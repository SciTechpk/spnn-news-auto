According to the Edhi rescue service, the bus overturned near the Thatta Bypass, following which a rescue team reached the site of the incident and transported the injured to a hospital.
“The bodies of the six victims were initially taken to a mortuary in Orangi Town,” the service said in a statement, adding that they were later transported to Edhi’s morgue in Karachi’s Sohrab Goth.
The bus was carrying a group of picnickers from Karachi to Keenjhar Lake when it overturned while taking a sharp turn, killing six passengers and injuring dozens others, state-owned Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
“Local authorities and rescue teams were quick to respond, reaching the crash site within minutes. The injured were rushed to Karachi hospitals, with several reported to be in critical condition,” it said.
In another incident, at least one person was killed and several others, including women and children, were critically injured when a passenger bus overturned on the Gambat National Highway in Sindh’s Khairpur district.
According to APP, the incident took place while the bus was en route from Karachi to Swabi. Rescue teams, along with local police, reached the incident site and rushed the injured to nearby hospitals for medical aid.
 
 

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah expressed deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the bus accidents, according to a statement issued by his spokesperson Abdul Rashid Channa.
Expressing sympathy with the Makli incident victims, he issued directives to the Thatta deputy commissioner (DC) to ensure the provision of immediate medical assistance to the injured. The chief minister further told him to immediately contact their families and fully cooperate.
Expressing sorrow over the Khairpur coach accident, CM Murad issued similar instructions to the Khairpur DC to ensure medical treatment of the wounded. He urged people to drive carefully to protect precious lives.
Accidents are common on highways and motorways across Pakistan, caused by reckless driving, speeding, driver fatigue, and poor vehicle maintenance. Poor road conditions contribute to mishaps, while weak enforcement of traffic laws allows violations to go unchecked, worsening the situation.
Earlier this month, four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a drain on Hawkes’ Bay Road in Karachi’s Mauripur area.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the family was returning from the Hawke’s Bay beach, and the accident most likely happened as a result of speeding.
In an incident on July 15, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near Karachi’s New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.
On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, killing a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.
On June 11, a young man was killed and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway. The same day, two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College in North Nazimabad.</p><small>2025-07-20 08:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614881-bnp-m-chief-akhtar-mengal-offloaded-from-dubai-bound-flight' target='_blank'><strong>BNP-M chief Akhtar Mengal offloaded from Dubai-bound flight</strong></a><br><p>

The comment was ironic because Haris is known by the moniker ‘Mr Google’ among his teammates, because of his cricketing intelligence.
Such PR content is primarily used to display camaraderie among the players and to provide fans with wholesome moments to cherish. At times, it also provides a peek into the dressing room.
Haris, that night, had become the first non-opening batter from Pakistan to score a century in T20Is, while facing only 45 balls — the second least for any batter from his country — to reach the mark. It was also his first century across all T20s.
Haris had long been censured for being a reckless slogger and considered not good enough for international cricket. He averaged a paltry 13.46 runs per dismissal and lasted only 11 balls per innings before the home T20Is against Bangladesh. Does he think he has silenced his critics for now?
“This is just the beginning, as I have to do more to silence them,” he tells Eos in all humility.

Once derided as a reckless slogger who always played below his potential, Mohammad Haris seemed to be a different player in the recent Bangladesh home T20I series, where he scored his first T20 century. What changed him?

Haris had a sensational start to his international career and played an integral role in Pakistan’s run to the 2022 T20 World Cup final, with the scores of 28 off 11 in a high-pressure, must-win match against South Africa, 31 off 18 against Bangladesh, and 30 off 26 against New Zealand in the semi-final. He was being readied as a second-choice keeper behind Mohammad Rizwan in white-ball cricket, but then slipped into oblivion due to the turbulence that successive ad-hoc management committees brought to the PCB.
 
 

His return to the national side in March — after a gap of almost two years — was due to a paradigm shift in Pakistan’s approach towards the T20 format.
In fact, 2024 was a terrible year for Pakistan, as they mustered only nine wins from 24 matches and lost to the USA on their way to the group-stage exit in the T20 World Cup that year. Their sluggish rate of runs accumulation was deemed the reason behind the abject results. Since the start of 2022 until the end of 2024, Pakistan’s run rate of 8.04 was the fifth worst among the 12 full-member teams.
After the ignominy of the World Cup, Pakistan benched their two most consistent but slow run-getters in Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and doubled down on the philosophy of batting with intent and aggression by presenting their most recent set of changes — Agha as captain and Mike Hesson as head coach — as requisites for modern-day cricket.
But Pakistan’s first T20I series without Babar and Rizwan resulted in a 4-1 drubbing in New Zealand. (This was Aaqib Javed’s last series as Pakistan’s head coach and Agha’s first.) Haris, who had been added to the top-order to inject aggression, managed only 11 runs in 16 balls across the first two matches — a six-ball duck marking his first international outing since 2023. He posted his highest T20I score of 41 in the third match, but subsequently finished the series with an abysmal 2 and 11.
“There is enormous pressure when you are playing for your country and I could not sleep before the third T20I, as I kept thinking about how to score runs,” he recalls. “But, the coaches and the captain continued to show their trust in me, which motivated me.
“I spoke to the Pakistan fast bowlers about what possible bowling plans are against me. I talked to Naseem Shah, [Mohammad] Wasim Junior, Abbas Afridi and Hasan [Ali] Bhai and their insights were extremely helpful. They told me that aggressive batters like Fakhar Zaman and me do not have to go overboard with our shots.
“I used to try to hit the ball behind square unnecessarily or shuffle down the leg side without any reason. They told me to just stay on the wicket, as my presence was enough to create pressure for the opposition. I worked on that and realised that the bowlers bowled bad balls to me because of that pressure,” Haris says.
Haris’ astuteness against Bangladesh turned heads. He scored almost half of his runs in T20Is in those three matches and capped the series with a scintillating 107 not out off 46, smashing seven sixes and eight fours as Pakistan chased down 197 with 2.4 overs to spare.
“I entered the Bangladesh series under pressure. Previously, I had an excuse of being in alien conditions, but now I was playing at home and there was no hiding. But, the century gave me a lot of confidence. It assured me that I could play big innings. I have been tagged as someone who is only good enough for 25 to 30 runs. Even my coach here in Peshawar used to ask me when I would score more than 30 runs.
“I started to question myself too,” he says.
The line between batting with ultra or controlled aggression is often blurred and whether the brand that a team played with on a particular day was correct or not is determined only in hindsight, based on the result. That’s the sad reality of the result-oriented business. But, it is important that teams learn lessons.
“We were not smart enough in New Zealand and were slogging rather blindly,” Haris admits. “We had meetings with the coaches after the New Zealand series and discussed how we have to be smart while staying aggressive…
“We have ingrained smartness in our batting by keeping the scoreboard ticking, which puts pressure on the opposition. We now look to pick favourable match-ups, make sure we don’t take unnecessary risks when we have scored enough boundaries in an over, and communicate to build partnerships.”
 
 

Convincing players to adapt according to the new demands can often be a challenge, as elite players can be too arrogant to change their playing styles. But Haris has brought in a new philosophy. The first signs of that were on the night of May 28, when he scored only seven off the first eight balls to stabilise Pakistan’s innings after they had lost both openers in the first eight balls.
He plundered 24 off the next nine. He made 41 off 25 in the next game, as Pakistan posted 201 in both the first two matches.
“There will be failures with this approach, but now we have a captain and a team management who are ready to back us and own those failures,” he says. “Previously, that was not the case, and it used to sow thoughts in our minds that perhaps we should play to secure our places after a couple of failures.
“Our coaches have realised that we are capable players and they are working with us on how they can convert our potential into runs on the field. I am working very closely with our batting coach Hanif [Malik] Bhai. I tend to think over-aggressively when I bat, but now I communicate with him through different signals when I am in the middle and it helps me to stay calm. It has improved my game.”
Haris understands the message in the irony of what his captain, Agha, had said with reference to his moniker, Mr Google.
“That nickname has been applicable in every aspect of my cricket but the batting,” he says laughing. “I have no idea why that is the case. I give the best advice when I am in the dressing room, keeping the wickets, or captaining a side. My teammates, such as Saim Ayub, question where all my intelligence goes when I am batting.
“But, I am working towards bringing that intelligence in my batting now. It is 2025 and it is about time I had an update.”

The WCL is an international cricket league where retired, non-contracted international players return to competitive T20 cricket, according to the league’s website. The tournament commenced on July 18 and is being held in Birmingham, England.
In a statement posted on X, WCL organisers announced that, “We have decided to call off the India vs Pakistan match,” saying that the match between the two countries was planned in light of recent positive development between India and Pakistan, indicating improved bilateral sporting ties.
 






The statement cited a recent volleyball match between the rival nations and speculations around Pakistan’s hockey team touring India later this year.
Earlier this month, Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that Pakistan is to review the security situation in India before taking a call on sending its hockey teams to the neighbouring country for the Asia Cup and Junior World Cup to be held later this year.
The decision to cancel the WCL match came after Indian veteran cricketer Shikhar Dhawan refused to play against Pakistan, according to a statement posted on his X account, showing a screenshot of an email sent to notify the player’s withdrawal from the match.
 






The statement cited “current geopolitical situation and prevailing tensions between India and Pakistan” as the reason for withdrawal.
WCL, in its statement, apologised for “hurting” people’s sentiments and causing discomfort to Indian players for WCL’s decision to hold the match in the first place.
The match — scheduled for Sunday (today) — was to be the first between the two nations in the tournament. The Pakistani team is being led by Mohammed Hafeez, while Yuvraj Singh is leading the Indian side.
According to WCL’s website, the tournament is set to run until August 2 with participation from England, India, Pakistan, Australia, West Indies, and South Africa.
WCL will be held across four English cities — Birmingham, Northampton, Leeds, and Leicester.
In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day military confrontation — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam attack  in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching Operation Sindoor. Islamabad has denied the accusations.
The recent tensions also briefly cast a shadow on this year’s Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. However, the two teams are expected to face each other in the tournament in September this year.
Meamwhile, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir has called for a complete halt to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.</p><small>2025-07-20 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2011551274ca175.png?r=115729' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925368/subsidised-wheat-stocks-exhaust-in-gb-amid-supplies-delay' target='_blank'><strong>Subsidised wheat stocks exhaust in GB amid supplies delay</strong></a><br><p> 

THE delay in wheat supply has put an immense strain on locals who say they cannot afford to buy flour from open market.—Dawn

GILGIT: A severe wheat shortage is intensifying across Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), depleting the region’s reserve stocks and raising fears of a food crisis after the federal government failed to release subsidised supplies more than two weeks into the new fiscal year, GB food department has said.
Officials with the food department said that wheat stocks have been completely exhausted.
GB residents rely almost entirely on the subsidised wheat supplied annually by the federal government.
While the federal government allocated Rs20 billion in its budget to procure over 170,000 tonnes of wheat for Gilgit-Baltistan for the current fiscal year, officials said not a single sack has been delivered.
The delay is putting immense strain on locals who say they cannot afford to buy flour from the open market.

Officials say not a single bag delivered though federal govt allocated Rs20bn for the purpose in budget

“Local people make their monthly expenditure budgets according to the subsidised rate,” Imtiaz Hussain, a local resident, told Dawn. “The current shortage is causing trouble.”
Mr Hussain said the community is facing significant difficulty and demanded that the “federal government release the subsidised wheat without further delay.”
 
 

The situation has been worsened by recent flash floods and torrential rains, which have severely damaged road infrastructure and made transporting goods to remote areas extremely difficult.
An official with the food department told Dawn that the last of the small reserve stocks were distributed during the recent floods and are now gone.
He noted that frequent landslides on the Karakoram Highway, the Baltistan road, and other key routes have severely disrupted supply chains.
Transporting goods from Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) warehouses in Islamabad to GB can now take several weeks, the official said.
The delivery of the remaining limited wheat from regional warehouses in Gilgit to remote areas also remains delayed because of blocked roads.
Officials fear that any further delay in supplies could plunge GB into a full-scale food emergency.

The report reveals that during in June 2020, the hydro-meteorological and climate change services component was initially scaled back and later dropped.
Activities aimed at improving the service delivery capacity of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, private sector engagement and mitigation of seismic and glacial hazards were also removed from the plan.
 
 

Although the original project financing of $188m, approved in 2018, remained unchanged after the first restructuring, the second restructuring in June 2023 reduced the total budget to $168m due to exchange rate fluctuations. Despite this, the project was completed within the original budget, albeit after an 18-month extension — an outcome the Bank attributes to efficient resource utilisation.
However, the project underwent two significant restructurings, in June 2020 and June 2023, that altered both its objectives and scope.

He told reporters that approximately 40,000 pilgrims’ records remain in paper form and have not been transferred to the digital registry system.
“It was never said that thousands of Pakistanis are missing,” Mr Yousuf said.
“The records of around 40,000 pilgrims were previously maintained in paper form and have not yet been fully transferred to the central digital registry.”
The initial report, which said tens of thousands of pilgrims (zaireen) had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq, was first floated by the minister himself as he announced a travel system overhaul.
 
 

To prevent future errors and enhance security, the Ministry of Religious Affairs launched a modern online registration system for all pilgrims travelling to Iran, Iraq and Syria.
The move is also aimed at curbing instances where individuals use the pilgrimage as a cover to migrate illegally to Europe through Turkiye.
Under the new system, tour operators must be officially registered, a practice similar to the one implemented by Saudi Arabia for Umrah pilgrimages.
“Under the new system, every pilgrim and group organiser will be issued a QR code for easy identification and coordination,” Mr Yousuf said.
He added that the government will now share complete pilgrim lists with authorities in Iran, Iraq and Syria ahead of travel.
“This proactive step will eliminate the possibility of any misunderstanding or propaganda regarding the movement of Pakistani pilgrims,” the minister said.

These two pilot cooperation projects were discussed in detail by delegations of both countries during a video conference in Islamabad on Saturday.
Minister of State for Railways and Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani and Deputy Chairman of Azerbaijan Railways Closed Joint Stock Company Arif Aghayev led delegations of their respective countries during the talks.
 
 

The meeting discussed opportunities for cooperation in increasing freight volumes, port integration, joint investment projects, and transport routes that pass through Azerbaijan and Pakistan within the Middle Corridor, according to a press release by the Ministry of Railways.
Delegations of both countries agreed to establish joint working groups to finalise freight transport initiatives and advance mutual cooperation in rail and trade sectors. These working groups will comprise officials from railways, commerce, finance and communication ministries.

Project to boost regional trade and connectivity

Secretary of Railways Board Muhammad Yusuf provided an overview of Pakistan Railways’ network. Discussions also took place regarding the Uzbekistan-Afghan­istan-Pakistan Rail Agreement.
The Trans-Caspian International Transport Route (TITR), known as the Middle Corridor, is a multilateral institutional development that links the containerised rail freight transport networks of China and the European Union through the Central Asia, the Caucasus, Turkiye, and Eastern Europe, a press release of Azerbaijan Railways says.
Both sides emphasised the potential use of various routes along the South Asia–Caucasus–Europe corridor for mutual cargo exchange and expressed support for the development of a multimodal transport corridor connecting continents via Azerbaijan, passing through China, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.
 
 

Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Afgh­anistan have already signed a framework agreement which will usher the region into a new era of prosperity. This agreement is considered a game-changer for the regional connectivity with a trade potential of $292 billion. Pakistan and Uzbekistan will finance the feasibility study by contributing $5 million each.
Speaking on the occasion, Minister Bilal Azhar Kayani stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is implementing a comprehensive strategy for the development and modernisation of Pakistan Railways. He emphasised that Pakistan attaches great importance to expanding trade relations with Azerbaijan through rail connectivity.
Karachi-Rohri track
Meanwhile, transport experts from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) inspected the 480km railway track between Karachi and Rohri, which is a part of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) upgrade package.
The track, when upgraded, will provide easy access to Reko Diq and speed up uninterrupted supply of coal from Thar.

• Notices issued to 10 MPAs for payment of damages caused during budget session withdrawn
LAHORE: In a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions in the Punjab Assembly, PA Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan has formally rejected the petitions seeking the disqualification of 26 PTI members.
This decision followed successful negotiations between the government and the opposition, and is expected to pave the way for the swift reinstatement of these suspended lawmakers.
The ruling comes after weeks of parliamentary deadlock, which saw the opposition members suspended for “disorderly conduct” during the budget session on June 27. The suspension for 15 sittings was a direct response to protests that disrupted Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s speech and involved the use of “offensive, abusive, and unparliamentary language and slogans”, as well as alleged physical altercations.
 
 

In his detailed written decision, the speaker firmly rejected the petitions. He underscored that the speaker’s role was not merely to act as a “postman” by forwarding such requests to the Election Commission. He cautioned that such an unscrutinised process could “weaken the constitutional framework” and “curtail freedom of expression” within the provincial assembly.
He clarified that while disruptive behaviour in parliaments worldwide often faced stringent measures, the serious allegations of legal and constitutional violations, including those related to oaths, must first be proven in a competent court or tribunal. He asserted that only after a judicial verdict would he be in a position to determine if disqualification under Article 63(2) of the Constitution was warranted, and if the matter should be subsequently referred to the Election Commission.
Four separate applications had been submitted demanding the disqualification of these members, with petitioners citing precedents like the Panama Papers case involving then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif and alleging violations of the speaker’s ruling and constitutional oaths. However, the speaker dismissed the disqualification requests that referenced the Panama case and similar decisions made under Articles 199 and 184-3 of the Constitution.
He stated that the petitioners retained the option to approach his office again, but only after securing a definitive decision from a competent court. The speaker also decided to withdraw the notices issued to 10 PTI MPAs for payment of damages caused to the furniture and other assets of the house during the June 27 session. The opposition members obstructed the proceedings of the house on June 27 by tearing agenda papers, hurling them at the treasury, using extreme derogatory language and physically impeding members who approached the treasury benches, according to the ruling, which shared the background of the petitions.
 
 

It was learnt that the policy of removing opposition members from the chairmanship of 13 standing committees was also being reversed, and the four chairpersons already removed from their offices through no-trust votes would also be reinstated.
Meanwhile, the opposition has intensified its pressure tactics, holding a ‘public assembly’ on the road outside the Punjab Assembly. During this ‘outdoor session’, the opposition leaders, like Ahmad Khan Bhachar, criticised the government’s handling of recent floods, soaring prices of essential commodities like sugar and petrol, and alleged political victimisation.
Mr Bhachar reiterated that the opposition would not return to the assembly until their suspended members were reinstated. He also presented a resolution condemning the government’s actions, which was passed by the ‘outdoor assembly’. According to political analysts, the decision by the speaker stressed the importance of due process and constitutional principles in parliamentary affairs and aimed to foster a more functional and less volatile political environment in Punjab.
While the government and opposition have agreed on activating the Advisory and Ethics Committees and avoiding indecent language in future sessions, the full reinstatement of the 26 members is now the immediate next step in restoring full parliamentary cooperation.

KARACHI: The investigating officer (IO) of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has informed a judicial magistrate that the prime suspect in the credit card data theft case, Armaghan Qureshi, had rented two properties to set up call centres in Lahore and Islamabad after the murder of Mustafa Amir.
The IO of the case, Ameer Ali Khoso, submitted this information in an interim charge sheet before the judicial magistrate (South), stating that more time was needed to file the final report as records from Binance and Coinbase were still awaited. He added that some documentary and digital evidence also remained to be collected.
Regarding the call centre operations, the IO claimed that during interrogation, the suspect revealed that he had decided to shift his operations after Mustafa’s killing. He allegedly paid rent to set up two call centres — one near PIA Society in Lahore for a monthly rent of Rs300,000, for which he the paid amount in advance.
In Islamabad, he allegedly acquired a facility on Data Khan Ganj Bakhsh Road, for which a total advance of Rs1.9 million was paid through a combination of cash and a servant’s bank account used under the tenant’s name.
Regarding the modus operandi of “illegal” call centre, the NCCIA explained in the report that the agents — who were hired by using multiple job seeking platforms — collect the sensitive personal information of victims’ through spoofed caller IDs while impersonating representatives of legitimate entities.
After collecting the data, agents were instructed to store the data in a software, which was under control of Armaghan, the report said, adding that later the suspect used that information to initiate unauthorised transactions by using various payment gateways, including Authorize.net, Stripe, Maverick Payment and others.
“All of these gateways were linked to US based LLC accounts registered under the name of Armaghan, his father and his father’s friends in different banks such as Bank of America and Wells Fargo,” the NCCIA claimed. “After the transaction the amount was converted into cryptocurrency including Bitcoin by using digital wallets.”
The report alleged that the suspect had masterminded and operated a transnational cybercrime racket involved in financial fraud, electronic theft, forgery, unauthorised fund transfers, digital identity misuse, cryptocurrency laundering, and international scams.
It added that his use of digital wallets, dark web transactions, and identity fraud indicated premeditated and systematic criminal activity.
The NCCIA claimed that the digital forensics analysis report confirmed that incriminating evidences were available on these digital devices like VoIP software, VPN software, access to United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) portals and extraction of registered trademark serials.
 
 

The case was registered against Armaghan under Sections 3 (unauthorised access to information system or data), 4 (unauthorised copying or transmission of data), 13 (electronic forgery), 14 (electronic forger), 16 (unauthorised use of identity information), 24 (cyber stalking) and 26 (spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 read with Sections 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
 
 

It may be noted that Armaghan has also been facing a case pertaining to the murder of Mustafa Amir.
The police had already filed an interim charge sheet against him, stating that Mustafa was allegedly murdered by Armaghan and his accomplice Sheraz, alias Shavez Bukhari, in a house in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Jan 6. The suspects allegedly stuffed Mustafa’s body into the trunk of his own car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.
The charge sheet stated that CCTV footage obtained from the Rangers allegedly shows the suspects travelling from Karachi to Hub in the victim’s car on the day of the incident. Another video purportedly shows them returning to Karachi in a Suzuki pickup.

According to Indian media reports, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is modifying the Agni-V intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to carry a colossal 7,500kg conventional warhead instead of a nuclear payload. This massive warhead (about 8 tonnes) is designed to penetrate 80-100 metres underground before detonating, enabling it to destroy deeply buried, hardened targets.
The missile’s range will be reduced to roughly 2,500km due to the heavier payload, but its impact power and precision will be dramatically increased. Two variants are reportedly under development: one with an airburst warhead for surface targets, and another a true earth-penetrator similar in concept to the US GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb. The penetrator version, carrying up to an eight-tonne warhead, would be among the most powerful conventional weapons globally.
 
 

India’s pursuit of a missile-based delivery system for bunker busters, as opposed to the US method of dropping bombs from stealth bombers, is notable. A missile allows India to strike fortified targets at long range rapidly and with little warning, enhancing operational flexibility and survivability of the launch platform.
The impetus for this development appears to come partly from recent events: the US’ use of MOP bunker-buster bombs against Iran’s underground nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz on June 21, 2025.
Seeing how US conventional munitions could cripple nuclear infrastructure, Indian strategists seem keen to acquire a similar capability. Indeed, Indian reports explicitly state the new Agni-V variant is meant to neutralise hardened enemy sites such as command centres, missile silos and other critical infrastructure buried deep underground in countries like Pakistan and China. In other words, India is developing a conventional weapon that can hold at risk the nuclear command bunkers and missile storage sites of its regional rivals.

India’s reported pursuit of a missile able to carry a ‘bunker-buster’ like the US’ Massive Ordnance Penetrator presents a perilous new chapter in South Asia’s evolving strategic and security landscape. It risks a hazardous entanglement between conventional and nuclear strategies. Rabia Akhtar explains why it’s a terrible idea, what lessons Pakistan can learn from global deterrence doctrines and what it can do to preempt another arms race…

 
 

This development blurs the line between conventional and nuclear strategy. On paper, using a non-nuclear warhead to destroy an enemy’s nuclear assets might appear to avoid crossing the nuclear threshold — after all, the weapon itself is conventional. India’s official doctrine remains ‘No First Use’ (NFU) of nuclear weapons, and an attack with a conventional Agni-V would technically not violate that pledge. However, this reasoning is dangerously simplistic.
Deploying conventional missiles against a nuclear-armed adversary’s strategic forces creates a classic nuclear-conventional entanglement that could lead to miscalculation and rapid escalation. India’s new bunker buster may offer a tempting counterforce option, but its use against Pakistan or China’s nuclear targets would carry grave risks. Here’s why.
THE ILLUSION OF A NON-NUCLEAR FIRST STRIKE
Indian advocates of the conventional Agni-V bunker-buster might argue that it allows New Delhi to strike Pakistani nuclear assets without breaking its NFU pledge or triggering nuclear retaliation. This is an illusion, perhaps even a dangerous hoax. From the standpoint of Pakistan or any nuclear-armed target, the method of attack matters far less than the target. Firing a high-speed ballistic missile at Pakistan’s missile silos or nuclear warhead bunkers would almost certainly be viewed as part of a nuclear first strike, regardless of the warhead type.
The launch of an Agni-series missile, traditionally associated with nuclear warheads, would put Pakistan’s forces on immediate high alert. In the fog of crisis, they would have no way to know whether the incoming missile is carrying a conventional high-explosive warhead or a nuclear bomb. The time from launch detection to impact would be only minutes, especially at short ranges; there would be no opportunity for comprehensive decision-making. By the time the reality, a conventional strike, is confirmed, the warhead will have already detonated on Pakistani soil.
Crucially, India’s declaratory NFU policy provides little comfort in such a scenario. In fact, Indian strategic thinkers themselves have cast doubt on how absolute that pledge really is. Former National Security Adviser Shivshankar Menon wrote in his book Choices: Inside the Making of India’s Foreign Policy that “circumstances are conceivable in which India might find it useful to strike first”, for example if an adversary is clearly preparing a nuclear launch. He also noted that, if Pakistan were to use even one tactical nuclear weapon, it would effectively free India to undertake a comprehensive first strike against Pakistan in response.
 
 

These musings, from a senior official who helped shape India’s doctrine, undermine the credibility of NFU. India’s NFU commitment is already viewed with scepticism by Pakistan, and developing counterforce capabilities like a conventional bunker-buster missile will only deepen that scepticism. No public reiteration of NFU will seem persuasive to Pakistani planners when India is openly acquiring tools to attack nuclear targets pre-emptively.
Furthermore, India cannot hide behind entanglement or ambiguity to escape the consequences of striking nuclear assets conventionally. Some might argue that using a non-nuclear weapon gives India plausible deniability of intent to cross the nuclear threshold. But Pakistan is unlikely to indulge in such legalistic hair-splitting amid a crisis. An attempt to destroy or disable Pakistan’s nuclear deterrent by any means would be seen as an existential threat.
Indeed, the India-Pakistan Non-Attack Agreement of 1988 recognised how provocative any attack on nuclear installations could be, even in a conventional war. That pact commits both countries not to attack each other’s declared nuclear facilities. While it covers primarily civilian facilities and open sites, the spirit behind it is relevant: an attack on nuclear infrastructure is extraordinarily escalatory.
If India’s new missile were used against Pakistani nuclear weapon storage sites or command-and-control bunkers, it would shatter the already fragile trust and violate the understanding that those strategic assets are off-limits unless all-out war has begun.
India’s NFU policy would offer no shield against escalation if a conventional counterforce strike were launched. Islamabad would likely interpret such an act as India effectively initiating nuclear hostilities under a different guise. The notion that using a conventional warhead keeps a first strike below the nuclear threshold is dangerously naive. To Pakistan, the threshold would already be crossed. This situation would create intense pressure on Pakistan’s leadership to respond in kind or even pre-empt, lest their deterrent be wiped out.

COUNTERFORCE TARGETING AND THE RISK OF NUCLEAR ESCALATION
Pursuing counterforce capabilities, the ability to destroy the enemy’s nuclear weapons and delivery systems, has long been recognised as destabilising. The reason is simple: it invites a hair-trigger, ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ mentality. If Pakistan believes India can snatch away its nuclear sword in a sudden strike, Pakistan’s incentive to use that sword early, before it is lost, increases dramatically.
Scholars at the American think tank Atlantic Council have warned that “inadvertent escalation may occur when conventional attacks put the adversary’s nuclear force at risk… Fearing the destruction or incapacitation of its nuclear deterrent, the target state might face a ‘use it or lose it’ dilemma.” In other words, once Pakistan perceives that India is going after its nuclear arsenal, even with conventional weapons, Pakistani leaders could feel compelled to unleash nuclear weapons rather than risk having them destroyed on the ground. The mere fear of a disarming strike can trigger escalation.
It is important to note that this ‘use-it-or-lose-it’ dilemma is not just theoretical. During the Cold War, both the United States and Soviet Union (USSR) realised that, if either side ever gained a realistic hope of wiping out the other’s nukes in a first strike, the endangered side might choose to fire its missiles on warning of attack. This was one factor that kept both superpowers cautious and led to arms control agreements — no one wanted to live in a perpetual hair-trigger scenario.
Today, analysts observe similar dangers in new technologies: advanced non-nuclear weapons and missile defences can blur the line and make nuclear arsenals feel vulnerable. This kind of nuclear-conventional entanglement “increases the risk that nuclear weapons could be used as a result of miscalculation, misperception, or an accident.” A conventional missile attack on nuclear forces is exactly the sort of entangled scenario where miscalculation could be catastrophic.
In South Asia, crisis stability is already fragile. Pakistan, with a smaller and more geographically constrained arsenal than India, has not adopted a ‘No First Use’ policy. Instead, its nuclear posture leaves the option of first use open, conditionally tied to scenarios involving existential threats, including an overwhelming conventional attack by India. Under its doctrine of “full-spectrum deterrence”, Pakistan reserves the right to employ nuclear weapons if the survival of the state is at stake, or if its key military assets are imperilled beyond recovery.
 
 

One can imagine, then, how Pakistan would view Indian ballistic missiles streaking toward its nuclear sites: as the onset of an existential threat. Even if those missiles carried conventional explosives, the effect might be to trigger Pakistan’s own nuclear release, for instance, firing tactical nukes at Indian forces or strategic nukes at Indian cities, under the logic of ‘better now than never.’
Such a response would of course be suicidal for both countries but the perception of imminent disarmament can override rational restraint. Any country whose nuclear forces are under attack might decide that a limited nuclear strike is its ‘least bad option’ before losing everything. When decision-makers are staring at the abyss of defeat, they may grab even terrible options.
Another escalatory risk is misinterpretation. If India launched an Agni-V with a conventional warhead, Pakistani early-warning systems would simply detect a missile launch and incoming trajectory. There would be no clarity on the warhead type. Rational military doctrine dictates, assuming the worst, that any incoming long-range missile is nuclear. Pakistan’s leaders would not have the luxury of trusting India’s intentions or waiting to see a mushroom cloud. This uncertainty could precipitate a launch-on-warning posture, or at least nervous readiness to retaliate instantly upon any indication of a nuclear detonation.
We must acknowledge this problem that firing a conventionally armed Agni in a conflict could be construed as a nuclear first strike and provoke a response in kind. During a crisis, neither side will have perfect information. A false alarm or a misunderstood signal could send things spiralling. The use of conventional counterforce weapons sharply lowers the firebreak between conventional and nuclear war. It compresses decision times and creates immense pressure on the targeted state to respond with its most powerful weapons before they are neutralised.
From India’s perspective, some hawks argue that Pakistan lacks robust real-time missile launch detection and does not practise launch-on-warning, implying India could execute a decapitating strike swiftly. They suggest Pakistan might be blindsided and unable to retaliate in time. This confidence, however, is a double-edged sword: if Pakistani leaders recognise India believes they can be caught off-guard, Pakistan will be all the more likely to adopt hair-trigger measures to avoid being a sitting duck. Such crisis instability means that a conventional strike, or even the fear of one, could rapidly trigger nuclear use by either side, with neither truly wanting it but each fearing to wait.
Finally, even if India’s leadership believed a counterforce strike could cripple Pakistan’s arsenal without immediate retaliation, they would have to be absolutely certain of getting all of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons. Anything less than total disarmament would invite a nuclear counter-strike by whichever weapons survived. Analysts have cast doubt on India’s ability to achieve a 100 percent knockout of Pakistan’s nukes, given Pakistan’s growing number of mobile launchers, decoy sites, and secret storage facilities. If India launched a strike but failed to neutralise all of Pakistan’s nuclear capabilities, it would turn what might have remained a probable conflict into an inescapable one, making Pakistan’s retaliatory response not just likely, but virtually assured.
In other words, a botched counterforce attempt, even with conventional weapons, could result in the very nightmare India hoped to avoid: nuclear devastation of its cities. This reality places a question mark over the strategic logic of India’s new bunker buster. Is it a silver bullet that neutralises Pakistan’s deterrent, or a spark that ignites a nuclear conflagration? The escalation risks far outweigh any reassurance that the warhead is non-nuclear.
 

American airmen look at a GBU-57, or the Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb, at Whiteman Air Base in Missouri: the impetus for this development by India appears to come partly from the US’ use of MOP bunker-buster bombs against Iran’s underground nuclear facilities at Fordow and Natanz on

LESSONS FROM THE US AND CHINA: ENSURING DETERRENCE, AVOIDING PERIL
History offers sobering lessons on the dangers of entangling conventional and nuclear strategies, as well as some guidance on how to mitigate these risks. The Cold War superpowers, the United States and Soviet Union, initially engaged in a counterforce competition that, at times, raised the spectre of disarming first strikes. Over time, however, both sides learned that true security came from a robust second-strike capability, not from a risky bid to strike first.
By the 1970s, the US and the Soviet Union embraced the doctrine of ‘mutually assured destruction’ (MAD), underpinned by each having invulnerable nuclear forces like submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which could survive any attack and retaliate. They even signed arms control treaties (SALT, START) and the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, to cap offensive arsenals and limit defences, essentially accepting mutual vulnerability.
This was not out of kindness, but cold logic: if neither side could realistically escape retaliation, neither had an incentive to start a nuclear war. South Asia’s situation is different in scale but the core principle still applies. The more secure and hidden Pakistan’s nuclear forces are, the less temptation India might have to contemplate a first strike, and vice versa.
Another lesson comes from how the US and China are handling the entanglement challenge today. China has watched US advancements in conventional precision strikes, missile defence and surveillance with concern, fearing that, in a conflict, the United States might try to neutralise China’s smaller nuclear deterrent. In response, Beijing has undertaken a significant nuclear modernisation, focused on increasing the survivability and credibility of its arsenal.
China is moving from a minimal deterrent posture to a more robust one: expanding its warhead stockpile, deploying more mobile solid-fuelled missiles, building a submarine-based nuclear force, and hardening its command-and-control networks. The goal is clear: deny any adversary the hope of a disarming strike.
At the same time, China officially still adheres to a ‘No First Use’ policy and emphasises nuclear weapons as political deterrents rather than war-fighting tools. This is coupled with increasing vigilance: reports indicate China may be keeping a portion of its forces on a launch-on-warning alert status, or at least moving in that direction, as its early-warning capabilities improve.
In internal debates, Chinese strategists have even discussed whether extreme circumstances, such as conventional attacks on China’s nuclear facilities or other strategic targets, might warrant reconsidering NFU. The takeaway for Pakistan is twofold: make your deterrent robustly survivable, and signal clearly the consequences of its attempted destruction. China’s build-up shows a determination to discourage an enemy from even thinking a first strike could work.
For Pakistan, ensuring a credible second-strike capability is paramount. In fact, Pakistan has already invested in several survivability measures over the years. It has constructed hardened, deeply-buried storage and launch facilities for its nuclear weapons, intending to ride out an enemy attack and retaliate. It has developed road-mobile missiles that can be dispersed to secret locations so they cannot all be targeted at once.
Pakistan is also pursuing a sea-based leg of its deterrent: the Babur-3 nuclear-capable submarine-launched cruise missile, while limited in range, is a step toward having nukes deployable from submarines, which would greatly enhance survivability. Air defences around strategic sites have been improved, and extensive concealment and deception practices are in place. All these steps echo the practices of larger nuclear powers: diversify and harden your forces so no opponent can wipe them out in one blow.
Nevertheless, Pakistan faces an acute challenge with India’s emerging counterforce capabilities. Unlike the US or China, Pakistan’s strategic depth and resources are limited, so it must be clever and resolute in response. Here are some specific recommendations drawn from global experience that Pakistan could consider:
• Strengthen Early-Warning and Command Systems: Acquiring or developing better early-warning technology, satellite infrared sensors and long-range radar can provide crucial minutes of notice if India launches missiles. Even a short warning can allow nuclear forces to disperse or prepare for retaliatory fire. The US and Russia maintain extensive early-warning networks as a backbone of stable deterrence. Pakistan might seek technical assistance from allies, perhaps China, which is itself improving early warning, to plug this gap, a necessity especially post the May 2025 crisis.
Reliable communication lines and redundant command-and-control are also essential, so that Pakistan’s leadership can make clear-headed decisions under attack and avoid decapitation. This includes having mobile command centres or pre-delegated launch authority in a crisis, so that one strike cannot paralyse retaliation. Such measures, while risky in their own way, ensure India cannot count on knocking out Pakistan’s ability to respond.
• Clearly Articulate Red Lines: While ambiguity can sometimes aid deterrence, in this case Pakistan may benefit from explicitly warning that any strike on its strategic nuclear assets will trigger a nuclear response. Ambiguity about conventional versus nuclear could invite Indian miscalculation. A public or private declaratory stance, that an attack on nuclear forces or command centres will be treated as initiation of nuclear war, could reinforce deterrence by leaving no doubt in Indian minds.
Essentially, Pakistan would be conveying: If you target our nukes, even if the attack were with conventional warheads, we will assume a nuclear war has started and respond accordingly. This is a harsh posture, but it may be the only way to deter a would-be counterforce strike. Of course, such a stance must be coupled with continued commitment to never use nuclear weapons first in less extreme scenarios, to retain international support and moral high ground. It is a delicate balance of messaging.
• Avoid a Costly Arms Race, But Innovate Asymmetrically: Pakistan cannot economically match India warhead-for-warhead, nor does it have the desire to build equivalent eight-tonne conventional missiles. The aim should be to invalidate India’s counterforce gambit, not to mirror it. This means focusing on dispersion, decoys and penetration aids. For every new Indian sensor or warhead, Pakistan can respond with measures to complicate targeting: more fake silos, dummy launch units, electronic jamming of guidance systems, etc.
In the nuclear realm, developments such as the MIRV [Multiple Independently targetable Re-entry Vehicle] technology on missiles, which Pakistan has tested on the Ababeel missile, can ensure that, even if one incoming interceptor tries to hit a missile, the missile can release multiple warheads or decoys to overwhelm defences. Mobility, frequently moving warheads and launchers among various underground facilities, raises the uncertainty for Indian planners.
• Pursue Risk-Reduction Dialogue (Even Unilaterally): Pakistan can take a cue from Cold War crisis management and seek communication channels to defuse accidental escalations. The US and the USSR established hotlines and regular communication to avoid misunderstandings that could lead to nuclear war. India and Pakistan do have some communication links eg hotlines between DGMOs [Director Generals Military Operations], but these could be expanded to specifically handle nuclear-risk incidents. Pakistan could propose mutual measures such as advance notification of cruise missile launches (ballistic is already in place via an existing agreement) and an extension of the 1988 non-attack pact to possibly cover not just declared nuclear facilities but also a tacit understanding against counterforce strikes.
Even if India is not immediately receptive, simply raising these ideas internationally can put political pressure on New Delhi and signal that Pakistan is behaving as a responsible nuclear power, seeking stability. In the near term, raising awareness of the escalation risks stemming from entanglement is critical. If both governments and their publics better understand that certain actions could be a point of no return, they may be more cautious in a crisis.
India’s reported development of a conventional mega-missile to target nuclear assets is a classic case of the counterforce temptation that has lured many nuclear powers, but it carries enormous dangers. Pakistan must not panic, but it must prepare. The preparation lies in making any Indian strike, nuclear or conventional, futile and prohibitively risky. By bolstering the survivability of its deterrent, as the US, Russia and China have done in their own ways, and clearly conveying the dire consequences of crossing the nuclear Rubicon, Pakistan can maintain deterrence and avoid being coerced.
Ultimately, the lesson from other nuclear rivalries is that stability comes from restraint and communication as much as from weaponry. Both India and Pakistan would do well to remember that slowing down the nuclear arms competition is in their mutual interest.
Otherwise, they risk replaying the worst chapters of the Cold War on the Subcontinent, with even less margin for error. For Pakistan, staying vigilant, resilient and diplomatically proactive is the best way to counter India’s new bunker-buster gambit, and ensure that conventional provocations do not mushroom into nuclear cataclysm.

• NDMA blames climate change, glacier melt for floods
• PDMA issues fourth spell alert as rivers swell
• Rs5m relief package announced in Punjab
ISLAMABAD: As the country grapples with a monsoon season that has intensified by up to 60 per cent over previous years, the national and provincial disaster management authorities have predicted further rains in the coming days.
According to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), at least 180 people have already been killed and more than 500 injured so far since the rains began unusually early in July.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Saturday forecast further rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, in Sindh over the next 24 hours. Cities and districts likely to be affected include Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Thatta, Badin, Larkana, Jaco­babad, Nawabshah, Mirpurkhas and others.
The NDMA’s NEOC has also issued alerts for urban flooding in low-lying parts of Sindh. It advised citizens to stay indoors during intense rainfall, avoid travelling to vulnerable areas and ensure household drainage systems remain clear.
The Provincial Disaster Mana­gement Authority (PDMA) of Punjab also issued an alert about the fourth spell of monsoon rains starting from July 20 (today). It forecasted strong winds, dusty winds and rain in most districts of Punjab from July 20 to 25.
 
 

Rain with strong winds is predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Hafizabad, Gujrat, Jhelum and Gujranwala. There are also chances of rain in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Sargodha, Mianwali, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur and Bahaw­alnagar from July 18 to 23.
The PDMA also issued a high-level flood pre-alert for all major rivers and associated streams acro­ss the province, warning of pote­ntial flooding from July 22 due to an incoming weather system.
 
 

According to the Flood Forecasting Division, increased water flows are expected in the Chenab, Jhelum, Ravi, Sutlej and Indus rivers, along with their tributaries and low-lying areas, posing significant risks.
KP, Islamabad on alert
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the monsoon system and glacial melt pose serious risks of flash flooding, particularly in the rivers Kabul, Swat, Panjkora, Bara and Kalpani Nullah. The NDMA warned of potential disruptions in transport across hilly and mountainous regions.
In Islamabad and central Punjab, strong monsoon currents are forecast to bring moderate to heavy rainfall through July 24, increasing the risk of urban flooding.
Meanwhile, due to rising water levels from recent downpours, the Rawal Dam reached its full capacity of 1,748 feet. Authorities announced the opening of its spillways at 6am on Sunday to reduce the level to 1,746 feet. Residents nearby have been advised to stay cautious.
Three children die in Attock
In a series of rain-related incidents in Attock, three children lost their lives on Saturday. A six-year-old girl, Fatima, drowned in a water channel in Amanpur, 12-year-old Muhammad Suleman died when the roof of his house collapsed in Bhattar, and five-year-old Umer Ayub was electrocuted in Ghourghushti after touching a live electric pole.
Meanwhile, in an incident unrelated to the rains, a man was shot dead in Mirza village in a targeted attack. Police said Inayat Rehman, 45, was going towards the mosque when two men hiding in a restaurant opened fire, killing him on the spot.
Over 1,500 rescued in Punjab
In Punjab, Rescue 1122 has rescued 1,594 people since June 25 in rain and flood-related emergencies, according to Secretary Emergency Services Dr Rizwan Naseer. Of these, 449 were seriously injured and shifted to hospitals. Moreover, 119 deaths have been confirmed, the majority due to the collapse of dilapidated buildings.
Rescue efforts included pre-emptive evacuation of 444 residents from high-risk areas and the deployment of over 100 boats and 312 rescue personnel. Lahore recorded the highest deaths at 27, followed by 15 in Faisalabad, 11 in Sheikhupura and 10 in Rawalpindi.
Since June 25, 369 building collapse incidents, 23 electrocutions, 62 rain-related crashes and multiple other emergencies have been reported, Dr Naseer said.
He urged the public to inspect rooftops, avoid contact with electric poles during rainfall and check forecasts before travelling to flood-prone or mountainous regions.
Meanwhile, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif directed the immediate restoration of flood-affected roads. Key arteries including Pind Dadan Khan-Jhelum Road, Matta Khurd Road, and Chakwal-Kallar Kahar Road have been reopened. In Rawalpindi, the Crowley Dhok Bridge and Dhok Parwana Road, damaged by floodwater, were also made accessible.
The chief minister also visited Chakwal on Saturday, where she announced Rs5 million in compensation for families of the deceased.
Five lives were lost in Chakwal’s record-breaking 430mm downpour earlier in the week. CM Maryam chaired a briefing at the district complex and commended district officials for their round-the-clock rescue efforts.
She ordered the evacuation of families from houses deemed vulnerable ahead of the next spell, and ordered the installation of a steel bridge at Dumman on the Chakwal-Sohawa Road, a key artery damaged by soil erosion. She also sought reports on privately built mini-dams, which worsened flooding in parts of Chakwal and Talagang.
The Punjab government on Saturday decided to ensure drainage in private housing societies, install modern alarm systems around Rawalpindi Nallah Lei and evacuate people living near the basins of Ravi, Sutlej and Beas rivers.
Intensified monsoon
NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik stated that this year’s unusually severe monsoon season, which he said began a month earlier than usual in July, was forecast by the authority four months in advance.
He said the current monsoon season has intensified by up to 60pc compared to previous years. In an interview with PTV News, he emphasised that comprehensive disaster response measures had been put in place under the guidance of the prime minister, with coordinated efforts from the armed forces, PDMAs and key stakeholders including NGOs and industries.
He attributed the heightened rainfall and disaster risk to climate change and accelerated glacier melting.

• Islamabad, Rawalpindi and a few other cities remain normal
KARACHI/LAHORE/ISLAMABAD: Karachi and Lahore — Pakistan’s two largest commercial cities — witnessed a near-complete shutdown on Saturday as traders observed a strike against what they described as harsh and anti-business taxation measures introduced through the Finance Act 2025-26.
The strike, called by the Karachi and Lahore Chambers of Commerce and Industry, marked one of the most widespread protests by the business community in recent years.
In Karachi, nearly 90 per cent of commercial activity remained suspended, including wholesale markets, retail shops, industries, and fruit and vegetable markets. KCCI President Jawed Bilwani told Dawn that this was the first time in the chamber’s history that the city’s entire business community had voluntarily shut down operations in protest.
Mr Bilwani said industrial production had come to a halt in all seven industrial zones, while no export consignments were sent to the port. Goods transporters also suspended operations, halting the movement of imported raw materials and finished goods. While Karachi Port Trust (KPT) officials claimed port operations remained unaffected, they could not confirm the flow of consignments to and from industries.
He said the economic cost of the strike could be gauged from Karachi’s significant contribution — around 70pc of federal tax revenues and 54pc of national exports.
Explaining the choice of Saturday for the strike, Mr Bilwani said the decision was taken unanimously by stakeholders, despite the usual weekend closures in multinational and large private companies. He stressed the strike was not a rebellious act but a last resort following repeated government inaction.
Among the business community’s core demands are the immediate suspension of Sections 37A and 37B of the Sales Tax Act — provisions that allow for the arrest and prosecution of taxpayers without due process. Other demands include the withdrawal of Section 21(s), which penalises cash-based transactions, and the restoration of the Final Tax Regime for exporters.
 


Mr Bilwani said these concerns were shared in detail with a committee led by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Finance Haroon Akhtar Khan, but only verbal assurances were received. “Frustration has reached a boiling point,” he warned, adding that failure to receive written assurances or progress by next week would prompt further nationwide consultations on future actions.
He expressed appreciation for the unity shown by the seven town associations of Karachi and other trade bodies including the PHMA, Knitwear Exporters, Electronic Dealers, and Petroleum Dealers Associations. He also thanked chambers from other cities for their solidarity.
Complete shutdown in Lahore
Lahore also witnessed a widespread shutdown, with traders from major markets strongly protesting against the new taxation regime and expanded FBR powers. Despite the FPCCI’s announcement of strike withdrawal, major Lahore markets observed a complete closure in support of the LCCI’s call.
 


Closed markets included Shah Alam Market, Hall Road, Urdu Bazaar, Anarkali, Azam Cloth Market and many others. Some markets, like Abid Market, remained partially open. Traders vowed to continue protests until their charter of demands is met.
LCCI President Mian Abuzar Shad called the strike a historic show of unity and resistance. “July 19 will go down as a defining day in the struggle for economic justice,” he said at a press conference.
“We have been left with no option but to protest either through shutdown strikes or rallies. And we will continue it till acceptance of our charter of demands,” commented a trader. “We will not surrender, and the government must listen to this well,” he warned.
Mr Shad noted that Lahore and Karachi together represent over 60pc of Pakistan’s economy. “Today, that 60pc was silenced by choice — not force — to send a clear message to the government,” he said.
He revealed that the LCCI held nearly eight hours of virtual talks with senior government officials, including SAPM Haroon Akhtar, FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial and others, but no written commitment was offered. The chamber had sought urgent revisions to Sections 37A/B, the e-invoicing and e-Bilty systems, the 16pc sales tax on property rent, and 20pc tax on transactions above Rs200,000.
Twin cities remain open
In contrast, business activity remained unaffected in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, where markets continued to operate as usual. Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Nasir Qureshi stated that the chamber had chosen to wait for the outcome of the recent assurances given by SAPM Haroon Akhtar.
Ajmal Baloch, President of the All Pakistan Anjuman Tajiran, announced a nationwide protest campaign starting with demonstrations on July 26, followed by phased strike actions if their demands were not addressed.
He criticised the bureaucracy, accusing it of misleading the government and warned of intensifying protests if the new FBR powers are not revoked.

“Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met,” New York-based Astronomer said in a statement shared on LinkedIn.
“Andy Byron has tendered his resignation,” the firm said, after previously launching an investigation.
The company added that Co-founder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy, who was assigned the role of interim CEO, will continue to serve in that position.
During a Coldplay concert in Foxborough, Massachusetts on Wednesday, the jumbotron zoomed in on a man and a woman embracing in the stands.
But the canoodling pair appeared shocked and horrified when they spotted themselves on the big screen, with the man ducking out of frame and the woman covering her face with her hands and spinning around.
“Uh-oh, what? Either they’re having an affair or they’re just very shy,” joked Coldplay frontman Chris Martin.
 






Within hours, internet sleuths tracked down the man as Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and said the woman was the company’s chief people officer, Kristin Cabot, alleging that the two were having a not-so-discreet affair.
According to Reuters, a spokesman for the company said that the pair were the only employees of the firm caught on camera. The spokesman did not respond to a Reuters’ request for comment on Cabot’s job status.
The video has garnered millions of views on TikTok and other social media, giving rise to memes discussing everything from the folly of having an affair at a Coldplay concert, to the hypocrisy of an HR representative seemingly caught in a workplace relationship.
“The craziest thing is about the Astronomer CEO cheating scandal is it was the HR lady,” said one X user. “The person who would warn you against fraternising with coworkers.”
 






Furry mascots of the Philadelphia Phillies Major League Baseball team jumped on the trend and recreated the scene for the jumbotron at a game after the video went viral.
 






However, an apology statement attributed to Byron, which spread rapidly online, was fake and appeared to have originated from a parody account.

According to State Bank data, the turnaround from a deficit of $2.07bn in the previous fiscal reflects a sharp though fragile improvement in external balances.
The surplus coincides with a rise in foreign exchange reserves to $14.5bn, enough to cover 10-12 weeks of compressed imports, but still less than the $16bn in bilateral debt rolled over annually by China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE to help Islamabad avert a default.
The development has led to celebratory statements from top officials. A current account surplus indicates that a country is exporting more goods and services than it imports, and also has a positive net income and transfers in the form of investment and official flows from abroad.
However, this is not the case here.
We continue to spend more on the import of goods and services compared to what we export. The country continues to run a large trade deficit of over $29bn in goods and services, despite tight import controls.
With merchandise exports stagnating at $32bn — just 8pc of GDP — Pakistan is among the weakest global performers in trade competitiveness. Meanwhile, foreign private investment has plateaued around $2.5bn, or 0.6-0.7pc of GDP, one of the lowest regionally. Although we remain under an IMF programme, financial inflows from multilateral and bilateral sources have thinned.
The financial account shows subdued investment activity, limited credit access and stalled external borrowing, reflecting structural weaknesses. The government has failed to tap international bond markets due to poor credit ratings and investor scepticism over the quality of macroeconomic improvements. The current account surplus has materialised almost entirely due to a 27pc jump in remittances, which hit a record $38bn in the last fiscal. That is the real driver of the surplus — not a boost in exports or foreign inflows.
The surge in remittances offers only short-term relief. It is not a reliable or sustainable strategy for long-term balance-of-payments stability. Dependence on these inflows is akin to living on borrowed time.
It is no wonder that the economy is facing an acute dollar shortage, reviving grey market activity as demand for the greenback far exceeds supply, despite the current account surplus. The long-term solution to our recurring balance-of-payments crises lies in resolving the structural gaps such as low productivity, stagnant exports and weak competitiveness.
Without addressing these, the balance-of-payments outlook will remain vulnerable. A surplus driven by remittances and import curbs is hardly the foundation for sustainable growth. Real economic stability requires reforms, investment and export-led expansion — not temporary fixes like debt rollovers and import compression.

The report, titled ‘Tax Stamps and Illicit  Cigarette Sales in Pakistan: Understanding Retailers’ Knowledge Gap’, was released by Umeed-i-Sehar, a non-profit organisation focused on public health initiatives. Based on a survey of 2,000 retailers in seven major cities — including Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad — the study  paints a troubling picture of regulatory neglect and widespread retailer  unawareness.
An overwhelming 97pc of retailers said they had  never been approached by Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officials for compliance guidance, while 86pc were unaware of the government-imposed  penalties for selling illicit cigarettes.
Only 27pc of retailers could differentiate bet­ween tax-paid and illicit cigarette packs.
Meanwhile, 73pc did not understand the placement or purpose of tax stamps, relying instead on price as the main indicator of legality. While 86pc cited low price as the deciding factor, just 12pc considered the presence of a tax stamp.
Regarding inventory, 59pc of retailers estimated that 30-60pc of the cigarette packs they sold lacked  tax stamps, while 29pc believed that over 60pc of their stock was  illicit.
The findings highlight the pivotal role retailers play in  sustaining the illicit cigarette trade, which continues to undermine  legitimate businesses. With over 50 local and international  manufacturers and an estimated annual consumption of 80bn sticks, Pakistan’s tobacco industry faces significant challenges as illicit  sales steadily erode the market share of tax-compliant firms.
The FBR had introduced the TransAct App to help retailers verify tax stamps, but the study revealed that 98pc of respondents were unaware of the app, and 99pc had never used it.
Additionally, 43pc of retailers  said that consumer promotions and advertisements promoting cheaper, untaxed cigarettes influenced their purchasing decisions. Another 31pc cited high demand and low pricing as key factors behind stocking illicit  brands.

The vessel was carrying 48 passengers and five crew members when it capsized in the Unesco World Heritage site because of sudden heavy rain, the VNExpress news site said. Most of those on board were families visiting from the capital Hanoi, with more than 20 children among the passengers, it said.
“Border guards rescued 11 people and recovered 34 bodies,” it added. Rescue efforts were set to continue into the night to find the eight still missing.
Ha Long Bay office worker Tran Trong Hung said the storm started in the afternoon.
“The sky turned dark at around 2 pm (0700 GMT),” he said. There were  “hailstones as big as toes with torrential rain, thunderstorm and lightning”, he said.
One of the rescued, a 10-year-old boy, told state media outlet VietnamNet:  “I took a deep breath, swam through a gap, dived, then swam up. I even shouted for help, then I was pulled up by a boat with soldiers.”
Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh sent his condolences to the families of the deceased and called on the defence and public security ministries to conduct urgent search and rescue.
Authorities would  “investigate and clarify the cause of the incident and strictly handle violations”, a statement on the government website said. Torrential rain also lashed northern Hanoi, Thai Nguyen and Bac Ninh provinces on Saturday.

The projections show the number of poor could rise by up to 148.8 million, with those in South Asia projected to be at 48.8m by  2030.
As per the findings — part of the report titled ‘The Future of Poverty’: Projecting the Impact of Climate Change on Global Pov­erty  through 2050 — the number of people living in extreme poverty worldwide could be nearly doubled due to climate change.
 
 

The rise in poverty due to climate change is likely to be profound in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, where the effects of extreme weather events are likely to interact with existing structural vulnerabilities and weaker social protection systems.

WB report emphasises need for social safety nets, subsidies for less privileged

The study emphasised international cooperation will be essential for addressing the global nature of the climate challenge.
High-income countries, which have contributed the most to global emissions, have a responsibility to support low- and middle-income countries in their efforts to adapt to climate change, it said.
This includes providing financial resources, technology transfer, and capacity-building support to help countries build resilience to climate shocks and transition to low-carbon development pathways.
The WB report said efforts to reduce income inequality must be central to any poverty reduction strategy, as the projections show, even small increases in inequality can lead to large increases in poverty.
 
 

Policies that promote inclusive economic growth, reduce barriers to education and employment and enhance social protection systems will be critical for ensuring the benefits of economic development are shared more broadly, according to the study.
It stressed the need to  streng­th­­­­en social safety nets and provide targeted support to the poorest and most vulnerable populations.
This includes expanding access to healthcare, education, and financial services, as well as improving the resilience of livelihoods through investments in agriculture, infrastructure, and climate adaptation measures.
According to the report, climate change-induced rising food prices may significantly increase global poverty, particularly in the developing world, where food consumption accounts for a large share of household expenditures.
If nothing changes, the projections suggest that global economic output could be reduced by 23pc by 2100 compared to a world without climate change.
In most scenarios, projected global income losses exceed 20pc, underscoring the potentially severe economic consequences of inaction.
The report said even though rich and poor countries respond similarly to temperature chan­ges, the economic impacts are substantially larger for the latter, as these are predominantly located in already warm regions.

• Dar to visit US next week to attend high-level signature events
WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has said that Pakistan and the United States are close to concluding a crucial trade agreement as negotiations in Washington entered their final phase.
Both sides expressed optimism that the deal would pave the way for a broader and more strategic economic partnership.
Mr Aurangzeb and his team returned to Pakistan early Saturday after two days of high-level talks in Washington.
In a statement after a key meeting on Friday with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer, Mr Aurangzeb described the discussions as “very constructive” and pointed to “clear commitment from both sides” to resolve outstanding issues.
“We had a very constructive dialogue with Secretary Lutnick and Ambassador Greer,” said the finance minister. “There is a very clear commitment from both sides to get closure on the remaining items so that we can move towards the finishing line.”
 






Mr Aurangzeb was joined in the meetings by Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul.
“This is very important for us because the US is Pakistan’s largest trading partner,” he said. “It is critical that we move forward in the same positive spirit that has defined our discussions over the past few weeks and months.”
The talks are part of Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to shield its exports from steep US tariffs — currently at 29 per cent under President Donald Trump’s trade policy aimed at reducing American deficits with trading partners. Pakistan’s surplus stood at around $3 billion in 2024.
Islamabad has responded by offering to import more US goods, including crude oil, and by opening investment opportunities in key sectors such as mining, digital infrastructure, and technology.
A Pakistani delegation, led by Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, also visited Washington in early July with the aim of finalising a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of the 29pc tariff on Pakistani exports.
Officials familiar with the negotiations say the talks were successful, with both sides agreeing to a broad framework.
Mr Aurangzeb said both sides agreed that the relationship should not be limited to trade alone. “We have to move beyond the immediate trade imperative,” he noted. “For the Pakistan-US relationship to move to the next level, investment is the key — and we believe areas like minerals, AI, and crypto could be real game changers.”
 
 

He also said that ongoing trade talks would soon be followed by a new phase of dialogue focusing on bilateral investment. “Trade is the starting point,” he explained, “but it will very quickly be followed through with investment discussions and real execution of the investment upside available to both sides — so that it becomes a real win-win for Pakistan and the United States.”
Sources close to the talks say that while a broad understanding has already been reached, a formal announcement is expected only after the US concludes similar deals with other partners.
The renewed momentum in US-Pakistan ties follows last month’s White House meeting between President Trump and Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir — the first such meeting in recent memory — signaling a strategic reset in the relationship.
Since the start of his second term, President Trump has signaled a desire to improve relations with Pakistan. In his inaugural address to Congress, he publicly thanked Pakistan for capturing and handing over a notorious terrorist, a gesture that was well received in Islamabad.
 
 

Dar to visit US
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar, is scheduled to visit the United States next week to attend the high-level signature events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council (UNSC) Presidency in New York, as well as to participate in various engagements in Washington. In New York, as part of Pakistan’s Security Council signature events, he will chair a high-level open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”.
In addition, Mr Dar will preside over the quarterly open debate of the Security Council on the “Situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question”.
He will also chair a high-level briefing of the UN Security Council that will focus on enhancing cooperation between the UN and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
The deputy prime minister is scheduled to attend the high-level conference on “Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of Two-State Solution”.

The decline in raw food exports marks the end of a 20-month streak of uninterrupted growth, despite persistently high food inflation.
According to data compiled by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the export of traditional value-added products saw only marginal growth during the fiscal year.
Rice exports fell by 14.72pc year-on-year to $3.353bn from $3.931bn. While the volume of basmati rice exports increased by 4.48pc to 808,643 tonnes, its value dropped by 5.3pc to $830.57 million. Non-basmati rice exports decreased by 17.42pc in value to $2.522bn, with a 4.65pc decline in quantity to 5.009m tonnes.
Meat exports also declined by 3.24pc in FY25. Domestic meat prices have surged significantly, with buffalo meat prices more than doubling from Rs700 to Rs1,600 per kg over the past three and a half years.
Exports of vegetables and fruits decreased by 14.53pc and 10.29pc, respectively. However, fish and fish product exports grew by 13.44pc during the same period.
In June 2024, the government allowed the export of 150,000 tonnes of sugar, but actual exports soared to 757,779 tonnes by March 2025. Since then, the government has imposed restrictions on further sugar exports.
Non-textile shows mixed trend
Non-textile exports were primarily driven by a few value-added segments, including leather, footwear, and engineering products. Engineering goods exports rose by 16.46pc, led by increased shipments of industrial machinery, transport equipment, auto parts, and rubber tyres.
Cement exports saw a 28.71pc increase in quantity and a 23.74pc rise in value. Footwear exports climbed 8.88pc, mainly due to a 10.12pc increase in leather footwear. Leather manufacturers’ exports rose by 4.87pc, with leather gloves contributing significantly with 11.8pc growth. Raw leather exports recorded a marginal rise of 0.45pc.
Pakistan remains a key global supplier of surgical instruments, but their export value remains low as foreign companies rebrand many products. This category saw only a modest 1.61pc growth.
Exports of carpets and rugs declined by 4.24pc, while sports goods dropped 2.74pc. Gur (jaggery) exports — not categorised under food — saw a steep fall of 34.82pc.
Jewellery exports rose by 10.59pc, handicrafts by 45.38pc, and furniture exports fell by 8.36pc. Molasses exports plunged by 68pc, while gem exports were down by 12.12pc.

While the power elites may claim credit for shaping this turning point, it is the weight of historical legacies and the churn of global and regional geopolitics that are more decisive.
These are testing times, not just for the state, but for the very mindset that governs decision-making. The choices made now will determine not only the future of those in power but also the trajectory of the nation.
Decision-making in Pakistan is not detached from sociopolitical and cultural underpinnings. Elites — civil, military and religious — have long constructed identities around faith, using it both as a political tool and as a mechanism of control. This has led to a peculiar paradox: religion is deployed to mobilise, but faith-based discourse is often left untouched, even in areas where it could give rise to social breakdown or violence. Over time, a worldview has emerged, insulated from global values and even diverging from mainstream Muslim thought elsewhere, that sees dissent as sacrilege and doubt as betrayal.
 
 

A recent decision by a judge of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to mandate an inquiry commission on the misuse of blasphemy laws is a rare opening.
It allows the state to correct course. Yet, the reaction from religious hardliners and segments of the clergy suggests that the path ahead will be turbulent. Instead of confronting the facts, the accused parties are attempting to pressure the judiciary and twist the narrative, spreading disinformation and casting the commission as an attack on Section 295-C, even though the court explicitly made no such connection. Their objective is clear: to delegitimise the process and maintain their grip on a narrative that thrives on fear.
 
 

Lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari rightly pointed out that if there was no foul play, then why the fear? The court merely ordered an investigation into possible collusion between certain FIA officials and private complainants, a necessary and legal step in a democratic society. But the backlash has been ferocious. Victims and their defenders are being threatened. Religious bigots, emboldened by the silence of the state and the indifference of religious scholars, continue to act with impunity.

We are trapped in a situation that many other nations have faced but overcame — collectively.

Pakistan finds itself trapped in a situation that many other nations have faced — but have ultimately overcome through collective effort. One close historical parallel is the case of US senator Joseph McCarthy in the late 1950s. He exploited anti-communist sentiment to silence society’s dissenters, branding them as enemies of the state, and targeting artists, intellectuals, and members of civil society in the process. His actions ruined careers and even claimed lives.
McCarthy’s downfall began when he turned his crusade against decorated US military heroes, which brought him close to impeachment. Though his campaign was eventually discredited, and ended, the damage he caused was widespread. The term ‘McCarthyism’ now refers to this era of fear-mongering and ideological persecution.
Other episodes are worth mentioning where myths, weaponised through state and religious institutions, led to mass persecution. The most horrifying one pertains to the European witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries. As Yuval Noah Harari notes in his recent work Nexus, the myth of witches transformed suspicion into systemic violence. What began as scattered accusations turned into legal doctrine, enabled by courts and monarchs, and consumed entire communities. Women, particularly healers and midwives, were targeted, tortured and burned, simply because fear had been institutionalised.
 
 

Europe eventually stepped back from the brink of hysteria. Monarchs such as Frederick II of Prussia and Louis XIV of France helped curtail witch trials through legal reforms and the influence of rationalist thought. The Church, once complicit, began to distance itself from the practice as witch hunts increasingly brought disrepute to the Christian faith. It worked to deconstruct the narratives that had fuelled the persecution, recognising the damage these trials inflicted on both society and faith.
Ironically, the Inquisition was at times more restrained than the local courts, which tended to act out of fear and popular pressure and on the basis of rumour. Over time, the values of the Enlightenment gained ground, emphasising reason, legal restraint and human dignity. But these shifts came only after entire regions had been scarred by collective hysteria, state-sanctioned cruelty, and institutionalised repression.
If this silence continues, Pakistan risks descending further into a state of perpetual fear, where beliefs are no longer a source of spiritual guidance but used as a tool to accuse and coerce. The cost will not only be paid by victims of blasphemy allegations but by society at large, producing a stunted generation, devoid of critical thought and locked in a cycle of moral panic.
This moment is a test. Not just of institutions, but of the national will. Will state and society push back? Can they summon the courage to break this cycle and reclaim a future grounded in justice, dignity and truth?
Toxic narratives drain the energies of nations, eroding their social fabric and weakening institutions. Overcoming such narratives requires collective resolve, honesty and consistent action. While other countries have confronted and dismantled similar ideological threats through national reckoning and reform, Pakistan has yet to demonstrate such commitment.
 
 

Despite producing policy documents and establishing counterterrorism centres in each province, these initiatives often serve as smokescreens instead of leading to real solutions. They provide the illusion of progress, while the deeper ideological challenges remain unaddressed. The power elites are either in denial or lack the courage to initiate a unified and meaningful response.
Crucially, there is no comparable state-led effort to counter extremism on the legal, political or ideological fronts. Legal reforms are absent, religious leadership remains largely passive, and intellectual resistance from the religious mainstream is minimal. Even those who present themselves as moderate or rational voices within the religious sphere remain silent, caught between fear, institutional pressure and quiet complicity.

What is surprising is how the democratic West, most notably the US, UK, Germany and France, claiming to be wedded to the ‘rules-based order’, unconditionally supported him and how the Arab/Muslim governments acquiesced in the mass murder of Palestinians in the Strip, by serving as conduits for essential supplies.
There can be no doubt that its very own kind of ‘final solution’ is being forced on Gaza, where the mass destruction of all infrastructure, from homes to hospitals to educational institutions, water, power and sewerage lines, is still continuing 22 months after the Hamas attack on Israel left 800 civilians and 400 security personnel dead, with many taken hostage (around 50 of the latter, including 20 alive) remain in Hamas captivity.
 
 

Netanyahu has walked away from deals which could have seen the hostages return and reunited with their families in exchange for thousands of Palestinians who are no more than hostages of the apartheid State themselves, having been imprisoned on the so-called administrative orders of military courts, having no legal validity under the international law of human rights conventions.
Ever since US President Trump touted his ‘Gaza Rivera’ plan and was enthusiastically backed by Netanyahu, as it called for the displacement of some two million Gaza Palestinians from the Strip, Israel has stepped up not only the destruction of Gaza, having flattened some 80 per cent of the homes there, but also the mass murder of members of the intelligentsia.

The world that rightly said ‘never again’ is tolerating what is happening in Gaza.

On Friday, informed US website Axios reported that the Israeli external security service Mossad’s chief arrived in Washington to ask the US to exercise its influence on Indonesia, Libya and Ethiopia to accept those to be forcefully displaced in Nakba-II from Gaza.
It is beyond hypocritical of the US and even Israel to claim nobody will be ‘forced’ to leave and any displacement will be ‘voluntary’. Yes, hypocritical, because when some 58,000 people, including 15,500 children and a large number of non-combatant women, have been killed and the genocidal Israeli regime is obliterating any infrastructure that enables or supports the most basic form of ‘life’, what is ‘voluntary’? It is ethnic-cleansing.
A young doctor working at a top trauma centre in the UK told me the week before last that three of his colleagues who rotate to Gaza to work there, saving lives on a voluntary basis, narrated a horrific experience. All of them carry on their person satellite identifiers which emit a signal that is used to pinpoint their exact location. The IOF monitors these signals.
He said that his colleagues told him that one day they worked 12 hours non-stop to carry out emergency operations at a Gaza hospital and left together after finishing their work. Half an hour later the hospital was bombed. IOF does seem to avoid killing Westerners working in Gaza, but no such consideration is shown towards the Palestinian healthcare staff, including doctors. The latter’s mass murder has been ‘normalised’, just like the mutilation and killing of young children. The Palestinians are seen as sub-human.
 
 

After their mass murder and destruction of their homes and all infrastructure, the ultimate weapon is being used against them now. Hunger and starvation. The US-based organisation Gaza Humanitarian Foundation with its mercenaries, working in tandem with IOF, have created new killing fields in Gaza. The ‘food’ distribution points they are running are no more than extermination traps, with dozens of starving people being mowed down by automatic gunfire on a daily basis. The ‘we cherish our values’ West finds nothing unconscionable in this.
Even this weekend, UNRWA made a plea in a tweet that it has food stocks to meet Gaza’s needs for three months and begged the authorities to open the gates of Gaza (no more than a prison of death, destruction and annihilation) so they could deliver supplies to the starving and desperate Palestinians who are forced daily to brave a hail of bullets to get a sack of flour to feed themselves and their families.
The Holocaust was one of the worst crimes against humanity of the last 100 years. The world that rightly said ‘never again’ is tolerating what is happening in Gaza. Why, is a question that baffles. Whether the Western world and the region’s despots endorse Netanyahu’s definition of the Palestinians as ‘Amalek’ (evil that should be eliminated), is not important. What is, is their arming, funding and unconditional support to a regime that is being called out for genocide by notable Jewish genocide scholars who, till a few months ago, were reluctant to reach that conclusion.
 
 

Instead of reflecting on their policy, that has left in tatters their ‘rules-based order’, the US and its European partners — the UK, France and Germany to name a handful — are prosecuting and persecuting their own citizens who find the Gaza genocide a crime against humanity, a war crime, and protest. And this targeting has not spared Jewish citizens whose conscience does not allow them to be silent. This includes Holocaust survivors and the families of Holocaust survivors.
Against this utterly depressing backdrop, there is a faint ray of hope in the muted suggestions that Netanyahu is waiting for July 28 to move on a peace deal due to privately conveyed international pressure, when the Israeli parliament and the supreme court go for a nearly three-month summer break.
This, so that his far-right (can you believe there is a right to Bibi’s right too?) coalition partners can’t topple his government and also the Supreme Court may not take up the corruption charges against him. This point of view holds that a peace deal will be followed by elections that Netanyahu now believes he can win. Admittedly, this is clutching at straws, but what more does one have?

Smoke rose from burning houses in Syria’s south, gunfire was heard from inside the city of Sweida and shells landed in nearby villages, while an Arab tribal fighter vowed to “slaughter” residents as deadly clashes with the Druze persisted.
Just hours earlier, Syria’s interim President Ahmed al Sharaa had announced an immediate ceasefire, but Bedouin and tribal fighters who are allied with the Syrian authorities pushed on in the west of the Druze-majority city.
“Go forward, tribes!” said fighter Abu Jassem, addressing fellow combatants in the area, where the streets were largely deserted.
 
 


Many homes torched; shells landed in villages; monitoring body says 940 people killed amid violence so far

“We will slaughter them in their homes,” he said, referring to the Druze.
The tribal fighters have converged on Sweida from other parts of Syria to support the Bedouin who have been clashing with Druze fighters since July 13.
The violence has killed 940 people, according to a monitor.
An eyewitness on Saturday saw dozens of torched homes and vehicles and armed men setting fire to shops after looting them.
Some fighters, their faces covered, opened fire in the streets with automatic weapons while others moved around on vehicles and motorbikes.
Nothing left
In Sweida city, where around 150,000 people live, residents have been holed up in their homes without electricity and water.
Food supplies are scarce despite repeated appeals for humanitarian assistance, and communications have largely been cut off.
Near the city’s main hospital, a photographer said bloated bodies were being taken for burial in a nearby pit as the morgue was overflowing.
A doctor said the facility had received more than 400 bodies.
Security forces were deploying in the province on Saturday with the stated aim of protecting civilians and ending the chaos.
Near a village north of Sweida, an eyewitness saw government forces deploying at a checkpoint and seeking in vain to prevent armed tribal fighters from advancing.
Interior ministry spokesman Noureddine al Baba told journalists in the province’s north that security forces were deploying “to protect public and private property and guarantee the security of civilians”.
Syrian government forces were to “supervise the withdrawal of the tribes that were in battle with outlaw groups”, he added, referring to Druze fighters.
Some tribal fighters withdrew from the city on Saturday afternoon, and also reported armed men dragging bodies from a street.
According to the United Nations, the fighting has displaced 87,000 people.
In recent days, brutal videos have circulated on social media, some appearing to show the execution of people in civilian clothing and the abuse of elderly clerics, as dozens of people published shocking accounts of the deaths of loved ones.
One resident of the city, who fled days earlier, said: “We have nothing left. Most of the people we know — our relatives and friends — are dead.
“Sweida has been destroyed, and we are trying to keep our families away until this madness ends.”

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi led the charge on Saturday, calling on Modi to address the nation regarding the fate of the jets.
“Modi ji, what is the truth about the five [jets]? The country has the right to know!” Mr Gandhi posted on X, as criticism from the opposition mounted over the government’s han­­dling of the brief but intense conflict.
 






The controversy erupted after Trump, speaking at a White House dinner with Republican lawmakers on Friday, said, “In fact, planes were being shot out of the air. Five, five, four or five, but I think five jets were shot down actually,” referring to the hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours.

Indian premier asked to ‘speak truth’

Trump did not specify which side’s aircraft were downed, nor did he provide further details.
Following the India-Pakistan war, Trump has repeatedly taken credit — over 60 times — for brokering the ceasefire he announced via social media on May 10, after Washington engaged in backchannel diplomacy with both sides.
However, India has challenged his claim, disputing that the truce resulted from US intervention or the threat of cutting trade ties if hostilities continued.
Congress general secretary-in-charge (communications) Jairam Ramesh accused Modi of failing to address Trump’s repeated assertions.
“The Trump missile gets fired for the 24th time with the same two messages, two days before the Monsoon Session of Parliament begins,” Mr Ramesh said.
“The prime minister has to now himself make a clear and categorical statement in Parliament on what President Trump has been claiming over the past 70 days.”
As the Indian Parliament prepares to convene for the monsoon session, the opposition has signalled that it will continue to press Mr Modi for answers.
The escalation between India and Pakistan was triggered by an attack in Pahalgam in India-held Kashmir in April.
The attack, which killed 26 men, led to a rapid military escalation, with Islamabad responding to what it called New Delhi’s “unprovoked strikes”.  A ceasefire was brokered days later, following US intervention on May 10.
Pakistan has claimed it downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat, while India’s top military official acknowledged in late May that the country suffered losses in the air on the first day of hostilities before switching tactics and regaining the advantage ahead of the ceasefire.
On May 10, Mr Trump announced on social media that Washington had held talks with both sides.  “These are two serious nuclear countries and they were hitting each other,” he said.
“We said, you guys want to make a trade deal. We’re not making a trade deal if you’re going to be throwing around weapons, and maybe nuclear weapons.”
India, however, has pushed back against Trump’s claims, insisting that the ceasefire was the result of direct talks between New Delhi and Islamabad, without outside intervention.
India maintains that it does not accept third-party mediation in its disputes with Pakistan.
The US counts both India and Pakistan as important partners in the region, with Washington seeking to deepen ties with New Delhi as part of its strategy to counter China’s influence in Asia.
The attack in India-held Kashmir, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistan, brought the two nuclear-armed countries to the brink of their fifth all-out war.  Islamabad has denied any involvement and called for a neutral investigation.

• Medic says hundreds facing ‘imminent death’ in besieged enclave
GAZA: At least 90 people, including 36 who were seeking aid, were killed across Gaza on Saturday as Al Jazeera reported Israeli forces continued to attack aid sites.
The Israeli military said it had fired warning shots at suspects who approached its troops after they did not heed calls to stop, about a kilometre away from an aid distribution site that was not active at the time.
Civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal said the deaths happened near a site southwest of Khan Yunis and another centre northwest of Rafah, both in the south, attributing the deaths to “Israeli gunfire”.
One witness said he headed to the Al-Tina area of Khan Yunis before dawn with five of his relatives to try to get food when “Israeli soldiers” started shooting.
“My relatives and I were unable to get anything,” Abdul Aziz Abed, 37, told AFP.
“Every day I go there and all we get is bullets and exhaustion instead of food.” Three other witnesses also accused troops of opening fire.
Gaza resident Mohammed al-Khalidi said he was in the group approaching the site and heard no warnings before the firing began.
“We thought they came out to organise us so we can get aid, suddenly [I] saw the jeeps coming from one side, and the tanks from the other and started shooting at us,” he said.
The Gaza Humanitarian Fund (GHF), a US-backed group which runs the aid site, said there were no incidents or fatalities there on Saturday and that it has repeatedly warned people not to travel to its distribution points at dark.
“The reported IDF [Israel Defence Forces] activity resulting in fatalities occurred hours before our sites opened and our understanding is most of the casualties occurred several kilometres away from the nearest GHF site,” it said.
In response, the Israeli military said it “identified suspects who approached them during operational activity in the Rafah area, posing a threat to the troops”.
Soldiers called for them to turn back and “after they did not comply, the troops fired warning shots”, it said, adding that it was aware of the reports about casualties.
“The incident is under review. The shots were fired approximately one kilometre away from the aid distribution site at nighttime when it’s not active,” it said in a statement.
On Tuesday, the UN rights office in Geneva said it had recorded at least 875 killings within the past six weeks in the vicinity of aid sites and food convoys in Gaza — the majority of them close to GHF distribution points.
‘Imminent death’
At least 18 more people were killed in other Israeli attacks across Gaza on Saturday, health officials said.
The Israeli military said that it had struck militants’ weapon depots and sniping posts in a few locations in the enclave.
Most people in Gaza have been displaced at least once by the fighting, and doctors and aid agencies say the physical and mental health effects of 21 months of conflict are being increasingly seen.
“We are receiving cases suffering from extreme exhaustion and complete fatigue, in addition to severe emaciation and acute malnutrition due to prolonged lack of food,” the director of the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in Khan Yunis, Sohaib Al-Hums, said on Friday.
“Hundreds” of people were facing “imminent death”, he added.
Accountability
The US ambassador to Israel on Saturday visited a Christian village in the occupied West Bank and urged accountability for an attack on an ancient church, which residents have blamed on Israeli settlers.
 
 

In early July, the village of Taybeh was hit by an arson attack in the area of the ruins of the Byzantine-era Church of Saint George, which dates back to the fifth century.
Ambassador Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian and staunch advocate for Israel, said it was “unacceptable to commit an act of sacrilege by desecrating a place that is supposed to be a place of worship”.

Police said a magnetic explosive device was attached to the officer’s vehicle, which exploded in the Jabl-i-Noor area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta.
Dawn withheld the martyred officer’s name and rank as there was no official announcement regarding the martyrdom.
However, officials said CCTV footage from a nearby camera showed a motorcyclist passing close to the vehicle moments before the explosion. He reportedly attached the explosive device to the driver’s side door. A few seconds later, the blast took place.
Security forces cordoned off the area after the attack and moved the officer’s body to the Combined Military Hospital, Quetta.
Initial investigation revealed it was a remote-controlled explosion.  The window panes of nearby shops and buildings were smashed due to the intensity of the blast.
Police said the officer had gone to the Jabl-i-Noor graveyard to offer fateha on the grave of his father. He was leaving the graveyard when he was targeted.
No other casualty was reported in the blast.
Police and CTD officials were investigating the incident.
The martyred officer belonged to the Muslim Bagh area of Pishin and was serving in the army for the last 10 years. He is survived by a wife and three sons.

• Insiders claim oath-taking slated for today may get delayed due to ‘quorum’
• PPP leader says opposition alliance intact, will secure five seats
PESHAWAR: As the disgruntled PTI workers are adamant on contesting Senate polls despite an understanding between the KP’s ruling party and the opposition, the agreement on seat adjustment, however, seems to remain intact, with both sides now working on the panel of voters for their candidates.
The oath-taking of the 25 MPAs-elect, which is scheduled for today (Sunday), has also assumed importance, as non-administration of oaths to them could lead to postponement of Senate polls.
One of the ruling party MPAs told Dawn that there was a likelihood that oath-taking would not take place on Sunday, as the session might be adjourned at the outset due to “lack of quorum”.
The treasury and the joint opposition alliance had agreed on a seat-sharing formula under which six seats will go to the treasury, which has 92 members in the KP Assembly, and five seats to the opposition, which is 53-strong.
“The denial of Senate tickets to diehard workers has strengthened the doubts of the establishment’s involvement in the award of tickets,” one of the PTI insiders told Dawn. It was a good opportunity for the Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur to stand with the ideological workers and dispel the impression that he was not the “establishment guy”. “We will not take part in the establishment game; rather, we will fully participate in the Senate elections,” PTI’s Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem said in his video message issued on Saturday.
This understanding had not sat well with the party’s Peshawar chapter, which had decided to oppose this agreement and vowed to contest the polls despite the party’s policy. On Saturday, they also released video messages, announcing they would stick to their stance. They said they would contest the elections in line with PTI founder Imran Khan’s vision. On the other hand, the PTI leadership has put their heads together on how to handle the situation, as party insiders believe that among the disgruntled candidates, Irfan Saleem will definitely score.
Gandapur asked to dispel impression
Referring to his party seat adjustment with the opposition, Mr Saleem said, “The plan is basically made to elect the pro-establishment candidates in the Senate elections”. He said that they would not withdraw and will fully resist the plan, adding that they didn’t tolerate blame on the Imran Khan vision under which the masses of KP and the entire country voted for him. Basically, the seat adjustment with the opposition is aimed at electing those people who have made the lives of the PTI workers and their leadership miserable after the May 9 incident, he said, adding that they would not bow down before such forces.
Another disgruntled candidate Khurram Shehzad said that a Senate ticket or other designations meant nothing to him, but “not contesting the elections is against Imran Khan’s ideology”. “I have been receiving different kinds of threats to withdraw from the race, but I will not, no matter if I am unable to get a single vote,” he said.
Another candidate Aisha Bano, who also refused to withdraw, said in her video message that, like her colleagues, she was going to contest the Senate election. “The Senate’s seats are a sacred trust of Imran Khan with us, and we will not let go easily,” she said, adding someelements wanted to favour those who were involved in the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
Against Imran’s ideology
Meanwhile, the opposition parties held a meeting at KP Governor House, attended by Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, leader of the opposition in KP Assembly Dr Ibadullah and senior leaders of the opposition parties.
The participants discussed the issue of oath-taking from the 25 MPAs-elect on reserved seats. PPP parliamentary leader Ahmad Karim Kundi told Dawn that the opposition alliance was intact and will secure five seats, including three general and one each for technocrat and women.
Sepa­rately, the Election Commission of Pakistan appointed eight polling officers to oversee the Senate elections set to take place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Monday. According to the ECP, Senate elections for eleven seats from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly will be held on July 21.

Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Dargai tehsil Assistant Commissioner Waheedullah Khan told Dawn.com that a major operation was carried out in the Mehrday area of Malakand today.
“Police and CTD took part in the successful operation,” the AC said. “Five terrorists were eliminated and two were injured while eight were captured alive.”
The AC added that the arrested terrorists were transported to the CTD centre, while the injured were moved to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Dargai.
The Dargai AC confirmed to Dawn.com that the terrorists belonged to the TTP and were behind attacks in the region.
Earlier today, nine terrorists were killed and three security officers were injured in an exchange of fire during an operation in KP’s Hangu district, police said.
“Nine terrorists killed in Hangu operation, District Police Officer (DPO) Khalid Khan is undergoing treatment at the Kohat Combined Military Hospital,” a statement issued by Kohat Regional Police Officer Deputy Inspector General Abbas Majeed read.
“The operation is continuing successfully and full action is being taken against the terrorists,” the statement added. It further read that DPO Khan was out of danger.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
Earlier this week, three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the CTD in Bannu district.</p><small>2025-07-19 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1916552305940c7.jpg?r=165806' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925221/byc-protesters-in-islamabad-fear-police-crackdown-on-sit-in' target='_blank'><strong>BYC protesters in Islamabad fear police crackdown on sit-in</strong></a><br><p>The Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) on Saturday continued its ongoing sit-in on the road leading to the National Press Club in Islamabad, as the route had been blocked by police with barbed wire, preventing its activists from returning to their original protest site.
An anti-terrorism court in Quetta on Friday remanded BYC chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other organisers of the group into police custody for 15 days, in the case of her and other BYC members “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence” in March.
The Islamabad sit-in began on June 16, with BYC leaders and members demanding the release of its activists. Political leaders, journalists and activists have joined the sit-in over the past few days.
A Dawn.com correspondent at the scene reported that the demonstrators were not allowed to set up their protest camp outside the press club, so they would leave in the evenings and return to demonstrate in the afternoon. When they arrived today, they found the route to the press club blocked.
“We started our camp in the morning and finished in the evening as the authorities did not allow us to erect tents,” a woman protester told Dawn.com. “When we came back today, they didn’t allow us to proceed and we were told that we didn’t have an NOC (no-objection certificate).”
She continued that “everyone had the right to protest except for the Baloch”.
“We have been sitting on the main road peacefully for the fourth day, but the police have called in buses to take us away and increased their numbers,” she added.
When asked about the possibility of a crackdown, the protester said, “They’re prepared to drag us into buses and take us back to Balochistan.”
According to the BYC, elderly people, women and children are among the protesters today and facing extreme heat.
“Whether under pouring rain or in scorching heat, they have continued their peaceful demonstration on the bare footpaths, without tents or shade,” the group wrote on X.
 






Lawyer Nadia Baloch, Mahrang’s sister, expressed fears of a crackdown by police in a post on X.
“Riot police have surrounded the National Press Club in Islamabad and its surrounding areas with barbed wire,” she wrote.
“We are peaceful protesters, including older women and young children, who have travelled thousands of kilometres from Balochistan to this city of power and authority, only to now face the threat of arrest, violence, and intimidation.”
 






Former PPP senator Farhatullah Babar told Dawn.com that there are “hardly 20 women” at the demonstration and that protesting is their fundamental right.
He highlighted two main issues in Balochistan, which are causing discontent among the people and contributing to protests like this one.
“There are two fundamental issues in Balochistan: number one, people want their representative assembly and government,” Babar explained.
“People in Balochistan feel that neither the assembly nor the government are their genuine representative. When you don’t have trust in your government … there is resentment.”
Babar highlighted that the second issue is enforced disappearances, stating, “My suggestion to the state would be to come out of the mode of denial, admit that there is an issue of enforced disappearances and sit together.”
Babar emphasised that all stakeholders should sit together and find a solution.
“A solution can be found — there have been recommendations made by parliament and there are observations made by the courts. “Let us all sit together and find a way.”
Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed, who is present at the protest, told Dawn.com that 25-30 people are protesting.
“They are demonstrating for their right to live and right to fair trial under Article 10A of the Constitution,” Ahmed said. “The roads have been closed and there is a heavy police deployment. There’s an atmosphere of fear here.”
The former senator said that he condemned this because the demonstrators have not blocked roads themselves. “This will not resolve the issue and the people behind this are playing with fire.”
Former senator Afrasiab Khattak condemned the police’s blocking the route to the press club in a post on X.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) issued a statement on X expressing concern about the treatment of Baloch activists who have travelled from Balochistan to the federal capital.
“HRCP stands by their right to peaceful assembly and protest and demands that the authorities differentiate between advocacy for legitimate rights and militancy,” the statement read. “Women and children from Balochistan deserve as much dignity and respect as people from other parts of the country.”

Federal Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi telephoned the Hangu DPO and appreciated his bravery and determination.
“The interior minister said that the nation will never forget the sacrifices of its brave sons and is determined to achieve final victory in the war against terrorism,” the statement added.
 






“During the operation, there was a heavy exchange of fire between the terrorists and the law enforcement personnel,” the earlier statement by the KP IGP read.
“Security forces fought bravely and killed five terrorists. However, Hangu DPO Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,” it added.
The statement said that DPO Khan “was hit by three bullets”.
IG Hameed spoke to the injured officers and enquired about their well-being, according to the police statement.
“Law enforcement agencies are determined to continue their fight against terrorism,” the statement added.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.
 
 

On June 21, KP police killed a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.
In May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide attack in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.
Earlier this week, three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu district.
On July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the CTD.
