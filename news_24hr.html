In these regions, affordability often outweighs concerns about the oil’s quality, exposing millions to significant health risks.
The loose oil, typically sold in bulk without proper packaging or labelling, often contains harmful chemicals, impurities, and biological contaminants. These pose serious health threats, including cardiovascular diseases, strokes, and brain disorders, experts warn.
This issue was highlighted during a recent consultative meeting on edible oil regularisation, organised by Nutrition International (NI), a Canadian organisation. Mueen Qureshi, a representative from NI, noted that between 40pc and 45pc of Pakistan’s low-income population relies on this informal sector for their oil supply.
Dr Hasan Orooj, NI’s Technical Consultant, pointed out that Sindh is home to 33 loose oil mills, with the majority located in Karachi, followed by Hyderabad and Sukkur. Balochistan, on the other hand, has only two mills, relying heavily on oil from Sindh, with smuggled Iranian oil also finding its way into the local market.

Consensus has been reached to bring the sale of loose edible oil into a regulatory framework, requiring sealed packaging, licencing and traceability

Dr Orooj emphasised that Iranian oil is 100pc fit for consumption, whereas samples from Sindh and Punjab have failed health tests.
Pakistan ranks as the eighth-largest consumer of edible oil globally, with per capita consumption at 22 kg annually. While branded oils undergo rigorous refining processes, including filtration, deodorisation, and neutralisation, loose oil is often produced without such safeguards. It is commonly stored in unsterilised containers and transported under unsanitary conditions, making it highly prone to contamination and oxidation.
The price difference between loose and branded oil is considerable. Loose oil, which lacks essential vitamins A and D, costs between Rs1,000 and Rs1,500 for a 5-litre container, while branded oil is priced around Rs2,700 for the same quantity.
However, the quality of loose oil is compromised due to high levels of trans fats, oxidised lipids, and other toxic compounds formed during improper processing. Trans fats, known for raising bad cholesterol (LDL) while lowering good cholesterol (HDL), significantly increase the risk of heart disease. Additionally, the common practice of reheating oil, particularly in Pakistani and South Asian cooking, further degrades its quality, producing carcinogenic substances like acrylamide and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
Dr Orooj explained that proper refining processes remove free fatty acids, eliminate gums, and neutralise unpleasant odours, ensuring the oil is safe for consumption. In contrast, unrefined oils retain higher levels of pesticides and aflatoxins, both of which are linked to liver damage and cancer.
Regulating edible oil sector
He also pointed to successful regulatory transitions in India and other Asian nations, where informal oil markets were brought into formal regulatory frameworks through government intervention. As part of the proposed solution, Dr Orooj called for the establishment of a “Regularisation Compliance Committee” (RCC) to oversee the registration and regulation of loose oil vendors.
The committee, which would include representatives from SFA, Nutrition International, Karachi University, and other bodies, would oversee the completion of the necessary legal and safety requirements.
Dr Seema Ashraf of the Sindh Food Authority (SFA) noted that while over 54 PSQCA standards exist for various edible oils, Codex standards specific to cold-pressed and expressed oils (e.g., mustard, sesame, sunflower) are yet to be adopted. She urged the implementation of these standards or the development of provincial regulations to fill the gap.
Mr Farhan, Chairman of the Karachi Edible Oil Association (KEOA), acknowledged the health risks associated with loose oil but emphasised the sector’s importance in supporting millions of consumers and livelihoods. He suggested that a formal licensing and registration system be introduced, allowing small producers to comply with safety and quality benchmarks.
A consensus emerged at the meeting, with stakeholders agreeing that all edible oils should be sold in sealed, labelled packaging with traceable batch numbers. Loose oil, under current regulations, should be considered non-edible, and vendors must adhere to standards set by PSQCA or Codex Alimentarius. In addition, licensing and registration should apply to wholesalers, distributors, and small-scale processors, and the sale of unbranded oils should be phased out through a clear regulatory framework.
Dr S. M. Ghufran Saeed, from the University of Karachi’s Department of Food Science and Technology, raised concerns about the lack of traceability and labelling of loose oils, which often leads to adulteration with hazardous substances, such as recycled frying oils or even industrial-grade fats.
He recommended a complete ban on the commercial sale of loose oils, which currently operates in a regulatory grey area, and called for a nationwide enforcement of formal licensing procedures.
Dr Umar Mukhtar Tarar from PCSIR Karachi proposed categorising stakeholders into distinct regulatory groups, each requiring tailored measures. He stressed the importance of monitoring inter-provincial trade and the movement of substandard oils through joint inspection teams.
Ms Farah Athar from the Punjab Food Authority (PFA) recommended that the sale of loose oils be banned by the SFA after a three-month transition period, with small vendors allowed to continue operating under regulated conditions. She also called for mandatory labelling requirements to ensure compliance with national food safety standards.
Dr Ahmed Ali Sheikh, representing the Sindh Food Authority, concluded that the government is committed to regulating the loose oil sector and is prepared to support sellers through the registration and regularisation process.
As Pakistan grapples with the health and economic implications of loose edible oils, the need for urgent reform is clear. The collective efforts of regulators, academics, and industry representatives are crucial to safeguarding public health and ensuring that the edible oil sector transitions into a more formal, regulated framework.

They said that the Iranian government will extend all facilities and incentives for starting joint ventures with Iranian entrepreneurs and investors.
They extended the offer during a meeting with business leaders and representatives of the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Small Chamber of Commerce and Small Industries and the Pak-Iran Chamber of Commerce in Quetta on Saturday.
The Iranian officials emphasised that achieving the $10 billion bilateral trade target between Pakistan and Iran depends on cooperation. They also congratulated Balochistan’s business community on the resumption of Quetta-Zahedan flight services via Mashhad.
The Iranian envoy and members of the delegation expressed satisfaction over recent agreements signed between Pakistani and Iranian officials in Islamabad, including plans to expand bilateral trade to $10bn.
They noted that while official agreements are encouraging, their implementation will not be possible without the cooperation of chambers of commerce and the business community. They stressed that Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan may have different geographies but share common economic interests and trade barriers must be removed collectively.
The delegation agreed to the proposal for forming a transport issue resolution committee and encouraged private-sector initiatives to further enhance bilateral trade.
Earlier, Quetta Chamber President Haji Muhammad Ayub Mariani and Vice President Engineer Mir Wais Khan Kakar highlighted the chamber’s long-standing efforts to promote and strengthen brotherly trade ties with neighbouring countries.
They stressed the need to resolve transport issues and reduce tariffs on imports from each other to boost bilateral trade. They also proposed forming a joint committee — comprising chamber representatives, NLC officials and transport ministry authorities from both countries — to address cross-border goods transport problems. According to them, resolving these issues would create dignified employment opportunities and improve living standards for people in both nations.

The visit comes shortly after he went to the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with US President Donald Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
During the trip in June, Field Marshal Munir stressed the “immense potential for a broader, multidimensional relationship built upon mutual respect” with Washington.
Today’s press release by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said: “In Tampa, COAS attended the Retirement Ceremony of outgoing Commander United States Central Command (Centcom), General Michael E. Kurilla, and the Change of Command Ceremony marking the assumption of command by Admiral Brad Cooper.
 






“COAS lauded General Kurilla’s exemplary leadership and his invaluable contributions to strengthening bilateral military cooperation, and extended his best wishes to Admiral Cooper, expressing confidence in continued collaboration to address shared security challenges.
In June, Gen Kurilla hailed Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in the arena of counter-terrorism, citing their struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State.
The field marshal also met with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine, where matters of mutual professional interest were discussed and Munir extended an invitation to General Caine to visit Pakistan.
The army chief also interacted with the chiefs of defence from friendly nations on the sidelines of the meeting, ISPR said.
“During an interactive session with the Pakistani diaspora, COAS urged them to remain confident in Pakistan’s bright future and to actively contribute to attracting investments.
“The diaspora reaffirmed their commitment to supporting Pakistan’s progress and development.”</p><small>2025-08-10 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/101011166600308.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929867/nab-recovers-rs547bn-in-first-half-of-2025' target='_blank'><strong>NAB recovers Rs547bn in first half of 2025</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) recovered movable and immovable properties, as well as money, worth Rs547.31 billion during the first half (January to June) of the current year from corrupt elements.
NAB made recoveries amounting to Rs456.3bn during the second quarter of 2025, marking a substantial increase of Rs365.29bn compared to Rs91.01bn recovered in the first quarter.
Of the total recoveries, movable and immovable properties worth Rs532.33bn have been disbursed and handed over to different ministries and departments of federal and provincial governments, as well as to financial institutions.
In addition, 12,611 victims in various cases of public cheating have also been compensated. Over the past two years, the anti-graft body has recovered Rs5.854 trillion, which is 700 per cent more than Rs839.08bn recovered previously since the bureau’s inception. Preliminary estimates indicate that state land worth approximately Rs5tr is under illegal possession and will be reclaimed.

Two-year recovery crosses Rs5.8tr

Key recoveries and achievements in the second quarter of 2025 include: NAB Rawalpindi recovered 51 kanal of land worth Rs29bn located in Sector E-11 of Islamabad and handed over to the Capital Development Authority (CDA). In another case of cheating the public at large (B4U), NAB secured Rs3bn, which will be disbursed to 17,214 victims.
 
 

In another case (Banker’s City), 640 kanal and 11 marla land of significant value has been transferred to NAB, with proceeds to be distributed among the affected individuals. NAB Sukkur recovered a piece of land worth Rs25.079bn belonging to the National Highway Authority.
The bureau also recovered 127 kanal and 15 marla of land valued at Rs895.160m, belonging to the Education and Literacy Department of the Sindh government. From its impressive recovery portfolio, Rs384.27bn worth of forest land was recovered in the quarter ending June 2025, contributing to a total forest land recovery value of Rs1.487tr.
NAB Lahore disbursed Rs3.2bn, recovered in the Eden case, to 11,880 victims of the housing society.
In the Pak Arab case, eight properties valued at Rs3.9bn were surrendered by the accused and are in the process of being transferred to NAB. Proceeds from these assets will be disbursed to 2,500 affected individuals.
A plea bargain amounting to Rs2.181bn is underway with owners of Elite Town Housing Society, with recovered funds intended for disbursement among 1,789 victims.

However, the registrar office raised an objection to three separate appeals of Ms Gul in as many convictions announced by a Faisalabad ATC.
The office noted that the appellant had not surrendered herself before the law, therefore, her appeals against the sentences were not maintainable.
However, the office fixed the hearing of the appeals as “objection case” before a two-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Aalia Neelum for Aug 11.

Zartaj Gul, Senator Ejaz move LHC against ATC convictions

Now, the bench will decide the office objection on the appeals.
The office also fixed the hearing of Senator Ejaz’s appeal before the same division bench without putting any objection. The senator is already in jail facing trials in multiple cases of May 9 attacks.
Ms Gul filed the appeals through Advocate Mian Muhammad Hussain.
The appeals contend that
Ms Gul was not nominated in the FIRs and her name was only added in the supplementary statements. They said she was neither present at the scene nor was her presence proved by the prosecution.
The appeals further stated that key prosecution witnesses denied any meeting involving Ms Gul. The pleas asked the LHC to set aside the sentences and acquit the appellant.
A Faisalabad ATC had on July 31 awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment each under Section 109 (punishment for abetment when the act abetted is committed) and Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the PPC.
A Lahore ATC had awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and others including Dr Yasmin Rashid, former governor Omar Sarfraz Chee­­ma and former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid in a case of violence near Sherpao Bridge.
The appeal by Senator Ejaz stated that the trial court handed down the sentence beyond facts and in violation of the law. It said the appellant was not even present at the alleged occurrence.
Bail dismissed
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill dismissed the pre-arrest bail of Mr Ayub as he failed to appear before the court.
His lawyer filed an application seeking a one-time exemption from personal appearance, pointing out that a Faisalabad ATC sentenced the petitioner in a May 9 case. He argued that without getting protective bail, the petitioner could not appear in Lahore and approached the Peshawar High Court for the relief.
However, Judge Gill dismissed the exemption request, noting that since Mr Ayub had already been convicted, he must surrender before the court.
The judge observed that a convicted person is not entitled to protective or transit bail and cannot file an appeal before surrendering.
Omar Ayub filed bail petitions in the Jinnah House attack, Askari Tower attack, and Shadman police station arson cases.

Simultaneously with Trump’s announcement of the summit came the approval of the Israeli security cabinet of war crimes-accused Prime Minister Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu’s plan to physically occupy Gaza. Netanyahu’s handpicked military chief earlier had reservations, but eventually consented and complied.
The military chief has been quoted as saying any expansion of the military operation would jeopardise the lives of the remaining 20 hostages held in captivity since being seized by Hamas on Oct 7, 2023. The group broke through the fence, walls and other obstacles around Gaza to attack Israel and kill some 1,200 Israelis, including nearly 400 civilians that day.
The Times of Israel quoted IDF chief of staff Lt-Gen Eyal Zamir’s assessment offered to his senior colleagues ahead of the security cabinet meeting. According to Hebrew media reports, he warned that “occupying the Strip would drag Israel into a black hole — taking responsibility for two million Palestinians, requiring a years-long clearing operation, exposing soldiers to guerrilla warfare and, most dangerously, jeopardising the hostages”.

Netanyahu’s plan looks like an attempt to grab all or most Palestinian land in Gaza

“We are not dealing with theory; we are dealing with matters of life and death, with the defence of the state, and we do so while looking directly into the eyes of our soldiers and the citizens of the country,” Zamir maintained during Thursday’s assessment, the army said. Then, under threat of a forced resignation, he said he’d comply.
It is clear that the starvation policy pursued by Israel for months, with the backing of the US through the murderous Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which so far has killed hundreds of starving Palestinians queuing for food in Gaza, does not seem to have broken the Palestinians’ iron will.
In fact, the images of starving people being slaughtered by IDF and GHF contractors have evoked outrage around the globe, with even the duplicitous EU and UK making disapproving noises and some European nations, led by France, saying they might recognise the Palestinian state during the UN General Assembly session next month as a first step towards a two-state solution.
Netanyahu’s plan looks like an attempt to grab all or most Palestinian land in Gaza to mirror what has been happening in the West Bank, ahead of any recognition, so as to deny the creation or existence of a viable Palestinian state. The psychopathic Israeli leader has received US approval, with Trump saying: “It is pretty much up to Israel” to do what it wants in Gaza.
There have been laughable leaks in the US media, probably originating in the White House where spin doctors have sold stories like Trump shouted down Netanyahu when the latter was claiming that there was no starvation in Gaza and all such stories were Hamas propaganda.
Who does not know that it was Trump who first mentioned his planned Gaza Riviera that would follow the (forced) displacement, again, of Gaza’s 2m Palestinians whose earlier generations were first displaced to the Strip in the Nakba in 1948?
It would be important to see the Trump-Putin summit against this backdrop. It is unlikely Putin will have changed his stance on key issues to which he ties any ceasefire in Ukraine, after one visit to Moscow by US presidential envoy Steve Witkoff (he is a US presidential envoy, despite often sounding like an Israeli spokesman on Gaza).
Putin has clearly stated that he will offer no territorial concessions in eastern Ukraine where his military has slowly but surely started to make gains and wants recognition of his Crimean annexation of 2014 and Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in 2022.
He has sought explicit guarantees that the Nato alliance would not be expanded to Ukraine because that would be too close for comfort and take away the buffer Ukraine has provided between Russia and Nato since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In the past, Trump has indicated that concessions (not by Russia) will have to be made in some of these areas for a peace deal to be realised. Ahead of the summit, it wasn’t clear if the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s government, or even the European members of Nato, was willing to make any such concessions.
And without such concessions, a peace deal cannot be realised. Perhaps, Putin agreed to the summit to give Trump a small win to boast about for weeks in the media and, at the same time, give himself more time and space to continue with his military campaign where he believes his forces are making good progress.
Inevitably now, the global media attention will shift from the Gaza forced starvation story to looking ahead at the Alaska summit. And this shift in focus will enable Israel to push ahead with the occupation of northern Gaza to start with, going on to the rest of the Strip, as only that will enable it to complete ethnic cleansing — even annexation — if that too is an unsaid part of the agenda.
All this is happening with the complicity of Western democracies, despite the unease of sections of their populations over the images of starving children and malnourished babies. It seems these images are more powerful or somehow affect the Western media sensibilities more than the slaughter of some 15,500 children and the amputation of the limbs of thousands more.
The less said the better about the Arab neighbours and the larger Muslim world, many of whose despotic rulers are too fearful of the consequences of defying the US to do anything other than being complicit in, or at least acquiescent to, genocide in Gaza. This is where we stand today in helpless despair and despondency.

From the battlefields of Ukraine to the brief India-Pakistan stand-off in May, unmanned aerial systems have steadily shaped the way conflicts are fought. Once confined to the arsenals of state militaries, drones have now become part of non-state actors’ toolkits too. This transformation has been gradual but deliberate, as militant groups learn to adapt commercially available platforms or assemble improvised systems for their tactical needs.
This global evolution has found its echo in Pakistan’s tribal districts, where Islamist militants have begun moving from occasional experimentation to more consistent and coordinated drone operations. The shift is not merely technical. It carries a political undertone, signalling to local populations and state actors alike that militants are capable of matching the technological edge of formal security institutions.
Pakistan’s security forces were already using drones for surveillance, reconnaissance, and precision targeting. But the appearance of similar technology in militant hands has complicated the battlefield equation. The skies over conflict zones now hold an ambiguity: a drone sighted overhead may belong to either side, and this blurring of lines heightens operational and psychological uncertainty.
For residents, the growing drone presence is unsettling. Many remain unsure whether the military or militants fly the machines they hear. This uncertainty steadily corrodes trust in the state’s ability to protect them. The fear is not abstract. Farmers delay work in their fields, shopkeepers close their shutters earlier than usual and inter-village travel is restricted. The constant buzzing overhead imposes a psychological toll, making life feel precarious even when no attack occurs. Over time, such conditions widen the social distance between communities and the state.

The appearance of drone technology in militant hands has complicated the battlefield equation.

The past few months have seen an intensification of militant violence in KP. According to local monitoring groups, July alone recorded 28 militant attacks in the province, several of them high-profile. Bannu’s Miryan Police Station came under repeated aerial assaults. The deadliest incident was in Orakzai, where eight paramilitary personnel lost their lives. This was particularly significant because Orakzai had long been considered one of the more secure districts compared to the southern belt, a perception now eroding as the militant influence spreads northwards.
The southern districts remain tense, with curfews imposed in multiple locations. On July 24, Tank district’s Jandola subdivision was placed under a daylong lockdown, while similar restrictions were applied in Birmal tehsil of lower South Waziristan due to credible threats. In Bajaur, a three-day curfew preceded a significant security operation aimed at clearing militant strongholds. Such measures underline not only the fragile security environment but also the strain on state capacity in containing the threat.
For now, militant drone warfare in Pakistan remains in its formative phase. Accuracy is inconsistent, and much of the activity still bears the hallmarks of experimentation. Yet security officials believe the trajectory is clear: as militants gain confidence and refine their techniques, both the frequency and lethality of these strikes will likely increase, a pattern already seen in other conflict theatres.
For these groups, drones offer versatility. They can deliver improvised explosive devices or small munitions with relative precision, using low-cost quadcopters that are easy to source or assemble. They can map checkpoints, log patrol timings, identify weak points in security perimeters, and spot targets for indirect fire or suicide attacks, relaying live video to command teams in real time. Drones are also used for logistical purposes, moving Sim cards, batteries, medical supplies or technical components between cells in areas where ground movement is too risky. Beyond their functional role, drones serve as tools of psychological warfare, producing aerial footage for propaganda, amplifying the perception of militant reach and eroding the sense of state control.
The state’s response is beginning to adapt to this emerging threat. Towards the end of July, police in KP deployed anti-drone technology for the first time during an operation in Bannu. An anti-drone gun sent from Peshawar successfully disrupted hostile UAV activity, forcing militants to abort movements. Authorities now intend to expand the deployment of such systems across the southern districts, integrating them into counter-militancy operations. Police officials express optimism that this capability will allow faster, more precise responses and help blunt the evolving tactics of militant groups.
Responsibility for these attacks is not always straightforward to establish. In Bannu, most incidents have been attributed to the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group. Yet in several cases, the perpetrators remain unidentified. Security forces have generally blamed the TTP, but the group, in some of its official statements, has denied operational involvement, claiming it is still in the process of acquiring drone technology.
Abdul Sayed, a Sweden-based researcher, offers a more nuanced account. He notes that since 2024, footage of drone strikes has been quietly circulated through TTP’s unofficial media channels, while official communications have avoided direct acknowledgement. This changed in 2025, when the TTP faction Ittehad began openly claiming drone attacks. The move drew criticism from pro-TTP voices on Telegram, who argued that public acknowledgement was strategically unsound. Nevertheless, Ittehad persisted, and eventually, the TTP leadership followed suit, marking a shift in propaganda posture.
From discreet experimentation to open claims, the evolution of militant drone use indicates that these systems are becoming increasingly entrenched in Pakistan’s internal security landscape. The country’s security challenges were already complex and multifaceted, and the introduction of drone technology adds a new layer of complication. While Islamist militants in KP’s tribal districts are the most frequent users, there is also evidence suggesting that Baloch insurgents have adopted this technology, as indicated by several video clips and reported terrorist attacks.
If left unchecked, the spread of drone use could deepen mistrust between the state and local populations, further destabilising fragile districts.

After all, both the Election Commission and the section of the judiciary which has prevailed since the 26th Amendment have shown very little regard for the controversies that continue to surround it.
It is pointless to fault the government or the so-called establishment, because such is the nature of the beast. It was the ECP, constitutionally tasked with ensuring and safeguarding the fairness of the political process, that ought to have ensured that injustices were promptly addressed.
Likewise, the courts, mandated with protecting the Constitution and the constitutional scheme of order, should have kept a constant check on the Commission. Unfortunately, both institutions long ago resigned themselves to complacency. And that is a charitable view.
 
 

According to electoral watchdog Fafen, more than half of the many election disputes raised after the Feb 8, 2024, polls remain undecided. The law gives election tribunals 180 days to settle election disputes. The deadline was extended from 120 days — mere months before the last election. It has now been a year and a half since the last vote was cast. Article 225 states: “No election to a House or Provincial Assembly shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such tribunal and in such manner as may be determined by Act of Parliament.”
Therefore, what the prolonged delays in issuing decisions essentially mean is that the tribunals are themselves the biggest hurdle in securing electoral justice. It must be noted that the entire purpose of appointing election tribunals is that cases regarding poll disputes can be heard and decided promptly. Otherwise, they would go to the courts, which are already burdened with a significant backlog.
This is why the tribunals’ failure to deliver is so egregious. To the suspicious mind, the sluggish pace of deliberations suggests that the tribunals were created merely to fulfil a formality and provide cover to the status quo.
Curiously, the ECP has felt no compulsion to prod them along in their work, even though the legal deadlines under which they are supposed to operate have long elapsed. The precedent that is being set will undermine future political transitions as well. The message being sent is that it does not matter whether electoral victory is secured through lawful or unlawful means, because the checks and balances meant to protect the public’s political rights can be rendered ineffective. This should alarm anyone who wishes to see Pakistan governed in accordance with the will of the public and not by the whims of a few powerful institutions and individuals.

The deaths were reported in Sialkot and Jhelum, with the former receiving 78 millimetres of rain — the highest in the province.
According to the Pakistan Meteorologi-cal Department (PMD), Sialkot  City received 78mm of rain, Lahore 43.4mm, Gujranwala 36.8mm, Chakwal  23mm, Attock 13.6mm, Mangla 12.2mm, Gujrat 10.6mm, Narowal 5.0mm,  Rawalakot 4.0mm, Islamabad Airport 3.9mm, and Mandi Bahauddin 0.5mm.
The Met Department said mainly hot and humid weather was expected in most parts of Punjab, but rain-wind/thundershower was expected at isolated places in northeastern Punjab, Potohar, Islamabad, upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and adjoining hilly areas on Sunday.
According to provincial figures issued on Aug 8, 164 people have died and 82 have sustained injuries during the ongoing monsoon season that has also killed 121 head of cattle. About 216 houses were also destroyed across the province.

Sialkot receives 78mm rainfall, the highest in the province

In Lahore, the rain started at 1:30pm and continued till 4:30pm. According to the Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa), 86mm rain was reported at Pani Wala Talab, 85mm at Farrukhabad, 83mm at Lakshmi Chowk, 81mm at Nishtar Town, 60mm at Gulberg, 57mm at Chowk Nakhuda, 45mm at Iqbal Town, 44mm at Johar Town, 43mm at Samanabad and less than 30mm at Gulshan-i-Ravi, Qurtaba Chowk, Jail Road, and Tajpura.
Due to rain, water accumulated in Model Town, Kot Lakhpat, Peco Road, Township, Green Town, Factory Area, Muslim Town, Garden Town and adjacent localities. The water was also accumulated in Nishtar Park Sports Complex, which caused the cancellation of ‘Independence Family Fun Race’, which was planned in the evening. The rain also caused electricity problems in the city as more than 120 feeders in different areas had tripped.
Meanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a warning about low-level flooding in rivers in the province. According to the latest update, Tarbela Dam is currently 96 per cent full with its water level standing at 1546.00 feet, while Mangla Dam is 63pc full at 1205.25 feet.
On the Indus River, low-level flooding has been reported at Chashma Barrage, while flows at other key barrages — including Tarbela, Kalabagh, Taunsa, Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri remain normal. Similarly, the Jhelum, Sutlej, and Kabul Rivers are flowing at expected levels without any immediate threat.
The Chenab River and its adjoining streams are also stable, with no unusual rise in water levels. However, the Ravi River is experiencing low-level flooding in the Basantar Nullah, though the main river’s flow remains normal.
Meanwhile, the hill torrents in Koh-i-Suleman and Dera Ghazi Khan Division are currently dry, posing no flood risk. With the monsoon season in full swing, the director general of the Punjab PDMA advised citizens to exercise extreme caution, especially near water bodies.
Section 144 has been imposed along rivers, canals, and streams to prevent accidents, and people have been strictly warned against swimming or bathing in these areas. Authorities have assured the public that all necessary measures are in place to handle any emergency, but residents in low-lying areas should stay alert for further updates.

Judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangiri told reporters that charges against some of the 20 suspects were dropped and they had been released, though he did not provide a specific number.
“The judiciary will show no leniency toward spies and agents of the Zionist regime, and with firm rulings, will make an example of them all,” Mr Jahangiri was quoted as saying by Iranian media.
He said full details wo­­u­ld be made public once the investigations were complete.
The announcement comes just days after Iran executed a nuclear scientist convicted of spying for Israel.
On Wednesday, state media reported that Rouzbeh Vadi was executed for passing on information about another nuclear scientist who was killed during Israeli air strikes on Iran in June.
 
 

Executions of Iranians convicted of spying for Israel have significantly increased this year, with at least eight death sentences carried out in recent months.
The arrests follow a recent, intense conflict between the two nations.
In June, Israel carried out 12 days of air strikes on Iran.
Tehran responded with barrages of missiles and drones on Israel.

• British police arrest 365 people for backing pro-Palestine group
GAZA STRIP: Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 37 people were killed by Israeli fire on Saturday, including 30 civilians who were waiting to collect aid.
Civil defence spokesman Mah­mud Bassal told AFP that 12 people were killed and nearly 200 wounded when Israeli forces opened fire on them as they gathered near a border crossing in northern Gaza that has been used for aid deliveries.
Six more people were killed and 30 wounded after Israeli troops targeted civilians assembling near an aid point in central Gaza, he said.
Strikes in central Gaza also resulted in multiple casualties, according to Bassal, while a drone attack near the southern city of Khan Yunis killed at least three people and wounded several others.
Media restrictions in Gaza and difficulties accessing swathes of the territory mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence and the Israeli military.
Thousands of Palestinians congregate daily near food distribution points in Gaza, including four managed by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.
Since launching in late May, its operations have been marred by almost-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on those waiting to collect aid.
 
 

Israeli restrictions on the entry of supplies into Gaza since the start of the war nearly two years ago have led to shortages of food and essential supplies, including medicine and fuel, which hospitals require to power their generators.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faces mounting pressure to secure a ceasefire to bring the territory’s more than two million people back from the brink of famine and free the prisoners held by Hamas.
But early Friday, the Israeli security cabinet approved plans to launch major operations to seize Gaza City, triggering a wave of outrage across the globe.
Despite the backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, Netanyahu has remained defiant over the decision.
Hamas has slammed the plan to expand the fighting as a “new war crime”.
UK police arrest protesters
Meanwhile, police in London arrested at least 365 people Saturday for supporting Palestine Action, at the latest and largest protest backing the group since the government banned it last month under anti-terror laws.
The Metropolitan Police said it made the hundreds of arrests, thought to be one of the highest ever at a single protest in the UK capital, for “supporting a proscribed organisation”.
 
 

It also arrested seven for other offences including assaults on officers, though none were seriously injured, it added.
A group called Defend Our Juries, which organised Saturday’s protests and previous demonstrations agai­nst the ban, said “unprecedented numbers” had risked “arrest and possible imprisonment” to “defend this country’s ancient liberties”.
“We will keep going. Our numbers are already growing for the next wave of action in September,” it added.
Attendees began massing near parliament at lunchtime bearing signs saying “oppose genocide, support Palestine Action” and other slogans, and waving Palestinian flags.
As police moved in on the demonstrators, they applauded those being arrested and shouted “shame on you” at officers.
“Let them arrest us all,” said Richard Bull, 42, a wheelchair-user in attendance.
The London force noted some of those there were onlookers or not visibly supporting the group.
NGOs opposed
The Met police also detailed how the hundreds arrested were taken to temporary “prisoner processing” points, where their details were confirmed and they were either instantly bailed or taken into custody elsewhere.
Amnesty International UK Chief Executive Sacha Deshmukh wrote to Met Police chief Mark Rowley this week urging restraint be exercised when policing people holding placards expressing support for Palestine Action.
A UK court challenge against the decision to proscribe Palestine Action will be heard later this year.

Initially, the anti-terror operation had been postponed after both sides agreed to a ceasefire until the conflict was completely resolved  thro­ugh talks.
The failure of the peace talks has also plunged the local population into fear and a state of uncertainty. Accor­ding to reports, a number of families from 16 areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil left their homes for peaceful areas in the district on Saturday. The reports added that more families from the said areas were expected to leave their homes today.
“The collapse of negotiations between members of the Bajaur Aman Jirga and militant leaders, aimed at convincing them to leave the region peacefully, has left no option but to resume Operation Sarbakaf to neutralise militants in the region, who pose a significant threat to peace and people’s lives,” the sources added.

Jirga leader says dialogue with militants for their return hit snag due to ‘some issues’

On Friday night, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, head of the 50-strong Bajaur jirga, told reporters that the talks with militants “concluded without desired results owing to the development of a serious deadlock over some key issues necessary to resolve the conflict peacefully”. He was talking to reporters after separate meetings with militants’ leaders and high-ups held on Friday evening.
 
 

“We (members of the Bajaur Amn Jirga) have tried our best with great sincerity and commitment to make the talks with militant leaders a success by convincing them to return peacefully to Afghanistan…but unfort­­unately, we couldn’t succeed in our mission due to the development of a serious deadlock on some main issues,” Mr Rashid said while sharing the details of the seventh round of talks. He did not elaborate on the issues that stalled the dialogue.
According to the jirga leader, there would be no further negotiations with militant leaders on the issue until the deadlock was resolved. Accompanied by all jirga members, including PTI’s local MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman and former local MNA Gul Zafar Khan, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid appealed to both sides, the security forces and militants, to show tolerance and refrain from fighting, as it was causing suffering among the local people.
However, he told reporters that both sides had assured the jirga that civilians and their properties would be spared in the event of any fighting in the region. He said the jirga would remain functional and work with local residents to devise an action plan in case the residents and their properties were affected in any potential conflict between the security forces and terrorists. Mr Rashid said the jirga members would resume their activities in the larger interest of Bajaur and its people after a meeting with the Khyber Pakht­unkhwa chief minister in Peshawar on Saturday. There had been no statement about the meeting by the time this report went to press.

A three-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and including Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, will take up the matter on Tuesday.
The apex court had previously adjourned the proceedings due to unavailability of Salman Safdar, senior counsel for the ex-premier.
In his appeals, the incarcerated PTI leader claimed that the LHC on June 24 denied post-arrest bail to him in eight cases related to May 9 violence, including attacks on Askari Tower at Liberty Chowk, PML-N offices in Model Town, Shadman police station, the burning of police vehicles near the Lahore corps commander’s residence and violence at Sherpao Bridge. The appellant said he moved the LHC after an anti-terrorism court had denied bail to him in the eight cases on Nov 27, 2024.

CJP-led bench put off previous proceedings due to unavailability of ex-PM’s lawyer

He said he was accused of conspiring and abetting violence on May 9, whereas, at the time of the alleged offence, he was in the custody of National Accountability Bureau (NAB). Therefore, his involvement in the May 9 violence was “impossible”, the appeal arg­ued, while reminding that the Supreme Court had already held that the case of an abettor who was not present at the scene of occurrence stands on a lower legal footing than that of a principal accused.
According to the set of appeals, the PTI founder had been subjected to an “unprecedented campaign of political victimisation” since his ouster as prime minister in 2022. The SC was informed that the cases were yet another attempt by the state and the police to “implicate” him in a criminal matter, based solely on “vague and unsupported allegations of abetment” as the prosecution had no “convincing” evidence connecting Mr Khan to the alleged offence.
After Mr Khan’s “unlawful and invalid” arrest from the premises of the Islamabad High Court on May 9, 2023, multiple FIRs were registered in Lahore and Islamabad, it contended, adding none of the complaints contained any specific allegations or details regarding the purported conspiracy.
At a later stage in these cases, the prosecution introduced supplementary statements by police officials in an apparent attempt to “falsely implicate” Mr Khan, it added. If, as per the prosecution’s claim, the police allegedly knew about the conspiracy to orchestrate violence as early as May 7, why did they not take any action to prevent the attacks, the appeal questioned. This was “highly illogical” and further exposed the “malafide and politically motivated nature of the proceedings”, it claimed.
The appeal alleged Mr Khan had been “maliciously implicated” in these cases as part of a “calculated and politically motivated design to prolong his incarceration”, harass him and tarnish his public image.
Mr Khan’s arrest was “never genuinely required” in cases pertaining to May 9 violence, it pleaded, adding that police took no action to arrest Mr Khan for over five months even after his bail applications were dismissed by an anti-terrorism court in Lahore. Despite knowing Mr Khan’s whereabouts — Adiala jail where he was confined — the police “made no meaningful attempt to effect his arrest”, it argued.
“This lack of urgency or interest on part of the investigating agency strongly supports the inference that the arrest was not necessitated by the merits of the case, but rather was a tool of oppression, thereby further justifying the grant of post-arrest bail,” the appeal said.
According to the appeal, the LHC decision to deny bail to Mr Khan was based on “engineered and fabricated evidence” comprising stale, discredited, and delayed statements of police officials recorded long after the occurrence, without any plausible explanation for the inordinate delay.
It argued that the LHC while rejecting the bail plea also failed to appreciate that the prosecution has been consistently shifting its stance like a pendulum, by introducing materially improved versions of the case narrative.
 
 

Each new version was introduced only after the preceding one failed to withstand before the courts of law, thereby rendering the prosecution’s case doubtful and entitling the petitioner to the benefit of further inquiry, the appeal pleaded. These material contradictions and afterthoughts clearly made out a case falling within the ambit of Section 497(2) of the criminal procedure code, warranting the grant of bail, the SC was requested.

ISLAMABAD: Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has invited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to the Future Inve­stment Initiative Conf­erence to be hosted by Riyadh in October.
According to PM Office, Ambassador of the King­dom of Saudi Arabia Naw­af bin Said Al-Malky on Saturday called on Prime Minister Shehbaz and handed over a signed invitation letter from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud to participate in the 9th Future Investment Initi­a­tives Forum to be held from Oct 27 to 30.
While accepting the gracious invitation exten­ded to him, the prime minister conveyed his warm greetings and respectful regards for the custodian of the two holy mosques on King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, as well as to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Recent regional developments were also discussed during the warm and cordial meeting.
Earlier, the PM said Pakistan welcomed the historic peace agreement signed between Azer­bai­jan and Armenia at the White House un­der the auspices of US President Trump.
“This landmark development marks the dawn of a new era of peace, stability, and cooperation in the South Caucasus, a region that has endured decades of conflict and human sufferings. We congratulate President Ilham Aliyev and the people of Azerbaijan on this historic agreement that reflects wisdom, foresight and sagacity in charting a course for a peaceful future for their region,” the PM posted on X account.
 






He said Pakistan had always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan, and stood with them at this proud moment of their history.
“We also appreciate the facilitation role of the United States, under President Donald Trump, in bringing the two sides together and securing an agreement that opens new avenues for trade, connectivity, and regional integration. It is our hope that this spirit of dialogue will serve as an example for other regions facing protracted conflicts,” he said.
Separately, the prime minister in a meeting with the National Party head said progress and prosperity of Balochistan and its people was among the top priorities of the federal government.
During an interaction with NP President Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, who called on him, the PM said the government was committed to the provision of opportunities for education and livelihoods to the youth. Dr Baloch thanked the premier for the efforts towards progress and prosperity of the province.  Adviser to the PM Dr Touqeer Shah was also present on the occasion.

• Three soldiers, woman martyred in spate of attacks in Lakki Marwat
QUETTA / LAKKI MARWAT: Security forces have thwarted yet another terrorist infiltration attempt in the Sambaza area of Balochistan’s Zhob district, eliminating 14 terrorists, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the latest action brings the total number of terrorists killed in the last two days to 47, following successful operations by security forces in Sambaza. This adds to the earlier neutralisation of 33 militants.
“Following the successful engagements by the security forces in the general area Sam­baza, Zhob district, on Aug 7-8 night, during which 33 Khwarij were sent to hell; on the night of Aug 8-9, a deliberate sanitisation operation was conducted in the surrounding areas of Sambaza along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border,” the ISPR said.
“During the conduct of the operation, 14 more Indian sponsored Khwarij were hunted down and successfully neutralised. Wea­p­ons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the killed Khwarij,” the ISPR said in a statement.
“The number of Khwarij killed in two days anti-infiltration operation has risen to 47,” it said, adding that the security forces “remain committed to securing the nation’s frontiers and thwarting attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Pakistan”.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday praised the security forces for eliminating 47 militants during the last two days.
 
 

The president observed that it was the biggest success of the security forces, the President’s Secretariat said in a statement, according to APP.
He reiterated the government’s resolve to eradicate terrorism, stressing that the nation stands united behind the security forces in their fight against militancy.
PM Shehbaz also praised the forces’ timely actions, which successfully foiled the militants’ infiltration attempt. “The entire nation is standing with the security forces in the fight against terrorism,” he said, reaffirming his commitment to the eradication of terrorism in all its forms from Pakistan, the PM Office said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also paid tribute to the security forces, commending their professionalism and swift actions.
“The nation looks with admiration at the successes of the security forces against the terrorists of the Indian conspiracy. The security forces have brought the Indian-sponsored terrorists involved in spreading chaos in Balochistan to an exemplary end,” he said in a post on X.
 






In May, the government officially designated all terrorist organisations operating in Balo­chistan as “Fitna al-Hindustan”, aiming to highlight India’s alleged role in fomenting instability and violence in the region.
Lakki Marwat attacks
In a series of militant attacks across Lakki Marwat district, three soldiers and a woman were martyred, while three others, including two soldiers, sustained injuries, police and rescue officials said on Saturday.
The first incident took place on Friday evening in the Tatta Bash­ikhel area, where Merajuddin, a clerk in the Frontier Corps (FC) Balochistan, who had been on leave for the past week, was attacked.
“The FC official and his cousin Fareedullah were sitting outside their home when two armed suspects wearing masks suddenly app­eared from the eastern side,” a police official said, quoting an FIR.
The attackers opened fire as Meraj and Fareed attempted to flee towards the house. Meraj’s wife, Nusrat Bibi, rushed out upon hearing the gunshots and attempted to shield her husband, but was also gunned down by the assailants.
Both Meraj and Nusrat were gravely wounded, and the FC personnel succumbed to his injuries on the spot, while his wife died en route to a hospital in Bannu.
Following the attack, a large police contingent was dispatched to the rural area to search for the assailants.
In another attack on Saturday, a soldier of the Frontier Corps, Sepoy Jehangir Khan, was martyred in the Mir Hazar Khanzadkhel area.
According to officials, Jehangir and his cousin Asmatullah were grazing cattle when two armed motorcyclists wearing masks opened fire on them. Jehangir was killed on the spot and his cousin was injured. The body and the injured were later transferred to the District Headquarters Hospital at Tajazai.
In yet another attack, a former soldier of the Pakistan Army, Habibullah Khan, 55, was shot dead by a group of seven militants near a rainwater course in the Ghazikhel area. The attackers, who fled towards the Karmukhel Mountain, also took away an AK-47 assault rifle from the martyred soldier.
In a separate incident, two soldiers were injured when their vehicle was struck by an improvised explosive device (IED) near Abdulkhel on Saturday.
 
 

Officials said that the roadside bomb, planted by “terrorists from the Fitna al-Khawarij group”, exploded as the soldiers were on patrol. The injured soldiers, Mohammad Salim and Mohammad Malook, were immediately shifted to the Government City Hospital. Rescue 1122 dispatched medical teams and ambulances to the scene.
Authorities later cordoned off the area and launched a combing operation in an effort to capture the attackers.
Bannu’s Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan visited the Tatta Bashikhel area to offer his condolences to the family of the martyred FC official Merajuddin. He expressed his sorrow for the loss and assured the family that the perpetrators would be brought to justice.
“The martyred security personnel are the pride of the nation and the supreme sacrifices offered by them will not go in vain,” he said.
Mr Sajjad also expressed his heartfelt condolences and sympathies with the family of martyred policeman Rukh Niaz Khan in the Kalan Tughalkhel area of Bannu.
Constable Khan had embraced martyrdom in a fierce gun battle with terrorists in the Fatehkhel area of Bannu last week.

The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. In February, nearly 62 per cent of the total terrorism-related deaths in the country occurred in Balochistan.
Speaking during a conference in Quetta, CM Bugti emphasised that peace was steadily returning to Balochistan and reaffirmed the state’s unwavering support for its people against forces seeking to destabilise the province.
Bugti described Balochistan as the heart of Pakistan, without which the nation was incomplete. He lamented the lack of attention given to the province’s positive realities and the limited recognition of its voices.
The chief minister condemned the spread of anti-state narratives.
“Balochistan faces challenges, but poverty and underdevelopment are no justification for rebellion,” he said.
 


The chief minister praised Balochistan as a model of interfaith harmony, where diverse sects and religious communities lived peacefully.
Bugti stressed that after August 14, 1947, every citizen’s foremost identity was being Pakistani above ethnic, tribal or linguistic affiliations.
He also warned of social media’s role in spreading misinformation and inciting unrest, adding, “Our society wasn’t prepared for this. People share unverified content without thinking, fueling confusion and division.”
He appealed to religious scholars, community elders, and social leaders to counter this trend.
While affirming the right to peaceful protest, Bugti declared that the era of indefinite road blockades was over.
“We welcome dialogue with those willing to lay down arms and rejoin the national fold. But those who spill innocent blood will face the full might of the state.”
He highlighted the government’s outreach efforts through jirgas and public gatherings aimed at engaging youth and strengthening their connection with the state.
He concluded by thanking the conference organisers for promoting unity and patriotism.
“The Balochistan government will continue to support such initiatives, whether in Quetta or remote areas. This country is the dream of our forefathers and part of our faith. The sun of peace will rise in Balochistan,” he concluded.
On Friday, Balochistan government spokesman Shahid Rind said that mobile data services in the province were suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”.
Also on Friday, CM Bugti reaffirmed his unwavering commitment to equal development of all 36 districts and youth empowerment during a series of meetings with public delegations and local notables at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat.</p><small>2025-08-09 18:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09214649c5369f1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929752/ptis-zartaj-gul-ejaz-chaudhry-appeal-to-lhc-against-atc-convictions-in-may-9-riots-cases' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Zartaj Gul, Ejaz Chaudhry appeal to LHC against ATC convictions in May 9 riots cases</strong></a><br><p>PTI leaders Zartaj Gul and Ejaz Chaudhry filed appeals in the Lahore High Court (LHC) on Saturday against their convictions by anti-terrorism courts (ATC) in May 9 riots cases.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.
On July 31 this year, an ATC in Faisalabad sentenced PTI leaders, including Gul, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the riots. The Election Commission of Pakistan later disqualified her and other PTI lawmakers following their convictions. Chaudhry was convicted in another May 9 case by an ATC in Lahore on July 22 and sentenced to 10 years in prison.
Gul filed an appeal against her conviction and sentencing in the LHC today. A division bench of the LHC will hear the case on Monday.
The appeal was filed through Gul’s lawyers, Barrister Ali Zafar and Muhammad Hussain, and pleaded the court to set aside her conviction and acquit her in the case.
It said that Gul was not nominated in the case or “found physically participant in the occurrence”. It added that no justification was provided by the prosecution for her being included through the supplementary statement, which it claimed cast doubt on the authenticity of the occurrence which had not been considered at the trial stage.
It stated that the ATC passed the “impugned judgment … in a hasty and slipshod manner”, based on three witnesses who had admitted in cross-examination that they had not nominated her but she was nevertheless convicted on their statements with a hefty punishment.
“The prosecution has failed to make out a case for such a punishment,” the petition argued, adding that the witnesses themselves had many times misstated and “cheated” the trial court with additions and deletions in their statements making their testimonies unreliable, but ultimately all exonerated the appellant.
“The other ATC court at Sargodha has disbelieved the same prosecution witnesses … but this is ignored in making (the) impugned decision,” it said.
It also stated that no evidence for conspiracy had been brought forward on the case file, challenging her punishment under section 120-B of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The petition pleaded that as “the prosecution also failed to establish the involvement of the appellant in the occurrence and instigation/abetment beyond the shadow of doubt, then there were no reasons to award punishment to the innocent appellant.”
It stated that the judgment was against “facts and law and resulted in (a) misreading of justice” and that, being passed hastily, material parts of evidence were not considered “despite the facts that the prosecution failed to adduce unimpeachable evidence and there was (every) chance of false implication”.
In particular, it cited the lack of material evidence to establish the intention to abet, instigate and conspire to facilitate the other accused parties. According to the petition, the investigation was “biased” and “flawed” but this was ignored by the court. It further criticised that more weight was given to witness statements than evidence by the court, failing to “properly appreciate” the prosecution’s evidence.
It added that 77 co-accused had been acquitted based on the same evidence, while Gul was convicted without valid reasoning.
The petition called for the judgment to be set aside as the case had not been proven “beyond the shadow of a doubt” due to a lack of unimpeachable evidence, adding that the evidence contained contradictions. It called the judgment of the court “arbitrary, capricious, indiscrete, non-speaking and without lawful authority based on no evidence”.
The petition noted that Gul was seeking leave from the court to advance further grounds at the time of argument.
Meanwhile, Chaudhry filed two petitions in the LHC through Advocate Mian Ali Ashfaq.
Chaudhry pleaded the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail.
He further requested the court in the second petition to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.
ATC reserves verdicts on two May 9 cases involving Chaudhry, Rashid, Qureshi, others
Separately, the Lahore ATC reserved its verdicts in two arson cases related to the May 9 riots, in which PTI senior leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Chaudhry and Omar Cheema are accused, with the judge slated to announce the decisions on August 11.
According to Advocates Rana Mudassar and Rana Maroof, who represented the PTI leaders during the hearing, the trials in the cases of burning vehicles outside Rahat Bakery and arson near Shadman Nazar were completed and ATC Judge Manzar Ali Gul reserved his verdict.
They said the verdicts would be issued on Monday.
They said a total of 25 accused were named in the Rahat Bakery case, while seven accused were declared absconders. They added that the trial of 12 accused was completed in the Shadman Nazar police station arson case and five accused were in custody in this case, while one accused had died.
The lawyers said Qureshi, Dr Rashid, Chaudhry, Cheema, Mian Mahmoodur Rashid and other accused were present in the courtroom.</p><small>2025-08-09 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09223351125aee5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929782/tony-hemming-resigns-as-pakistan-cricket-boards-chief-curator' target='_blank'><strong>Tony Hemming resigns as Pakistan Cricket Board’s chief curator</strong></a><br><p>Australia’s Tony Hemming has resigned from his position as the chief curator, the Pakistan Cricket Board announced on Saturday.
He was appointed as chief curator in July last year as no extension was given to previous chief curator Agha Zahid.
“One of Hemming’s immediate tasks will be to prepare pitches for the upcoming five ICC World Test Championship matches against Bangladesh [two in August/September] and England [three in October].

The spacecraft carrying US astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japan’s Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov splashed down off California’s coast at 8:44am local time (8:34pm PKT).
Their return marks the end of the 10th crew rotation mission to the space station under Nasa’s Commercial Crew Program, which was created to succeed the Space Shuttle era by partnering with private industry.
The Dragon capsule of billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX company detached from the International Space Station (ISS) at 2215 GMT (3:15am PKT) on Friday.
The capsule’s dizzying, 17-hour drop back down to Earth was slowed when it re-entered the atmosphere, then further reined in by the deployment of huge parachutes.
After the capsule splashed down, it was recovered by a SpaceX ship and hoisted aboard. Only then were the astronauts able to breathe Earth’s air again, for the first time in months.
The astronaut team, known as Crew-10, conducted numerous scientific experiments during their time on the space station, including studying plant growth and how cells react to gravity.
Their launch into space in March allowed two US astronauts to return home after being unexpectedly stuck on board the space station for nine months.
When they launched in June 2024, Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams were only supposed to spend eight days in space on a test of the Boeing Starliner’s first crewed flight.
However, the spaceship developed propulsion problems and was deemed unfit to fly back, leaving them stranded in space.
Nasa announced this week that Wilmore has decided to retire after 25 years of service at the US space agency.
Last week, US astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japan’s Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov boarded the ISS for a six-month mission.</p><small>2025-08-09 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/091809267c52864.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929745/defence-minister-rubbishes-indian-air-chiefs-comical-claims-of-downing-6-pakistani-aircraft-in-may-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Defence minister rubbishes Indian air chief’s ‘comical’ claims of downing 6 Pakistani aircraft in May conflict</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday rubbished what he said were “implausible” and “comical” claims by the Indian Air Force chief that the country had shot down five Pakistani fighter jets and one other military aircraft during clashes in May.
The comments are the first such statement by the Indian side three months after its worst military conflict in decades with its neighbour. During the conflict, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7, later stating that figure as six. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
Speaking at an event in the southern city of Bengaluru, Indian Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh claimed: “We have at least five fighters confirmed killed, and one large aircraft,” adding that the large aircraft, which could be a surveillance plane, was shot down at a distance of 300 kilometres.
He alleged that most of the Pakistani aircraft were downed by India’s Russian-made S-400 surface-to-air missile system. He cited electronic tracking data as confirmation of the strikes.
 






Singh did not mention the type of fighter jets that were downed, but claimed that airstrikes also hit an additional surveillance plane and “a few F16” fighters that were parked in hangars at two air bases in Sindh and Punjab. “This is actually the largest ever recorded surface-to-air kill,” he insisted.
Responding to the claims in a post on X, the defence minister said: “The belated assertions made by the Indian Air Force chief regarding alleged destruction of Pakistani aircraft during Operation Sindoor are as implausible as they are ill-timed.
“It is also ironic how senior Indian military officers are being used as the faces of monumental failure caused by strategic shortsightedness of Indian politicians. For three months, no such claims were voiced — while Pakistan, in the immediate aftermath, presented detailed technical briefings to the international media, and independent observers recorded widespread acknowledgment of the loss of multiple Indian aircraft, including Rafales, by sources ranging from world leaders, senior Indian politicians to foreign intelligence assessments.”
Asif said that “not a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed” by India, adding that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while “swiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action”.
 






He added that the losses on the Line of Control for Indian armed forces were “disproportionately heavier” as well.
“If the truth is in question, let both sides open their aircraft inventories to independent verification — though we suspect this would lay bare the reality India seeks to obscure. Wars are not won by falsehoods but by moral authority, national resolve and professional competence.
“Such comical narratives, crafted for domestic political expediency, increase the grave risks of strategic miscalculation in a nuclearised environment,” he warned.
The defence minister iterated that every violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would invite “swift, surefire and proportionate response, and responsibility for any ensuing escalation will rest entirely with strategically blind leaders who gamble with South Asia’s peace for fleeting political gains”.
Former envoy Dr Maleeha Lodhi said the Indian air chief’s claim was “laughable”, noting that it took him “several months to count the planes to make this ridiculous assertion!”
 






Meanwhile, Indian Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said when questioned about the matter: “The question we have after today’s information … when we had such a strong army and we were advancing then under whose pressure did you stop Operation Sindoor?”
 






American South Asia expert Michael Kugelman opined that “regardless of whether true or not, the timing of these claims, with US-India ties in crisis, is easy to understand.”
 






Pakistan, with the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) primarily operating Chinese-made jets and US F-16s, has previously denied that India downed any aircraft during the May 7-10 fighting between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
New Delhi had previously claimed it had downed “a few planes”. United States President Donald Trump has echoed the figure of “five jets” shot down during the military confrontation, albeit without specifying which side’s craft he was referring to.
 
 

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has faced scathing criticism from opposition parties for its lack of “political will to fight” during the May clashes and “failures” to prevent the Pahalgam attack.
The May conflict was sparked by New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, which were without evidence and strongly refuted by Pakistan, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. After the May 7 combat and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
France’s air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The Indian Air Force has not commented on those claims.
Days after the air combat, The Washington Post, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, reported that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.
According to The Wire, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in June, acknowledged that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.
During his presentation at the event, Kumar had acknowledged the loss of Indian planes. According to Kumar, Indian fighter jets were “operating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems”, The Wire reported.
“This self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,” the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer.
India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.
Reuters interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.
The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.
“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.
“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.</p><small>2025-08-09 17:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618063-pti-mna-zartaj-gul-challenges-10-year-jail-sentence-in-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leader Zartaj Gul moves LHC against conviction in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

It added that formal work on the project would now commence. The prime minister had announced during his recent visit to GB that Ecnec would soon approve the 100MW power plants.
The report said that Central Development Working Party had already approved the project and it would benefit the districts of Astore, Darel, Tangir, Diamer, Ghanche, Ghizer, Gilgit, Hunza, Ishkoman, Nagar, Roundu, Skardu and Shigar.
It added that Skardu district would be provided with 18.96MW of electricity in the first phase; the districts of Hunza, Gilgit and Diamer would be supplied with 6MW, 28MW and 13MW of electricity, respectively, in the second phase and the remaining districts would receive 16.1MW of electricity in the third phase.
The project is set to be completed within three years at a total cost of Rs24,957 million.
In June, protest demonstrations were held in several areas of GB against massive loadshedding and power outages — leading to blockades on main roads and the Karakoram Highway. The issue was raised in the GB Assembly by opposition lawmakers, who said the crisis has made life unbearable for people.</p><small>2025-08-09 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09132240eea0739.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929735/armenia-azerbaijan-truce-pakistan-again-hails-trumps-efforts-for-peace' target='_blank'><strong>Armenia-Azerbaijan truce: Pakistan again hails Trump’s efforts for peace</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday hailed US President Donald Trump’s peace efforts following his role in brokering the Armenia-Azerbaijan peace deal.
A day earlier, Azerbaijan and Armenia signed an initial US-brokered peace agreement during a meeting with Trump, a deal aimed at boosting economic ties between the two countries after decades of conflict.
“Pakistan welcomes the historic peace agreement signed between the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Republic of Armenia at the White House Summit under the auspices of US President Donald J Trump,” the premier wrote in a statement on X.
He congratulated both countries on “charting a course for a peaceful future for their region”, stating: “Pakistan has always stood by the brotherly nation of Azerbaijan and we stand with them at this proud moment of their history.”
PM Shehbaz continued: “We also appreciate the facilitation role of the United States, under President Donald Trump, in bringing the two sides together and securing an agreement that opens new avenues for trade, connectivity, and regional integration.”
“It is our hope that this spirit of dialogue will serve as an example for other regions facing protracted conflicts,” he added.
He also said that the development marks the “dawn of a new era of peace, stability, and cooperation in the South Caucasus”, which has endured “conflict and human suffering” for decades.
 






Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also appreciated Trump’s role in “facilitating this breakthrough” and congratulated Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov.
In a post on X, he wrote, “Today marks a truly historic moment as Azerbaijan and Armenia take a decisive step towards resolving a bitter conflict that has lasted for over three decades.
“May this milestone pave the way in the Caucasus for a future free of the painful shadows of the past, and one built on peace, stability, and hope,” he added.
 






Highest aspiration is to bring peace: Trump
Separately, Trump said that both countries were “committing to stop all fighting forever, open up commerce, travel and diplomatic relations, and respect each other’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”, while speaking to reporters alongside Azerbaijan’s Aliyev and Armenian PM Nikol Pashinyan.
Trump said the US signed separate deals with each country to expand cooperation on energy, trade and technology, including artificial intelligence. Details were not released.
Both leaders praised Trump for helping to end the conflict and said they would nominate him for the Nobel Peace Prize.
 


Trump has tried to present himself as a global peacemaker in the first months of his second term. The White House credits him with brokering a ceasefire between Cambodia and Thailand and sealing peace deals between India and Pakistan, and Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Following the announcement, Trump stated: “As president, my highest aspiration is to bring peace and stability to the world.”
“Today’s signing follows our success with India and Pakistan. They were going at it. They were going at it big. And, they were great leaders that came together just prior to what would have been a tremendous conflict, a nuclear conflict probably.”
Meanwhile, Russia said that the draft peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan was “positive” and that it hoped it would contribute to the peace in the Caucasus region bordering it.
“The meeting of the leaders of the South Caucasus republics in Washington, mediated by the American side, deserves a positive assessment. We hope that this step will help advance the peace agenda,” foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said.
Trump has repeatedly claimed — in contrast to India’s stance — that US intervention prevented a “bad nuclear war” between India and Pakistan following their most intense military confrontation in decades.
Tensions between the two countries escalated after the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly denied the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before a ceasefire on May 10.</p><small>2025-08-09 14:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/09172745451df98.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929757/thai-soldiers-injured-by-landmine-near-cambodia-amid-fragile-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Thai soldiers injured by landmine near Cambodia amid fragile ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>Three Thai soldiers were injured by a landmine on Saturday while patrolling a border area near Cambodia, the Thai army said in a statement, days after the two neighbours agreed to a detailed ceasefire following a violent five-day conflict last month.
One soldier lost a foot and two others were injured after one of them stepped on a landmine as they patrolled an area between Thailand’s Sisaket and Cambodia’s Preah Vihear provinces.
“The soldiers are being treated at a hospital,” the army said.
Thailand said the incident took place within its territory and in an area recently cleared of landmines. It added that it would lodge a complaint against Cambodia for violating a treaty that bans the use of landmines and for infringing Thai sovereignty, the Thai foreign ministry said in a statement.
Both Thailand and Cambodia are signatories to the Ottawa Convention against landmines.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said on Saturday that it “has yet to receive clear confirmation from Cambodian frontline forces concerning the explosion”, adding that its army has been strictly respecting the spirit of the ceasefire.
The incident is the third time in a few weeks that Thai soldiers have been injured by mines while patrolling along the border. Two previous incidents led to the downgrading of diplomatic relations and triggered five days of violent clashes.
 
 

The Southeast Asian neighbours were engaged in deadly border clashes from July 24-28, in the worst fighting between the two in more than a decade. The exchanges of artillery fire and jet fighter sorties claimed at least 43 lives and left over 300,000 people displaced on both sides.
A fragile ceasefire has been holding since Thailand and Cambodia agreed on Thursday to allow observers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to inspect disputed border areas to ensure hostilities do not resume.
Bangkok earlier accused Cambodia of planting landmines on the Thai side of the disputed border that injured soldiers on July 16 and July 23. Phnom Penh denied it had placed any new mines and said the soldiers had veered off agreed routes and triggered old landmines left from its decades of war.</p><small>2025-08-09 14:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618054-asif-rejects-indian-air-force-chiefs-implausible-ill-timed-claims-on-downing-of-pakistani-jets' target='_blank'><strong>Asif dismisses IAF chief's 'implausible, ill-timed' claims of downing Pakistani jets</strong></a><br><p>

Modi’s first attempt came in 2014 through a high-level engagement with China came. The Indian premier rolled out the red carpet for China’s President Xi Jinping in his home town, organising an intimate riverside dinner in Ahmedabad.
The meeting at the time focused on economic cooperation, with India seeking Chinese funding for an overhaul of its dilapidated railways and cooperation in nuclear energy.
However, the talks were overshadowed by a stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops along their shared border. “The flare-up in 2014 was the first of several acts of aggression that would ultimately leave Mr Modi embarrassed, his economy squeezed by the need to keep tens of thousands of Indian troops on a war footing high in the Himalayas for several years,” The New York Times said.
Subsequently, Modi steered towards the US direction. “Mr Modi developed such a bonhomie with US President Donald Trump in his first term that he broke with protocol to campaign for a second term for him at a stadium-packed event in Houston,” the outlet said, adding that the increasing alignment grew further after “the Biden administration looked past that partisan play to continue expanding relations with India, a bulwark against China”.
During a joint session of Congress last year, Modi remarked, “AI stands for ‘America and India’”, the report added.
India’s relations with the US have seemingly faltered during Trump’s second term.  Terming the recent trade tensions a “very public humiliation” of Modi, the outlet said that India was singled out for a whopping 50 per cent tariff, with the US citing India’s continued imports of Russian oil and calling India’s economy “dead”.
Trump also “stirred rancour among Indians” by giving Pakistan’s leadership an “equal footing” as he tried to settle the military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours earlier this year, the outlet said.
In June, Trump hosted Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the White House in the weeks following the military confrontation between India and Pakistan. This prompted a private diplomatic protest from India in a warning to Washington about risks to their bilateral ties while New Delhi is recalibrating relations with China as a hedge.
“All that has plunged India into a moment of soul-searching, exposing limitations to its power on the world stage despite its gargantuan size and growing economy,” The New York Times stated. The outlet also highlighted Modi’s acknowledgement this week that he might pay a “personal political price” for the trade dispute with the US.
Amid heightened tensions with the US, India has made moves indicating “increased activity toward warming ties with Beijing again”, the outlet said.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Friday welcomed Modi’s plan to visit China for the first time in seven years to participate in the upcoming Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. Last month, Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar made his first visit to Beijing since a deadly 2020 border clash between Indian and Chinese troops.
The outlet suggested that relations with China “remain strained” due to border disputes and China’s support for Pakistan during the recent military escalation, adding: “China, for its part, has been wary of New Delhi’s efforts to create a manufacturing alternative to China.”
It further noted Modi’s current engagement with Russia, saying, “Russia’s steadfastness as a partner is being talked up by officials in India. Mr Modi’s national security adviser was in Moscow this week to finalise details of a trip by Mr Putin to New Delhi.”
India’s aim to rise as an economic and diplomatic power “appears deflated by the sudden uncertainty”, according to The New York Times.
It said, “Stuck between two superpowers that have shown no hesitation to put India down in moments of friction, there is a growing sense among Indian officials and experts that the country will have to firmly return to its long-tested doctrine of ‘strategic autonomy’.”
This means that India was “on its own” and must “make do with a patchwork of contradictory and piecemeal ties, and avoid overcommitting to alliances”.
The outlet quoted Nirupama Rao, a former Indian ambassador to Beijing and Washington, who said that Trump’s punishing moves had upended “the strategic logic of a very consequential partnership” that had been carefully nurtured over more than two decades. “There will be ‘very pragmatic strategic recalibrations’ by New Delhi to protect its interests,” she said.
India’s growing economy allows its leaders breathing room, but it is still a moment of “deep introspection” for the country, Rao said, adding: “We have to draw our lessons from that and really focus on the national priorities and what we need to do to become strong and more influential.”</p><small>2025-08-09 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0915010960d4337.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1929746/pakistan-medical-and-dental-council-refutes-claims-of-80pc-fee-increase-for-mdcat-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Medical and Dental Council refutes claims of 80pc fee increase for MDCAT 2025</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) on Saturday refuted claims of a fee increase of 80 per cent for their colleges admission test, announcing that the test is scheduled for October 5 this year.
The PMDC is the national statutory organisation responsible for regulating the standards of medical and dental education throughout the country.
In a press release today, PMDC announced that the Medical and Dental Colleges Admission Test (MDCAT) was scheduled to be held on Sunday October 5, while addressing the concerns regarding the fee.
“It has come to the notice of the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) that there has been a misunderstanding regarding the MDCAT examination fee, which claims that it has increased by 80pc,” it said.
“PMDC would like to clarify that the fee for the MDCAT has increased modestly and gradually over the past years,” it added, noting that it was Rs8,000 in 2024 and is set at Rs9,000 for 2025 — the Rs1,000 increase marking an increment of only 12.5pc, not 80pc as had been circulated on social media.
It also said that the exam would be conducted by universities nominated by federal and provincial authorities, rather than by PMDC.
“However, PMDC as a regulator has developed a uniform syllabus for the MDCAT in consultation with all stakeholders,” it said, adding that it had also “invested heavily” in developing a question bank based on a common syllabus agreed upon by the provinces.
According to the statement, the council’s decision to revise the fee upon the request of the examination-conducting universities was due to the rising costs of paper printing, enhanced security protocols and logistical arrangements, as well as payments for examiners, invigilators, and administrative staff and to ensure adequate seating and facilities for candidates.
“Despite significant inflation and increasing operational costs, PMDC remains steadfast to affordability and fairness,” PMDC said, stressing that the council had taken a “balanced approach to ensure that the exam remains accessible to all candidates while maintaining quality and integrity in the testing process”.
It reaffirmed its commitment to “transparent, responsible, and merit-based admissions” to ensure equal opportunities for all aspiring medical and dental students.
The MDCAT will be conducted through the following universities: University of Health Sciences, Lahore for Punjab; Sukkur IBA University, Sukkur for Sindh; Khyber Medical University, Peshawar for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Bolan University of Medical and Health Sciences, Quetta for Balochistan; and Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University, Islamabad for Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan as well as PMDC’s international venue in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
Online registration for both local and international MDCAT candidates began yesterday and will close on August 25, 2025. After this date, late fees will be required for registration until the cutoff on September 1, 2025.
 
 

PMDC warned that candidates would have to “carefully select one city/centre for the MDCAT and fill out the application with all necessary requirements” otherwise the application would be rejected by the online system.
The statement added that the test would be a paper-based exam conducted in English, comprising 180 multiple choice questions with no negative marking. Of the 180 questions, 81 will be about biology, 45 chemistry, 36 physics, nine English, and nine logical reasoning.
It directed candidates to the exam’s syllabus available on their website, advising that candidates must complete their registration through mdcat.pmdc.pk. It warned that incomplete applications would not be accepted.
In June, the PMDC issued a decision to restrict MDCAT candidates to their respective provinces, sparking controversy as parents feared the decision could compromise the safety and well-being of students, many of whom had seldom traveled to their native areas.
The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA), the representative body of doctors, rejected the decision, demanding that the notification be withdrawn. The PMA argued that the policy would disproportionately disadvantage students from less developed areas and limit accessibility to medical education.</p><small>2025-08-09 10:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618023-security-forces-kill-47-india-backed-terrorists-in-two-day-zhob-operations' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 47 India-backed terrorists in two-day Zhob operations</strong></a><br><p>
