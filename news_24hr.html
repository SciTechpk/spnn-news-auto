The FIR was filed by the woman’s father and named the construction project’s manager and safety management. The FIR — available with Dawn — was filed at the Bhatti Gate police station under Section 322 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code. In the complaint, the deceased woman’s father stated that his son received a call from his son-in-law informing him about the incident.
“Upon receiving this information, I, my son … my son-in-law … and my friend … reached Data Darbar at about 2:30am,” the complainant stated in the FIR. “There, my son-in-law … informed us that his wife … and his daughter … had fallen into the said manhole.”
The FIR noted the woman’s husband added that her body had been recovered, but at the time, the daughter’s body was still missing.
The complainant named three individuals in the FIR, accusing them of leaving “the manhole open due to negligence and carelessness”. These were the construction project’s project manager, the safety in-charge and the site in-charge.
“Due to their gross negligence and irresponsibility, my daughter … and my granddaughter … lost their lives,” he said in the complaint.
Subsequently, Lahore Operations SSP Mohammad Tauqir confirmed to Dawn that the suspects nominated in the FIR by the complainant had been arrested.
The arrests were made after Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz issued directions to expand the scope of action to punish those responsible for the death of the woman and her minor daughter.
Child’s body found
Earlier on Thursday, police said that the body of the child, said to be a baby between nine to ten months old in the FIR, was recovered. The body of the mother was found during the wee hours of Thursday morning.
In a statement, Rescue 1122 said that its “diving team had recovered the girl’s body from Saggian”, around five kilometres from Bhatti Chowk, where the incident took place a day earlier.
The woman and her child had reportedly fallen into the open manhole after they dismounted a rickshaw on Wednesday evening. At the time, conflicting reports had emerged about the incident, with some authorities doubting that the woman had in fact fallen into the manhole.
Reportedly, rescue teams had initially doubted the call made by the woman’s husband and also raised doubts about the authenticity of the incident. They had alleged that the water level at the time of the operation was just two feet deep, which made it impossible for a person to drown.
Meanwhile, official statements, including those by the district management, further complicated the matter as they shifted the entire blame on the woman’s husband.
Following these premature statements, police high-ups ordered the interrogation of the woman’s husband.
The role of the project managers also remained questionable. The under-construction sewerage pipeline was left uncovered, despite the fact that hundreds of people visiting Data Darbar were walking around in the area.
In the early hours of Thursday, Lahore Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran had stated that the body of the mother had been found at the disposal station on Outfall Road.
When asked about the various reports about the water flow not being fast enough to carry away a person, he said, “You should also look at the time difference. When it happened, the water flow was fast; those are peak hours.”
He said that the water flow receded as the night progressed.
At the same time, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had taken notice of the incident and constituted a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter and submit a report within 24 hours.
It should also be mentioned that two officials of Tepa, a subsidiary of the Lahore Development Authority, were placed under suspension with immediate effect “on account of an incident [regarding] uncovered manholes”.
Last month, a seven-year-old boy in Punjab’s Bahawalpur district fell into an open manhole in Dhanote town near Lodhran city and died.
CM Maryam fires Lahore DC, grills officials over incident
On Thursday, Punjab CM Maryam took aim at senior officials, including the Lahore commissioner, assistant commissioner and the head of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) for the “negligence” which led to the incident.
Addressing a high-level meeting, she noted that Rs500 billion was being spent on construction projects across the province.
“Regardless of how much this work costs, it is happening to improve people’s lives and their living environment and provide relief to them. It is not meant to kill them.”
CM Maryam added that if the incident happened in a more remote area with less foot traffic, “it could be understandable”.
“This is the area in Lahore with the most footfall, near Data Sahib,” she noted.
“It is such a prime area, with so much foot traffic; there’s a construction site there, and this is such criminal negligence that there is no work going on. The workers or contractors or whoever have left, and nobody is concerned that a manhole or a ditch is left open. Does nobody care?”
She questioned the assistant commissioner for saying he never visited the site, asking, “So what are you the assistant commissioner of?
“Wherever there are construction sites throughout the world, there are safety measures,” she said. “It is your job to visit the site and see if safety measures have been taken or not,” she added, addressing the AC.
The chief minister reiterated that the neighbourhood saw the most foot traffic in the metropolis.
“There should not have even been parking here, but that’s a separate discussion. The question is not why parking was allowed, but why wasn’t it (the sewer) closed?” she asked.
“Not only did someone leave it open and didn’t care, but how can anyone read warning signs in an area where there is such darkness?” she questioned the LDA’s director general, adding that if someone were illiterate, they would not be able to read it.
“You told me that the contractor is at fault, and they absolutely are. The supervisor, consultant are all at fault, as are Nespak (National Engineering Society of Pakistan), the executing agency, TEPA (Traffic Engineering and Transportation Planning Agency) and the LDA. But frankly, you, commissioner, Lahore DC, assistant commissioner, Wasa and the LDA are all at fault,” she asserted.
“There’s construction work ongoing in a prime area of the city and you people don’t know if it has been amply secured for the public? And somebody has started parking there and is taking money, does nobody know about this?” she added.
Addressing the officials, the CM declared that the site was left unsecured despite the high foot traffic in the area.
Directly addressing the Punjab chief secretary, she said she stressed in every meeting that no manhole be left open, because “the poor fall in and die, not the rich”.
“Please allow me to say, if it were my daughter or yours, then I would question you. Would the system be shaken or not? Do the people who left the site open not have children?” she remarked.
“The word criminal isn’t enough for this negligence.”
“I normally don’t fire DCs, but I am firing the DC over this incident, where a child fell into an open manhole,” she stated. “We’re in Lahore, a Safe City. How long does it take to see that the woman fell in the CCTV footage?”
The CM noted that one of her staffers examined the CCTV footage and confirmed that nobody pushed her into the sewer.
Adding that the call was made to Rescue 1122 two minutes after she fell, she said that “nobody can kill someone in two minutes, but in two minutes she could fall because of your negligence, incompetance and carelessness”.
“There are 10 institutions in one place, yet nobody seems responsible,” she added. CM Maryam said that there was “criminal apathy” at every level, adding that her husband was taken to a police station instead of being treated with compassion at that time.
She instructed an official to go across Punjab and install temporary cameras wherever they are needed, because “it is very easy for people to lie in Lahore”.
“No precautionary measures or safety measures were taken, the site was not cordoned off, and there was no temporary covering,” CM Maryam said. “The people who closed the site just went home comfortably and left the public to die.”
Addressing the Lahore commissioner and deputy commissioner and the LDA director general, as well as the Wasa managing director, she asked, “Do you even have a heart in your chests? How did this happen?”
She then asked who the supervisor was, but said that the Lahore commissioner, deputy commisisoner and the LDA director general should be punished, adding that the assistant commissioner should be “especially” punished.
She further directed the chief secretary to remove TEPA Project Director Zahid Hussain and Wasa site in-charge Usman Babar from their posts and “they should never get another job again, so they know the extent of their criminal negligence”.
“Arrest them both, along with [project manager] Asghar Sindhu, [safety in-charge] Danial and [site in-charge] Ahmad Nawaz,” the CM ordered. “Make a strong case against them for criminal negligence. It’s amazing how people are dead and nobody is responsible.”
Later, in a post on X, she said, “ Instead of accepting responsibility, facts were distorted to hide incompetence. Officers who cannot even secure an open manhole have no right to hold office.”







“I will not rest until justice is served, the blood of the two daughters is accounted for, and every responsible officer is brought to punishment,” she said.
“Despite my relentless focus and repeated instructions, a poor life was lost to negligence and dereliction of duty, but what is even more painful is the attempt to suppress the truth,” she said.
“Let me be clear, the time of negligent and dishonest officers is over. I will stand as a shield for the family that was harassed instead of being given justice. In Punjab, every life will be valued, no matter how powerful the officer involved,” she asserted.</p><small>2026-01-29 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29215406ad0339b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969741/bangladesh-pakistan-flights-resume-after-14-years' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh-Pakistan flights resume after 14 years</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After a hiatus of 14 years, direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh commenced on Thursday as Biman Bangladesh Airlines launched its inaugural flight from Dhaka to Karachi.
According to Pakistan’s High Commission in Dhaka, the “fully packed” inaugural flight departed from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka, for Jinnah International Airport, Karachi.
The flight was seen off by Bangladesh Civil Aviation and Tourism Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, High Commissioner of Pakistan to Bangladesh Imran Haider and other officials, it added.
“The resumption of direct flight after a hiatus of 14 years marks a significant milestone in strengthening connectivity and bilateral engagement,” it said.







Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Bangladesh’s adviser for civil aviation and tourism underscored the importance of the Dhaka–Karachi route in “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”.
The statement quoted him as saying, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people.”
He expressed hope that people of Bangladesh will visit Pakistan and explore its natural beauty, cultural heritage and diverse cuisines, it added.
During the ceremony, Pakistan’s high commissioner recalled the vision of Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh’s interim leader, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “aimed at enhancing connectivity between Pakistan and Bangladesh”.
“In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries, during the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar to Dhaka in August last year, both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” the statement quoted him as saying.
He also expressed gratitude to the government of Bangladesh, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, and the Civil Aviation Authority for making the launch of the flight possible, the statement said.
“Passengers travelling on the inaugural flight expressed happiness and enthusiasm over the restoration of the direct air link, describing it as a milestone towards bringing the two countries closer,” the statement added.
Earlier this month, it was announced that both countries would resume direct flight operations after a 14-year hiatus.</p><small>2026-01-29 16:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647944-pti-announces-sit-in-outside-adiala-jail-amid-concerning-reports-on-imrans-health' target='_blank'><strong>PTI announces sit-in outside Adiala jail amid 'concerning reports' on Imran's health</strong></a><br><p>

The documents were signed by the government and a consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited at a ceremony in Islamabad, where several federal ministers were also present.
The Arif Habib-led consortium had won the auction for 75 per cent shares of PIA in December last year, making a winning bid of Rs135 billion.







After the documents were signed, PM Shehbaz said, “I want to congratulate the entire nation from the bottom of my heart on the completion of PIA’s privatisation, the process for which began a month ago.”
He commended Arif Habib and his team, terming them “committed business ambassadors of Pakistan”.
“Their performance in the industrial growth and progress of Pakistan is very prominent,” he added.
He said as Habib had also stated, speaking before him, the businessman’s first priority would be ensuring comfortable travel for passengers, their safety and respect.
The premier recalled that the airline had peaked in the 1960s, adding that he resolutely believed that Habib and his team would make PIA scale even greater heights.
Earlier, as the ceremony commenced, Adviser to the PM on Privatisation Muhammad Ali thanked the premier and the army chief for their “immense hard work” and “support” in the process of PIA’s privatisation.
“Had it not been for their guidance and engagement, we would not be here today. I have no qualms in saying that today we are here because of their efforts,” Ali said.
He said the signing marked “one of the most significant milestones undertaken by the current government”, adding that the transaction was completed in a very efficient and transparent manner. And the highest bidder won the auction for PIA after a competitive process, he said.
The PM’s adviser further stated that the airlines’ privatisation had turned out to be “the largest transaction in the history of privatisation in Pakistan”.
“Under this transaction, the investment by all consortium members will add up to Rs180bn, which is equivalent to around $650 million. From this amount, Rs125bn, which is equivalent to $450m, will be invested in PIA and Rs55bn, equivalent to $200m, will be paid to the government,” he detailed.
The growth capital invested in PIA would be used for fleet expansion, service improvement, private-sector management and to take the airline “back to its glory days”, he continued.
Ali said PIA’s privatisation had proved that “Pakistan means business”.
Moreover, he added, “it has also shown that our privatisation programme is aggressive, that the government has decided to sold its loss-making and commercial enterprises, and most importantly, that we have the capacity to structure complex transactions”.
And the transaction had also proved that Pakistan’s local entrepreneurs were not shying away from large ticket items and large investment, and that they would participate in Pakistan’s next growth story, Ali concluded.
After him, Habib addressed the ceremony and said, “We consider ourselves very lucky that we volunteered for this national cause.”
He said the entire investment under the transaction was “100pc equity”. Habib further said PIA’s privatisation was an endorsement of the business sentiment in Pakistan being “very positive”.
He further stated that the biggest beneficiaries of this transaction would be the people, who would avail the airlines’ improved services. He added that they had held a meeting with aircraft manufacturer Boeing and would hold another one with Airbus.
“We are exploring more options as well,” he said, adding that his consortium would get PIA’s control in three months and until then, the consortium’s team was working very hard.
“I assure the prime minister that we will fulfil your expectations. Our consortium believes that we are doing this for our respect. We responded to the government’s call, and if we accomplish this task, it will show that even businessmen are soldiers. So my request is to keep guiding us,” he said.
He also announced that the consortium had decided to exercise the option of acquiring the remaining 25pc shares of the airline as well. “So the government will get Rs55bn.”</p><small>2026-01-29 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/292107173e59be6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969723/saims-all-round-show-takes-pakistan-past-australia-in-first-t20' target='_blank'><strong>Saim’s all-round show takes Pakistan past Australia in first T20</strong></a><br><p>Saim Ayub gave an outstanding all-round performance, taking two wickets after a blistering 40-run knock as Pakistan defeated Australia by 22 runs in the first Twenty20 International at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Thursday.
This is Pakistan’s first T20I victory against Australia in more than seven years.
Winning the toss and batting first, Pakistan scored 168 runs at the loss of eight wickets in the allotted overs.
Despite Sahibzada Farhan’s duck in the first over, Saim and skipper Salman Ali Agha managed to anchor Pakistan’s innings with a 74-run partnership.
Returning to Pakistan’s T20 side after a troubled Big Bash League season, Babar Azam could score only 24 runs before losing his wicket to Adam Zampa.
For Australia, spinner Adam Zampa grabbed four wickets, including the crucial ones of Babar, Saim, and Salman. Xavier Bartlett and Mahli Beardman also took a couple of wickets each for Australia.







While defending the target, Pakistan’s decision to include four spinners proved to be vital in dismantling the Australian batting lineup.
Saim took the wicket of fiery-looking Australian Travis Head, who scored 23 runs, with two sixes and two fours. He also took the wicket of Matthew Short in his first over of the innings.
Pakistan’s Abrar Ahmed also joined hands with Saim, taking two wickets, while other spinners, Mohammad Nawaz and Shadab Khan clinched a couple of wickets together.
Australia’s Cameron Green and Xavier Bartlett made 36 and 34 runs respectively. Two of their batters also flung their wickets with perplexing run-outs.
Pakistan restricted the Australian side to 146 runs with eight wickets in 20 overs.
Saim, who earned the Player of the Match award, said after his side’s victory that “conditions were a bit challenging, but our plan was to dominate with the new ball as much as possible”
During the batting powerplay, the goal was dominate sensibly by calculating the innings, watching the ball, and enjoying the process, he said.
On Pakistan’s bowling strategy, Saim said, “We knew that if we hit a good length consistently, it wouldn’t be easy for the batters to score. That was the strategy”.
Skipper Salman lauded his team’s “outstanding” bowling performance but also acknowledged batting challenges.
“It was a great game. We started well with the bat but couldn’t finish the way we wanted. It became challenging after the first 10 overs as the ball stopped coming onto the bat, but I think we were outstanding with the ball,” he said.
He said he would continue to bat at number three as they were expecting a “lot of spin”.
“And I believe I can dominate spin during the powerplay. That’s why I moved up, and that is where I’ll stay.”
The Pakistan captain said 170 was a good enough target given the favourable conditions for spin and Pakistan bowling capability.
“Given how we were placed after ten overs, we probably could have scored 15 more, but I knew 170 would be plenty on this pitch because our spin bowling is outstanding.
“Abrar has been outstanding since his debut. Since the Asia Cup, our spin bowling has been doing really well for us; they are winning us games day in and day out. Hopefully, they can continue this form through to the World Cup,” he said.
After Pakistan’s innings, Australian captain Travis said, “We felt like we dragged it back well after the first ten overs. As the ball got softer, it became harder to score, so we felt we were right in the game. We had moments where we could have opened it up, but the conditions made it difficult.”
He credited bowler Mahli for working his way back into his spell and finished really strongly and said Xavier, too, had very good game.
“Zampa did his thing as usual.”
The Australian skipper said there were definitely positives, but also things to work on.
On his side’s preparation for the upcoming T20 World Cup, he said, “We’ll have to wait and see how it plays out. We have two more opportunities before we head to Sri Lanka, and we want to continue playing as well as we can. Even though the result didn’t go our way today, there are things we did well and areas we can improve.”
The Australian cricket team arrived in Lahore on Wednesday for a T20 tri-series, which was announced earlier this month.
All three matches are scheduled to take place at the Gaddafi Stadium on January 29, 31 and February 1.
Addressing a press conference in Lahore on Wednesday, Australian captain Mitchell Marsh had praised the Green Shirts and said his team was excited about the challenge of playing them on home soil in preparation for the T20 World Cup.
In his remarks, Agha had stressed the importance of the series, saying, “There are some boxes that need to be ticked — this is one of those series where we will tick all boxes”.
The two teams played a three-match Test and an ODI series in March-April 2022, followed by a solitary T20I where they bagged a close three-wicket win at Gaddafi Stadium. Australia also played three of their 2025 Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan.

Speaking to Geo News, Tarar said the former premier, who is imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
“Eye experts examined him in Adiala jail, after which they recommended that it was necessary to take him to Pims for a small medical process. Last Saturday night, he was taken to Pims on the recommendation of these eye doctors and experts,” Tarar said.
He added that at Pims, Imran’s “eyes were further examined, and after his written approval, a 20-minute medical procedure was performed”. The ex-premier was then taken back to the Adiala jail with “important instructions”.
“During the medical procedure, his vitals and everything were stable. He’s absolutely healthy,” Tarar stated.

 


The minister asserted that “all prisoners” have access to doctors and medical treatments when such an issue arises. “This is in accordance with the [jail] rules, and he is absolutely healthy,” he added.
Asked about the concerns raised regarding Imran’s health, Tarar reiterated that the PTI founder was “absolutely fine”.
The minister stressed that it was the medical experts’ opinion to take Imran to Pims for a medical procedure. “He is absolutely fine, and he was also perfectly fine when this medical procedure was being performed.”
On Tuesday, the PTI said it had learned through credible reports that Imran had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, “resulting in a dangerous blockage in the retinal vein”.
Citing medical experts, the party had said that if not treated promptly and properly, CRVO could cause permanent damage to his eyesight.
Also on Tuesday, PTI MNAs filed a fresh petition before the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission to meet Imran.
According to a senior doctor at Pims, Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on Saturday night for the procedure, which took quite some time.
“Whatever procedure was going on, it was completed when the time reached in the A.M. So we can say that he was taken back on Sunday,” he claimed.
The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims.
PTI condemns Imran’s ‘secret transfer’
Responding to the minister’s statement, the PTI said it strongly condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed and refusing access to his personal physicians.







The party declared it an act of “clear malice, bad faith, and a grave unconstitutional and illegal move”.
It said that according to Tarar, the PTI founder had requested medical treatment.
“If this is indeed the case, then why was such a request concealed from his family, party leadership, and legal counsel? The PTI, therefore, demands that this alleged request be made public immediately and presented before his family and lawyers,” it said.
“Secretive actions, suppression of information, and restrictions on meetings are unacceptable under any circumstances. The PTI demands that meetings with Imran Khan be arranged without delay and that his personal physicians be granted full and unconditional access,” it added.
“The treatment being meted out to a former elected prime minister and the country’s most popular national leader is a blatant violation of the Constitution, the law, democratic norms, and fundamental human rights. The Punjab government and the jail administration are deliberately disregarding court orders and are pushing the country toward a dangerous and volatile crisis,” it said.
The party warned that if the federal government, the Punjab government and the Adiala jail authorities failed to immediately allow meeting with Imran and access to his personal doctors, then the “full responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with them”.
“Public patience is being severely tested, and a public reaction against this unconstitutional, illegal, and inhumane conduct is becoming inevitable,” it said, adding that it would continue to protect Imran’s constitutional and human rights.
It also penned an open letter to human rights organisations about the violation of Imran’s rights, saying: “The deliberate secrecy surrounding a detainee’s medical condition and location constitutes bad faith, malice, and a clear violation of international custodial standards, including the UN Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.”
It urged the rights organisations to take cognisance of Imran’s situation; demand unrestricted access for his family, lawyers, and personal physicians; call for an end to solitary confinement and custodial abuse; and rrge Pakistani authorities to ensure fair, transparent, and timely judicial proceedings.







Further, the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) termed Imran’s transfer to the hospital without the knowledge of his family and personal physicians a “criminal negligence”.
It demanded that the details of Imran’s condition be disclosed to his family immediately, and said any “delay or irresponsibility” in this regard “will not be tolerated”.
It said that not providing him access to his personal physicians was a “violation of court orders”. It added that the silence of state institutions on Imran’s health was “alarming”.
Former opposition leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub said, “The fascist regime is denying medical treatment to PM Imran Khan in Adyala. This is against all norms of human rights. The judiciary is unable and unwilling to enforce its writ.”
He said that Imran’s personal physicians, family members and lawyers should be given immediate access to Imran.







Imran’s sister demands his medical reports be made public
Prior to Tarar’s confirmation, Imran’s sister Noreen Niazi had raised concerns about why the PTI founder’s family and lawyers were not being kept informed if the reports of his medical treatment were true. She also asked for his medical reports to be made public.
“I am a sister, and today my question is directed towards the corridors of power,” Niazi said on X this morning.
“According to multiple journalists and media sources, our brother, Imran Khan, was taken under the cover of the night to the Pims hospital on the pretext of eye treatment. He was kept there for three hours, and then transferred back to Adiala jail in an atmosphere of extreme mystery and terrifying silence,” she stated.
Contending that it was a “blatant crime” if the reports were true, Niazi asked: “Why does no one have the courage to tell the truth to Imran Khan’s family and lawyers? Who is this being hidden from, and on whose orders?
“What treatment is our brother being subjected to inside the jail, and why are our family and lawyers being kept in the dark?”







Niazi again demanded that Imran’s family, personal doctors and lawyers be allowed to meet him, adding that “make his complete medical reports public”.
“This is no longer a request, it is a final warning!” she stated.
Asserting that Imran was “not just another prisoner”, his sister alleged, “To endanger his health is nothing less than an attempt to blind the entire country.”
“Remember, if even the slightest harm comes to Imran Khan’s eye, this injustice will not be buried in silence. After that, no one else’s eyes will remain safe,” Niazi added.
Separately, Imran’s son Kasim Khan claimed that “authorities continue to block his treatment and deny him the doctors he trusts”.
“I am even denied the right to speak to him. This is not governance. This is authoritarian cruelty,” he said on X.
Claiming that his father had now spent over 900 days in a “death cell with no family visits and no access to his personal doctors, Kasim stressed that CRVO could “lead to permanent vision loss if not treated through urgent medical intervention in a proper hospital”.
The son called on human rights defenders to “act before it is too late”.
“The world must see that in Pakistan today, democracy is hollow and basic human rights are being crushed,” he added.

Afridi, who has been seeking a meeting with the incarcerated prime minister since he assumed office of the provincial chief executive in October last year, but to no avail.
He again reached Factory Naka — a police picket near the Adiala jail — today in yet another attempt to meet Imran, with Thursday and Tuesday being court mandated dates for meeting with the former prime minister.
However, he, as well as Imran’s sisters and lawyers, have been barred from meeting him for past several weeks — a restriction has made sit-ins and protests near the prison a usual occurrence. On several occasions, police also used force to disperse the protesters, who often camp at Factory Naka.
Speaking to the media at the spot today, Afridi announced his plans for an overnight stay and said “most of [PTI] parliamentarians have also reached the spot and some others will be arriving in some time”.
Standing alongside Raja, he added, “This is about our leader’s life. We will not let this get normalised. We will spend the entire night here. We are waiting for a meeting between Imran Khan sahib and his family and personal physician.”







He also said that if deliberate attempts were being made to worsen the situation for no reason, “we cannot do anything about this. All responsibility then lies with the government. Those who are not allowing the meeting will be responsible.”
The KP CM said if Imran’s sisters were allowed to meet him, the situation could be prevented from worsening.
CM Afridi’s visit comes after the PTI on Tuesday raised concerns about Imran’s health.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed earlier today that the PTI founder had undergone a medical procedure for an eye ailment at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on Saturday night.
Referring to Tarar’s statement, Afridi said he had “serious reservations” about the former premier’s health.







For his part, Raja said they had sent a list of names of those who were supposed to meet Imran to the prison administration as per the directions of the Islamabad High Court. “All those who have been mentioned in the list are present here,” he said.
Raja mentioned that they would not return without meeting the PTI founder today, calling the meeting Imran’s “human right”.
Referring to the former premier’s brief visit to Pims for a procedure, he said, “The PTI founder was taken to Pims secretly on Saturday night. It was certainly a situation where the party founder could not receive treatment in prison.”
“It was the prison administration’s responsibility to inform his family members so that they, along with his personal physician, were present.”
Rawalpindi police had made strict security arrangements ahead of Afridi’s expected arrival on Thursday, with personnel at the prison and in the adjoining areas on high alert.
Police pickets were established near the prison’s gate, at Shaigan Healthcare factory, and in Dahgal and Gorakhpur areas, while female cops were also deployed on pickets on Adiala Road.
Police checkpoints were also set up on the toll plazas of the M1 (Islamabad–Peshawar) and M2 (Lahore-Islamabad) motorways.
Other places where police personnel were deployed included Committee Chowk, Liaquat Bagh, GPO Chowk, Chungi No. 22, Khawaja Corporation Chowk, Gulshanabad Chowk, Thalian and Chakri Interchange.</p><small>2026-01-29 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29161859030df46.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969729/foreign-office-does-not-subscribe-to-judges-opinion-on-terrorist-states-in-imaan-mazari-case' target='_blank'><strong>Foreign Office ‘does not subscribe’ to judge’s opinion on ‘terrorist states’ in Imaan Mazari case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office (FO) on Thursday stated Pakistan did not “subscribe to the opinion” of the judge — who convicted lawyer Imaan Mazari-Hari and her spouse, Hadi Ali Chattha — on “terrorist states”.
In his verdict, Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka had noted: “Currently there are four countries designated as terrorist states, which are Cuba, the Democratic Republic of Korea, Iran and Syria.”
Asked about that judgment during his weekly press briefing in Islamabad on Thursday, FO spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said, “This judgment […] is the view of the learned judge. Pakistan, of course, does not subscribe to this opinion.
“And frankly, this kind of designation does not exist either under the United Nations (UN) or under international law,” he said.

 

Judge Majoka had made the observation while noting that Pakistan was “not included in the list of terrorist states”.
It is worth mentioning that the UN does not maintain a list of “terrorist states”.
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has a “Consolidated List” of individuals, entities and other groups that it subjects to certain measures, such as sanctions, due to various reasons. While it may include certain government-affiliated departments, it does not name any country in its entirety.
Imaan and Hadi were sentenced on January 24 under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act’s (Peca) sections 9 (glorification of an offence), 10 (cyberterrorism), and 26-A (false and fake information).
They were handed a total of 17 years in jail, with the longest sentence being 10 years, and fined Rs36 million each collectively.
In his judgment, Judge Majoka had remarked about the four countries while noting that the couple had “intentionally in their tweets mentioned the [sic] Pakistan as a terrorist state”.
Earlier on Thursday, the European Union’s (EU) Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Anouar El Anouni raised concerns over the conviction of Imaan and Hadi.
In a post on X, the EU official said their convictions “over social media activity goes against freedom of expression and independence of lawyers”.
“These are not only key democratic principles but also part of [Pakistan’s] international human rights commitments,” Anouni said.







Andrabi was asked to comment on Anouni’s remarks during the briefing, to which he said: “This is a domestic affair of Pakistan, the trial and conviction took place under our local laws through a judicial process.
“The relevant individuals have a right to appeal and have a right to a judicial recourse,” he said.
“As such, there is a domestic remedy available to these individuals. Whilst we remain engaged with the EU on all issues, we do make a distinction about our domestic affairs,” he said.
On Iran-US rift
The FO spokesperson was also asked about whether Pakistan was making any efforts to ease tensions between Iran and the US in view of a threat of war between the two.
In his response, Andrabi said Pakistan had always advocated for peace and diplomacy to settle all outstanding issues.
“Pakistan remains firmly opposed to interference in the internal affairs of our brotherly country, Iran. We have opposed the use of force; we have opposed the imposition of sanctions,” he added.
The FO spokesperson recalled that earlier this week, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had telephone conversations with his Iranian counterpart twice and Pakistan had also engaged with the US at the World Economic Forum.
“So, our advocacy for peace diplomacy continues and this remains our stated position. This region cannot afford war or turmoil because this, in essence, stops the economic development and prosperity. So, we hope that peace and diplomacy will prevail,” he said.
Board of Peace
Multiple questions were also asked about the Board of Peace, which is led by US President Donald Trump.
Trump announced the establishment of the Board of Peace on January 15 as part of his broader plan for Gaza, under which the ceasefire agreement was reached. The board was authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 2803 in November 2025.
The board was originally conceived to oversee the ceasefire and reconstruction of Gaza, but its charter expands its mandate to peace-building in all areas affected by or at risk of conflict.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was among the world leaders who signed the board’s charter on January 22 in Davos.
Andrabi was asked on Thursday whether the FO had “prohibited” the premier or the government from signing the charter “for the time being” when the premier was leaving for Davos.
The FO spokesperson dismissed the reports, saying: “This news is incorrect.”
Responding to other questions on the matter, he said: “Pakistan has joined the Board of Peace in good faith. Our basic objective in joining the Board of Peace is threefold.
“One, to consolidate and sustain the ceasefire in Gaza; second, to support reconstruction; and thirdly, to advance a just and lasting peace based on the Palestinian right to self-determination.”
The FO spokesperson also pointed out that seven other Muslim countries had joined the board as well.
“As such, Pakistan joining the Board of Peace should be seen in the continuum of the initiative by these eight Arab Islamic countries to promote peace in Gaza, leading towards a lasting solution to the Palestinian question — and this initiative dates back to September and August last year.
“All eight countries have joined the Board of Peace with a single collective voice. The Board of Peace offers a viable glimmer of hope for Gaza and for the wider Palestinian question,” he asserted.
Andrabi further stated that for over two years, the people of Gaza had witnessed unprecedented suffering, death and destruction.
“The UN Security Council remained deadlocked on this issue. The International Court of Justice issued three advisory opinions, and the General Assembly adopted a number of resolutions, all of which failed to prevent the Israeli onslaught.
“So, in this backdrop, the Board of Peace is a glimmer of hope for Palestine,” he said.
Andrabi also clarified that it was a misconception that joining the board was in any way “connected to any Abraham accord or any sidetrack to this issue”.
“Pakistan’s positions remain unchanged, and we will not become a party to the Abraham Accord,” he said. He said the board “does not replace the United Nations”.
“It has been established with a specific mandate authorised by the UN Security Council resolution 2803. We understand that the Board of Peace is intended to complement and not undermine the UN system,” he said, adding that Pakistan had not decided to join the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) and the membership of the Board of Peace did not imply contributing to troops to ISF.
As for the decision to join the board itself, he said, the foreign ministry and all stakeholders held joint consultations.
“This was a collective decision taken with all procedural formalities completed in terms of the ‘Rules of Business’ of the federal government.”
Andrabi further stated: “We hope that the framework established by the Board of Peace will lead to concrete steps towards permanent ceasefire, expanded humanitarian assistance, the reconstruction of Gaza and will advance Palestinians people’s right to self-determination through a credible, time bound political process in line with international legitimacy and the relevant UN resolutions, culminating in an independent, sovereign, contiguous state of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.”
He said Pakistan looked forward to continuing to play a constructive role as part of the Board of Peace in achieving these goals and in ending the suffering of Palestinian brothers and sisters.
The FO spokesperson explained that representation at the Board of Peace depended on “at what level the meeting is taking place. I mean, there could be a summit level, or a ministerial level. So, on this issue, we will know, as we advance in this process”.
“As for the status of the membership, there is basically a three-year membership. And after three years, there is a certain payment. There is no permanent and non-permanent category, as such, linked to the financial contribution,” he added.
Andrabi was also asked about the steps taken for the removal of Pakistan from a list of countries facing recently imposed restrictions by the US on immigrant visas.
In his response, the FO spokesperson said, “This matter has been under discussion in Islamabad as well as in Washington through our diplomatic channels. This is an ongoing review. Our understanding is that eventually Pakistan will be excluded from this list.
“Our talks with the US, our diplomatic exchanges with the US are geared towards this objective.”</p><small>2026-01-29 15:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29171757b414bac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969735/sindh-govt-announces-judicial-inquiry-into-deadly-gul-plaza-blaze' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt announces judicial inquiry into deadly Gul Plaza blaze</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon on Thursday announced that a judicial inquiry will be conducted into the Gul Plaza fire.
“To further probe this and to promote departmental transparency, the sub-committee decided … a letter is being penned to the honourable Sindh High Court (SHC) chief justice,” Memon told a press conference in Karachi.
He added that the SHC top judge will be requested to appoint a serving judge to “review everything and decide on it”.
A cabinet sub-committee — chaired by Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and including ministers Memon, Nasir Hussain Shah, Saeed Ghani, and Ziaul Hassan Lanjar — reviewed a report submitted by a two-member team.
“The meeting with the chief minister went on for four to five hours and important decisions were made in light of the commissioner and additional IG’s report,” Memon noted.



The senior minister then listed the decisions taken by the sub-committee.
He observed that the Civil Defence department conducted fire safety audits of Gul Plaza and other buildings since 2023, but “no effective, corrective, precautionary or legal action was enforced to prevent such incidents of such nature”.
Memon said the Civil Defence director and its South district additional controller “did not bring the matter up to authorities nor took any appropriate action against violators”.
The minister highlighted that Gul Plaza’s management had received notices twice after fire safety audits, informing them they did not have adequate safety arrangements in place in case of an emergency.
Hence, both Civil Defence officials were suspended immediately as they were unable to implement either of the letters.

 

“Departmental action has been initiated against them under the relevant regulations,” he said, adding that action would also be taken if negligence on the part of any other official was proven.
“If it is revealed that a higher officer was asked to take action but they did not do so, they will be suspended as well,” the minister asserted.
‘Delay in supplying water to fire tenders’
The cabinet sub-committee also noted that there was a “delay in the supply of water to the fire tenders”, affecting the operations of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s (KMC) fire brigade and Rescue 1122.
Therefore, Memon said, it was decided to suspend the chief engineer (bulk) and the hydrants’ incharge of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC).
“Departmental action will be initiated against them,” he said, adding that action would also be taken if “negligence or failure of any senior officer or authority” is found.
“KMC Municipal Commissioner Afzal Zaidi was removed from his post on the first day [of the incident],” the minister revealed.
“The sub-committee found that KMC Fire Brigade and Rescue 1122’s equipment, training and capabilities to deal with an incident of this nature were insufficient.”
However, Memon emphasised, KMC firefighters acted with courage despite severe equipment shortages and difficulties, noting that firefighter Furqan Shaukat lost his life in the operation.
The minister further announced that the KMC municipal service senior director will also be immediately suspended and departmental action will be taken against him for “failing to ensure the preparation of firefighting staff”.
Providing details of January 17, when the blaze erupted, Memon said there were between 2,000 and 2,500 people present in the building, including workers and visitors.
“As the fire broke out, many people escaped. Government employees managed to rescue them. Eighty people fell victim and were affected,” the minister added.
Sharjeel further said that the relevant departments must immediately conduct a needs assessment, so that provincial and municipal institutions can improve and strengthen their firefighting capabilities. He said that the assessment would focus on equipment, training, manpower and infrastructure.
“A deadline will be established for this process to prevent similar incidents in future,” the minister said, adding that CM Murad had several meetings about consolidating the city’s rescue institutions.
“The chief minister has had two or four meetings and said that rescue institutions — Rescue 1122, KMC Fire Brigade, civil defence — must be brought together,” Sharjeel explained.
“He (CM Murad) is bringing them under one roof, so that they can get state-of-the-art equipment and improved training and are ready to respond to future incidents with no shortage of resources,” he said.
‘No adequate firefighting systems’
According to the minister, the sub-committee found that Gul Plaza’s building management did not have adequate firefighting systems in place.
“This was highlighted in writing, but not implemented, so two civil defence officers were suspended,” he stated. “The building managers had a responsibility to make these arrangements after being informed and audited.
“The constructed building violated the approved building plan, which limited firefighting options and endangered public safety,” he added.
Sharjeel noted that since the management at Gul Plaza did not take measures, their role and conduct at the time of the incident will be scrutinised, amid the police investigation.
“If negligence or violations of the law are found, then legal action will be taken against those responsible,” he warned.
Sharjeel added that the sub-committee also found “serious discrepancies” in the lease and approval granted by the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) and KMC in 1979, 1983, 1986, 1991, 1998, 2003 and 2015.
“Anti-corruption has been instructed to assess these discrepancies in minute detail and take legal action,” he stated.
‘Government accepted its mistakes’
After reading through the sub-committee’s report and listing the important decisions made, Sharjeel noted that the government is not above accountability and highlighted its own errors.
“Wherever there were assessments, they were carried out by the government,” he said, adding that the mistakes of other institutions were also highlighted in the report.
“We also highlighted the responsibility of building management; it is being claimed that they were never warned, but letters were written to them explaining what needed to be done,” the minister stated. “If something like this happens, there need to be arrangements in place, but they weren’t made by building management.”
The minister said that there was also detailed information available with the SBCA about the original number of shops at Gul Plaza and those added over time, as well as “the size of the staircase, which people would use to escape in the event of a fire or emergency”.
He stated that the government highlighted these issues and determined those responsible, reiterating that the SHC was approached for a judicial inquiry.
Fielding questions, Sharjeel expressed his displeasure that political parties were politicising the issue, not mentioning them by name.
“From day one, we said we would not take pressure from any political parties,” he said, adding that compensation cheques had been delivered to those affected by the blaze.
“When the cabinet made this decision, we said that we would examine all angles and bring them forward in a transparent manner,” Sharjeel added. “We have acknowledged our own mistakes in the report, as well as the illegal ways in which previous administrations blindly handed out leases and on what basis.”
He added that the anti-graft body would conduct an inquiry and summon the relevant people and interrogate them, to ensure transparency and “prevent finger-pointing”.
“We are answerable to the public, not a political party,” Sharjeel stated.
In response to a question about whether the incident was an accident or arson, the minister noted that the fire started in a flower shop.
Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Azad Khan then explained the circumstances of the fire, saying that a shopkeeper had left his 11-year-old child at a shop.
“A 13-year-old child was also there. While they were playing, they took matches and lit them, which caused the fire,” he said. “People witnessed this and the children admitted to it.
“We ruled out any causes other than an accident in our committee’s findings,” he added. “We did not identify any other factors.”
Replying to another question, Sharjeel reiterated that the Sindh government was not under any pressure and that it is “doing its job”.
“This is not the first time this has happened. There have been 1,100 such incidents in one year, and our fire brigade has responded to them well,” he explained.
“This is a major incident and we are not being dictated to, nor will we be. This is about 80 valuable lives, and we want to make it as transparent as possible.”
When asked about the BRT Green Line project obstructing firefighting efforts, Sharjeel replied that the question “would be answered by the judicial inquiry”.
He noted that at the time of the incident, the government responded immediately and machinery, fire tenders, water bowsers and officials and police rushed to the scene.
“Wherever we were lacking, we will take responsibility for it,” he said.
“Look at what happens in Pakistan: whenever something like this happens, we play the blame game. Let the judicial commission’s report come out, then if any institution is at fault, they will come forward,” Sharjeel maintained. “Let the court decide.”
The minister added that this was “a serious matter that needs to be taken seriously” and reiterated that it would not be politicised.
“We’re not blaming anyone else, we have outlined the causes and there is strong evidence. If you want the evidence, it will be shared, but it should be gathered in court for the judicial commission,” he added.
AIG Khan responded to a question and said that a first information report had been filed “after a delay”, but noted that it would determine individual responsibility and damages, and whether there was negligence and if fire safety measures were in place.
“When discussing how many fire tenders and cylinders, we were given a number. There were only cylinders deployed, as there was no other equipment to effectively respond,” AIG Khan explained.
“There also needs to be fire exits and whether people can be guided, or if there are signs. There are no emergency exits and the existing exits are very narrow,” he added.
“You saw that the fire started on the ground floor, but people died mostly on the mezzanine floor. There were very few exits and people there could not react. All of these things will be investigated.”
Asked if the government had taken the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) on board, Sharjeel replied in the negative, adding that the judicial commission would not be constituted upon their request.</p><small>2026-01-29 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29192143e242c55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969724/pm-shehbaz-iranian-president-discuss-evolving-regional-situation' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, Iranian president discuss ‘evolving regional situation’</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday spoke with Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian, with the two leaders exchanging views on the “evolving regional situation”.
According to a handout from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), PM Shehbaz “underscored the importance of sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement for promoting peace, security and development in the region”.
“Reflecting the close and fraternal ties between Pakistan and Iran, rooted in shared history, culture, and faith, both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to maintain regular high-level engagements and consultations through bilateral institutional mechanisms, to further strengthen cooperation across the full spectrum of bilateral relations,” the statement said.
In a separate post on X, PM Shehbaz said the two exchanged views on the “evolving regional situation and agreed that sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement are vital for peace, security, and development in our region”.
“We also reaffirmed our commitment to further strengthening Pakistan–Iran fraternal ties through regular high-level engagement and institutional cooperation,” he said.







The development comes as reports have emerged that US President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders.
The call also came hours after Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had underscored the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in a phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi.
The Foreign Office (FO) posted on X that the two foreign ministers had spoken on the phone, during which Dar expressed concern over the evolving regional situation.
The foreign minister “underscored that dialogue and diplomacy remain the only viable way forward”, the FO said.
It added that both leaders agreed to remain in close contact.







The two leaders had already spoken on Saturday, when Dar received a call from Araghchi while on a visit to Dubai.
According to the FO, the Iranian minister had thanked the deputy prime minister for “his strong support and Pakistan’s position at the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva, including its call for a vote as well as voting against the resolution concerning Iran”.







Last week, the United Nations Human Rights Council had adopted a resolution to extend the mandate of the Independent International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran for two years. Pakistan was one of the seven countries that voted against the resolution, along with India and China.</p><small>2026-01-29 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29163156f5b023c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969731/pakistan-committed-to-working-with-eu-on-trade-initiatives-especially-through-gsp-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan committed to working with EU on trade initiatives, especially through GSP+: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said Pakistan was committed to working closely with the European Union (EU) on mutually beneficial trade enhancement initiatives, especially through the GSP+ status.
According to a handout by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), PM Shehbaz made these remarks while meeting the EU’s Ambassador to Pakistan Raimundas Karoblis, who called on him in Islamabad.
According to the EU, GSP+ status is a special incentive awarded to developing countries to “pursue sustainable development and good governance” in exchange for cutting import duties to zero on two-thirds of the tariff lines of its exports. Governments with this status need to implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, good governance and the environment.
According to the handout issued on Thursday, the premier welcomed the ambassador and reaffirmed “Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthen cooperation with the EU in all areas of mutual interest, particularly trade, investment, development, security, migration and climate change”.







“The prime minister emphasised upon the critical role of the GSP+ scheme in enhancing trade between Pakistan and the EU, and said the government of Pakistan is committed to working closely with the EU on mutually beneficial trade enhancement initiatives, especially through the GSP+,” it said.
He also expressed satisfaction at the seventh round of Pakistan-EU Strategic Dialogue held in Brussels in November last year, it added.
Meanwhile, the EU ambassador expressed gratitude and deep appreciation to the prime minister for the warm welcome he had received since his arrival in the country and assured him that he would continue to work steadfastly to strengthen Pakistan-EU relations across all spheres.







He also conveyed good wishes from the EU leadership to the prime minister, and said the EU would continue to engage closely with Pakistan on enhancing trade, under GSP+ as well as through trade promotion activities such as the first-ever EU-Pakistan Business Forum, which would be held in April.
The GSP+ status was granted to Pakistan by the EU in 2014, resulting in a 108 per cent increase in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs.
In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan.
According to the EU’s GSP Convention Compliance Database, Pakistan has ratified 27 international conventions, most recently ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (1976) and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (1987) in 2010.
Regarding the EU’s monitoring of Pakistan, the body prioritised 13 key areas, including enforced disappearances, torture prevention, and freedom of expression and belief and minority rights.
Last month, the EU had welcomed Pakistan’s progress towards implementing 27 international conventions under the GSP+ framework.</p><small>2026-01-29 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647892-pm-renews-commitment-to-working-with-eu-on-trade-initiatives-including-gsp' target='_blank'><strong>PM renews commitment to working with EU on trade initiatives, including GSP+</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan is expected to make a final decision by next week, over the cricket team’s participation in next month’s Twenty20 World Cup, keeping open the possibility of a boycott over Bangladesh’s withdrawal from the tournament.
Amid the uncertainty, Iceland Cricket had earlier quipped that it needed Pakistan to decide on its participation soon, saying they were “ready to take off”.
It is worth mentioning that Iceland is not a member of the International Cricket Council.







Howeve, on Thursday, Iceland Cricket’s X account — known for its wisecracks — said: “It is with a heavy heart that we now announce our unavailability to replace Pakistan in the upcoming T20 World Cup.
“Regardless of whether [Pakistan] they now withdraw, the short timescales ensure it is impossible for our squad to prepare in the professional manner necessary to compete effectively in this global cricketing spectacle,” it said.







Referring to ICC’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland, upon their refusal to travel to India, it said, “We are not like Scotland and able to turn up on a whim, with no kit sponsor.
“Our players are from all walks of life and cannot simply drop their occupations to fly halfway around the world to experience temperatures only normally felt in Finnish saunas,” the post said.
“Our captain, a professional baker, needs to attend to his oven, our ship captain needs to steer his vessel, and our bankers need to go bankrupt (again). This is the harsh reality of cricket at the amateur level of the game,” it said.
“This is the harsh reality of cricket at the amateur level of the game. This news will be extremely disappointing to our fans,” it said.
“We were ready to give the Dutch the biggest shock they have experienced since William of Orange lost the Battle of Landen in 1693. And the Americans were looking forward to taking on Greenland, or so their orange-dyed leader thought,” the post added, taking a crack at US President Donald Trump.
“Our loss is likely Uganda’s gain. We wish them well. Their kits cannot be missed unless you have epilepsy, in which case they are probably best avoided,” it concluded.</p><small>2026-01-29 13:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647897-sindh-govt-decides-to-hold-judicial-inquiry-into-gul-plaza-tragedy' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt decides to hold judicial inquiry into Gul Plaza tragedy</strong></a><br><p>

On Monday, France’s National Assembly backed legislation to ban children under 15 from social media and Britain, Denmark and Greece are studying the issue.

 

The adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, recommended in India’s annual economic survey that families promote screen-time limits, device-free hours and shared offline activities.
“Policies on age-based access limits may be considered, as younger users are more vulnerable to compulsive use and harmful content,” he wrote in the survey, which was published on Thursday.
“Platforms should be made responsible for enforcing age verification and age-appropriate defaults.”
The recommendations are not binding, but are reflected in policy discussions in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.
Past recommendations have prompted tax reforms, easing rules on Chinese investment and stronger digital infrastructure.
India, the world’s No. 2 smartphone market with 750 million devices and a billion internet users, is a key growth market for social media apps, and does not set a minimum age for access.
Research firm DataReportal says YouTube has 500m users in India, Facebook 403m, while Instagram has 481m.
Facebook operator Meta, YouTube-parent Alphabet and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Meta has previously said it backs laws for parental oversight while adding: “Governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites.”
New Delhi has repeatedly clashed with social media companies like Meta and X over the years over content moderation, local data storage, user safety and not complying with content takedown orders promptly.

 

In a press briefing, Nageswaran on Thursday called the platforms “predatory” in their approach to maximise user engagement and time spent by users, adding that “such algorithms are particularly targeted at youngsters between the ages of 15 and 24”.
Cheap telecom data plans have boosted use of social media apps in recent years, with 75 per cent of young smartphone users on the apps, the survey report said.
“Digital addiction negatively affects academic performance and workplace productivity due to distractions, ‘sleep debt’, and reduced focus,” Nageswaran added.
Children slipping into relentless usage
The recommendation follows growing efforts among Indian states to rein in screen time for young people.
The coastal state of Goa and the southern state of Andhra Pradesh have said they are studying Australia’s regulatory framework, with an eye to similar bans for children.
“Trust in social media is breaking down,” Nara Lokesh, the infotech minister in Andhra Pradesh, wrote on X on Thursday, saying the state would study legal frameworks for age-appropriate access.







“Children are slipping into relentless usage, affecting their attention spans and education.” Nageswaran said “we are very happy” the two states are considering restrictions for children.
Some activists and tech experts have called for measures to help children and parents develop healthy and safe social media usage, saying that age-based curbs do not work as children can bypass them with fake identification documents.</p><small>2026-01-29 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969662/no-appetite-for-war' target='_blank'><strong>No appetite for war</strong></a><br><p>WITH the threat of a new American attack on Iran persisting, many of the Islamic Republic’s neighbours have said they will not allow their territory to be used against Tehran. This is significant as a number of Iran’s neighbours host thousands of American troops, and these states realise that if their territory is used to mount fresh aggression, regional US bases will become targets for Iran.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian have discussed the situation, with the latter saying that Iran welcomes any process that will avoid war. The prince, on the other hand, reiterated that Saudi territory will not be used against Iran.
Earlier, the UAE had also said that it will not allow its facilities to be used against its neighbour across the Gulf.

 

Meanwhile, the Turkish foreign minister has observed that a new American war would be “wrong”, while calling for a diplomatic resolution of the crisis.
But diplomacy does not seem to be on top of US President Donald Trump’s agenda, as his pugnacious remarks on Wednesday indicate. He observed that unless Iran comes to the table, “the next attack will be far worse” than last year’s US-Israeli aggression.
The uneasiness of Iran’s neighbours at the thought of fresh hostilities is understandable. Iranian authorities have said several times that if targeted by foreign aggression, they will reply with full force. They have also said that if neighbouring countries allow their land or airspace to be used, “they will be considered hostile”.
There is clearly no appetite for a new war in the region, apart from the Israelis. Therefore, the US should abandon its threatening posture and regime change plans, and adopt a more conciliatory tone with Iran.

 

The Iranians are willing to talk, but as their foreign minister said yesterday, negotiations “under threat cannot succeed”.
There may still be time to pull back and stop a destructive new war. Mr Trump should listen to regional voices, and approach Iran with respect if he is serious about peace.
However, the Zionist and neocon members of his inner circle appear to be egging on the American leader towards confrontation with the Islamic Republic. If these warmongers have their way, a devastating conflagration may be on the horizon, as the Iranian establishment will consider this an existential battle.

Maaz Mulla, vice president equity sales at Topline Securities, noted that “the sharp decline was primarily triggered by Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited’s result, which disappointed the market as earnings came in below industry expectations due to lower-than-anticipated gross margins”.
Top decliners included Kohinoor Power Company Limited, which dropped to Rs44.60 followed by Said Textile Mills Limited, which fell to Rs36.61, and Kohinoor Industries Limited, which dropped to Rs63.06.
Mulla also noted that “market rumors had built expectations of a stock split or bonus announcement, which did not materialise”. He overall stated that there was a “mismatch between expectations and outcomes led to panic selling, prompting investors to book recent gains and intensifying the sell-off”.

A police statement said several terrorists were also injured in clashes with security forces. The operation was launched in the tehsil’s Sperka and Kotka Akbar Ali Khan area.
During the operation, security forces have targeted militant hideouts with more than 25 quadcopter strikes, while a heavy exchange of fire continues in the area.
The operation is being supervised by senior police and security officials who are also present in the field.
Security forces have cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to arrest terrorists attempting to flee, which is still ongoing.
Continuous surveillance by drones and helicopters is being carried out in the region, indicating the sensitive nature and importance of the operation.
The objective, security forces said, is to completely clear the area and restore law and order.
Meanwhile, local sources said that amid intense firing and fierce clashes, three civilians were killed, including two women. Due to the severity of the fighting, public access to the area remains restricted, and as a result, the bodies are still lying inside their homes.
Separately, MTI spokesperson Muhammad Noman told Dawn that four injured persons were brought to Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital, Bannu Township, including two women and two children.
Earlier this week, two terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with police in Domel area. The police also recovered weapons and ammunition from the possession of the killed militants.
On January 13, armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee in the district.
The incident took place in the Gulbadin Landi Dak area of Bannu district. According to a senior official of the district police, the victims were all travelling in the same vehicle when armed men opened “indiscriminate fire” on them.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
Violence in Bannu has included attacks on police and jirga members, prompting targeted operations by police and security forces in various localities to disrupt militant networks.</p><small>2026-01-29 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647855-pakistan-will-not-join-abraham-accords-stance-on-palestine-unchanged-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan will not join Abraham Accords; stance on Palestine unchanged, says FO</strong></a><br><p>

On the most important day of his four-day visit to China, the first by a British prime minister in eight years, Starmer held an 80-minute summit with Xi at the Great Hall of the People before they lunched together. He will later meet Premier Li Qiang.
“China is a vital player on the global stage, and it’s vital that we build a more sophisticated relationship where we can identify opportunities to collaborate, but of course, also allow a meaningful dialogue on areas where we disagree,” Starmer told Xi at the start of their meeting.



Xi said ties with Britain had gone through “twists and turns” that did not serve the interests of either country and that China stood ready to develop a long-term strategic partnership.
“We can deliver a result that can withstand the test of history,” the Chinese leader said, flanked by his top ministers.
Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the growth it promised, has made improving relations with the world’s second-largest economy a priority, despite lingering misgivings about espionage and human rights.

PM Starmer said “really good progress” had been made on issues including whisky tariffs and visa-free travel during his meeting with Xi.
“We made some really good progress on tariffs for whisky, on visa-free travel to China and on information exchange and cooperation on irregular migration, focusing particularly on small boats and engine parts,” Starmer told reporters, calling it “a very good constructive meeting with real outcomes”.
Starmer is the latest Western leader to engage in a flurry of diplomacy with China, as nations hedge against unpredictability from the United States under President Donald Trump.
Trump’s on-off threats of trade tariffs and pledges to grab control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, have rankled long-standing allies like Britain.







Starmer’s visit immediately follows that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who signed an economic deal with Beijing to tear down trade barriers, drawing Trump’s ire.
Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King’s College London, said he expected a number of deals between Britain and China would be announced to show how their relationship has improved.
Starmer is being accompanied by more than 50 business leaders, another signal that he is seeking economic wins.
The British premier said he raised issues such as the trial of Hong Kong pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai and China’s human rights record during his meeting with Xi.
“We did have a respectful discussion about that, raised those issues as you would expect … It gives us great opportunities, but it also gives us the opportunity to have those discussions about areas where we disagree,” Starmer told reporters in Beijing when asked if the subjects had been raised.
Tackling migrant smuggling gangs
Starmer has adopted a new policy of engagement with China after ties deteriorated for years under previous Conservative governments, when London curbed some Chinese investment over national security worries and expressed concern over a crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong.
“I made the promise 18 months ago, when we were elected into government, that I would make Britain face outwards again,” Starmer told Xi.
“Because, as we all know, events abroad affect everything that happens back in our home countries, to prices on the supermarket shelves to how secure we feel.”
Kemi Badenoch, the leader of Britain’s opposition Conservative Party, said on Wednesday she would not have gone to China because of the security risks the country poses.

British security services have said China routinely spies on the government. China has denied the claims.
In a sign of how the countries can work together, Downing Street said Starmer and Xi would announce that Britain and China would jointly tackle gangs involved in trafficking illegal migrants.
The deal will focus on reducing the use of Chinese-made engines for small boats that transport people across Europe to claim asylum.
British and Chinese officials will share intelligence to identify smugglers’ supply routes and work with Chinese manufacturers to prevent legitimate businesses from being exploited by organised crime, Downing Street said.
After arriving late on Wednesday, Starmer dined at a restaurant in the capital known for its mushroom-laden dishes that also hosted former US treasury secretary Janet Yellen during her 2023 visit.
He practised pronouncing the Chinese word for thank you – “xie xie” – with restaurant staff as he posed for photographs, a video posted on Weibo showed.</p><small>2026-01-29 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/291204583011766.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969717/in-letter-to-shc-cj-sindh-governor-seeks-constitution-of-judicial-commission-for-gul-plaza-inferno' target='_blank'><strong>In letter to SHC CJ, Sindh governor seeks constitution of judicial commission for Gul Plaza inferno</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, in a letter to the Chief Justice of Sindh High Court Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput, has sought the constitution of a judicial inquiry commission in relation to the devastating Gul Plaza blaze in Karachi, it emerged on Thursday.
The development comes amid growing calls from the opposition parties to form an inquiry commission in response to preliminary findings on the incident, which suggested that the fire was caused accidentally by a minor son of the owner of a flower shop.
Jamaat-i-Islami also questioned the probe’s credibility and asked for an independent judicial commission.
The deadly inferno, which erupted on the night of January 17 at the mall and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, has claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
In his letter — dated January 27 and available with Dawn — the Muttahida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader requested the SHC CJ to constitute a judicial inquiry commission to “investigate the Gul Plaza fire incident and to dig out the root cause, negligence facts or violations of law that may have led to this unfortunate occurrence”.
He noted that the incident had “resulted in irreparable loss of precious human lives and caused grave concern among the public at large”.
“Given the gravity of the incident and the widespread public concern, there is a compelling need for a transparent, independent, and credible inquiry to ascertain the causes, regulatory lapses, and any responsibility on the part of individuals or institutions,” Governor Tessori said.
He maintained that inquiry would “contribute towards preventing similar tragedies in future in the larger public interest”.
In his letter, the governor expressed confidence that “an inquiry conducted under the esteemed guidance of the judiciary will help restore public confidence and ensure that justice is served in accordance with law.”
On Wednesday, JI Karachi chief Monem Zafar called for an independent and credible judicial or statutory commission to conduct a thorough investigation, warning that failure to hold those responsible accountable would only pave the way for more disasters in the city.
Earlier in the day, a two-member committee comprising Karachi Commissioner Hasan Naqvi and city police chief Azad Khan, tasked with investigating the Gul Plaza inferno, called on Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and reportedly submitted their report.
Media reports said the report stated that the minor son of a shop owner lit a match while playing inside the shop and threw it without putting it out, due to which the shop caught fire, which then spread to the entire Gul Plaza.</p><small>2026-01-29 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/29105602e713bca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969710/pakistan-armed-forces-undergoing-major-transformation-in-multiple-domains-cdf-munir' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan armed forces undergoing major transformation in multiple domains: CDF Munir</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the armed forces were “undergoing major transformation in multiple domains”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Thursday.
According to an ISPR press release, the army chief made the remarks while addressing troops of the Bahawalpur Garrison at Khairpur Tamewali (KPT) in Punjab, where he witnessed a high-intensity field exercise ‘Steadfast Resolve’.
The corps, based at Bahawalpur Garrison, is a key strike formation of the Pakistan Army. Its area of responsibility includes the southern Punjab desert zone and its order of battle includes multiple divisions. It focuses on modern, technology-enabled, multi-domain operations, often conducting exercises in areas like Khairpur Tamewali.
“COAS & CDF highlighted that Pakistan Armed Forces are undergoing major transformation in multiple domains,” the military’s media affairs wing said.
“Character of war has evolved massively, with technological advancements driving the evolution, dictating huge mental transformation at all tiers,” the army chief observed.
He added: “In the future, technological manoeuvres will replace physical manoeuvres and will fundamentally alter the way offensive and defensive operations are undertaken.”
“Therefore, Pakistan armed forces are embracing and absorbing technology at a rapid pace. In this process, innovation, indigenisation and adaptation shall remain fundamental.”



CDF Munir also lauded the troops’ high morale, professional competence and operational preparedness.
He reaffirmed that the armed forces remain fully prepared to defend the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity “against all threats, emphasising the need to maintain optimum readiness to meet the requirements of future battlefield and security challenges”, the ISPR added.
The ‘Steadfast Resolve’ exercise encompassed the “integration of niche technologies like unmanned aerial systems (drones), advanced surveillance assets, electronic warfare assets and modern command-and-control mechanisms, reflecting the armed forces’ focus on technology-enabled multi-domain operations”, the statement said.

During his visit to Bahawalpur Garrison, Field Marshal Munir was also briefed on “various operational, training and administrative aspects of the Corps, with special focus on preparations for multi-domain warfare”.
Upon his arrival at the garrison, the CDF was received by the Bahawalpur Corps commander. He also laid a floral wreath at the Martyrs’ Monument and offered prayers for the martyrs, paying tribute to their sacrifices.
Earlier, COAS Munir inaugurated the “ROHI eSkills Learning Hub (STP) aimed at promoting digital skills and learning opportunities for students, particularly from southern Punjab and across the country”.
He also inaugurated the APS Abbasia Campus, reaffirming the army’s commitment to “quality education and character building”, the ISPR said.
Field Marshal Munir also visited the EME Regional Workshop, where he was briefed on the maintenance regime to sustain modern platforms through advanced technologies, indigenisation, and other combat support measures.
In August 2025, the Army Rocket Force Command was established to bolster the country’s conventional strike capability. As part of it, the army successfully conducted a training launch of the Fatah-4 cruise missile in September.

 

The army chief has emphasised the importance of technological advancements in modern warfare on multiple occasions.
In December, he highlighted that the multi-domain operations conducted during the conflict with India in May 2025 had now become a textbook example and case study for future warfare.
He also noted that the country needed to keep up with emerging spheres in warfare, such as cyberspace, the electromagnetic spectrum, outer space, information operations, and quantum computing.
Earlier this month, CDF Munir addressed officers at the Lahore Garrison, where he witnessed a “specialised field training exercise showcasing the latest technologies”.
Last week, the army chief visited the National Police Academy in Islamabad, where he stressed that a strong and people-centric police force was indispensable for ensuring internal security and the rule of law.</p><small>2026-01-29 08:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647841-pti-establishment-indirect-contacts-also-freeze-amid-confrontation-politics' target='_blank'><strong>PTI-establishment indirect contacts also freeze amid confrontation politics</strong></a><br><p>

Two US sources familiar with the discussions said Trump wanted to create conditions for “regime change” after a crackdown crushed a nationwide protest movement earlier this month.
To do so, he was looking at options to hit commanders and institutions that Washington holds responsible for the violence, to give protesters the confidence that they could overrun government and security buildings, they said.
One of the US sources said the options being discussed by Trump’s aides also included a much larger strike intended to have a lasting impact, possibly against the ballistic missiles that can reach US allies in the Middle East or its nuclear enrichment programmes.
The other US source said Trump has not yet made a final decision on a course of action, including whether to take the military path.
The arrival of a US aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East this week has expanded Trump’s capabilities to potentially take military action, after he repeatedly threatened intervention over Iran’s crackdown.
Four Arab officials, three Western diplomats, and a senior Western source whose governments were briefed on the discussions said they were concerned that instead of bringing people onto the streets, such strikes could weaken a movement already in shock after the crackdown.
Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute, said that without large-scale military defections, Iran’s protests remained “heroic but outgunned.”
The sources in this story requested anonymity to talk about sensitive matters. Iran’s foreign office, the US Department of Defense and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Israeli Prime Minister’s office declined to comment.
Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons, warning that any future US attack would be more severe than a June bombing campaign against three nuclear sites. He described the ships in the region as an “armada” sailing to Iran.
A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was “preparing itself for a military confrontation, while at the same time making use of diplomatic channels.” However, Washington was not showing openness to diplomacy, the official said.
Iran, which says its nuclear program is civilian, was ready for dialogue “based on mutual respect and interests” but would defend itself “like never before” if pushed, Iran’s mission to the United Nations said in a post on X on Wednesday.







Trump has not publicly detailed what he is looking for in any deal. His administration’s previous negotiating points have included banning Iran from independently enriching uranium and restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles and on Tehran’s network of armed proxies in the Middle East.
Limits of air power
A senior Israeli official with direct knowledge of planning between Israel and the United States told Reuters that Israel does not believe airstrikes alone can topple the Islamic Republic, if that is Washington’s goal.
“If you’re going to topple the regime, you have to put boots on the ground,” he said, noting that even if the United States killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would “have a new leader that will replace him.”
Only a combination of external pressure and an organised domestic opposition could shift Iran’s political trajectory, the official said.
The Israeli official said Iran’s leadership had been weakened by the unrest but remained firmly in control despite the ongoing deep economic crisis that sparked the protests.
Multiple US intelligence reports reached a similar conclusion: that the conditions that led to the protests were still in place, weakening the government, but without major fractures, two people familiar with the matter said.
The Western source said they believed Trump’s goal appeared to be to engineer a change in leadership, rather than “topple the regime,” an outcome that would be similar to Venezuela, where US intervention replaced the president without a wholesale change of government.
Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand deaths during the protests. He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.”
Khamenei retains control but less visible
At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said.
Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran’s security network and big parts of the economy.
However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy — meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran’s foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei.
In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said.
But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions.
Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said.
Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse — not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran’s borders.
A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint.
The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources.
Regional blowback
Gulf states — long‑time US allies and hosts to major American bases — fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen.
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran.
“The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.”
Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Centre said the US deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium.
The most likely outcome is a “grinding erosion — elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession — that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said.
EU set to add Iran’s Guards to terror list after France U-turn
Meanwhile, the European Union is poised to include Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations after France said on Wednesday it would now support the move.
EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests.
“France will support the designation of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the European Union’s list of terrorist organisations,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X.







With France, Italy and Germany now on board, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday, although it does need unanimity among the bloc’s 27 members.
Earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU’s terrorist organisation list, joining the United States.
“The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain,” Barrot said.
The French presidency had earlier announced the decision.
Set up after Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran’s ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.
Cutting ties, fears for citizens in Iran
While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU’s terrorist list, others, led by France, have been more cautious.
They feared such a move could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, and also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons.
Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year.
Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal, given the IRGC’s role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said were tantamount to terrorist activity.
“If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it’s probably a duck, and it’s good to call that out,” said one senior EU diplomat.</p><small>2026-01-29 07:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647835-info-minister-confirms-imran-khan-inspected-at-pims-hospital' target='_blank'><strong>Info minister confirms Imran Khan inspected at Pims hospital</strong></a><br><p>

The island is co-hosting the biennial cricket tournament with India and will hold 20 games between February 7 and March 8.
The Indian and Pakistani teams will play each other at least once, in their Group A clash in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo on February 15.
Cricket matches have long been a stage for expressing political tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, which fought a four-day conflict last year.

 

Sri Lanka has given the “highest priority” to ensuring the tournament runs smoothly and is “paying special attention to the India-Pakistan matches”, sports minister Sunil Kumara Gamage told AFP late on Wednesday.
Elite commando units, usually assigned to guard visiting heads of state, will be deployed to protect all participating teams, police and security officials said.
“From the time they step out of the airport till they return to their aircraft, they will be protected by armed guards,” an official said, asking not to be named.
India and Pakistan have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, opting to play on neutral ground via a hybrid model instead. Hence, for the T20 World Cup, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has shifted their matches to Sri Lanka.
Bangladesh also tried to have their matches moved out of India due to security fears, but the ICC rejected the request.
An angry Bangladesh then withdrew from the tournament, and Scotland were drafted in as their replacement.
Pakistan has indicated that it may yet boycott the event in solidarity with Bangladesh.

 

Sri Lanka maintained a studious silence throughout the India-Bangladesh row.
Cricket Secretary Bandula Dissanayake told AFP Colombo wanted to avoid being drawn into regional disputes.
“In these disputes among India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, we are remaining neutral, all of these are friendly nations,” he said.
But he added that Sri Lanka would be willing to host future tournaments for any of the countries if asked.
Sri Lanka has also used the T20 World Cup as an opportunity to upgrade its international venues.
It has commissioned new floodlights at the Singhalese Sports Club, one of two stadiums in Colombo.
The Pallekele Stadium in Kandy was unaffected by a deadly cyclone that damaged buildings in the region in November, and will host a T20 international between Sri Lanka and England from Friday.</p><small>2026-01-29 06:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647812-pakistan-armed-forces-fully-prepared-to-safeguard-countrys-sovereignty-says-cdf-on-bahawalpur-garrison-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Armed forces fully prepared to safeguard country's sovereignty: CDF</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking at a Security Council open debate on the Palestinian question on Wednesday, Pakistan emphasised that the establishment of “an independent, sovereign, and contiguous state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital” is the ultimate goal supported by the international community and essential for regional stability.
Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said the unresolved Palestinian question lies at the heart of Middle East instability. He highlighted decades of Israeli occupation marked by dispossession, repression, and the denial of Palestinians’ inalienable rights, including self-determination.







Referring to continued Israeli aggression in Gaza, Ahmad noted that over the past two years, the crisis has escalated to an unprecedented scale, causing widespread civilian casualties, mass displacement, near-total destruction of infrastructure, and severe humanitarian deprivation. He stressed that humanitarian needs are growing rapidly.
The ambassador welcomed renewed diplomatic engagement, including the High-Level Conference on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and President Donald Trump’s Peace Plan, endorsed by Security Council resolution 2803. 
He said the second phase of the plan should help consolidate the ceasefire, secure a permanent cessation of hostilities, facilitate transitional arrangements, and enable recovery and reconstruction, while providing humanitarian assistance at scale and preparing the ground for a credible political process toward Palestinian self-determination.
Pakistan, along with other Arab and Islamic countries in the Group of Eight, supports the Board of Peace under resolution 2803, which is intended as a transitional mechanism to consolidate a permanent ceasefire, aid reconstruction in Gaza, and advance a just and lasting peace.







Pakistan has also expressed willingness to participate in the proposed Gaza Stabilisation Force, a US-led multinational initiative to stabilize the territory following the ceasefire.
At the same time, Islamabad has voiced deep concern over continuing tensions. Ambassador Ahmad warned that ceasefire violations persist, civilian lives remain at risk, and pressure on humanitarian organizations impedes aid and protection. 
He strongly condemned Israeli actions against UN facilities, including the recent demolition of a UN compound in Sheikh Jarrah, stressing that such acts undermine stabilization efforts and threaten limited progress. He underlined that UNRWA’s operations remain essential and must be safeguarded.
Outlining Pakistan’s priorities, Ahmad called for full respect for the ceasefire, recovery and reconstruction in Gaza without delay, and the prevention of annexation, forced displacement, or any alteration of the territorial unity of Palestinian territories. 
He urged an immediate end to illegal settlement activity, settler violence, and attempts to alter the demographic, legal, or historical character of the occupied territory, including holy sites, emphasizing that accountability is indispensable for durable peace.
Pakistan has long supported Palestinian self-determination and statehood, consistently advocating a two-state solution in line with UN resolutions and international law.
Concluding his statement, Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed that Pakistan’s solidarity with the Palestinian people “remains firm and unwavering” and called on the Security Council to ensure diplomatic efforts deliver concrete, measurable results for the betterment of Palestinians.</p><small>2026-01-29 04:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/290825327cc6a22.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969650/super-tax-provisions-not-violative-of-fundamental-rights-fcc-holds' target='_blank'><strong>Super tax provisions not violative of fundamental rights, FCC holds</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Disposing of a batch of appeals, petitions and transfer cases, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) has upheld the vires of the super tax, holding that Sections 4B and 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance (ITO) 2001 are neither discriminatory nor violative of fundamental rights.
In a judgement pronounced on Jan 27 and uploaded on Wednesday, the FCC ruled that Section 4B does not create any unreasonable or hostile classification among persons forming the same class. The court held that parliament was fully competent to impose, abolish, remit, alter or regulate such taxes through a Finance Act as part of a Money Bill under Article 73(2)(a) of the Constitution.
The court observed that the classification introduced under Section 4B is income-based, rests on an intelligible differentia and bears a rational nexus with the object sought to be achieved. The provision, it said, suffers from no lack of legislative competence and does not, on its face, transgress any fundamental right warranting judicial invalidation.
The verdict was delivered by a three-judge bench comprising FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Syed Arshad Hussain Shah. The judgement noted that any perceived inequities or hardships arising from the operation of Section 4B fall within the legislative domain and do not, by themselves, justify judicial interference in fiscal matters.

Verdict says parliament can enact laws with retrospective or prospective effect, as long as ‘past and closed transactions’ are not disturbed

The FCC held that Section 4B squarely falls within Entry 47 of Part I of the Fourth Schedule to the Constitution, namely “taxes on income”, and was therefore intra vires. It ruled that Section 4B applies as enacted for tax year 2015 and onwards at the rates prescribed in Division IIA, Part I of the First Schedule to the ITO. Consequently, the decisions of various high courts upholding Section 4B as a validly enacted “tax” were declared to represent the correct position of law.

 

Section 4B was inserted through the Finance Act of 2015 to impose a super tax for the rehabilitation of internally displaced persons on individuals earning more than Rs500 million. Similarly, Section 4C was introduced through the Finance Act, 2022, imposing a super tax on persons earning more than Rs150m from tax year 2022 onwards.
The FCC also declared Section 4C to be intra vires the Constitution and applicable as enacted for tax year 2022 onwards at the rates prescribed in Division IIB, Part I of the First Schedule. The court reaffirmed that the legislature enjoys plenary power to enact laws with retrospective or prospective effect, subject to the caveat that such laws do not disturb past and closed transactions.
The judgement clarified that the closing of accounts for a tax year does not preclude the imposition of a fresh charge where none existed earlier, particularly when returns for tax year 2022 were yet to be filed. Accordingly, the FCC set aside the judgements of the Sindh, Islamabad and Lahore High Courts to the extent they held that Section 4C could not apply retrospectively to tax year 2022.
Rejecting preliminary objections regarding maintainability, the FCC held that it possessed inherent powers to transpose parties for just adjudication. Since the federation was already a respondent, it could be transposed as an appellant. The court also noted that in several pending matters, appeals had been filed by the Federation in addition to the Commissioner Inland Revenue (CIR) and the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), rendering the appeals maintainable.
The FCC set aside the Islamabad High Court’s Pakistan Oilfields judgement of March 15, 2024, insofar as it held that amended rates under Division IIB could not apply retrospectively to tax year 2023. It held that the definition of “income” under Section 4C, including income from all sources, was validly enacted. Consequently, the IHC’s direction to the FBR to issue a nationwide circular to implement its order was declared to be without jurisdiction.
The court ruled that super tax under Section 4C is a standalone tax on income, independent of the tax levied under Section 4 of the ITO, and therefore applies to capital gains under Section 37A as well. However, in the case of exploration and production (E&P) companies, Sections 4B and 4C will apply only to the extent that they do not exceed the aggregate tax rates stipulated under the Fifth Schedule and relevant petroleum concession agreements.
The FCC held that Section 4C would not apply to E&P companies where it would result in taxation exceeding the threshold prescribed in Rule 4 of the Fifth Schedule, nor would it override exemptions granted to benevolent and provident funds. In the case of banking companies, Section 4C will apply from tax year 2023 onwards at rates amended by the Finance Act, 2023.

In a statement, the power division said the minister had taken notice of the “non-crediting of units of net-metering consumers under PPMC instructions”, which had been reviewed “with immediate effect”.
Informed sources said power distribution companies (Discos) had complained that some net-metered solar consumers — commonly referred to as “prosumers” — had installed solar systems significantly larger than permitted under the rules, which allow generation capacity up to 150 per cent of sanctioned load. The Discos argued that such installations created challenges for grid stability and financials.
They said the PPMC had directed Discos and the Power Information Technology Company (PITC), which handles billing for all Discos, to stop counting export units for consumers found to have exceeded the allowed capacity, instead of denying the benefit of only extra units exported beyond the authorised capacity.

Leghari intervenes as govt comes under criticism for violating its own policy

Sources said implementation of the directive led to the blocking of credit for all exported units for affected consumers, including a number of influential politicians and businessmen, among them leading parliamentarians.

 

Most of them belonged to Lahore, where the Lahore Electric Supply Company’s first billing cycle immediately coincided with the application of PPMC’s notification, followed by other Discos as well.
A large number of bills on the first three days after the Jan 23 notification caused a lot of hue and cry in Lahore, although there were fewer complaints in other Discos, including Islamabad Electric.
The power minister had to intervene for damage control as the government came under criticism for violating its own policy for renewable energy through a unilateral notification without stakeholder consultation or approval from any competent forum.
Mr Leghari directed that consumers who had already received their bills should be corrected in next month’s billing and stop issuing fresh bills to remaining consumers at the outset. In addition, only extra units beyond authorised capacity should not be credited in favour of prosumers.
The power division said some net metering consumers had installed systems with capacities exceeding the approved limit under their licences for distributed generation capacity.
“Last month, a number of such consumers were not given any credit for the electricity sold to the national grid,” it confirmed and conceded that “this practice was not correct”.
Mr Leghari reiterated commitment to securing consumers’ rightful entitlements without any compromise, the statement said. Under the revised directives, only those units exceeding the approved capacity will not be credited.
Units exported to the national grid within the approved capacity would now be credited accordingly as before, it said, adding that instructions had been issued to all Discos for implementation.
“For consumers whose net metering units were not credited in their bills, the relevant adjustments will be made in the next billing cycle,” it said.

The department updated its travel advisory for Pakistan on Jan 26, advising travellers to think twice before visiting due to crime, civil unrest, terrorism, and the risk of kidnapping. 
Pakistan has been placed under a Level 3 advisory, a category that indicates a high risk where terrorist attacks may occur without warning. According to the State Department, typical targets include “transportation hubs, hotels, markets, shopping malls, military and security sites, airports, trains, schools, hospitals, places of worship, tourist locations, and government buildings”.
Some regions, including parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, have been designated Level 4: Do Not Travel areas. 
The advisory urges US citizens not to travel to Level 4 areas “for any reason”, warning that assassination and kidnapping attempts are common, particularly against government officials and private citizens. The warning also applies to US citizens of Pakistani origin.
The State Department noted that local laws prohibit demonstrations without a permit and warned that “US citizens have been detained for participating” in such activities.
A Level 3 advisory indicates “serious risks to safety”, and travelers are advised to reconsider their travel plans. Level 4 is the highest advisory level and discourages all travel.
