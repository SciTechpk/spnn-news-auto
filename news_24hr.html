Here’s what their report says</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan — who is suffering from an eye ailment leading to loss of vision in his right eye — was examined by a team of doctors at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday. The party had rejected the inspection conducted in the absence of his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”.
On Monday, the law minister allayed concerns Imran’s vision loss, saying that there was “nothing as such to worry about”. Meanwhile, the doctors who examined the former premier in jail released a two-page report on Monday.
According to the report, a copy of which is available with Dawn, a medical report comprising the following eye specialists examined Imran on February 15; Dr Prof Nadeem Qureshi, the head of the vitreoretinal department at the Al-Shifa Trust Eye Hospital in Rawalpindi, and Dr Prof Dr M Arif, the head of the opthalmology department at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad.



The report stated that unaided, Imran’s right eye had 6/24 partial vision and 6/9 in the left. It said that with glasses, the ex-premier’s vision was 6/9 partial in the right and 6/6 in the left.
6/6 vision means that a person can see at 6 metres what a person with normal vision can see at 6 metres. 6/9 vision means that a person can see at 6 metres what a person with normal vision can see at 9 metres.
The doctors also conducted a slit lamp examination, which, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is a common test an eye specialist will use to check overall eye health.
The test showed that the “cornea was clear bilaterally” and “no cells in the anterior chamber”.
The report further stated that in the right eye, the vitreous was clear with a “few fibrillar opacities seen, no cells appreciated”.
“Mild intragel haemorrhage seen at 6 o’clock periphery,” it said. It further noted “disc hyperemic and vessels engorged” and “cup obliterated”.
“Moderately dense retinal haemorrhages in all four quadrants. Four to five cotton wool spots seen in different quadrants,” it said. “Resolving macular oedema seen. Foveal contour visible. Retina is attached,” it said.
According to the Mayo Clinic, oedema is swelling caused by too much fluid trapped in the body’s tissues. The macula, according to the Cleveland Clinic, is what lets a person see small details and focus on very specific aspects of what they are looking at.
In comparison, according to the report, in Imran’s left eye, the macula and periphery were “clear”, “no lattice” and the retina was attached.
The doctors also conducted an optical coherence tomography (OCT) test, a non-invasive imaging test where light waves are used to take cross-sectional pictures of the retina.
The test showed that in the right eye, the macular oedema was “resolving and reduced”.
“Central macular thickness reduced from 550 to 350 (improved),” it added. It further stated that the left eye was “within normal limits”.
In the report, the doctors advised Nevanac eyedrops (twice a day for both eyes), Co-sopt eyedrops (twice a day for the right eye) and Systane ultra eyedrops (three times a day for both eyes).
Nevanac eyedrops are anti-inflammatory drops for pain in the eye; Co-spot eyedrops are used for the treatment of elevated intraocular pressure; and Systane ultra are artificial tears for dry eyes.
“Second dose of anti-VEGF may be given as per schedule. However, vision has improved from 6/36 to 6/9 partial in the involved eye which is substantially good vision at this stage,” the report said.



According to the American Academy of Opthalmology, an anti-VGEF treatment reduces leaking abnormal blood vessels in the retina. This slows or stops damage from the abnormal blood vessels and slows down vision loss and may also improve vision.
It further advised optical coherence tomography angiography and a fundus fluorescein angiography for the premier.
According to the report, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and Opposition Leader in the Senate Allama Raja Nasir Abbas visited Pims on Sunday for a follow-up on Imran’s examination in Adiala jail.
It said that the two doctors, Dr Qureshi and Dr Khan “briefed them in detail on the current health condition” of Imran, while the board members also briefed Imran’s personal physicians, Dr Asim Yousaf and Dr Khurram Mirza, over a phone call lasting more than 25 minutes “to the extent of their satisfaction”.
“After a detailed briefing, leaders and personal physicians expressed their full satisfaction and confidence over the treatment given so far and follow-up advice recommended by the team of senior doctors,” the report said.</p><small>2026-02-16 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/161642150143a39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973692/pti-leader-latif-khosa-writes-to-cjp-raises-concerns-over-imrans-medical-check-up-at-adiala-jail-in-secrecy' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leader Latif Khosa writes to CJP, raises concerns over Imran’s medical check-up at Adiala jail in ‘secrecy’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: PTI leader Latif Khosa wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi on Monday, voicing concerns over the medical examination of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan in “secrecy” at the Adiala jail on February 15 (Sunday).
A team of doctors conducted the former premier’s medical check-up a day ago, following the Supreme Court’s directives that a medical team should be constituted to examine him before February 16 (today). The directive was issued after the court was informed that Imran had only 15pc vision left in his right eye.
However, the PTI rejected the check-up conducted without his family and personal physicians.
In his letter, Khosa raised concerns to this end, identifying himself as a counsel for Imran in a plea pertaining to the Toshakhana case against his client.
He said Imran’s medical examination in “secrecy, without notice to the family or independent doctors, has given rise to serious apprehensions”.
“The continued exclusion of the petitioner’s family and personal medical practitioners from information concerning his health has created unavoidable doubts. Such secrecy not only undermines confidence in the medical process but is also causing unrest and distress among his family members, friends and supporters,” the letter, seen by Dawn, stated.
Khosa underlined in the letter that Imran was 73 years old, and “his advancing age and declining health are matters of grave concern not only for his family but for the people of Pakistan at large”.
“Being one of the most widely supported political leaders in the country, public interest in his wellbeing is natural and unavoidable. Yet, despite this, he remains deprived of basic human necessities during a period when his medical condition demands care and transparency,” he added.
He further said that “for the past few months, reports have surfaced across Pakistan raising serious concerns regarding the deterioration of the petitioner’s eyesight and overall health”.
“These reports, coupled with the continued denial of access to family members, have created deep uncertainty.”
In these circumstances, Khosa continued, the SC was approached for relief and appointed Barrister Salman Safdar as a “friend of the court” on February 10, permitting him to visit Imran in jail.
Barrister Safdar was asked to submit a report detailing Imran’s living conditions and health status after the visit, Khosa recalled, adding that he subsequently submitted the report to the SC on February 11.
“The report confirms that the petitioner has been left with only approximately 15pc vision in his right eye. It further records, particularly paragraph 8, that despite the petitioner’s repeated complaints of blurred and hazardous vision, no timely or adequate medical intervention was undertaken by the jail authorities, which ultimately resulted in complete loss of his vision in one eye,” Khosa claimed in his letter.
Terming these findings “alarming”, Khosa noted that Imran was medically examined at the Adiala jail on Sunday.
“Shockingly, the said examination was carried out in the complete absence of his family members, personal doctors, or legal representatives. No prior intimation was given to them regarding the said medical checkup,” he claimed.
He further brought it to the CJP’s attention that it was being “claimed in certain quarters that the family and party members were informed but voluntarily chose not to attend [the examination]”.
“These assertions are wholly incorrect and unrealistic. At no stage were the petitioner’s family members, personal physicians or counsel were informed. In fact, when the petitioner’s sisters approached the authorities, they were denied access.
“Instead, a panel of handpicked doctors was formed to conduct the examination. The petitioner’s personal doctors, family members, and legal team were denied access,” he maintained.
Khosa highlighted that Imran, on the other hand, had “repeatedly sought access to his personal doctors, namely Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yousaf, for independent examination and treatment of his deteriorating eye condition”.
He also mentioned in the letter that Imran was taken into custody on August 5, 2023 and initially kept at District Jail in Attock. He was moved to the Adiala jail after around three months and had been incarcerated there since.
“Throughout this prolonged period of incarceration, his fundamental and statutory rights have consistently been violated. While earlier his family members and close associates were permitted to meet him in accordance with jail rules, it has now been over four to five months that no meeting has been allowed. His family has effectively been denied access to him,” Khosa complained in the letter.
He requested the CJP to direct the relevant authorities to provide an attested copy of Imran’s medical report of his examination conducted on February 15.

 

The report was released today.
Khosa also sought permission for Imran to be provided immediate access to his personal doctors, including Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yousaf, for his independent medical examination and treatment.
The PTI lawyer further requested the CJP to issue directives for moving Imran to “Al-Shifa Hospital for immediate treatment of his ailment, which clearly cannot be adequately treated within Central Jail, Rawalpindi”.
He also asked the court to “direct that the petitioner’s family members be duly informed and granted reasonable access regarding his medical condition and any future medical condition”.
Concerns regarding Imran’s health increased after he underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 10, last week submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living conditions in the prison.
In his report, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6/6 vision in both eyes”.
While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying.
A medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC.
It stated that a qualified ophthalmologist from Pims conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala jail of Imran and a “diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made”.
This was then followed by Imran undergoing medical treatment at Pims.</p><small>2026-02-16 12:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16144734f871d62.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973658/nothing-to-worry-about-law-minister-allays-concerns-over-imrans-vision-loss' target='_blank'><strong>‘Nothing to worry about’: Law minister allays concerns over Imran’s vision loss</strong></a><br><p>Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on Monday allayed concerns over PTI founder Imran Khan’s vision loss, saying that there was “nothing as such to worry about”.
The statement comes days after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that Imran had only 15pc vision left in his right eye, prompting the apex court to form a medical team to examine him before February 16 (today).
Subsequently, a team of five doctors arrived at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Sunday, where the ex-premier is incarcerated, and carried out a detailed eye examination, took blood samples and checked his blood pressure. However, the PTI rejected the check-up conducted without his family and personal physicians.
Addressing Bar Association Ferozewala in Punjab’s Shahdara on Monday, Tarar referred to the “latest report that had to be submitted” regarding Imran’s health.

 

The minister added that he discussed it with Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan and the “relevant” individuals before coming to the bar association.
Tarar stated: “They said thanks to God, the examination was carried out again on the Supreme Court’s order and there is no such thing about 35 or 25 [per cent].
“If he uses glasses for his eyesight, then one eye is approximately 70pc fine and the other eye is 6/6. There is nothing as such to worry about.”
According to the Cleveland Clinic, having 6/6 vision or 20/20 vision means you see the world with normal clarity and sharpness.
Before commenting on Imran’s health, Tarar stressed the need to “pay attention to our national issues”.
“We took difficult financial decisions, but the fruits of those can be seen now,” he stated, asserting that Pakistan was now “performing way better economically”.
The law minister stressed that political stability was crucial for economic stability. “There is a lot of noise these days that what is about happen and what has been done to the PTI founder,” he noted.
Addressing the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, Tarar said it was the “first time that a government was taking official measures to deprive the citizens of their rights”.
He then referred to the blockades of major roads and KP’s entry and exit points by PTI protests, which have cut off the province from the rest of the country.

 

“Article 15 [of the Constitution] allows freedom of movement, but the blockage of motorways and GT Road on the official level is unconstitutional,” the law minister pointed out.
He expressed the hope that the PTI would “rectify” the situation itself after looking at the latest report. “Otherwise, the federal government will have to take some action,” Tarar warned.
He further said it was the responsibility of PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, to “ensure that the KP government adheres to the Constitution”.
Imran’s physician urges authorities to allow access
Meanwhile, Imran’s long-time personal physician Dr Aasim Yusuf released a video statement, saying that last night he spoke on the telephone to the two Islamabad-based eye doctors who were treating the ex-premier for his eye condition.
He said he asked his colleague, Dr Khurram Azam Mirza, a Lahore-based retinal specialist, to join the phone call.







Dr Yusuf said that the phone call lasted 40 minutes, during which the doctors provided a background of when they first examined Imran, what his symptoms were, details of the treatment prescribed and what the future treatment plan.
“Their latest assessment was yesterday afternoon … they told us that, in their view, Imran had shown significant improvement as a result of treatment and his vision had improved significantly as well,” he said.
“I would be extremely happy if I was able to confirm that this was the case. Unfortunately, because I have not seen him myself and have not been able to participate in his care or talk to him, I am unable to either confirm or deny the veracity of what we have been told,” he said.
Dr Yusuf appealed to the authorities to allow him or Dr Faisal Sultan, ideally both of them, and physicians nominated by Imran’s family to examine the ex-premier and participate in his care.
He also called for Imran to be treated at the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad, saying that it was “appropriately equipped and of a suitable standard” for treating the PTI founder.
CRVO in Imran’s right eye
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on February 10, last week submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living conditions in the prison.
In his report, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6/6 vision in both eyes”.

It stated that a qualified ophthalmologist from Pims conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiala jail of Imran and a “diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made”.
This was then followed by Imran undergoing medical treatment at Pims.
The ex-premier’s family and the PTI have been demanding that he be moved to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital for a comprehensive check-up, with the opposition even staging a sit-in at Parliament House for the past four days.</p><small>2026-02-16 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1617201334cbe9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973695/travel-why-thailand-is-perfect-for-travelling-parents-with-little-ones' target='_blank'><strong>Travel: Why Thailand is perfect for travelling parents with little ones</strong></a><br><p>My travelogue has had a recent makeover. The itinerary now insists on including clean bathrooms, feeding areas, and a prospective diaper change station. Even though these recent life developments had me apprehensive to venture back out into the world, I slowly started to identify and appreciate how family-friendly most cities in the world had become when I was not paying attention.
It was a bit like that car spotting phenomenon. You know the one where, when you notice a particular brand and model of a car, they start to appear everywhere. Similarly, once I braved back out into the world, I started to realise how much the world had to offer to travelling parents with children. It’s still a work-in-progress, but at least it was much better than what my fears had me convinced.
As the first international travel location, my personal preference was to start with a place that was already familiar. I could not look past Thailand.

On a global scale, when you do the math for budget, accommodation, food and shopping and build a travel itinerary, I think anyone in any stage in life would find it hard pressed to find a better alternative to Thailand. When you add children to the mix, it becomes even more appealing.

Firstly, let’s tackle where to go in Thailand. Bangkok or one of the islands, or both?
I would recommend Bangkok as the first stop to ease into the holiday season with modern facilities and an endless supply of 7-Elevens for any need at any hour of the day. A couple of days to get your bearings before you shoot off to your island holiday.
Although any number of island combinations could work as your first holiday, my recommendation includes two options. One for families with really young children and zero energy to plan or think. Another option for families on the path to recovery is some off the off-the-beaten-track adventures. Let’s go!
BKK + Phuket
Let’s face it, Bangkok has a reputation. If a certain portrayal in the Hangover movie is to be believed, what would have been its entertaining and exciting prospect pre-children would now terrorise the same adults and make them want to stay away.
In my opinion, though, the movie underestimates Bangkok’s diversity and capability to segregate trouble and keep it tied to specific locations only.
Most of this city actually offers a safe passage to most on a quick stopover, as also indicated by female solo travellers, marking it as one of the safer cities that can be enjoyed on your own. I place tremendous value on female and marginalised lenses on travel, especially when it comes to safety. With that in mind, let’s scope out the general must-sees!
Wherever you start in Bangkok, and I do hope you can find a suitable accommodation as close to the Nana MRT as possible, as most attractions pan out from that area. I would start my day by purchasing an MRT ticket, get off at Asok and make my way to Terminal 21, a more spread-out shopping mall.
The various exits also offer additional walking time while staying within air-conditioned zones, an important requirement on your first day, to acclimatise. The food options inside the mall are also varied and include some of the best hygienic dessert options.
If you are like me and cannot walk inside a mall without some kind of bubble, boba or sago drink in hand, then look no further and head straight to YenlyYours in Terminal 21.
This is an absolute mango heaven! Besides its smoothies and floats, the dessert options include mango sticky rice, of course, but also the lesser-promoted “treasures” such as mango mochi, mango cheese tart, and mango crepe.
Once you have checked mango off your list, move on to Pier 21 for a pad Thai with prawn wrapped in egg.
If you are a pram-pushing daredevil, by all means tick off the mandatory locations such as Khao San Road, the Floating Market and Arab Street; all the more power to you! However, if you would like to play it safe on your first trip while continuing to partake in the best of the city, I would suggest an alternate route to old BKK.
Rattanakosin is the historic heart of Bangkok. Most people associate it with all the Wats or temples it has to offer, but for me, this is where the real hidden charm of Bangkok lies, like the old parts of most cities, I suppose, being the source of origin.
The bank of the Chao Phraya is magical, and the cafes and restaurants lining this part of the city are unforgettable. Each restaurant has a history and old photographs you can peruse while you eat.
A full day spent in this part of Bangkok, traversing between the many Wats, ferried across in one of the canal boats and ending the day, watching the sunset from the Eagle Nest rooftop, can easily make one forget about the chaos of the city centre.
Once you and your baby have recovered from the flight, it’s time for island hopping!

Phuket
I chose Phuket because, whilst there are plenty of other secluded islands that can offer an experience a thousand times better than here, it is the sheer convenience of Phuket that I find unmatchable. Here, you don’t have to forego the natural beauty to satisfy comfort.
Nearly all resorts are built to attract families with children. You can choose any number of resorts along that coastline, whether it be Centara, Marriott, or Holiday Inn, suiting your budget; you are guaranteed a world within a world.
With a variety of children’s activities offered through the kids’ clubs, several splash pools and most restaurants catering to children, some offering freshly prepared meals specific to toddlers, whilst tired mummies are whisked away for the perfect foot massage or backrub next to the ocean, this is the family holiday we all deserve.
Whilst I have been busy blowing Phuket’s horn, the memory of another island begs to be mentioned. This is Koh Lanta, where I had once disappeared to during a challenging work assignment and had left after a couple of days feeling like a new person.
This island feels like being cradled into nature’s arms like no other, ushering in peace, tranquillity and safety. Please look it up if that’s the need of the hour. Otherwise, the newly reenergised army of parents, look this way with your slightly older kids, for an adventure away to Chiang Mai!

Chiang Mai
Head to the Elephant Parade with your kiddy entourage and learn the story about the father and son duo, who brought this place into existence when they fell in love with a certain baby elephant called Mosha during their holiday in Thailand.

Have you heard of cocoon farms, no? Then your next stop should be to the Thai Silk Village for a hands-on workshop on silk weaving.

A visit to Chiang Mai is not complete without at least a day spent at Baan Kang Wat, a tucked away art village, yes, guilty as charged — also in the Old Town streets of Chiang Mai.
Every inch of this place is Instagram-worthy and one of the best family day outs you can have. While the kiddos can enjoy a painting workshop, you can take your tired feet across for a cup of joe and a slice of cake at Graph. If you happen to peek inside one of the art studios, coffee in hand, some of the artists might let you watch as they work.
If you are anything like me, an out-and-out urban parent, Chiang Mai also offers a wonderful opportunity at glamping! You have heard me right, this is the newest stage in your camping journey, for those who are taken by the idea without being equipped with the logistics (and let’s face it, the guts!) that camping demands.
Once you have had your fair share of café hopping, night markets and kayaking adventures, you might want to end your trip by taking a stroll to the Thapae Gate of the Old City Walls to take to the shores of the Ping River to watch thousands of people release their krathongs or paper-based lanterns into the water.
Alternatively, arrange for a day-trip to Nong Bua Pra Chao Luang lotus lake to watch thousands do the same, but in this case, releasing the lanterns into the sky, and totally for free!

The premier made the remarks while addressing the Pakistan-Austria Business Forum in Vienna, where he arrived a day earlier for a two-day official visit.
Addressing the forum, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan was “absolutely” against illegal immigration, and gave assurance that the government of Pakistan was “working with our European friends — Austria, France, and Germany — to jointly ban this illegal immigration [and bring it] to a grinding halt”.
He affirmed that Pakistan would fulfil Austria’s “demand for skilled labour” as per the international certification required by it.
Every year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities.
A 2023 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the European Union (EU) found that 24,000 Pakistanis entered EU countries illegally over the past three years.
At the outset of his address, the premier stressed that Pakistan and Austria shared “long-standing friendly relations”.
The premier outlined the areas in which the two countries remained “proactively engaged”, including mining and minerals and renewable energy.
He detailed that he held meetings with the leadership of Austria, stating that he aims “to take many of these discussions to their logical conclusion”.
He noted that 6o per cent of Pakistan’s population was young and “needed modern training in their hands, including laptops, AI, and IT-led initiatives”.
PM Shehbaz further added that Pakistan held “huge potential” in the field of agriculture.
“Here, Austria can be a great partner, providing Pakistan with experience and modern technology to have value-addition in the field of citrus root, and make marmalade, juices and export them to Austria, the Middle East and other parts of the world”, the premier added.
PM presented guard of honour at Austrian Chancellery
PM Shehbaz began his two-day visit to Austria as he arrived at the Austrian Chancellery today, where he was presented with a guard of honour and welcomed by Austria’s Federal Chancellor Christian Stocker, the Prime Minister’s Office said.







The statement said that the national anthems of both countries were played at the arrival, and both leaders “introduced their respective delegations to each other before proceeding for tête-à-tête and the delegation-level talks, wherein both sides will take stock of the entire gamut of bilateral relations”.
PM Shehbaz also penned his remarks in the guest book at the Chancellery.
The premier is accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and one of his aides, Tariq Fatemi, during the two-day visit.
This visit marks 70 years of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
In its statement issued on Sunday, the Foreign Office (FO) noted that the trip marked “the first visit by a Pakistani prime minister to Austria in over three decades, the last having been undertaken by the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 1992”.</p><small>2026-02-16 12:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16171634555899d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973694/kp-living-in-the-stone-age-says-punjab-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>KP living in the stone age, says Punjab CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday said that the PTI-led Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was living in the stone age, critising the province’s government for not taking steps for development in the age of technology.
Addressing a laptop distribution scheme at a Gujrat university, CM Maryam highlighted that students in Punjab had access to Honhaar scholarships, laptop schemes, Parwaz Card, green buses and technical training programmes.
“So there is Honhaar here, and incitement there, but this is nothing to rejoice about,” she said, adding that she was extremely upset that the “people of KP were still living in the stone age”.
Maryam stated: “They do not know what development is. They do not realise that Honhaar scholarships also exist if one does not have the resources for their child’s studies.
“They do not know that you must have a gadget or a laptop or an iPad or a computer in your hands if you are to meet global standards in today’s age.”







Indirectly noting that the PTI had been in power in KP for the past “13 years”, she said the public there “does not even know what development is”.
The chief minister quipped that the KP government’s response to every need was that it was providing them “awareness”.
Maryam emphasised that blocking major roads in KP did not affect the businesses in Punjab but rather the economic activity of KP itself.



During her address, Maryam also recalled the time when her mother Kulsoom Nawaz was hospitalised due to cancer in 2017 and 2018, as well as when her father and ex-premier Nawaz Sharif was ill during his imprisonment in 2019.
Noting that Nawaz was in his 70s when he was jailed, the Punjab CM said, “He got sick after multiple heart attacks and his platelets dropped. He had cardiac pain [but] such a joke was made out of his ailment.”
She continued: “When my father and I were in jail, my mother was diagnosed with cancer and her disease was ridiculed so much; it was even said that she was not sick and it is all a drama.”
Maryam then recalled that Kulsoom was on a ventilator in a London hospital when certain individuals “entered the ICU through deception by wearing doctors’ uniforms to verify whether it was true or false”.

 

“When my mother passed away, my father said, ‘One has to die to prove their innocence here’,” she said, adding that she was in a jail cell when Nawaz informed her about Kulsoom’s death.
The PML-N leader then played some old video clips of ex-premier Imran Khan from when he was in power. In the clips, the PTI founder threatened to get the TV and air conditioner removed from the prisons of the PML-N leadership.
Maryam asserted: “I am swearing by God that till today, neither I nor Nawaz Sharif or Shehbaz Sharif even thought of removing his AC or shutting off his food and TV.
“In fact, Nawaz Sharif said one day that he (Imran) has one AC, give him two ACs as he should not face any problems.”







She further said she was the “first woman” to be locked in the National Accountability Bureau’s (NAB) jail and a cell had to be vacated for her as they did not have a dedicated women’s prison.
The Punjab CM then played another video of ex-PM Imran, wherein he commented on the “long list” of health issues Nawaz was facing.
“You can have differences on policies and policies, but you cannot turn political disagreements into personal enmities,” Maryam emphasised.
“My children, you must never do this,” she told the audience, referring to the actions taken by the PTI government of jailing PML-N leadership and “making fun” of the ailments.

 

“The time circles back, but my father was telling me at dinner the other day to never wish bad for even one’s political opponents,” she said.
“You all must not do what he or his party is doing,” the politician stressed. “Those who are ill, we pray that God may give them recovery soon,” she added.
Speaking on Imran’s current health issues, Maryam said, “The kind of facilities and the doctors he needs are being provided to him, and I am telling you this on oath that no one wishes ill for him.”
She called for lies, accusations, incitement, vandalism and fitna to be “thrown out” of politics.

Field Marshal Munir made the remarks during a meeting with the Deputy Ruler of Abu Dhabi and National Security Adviser Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan, during which they discussed “ways to further strengthen bilateral cooperation across various sectors, particularly in the fields of economic collaboration, investment and security,” according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The two leaders also “exchanged views on regional developments and emphasised the importance of continued coordination to promote peace and stability in the region,” ISPR added.
Field Marshal Munir, during the meeting, “expressed his sincere appreciation and gratitude to the government of the UAE for its longstanding investments and continued support to Pakistan’s economy and security over the decades”.
As per ISPR, the army chief “noted that such support reflects the deep-rooted historical relations between the two brotherly countries and commended the constructive role of the UAE leadership in advancing economic and social development in Pakistan”.
During the meeting, the field marshal reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to continuing joint efforts to “further strengthen this partnership in all fields, in a manner that serves the interests of both brotherly peoples and contributes to peace, stability, and prosperity in the region”.
Pakistan and UAE maintain close bilateral relations. Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held a telephone call with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, lauding the Gulf country’s “consistent and unwavering support to Pakistan”.
Last month, Field Marshal Munir met UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at Qasr Al Shati Palace, where the two reviewed bilateral cooperation between the two countries.</p><small>2026-02-16 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651128-cdf-asim-munir-expresses-gratitude-lauds-uae-for-investment-support-to-economy' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Asim Munir expresses gratitude, lauds UAE for investment support to economy</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement by the police, the blast occurred when a time bomb planted in a motorcycle detonated. A child was among those killed in the explosion.
Police sources said the blast took place near shops located in front of the station. Although police personnel remained unharmed, civilians in the vicinity were caught in the blast. Several of the injured are reported to be in critical condition.
Medical Teaching Institution (MTI) spokesperson, Muhammad Noman Khattab, stated that the victims were brought to District Headquarters Hospital and Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital.
Rescue 1122 officials said emergency teams promptly reached the scene and moved the bodies and injured to nearby hospitals.
Following the incident, a heavy contingent of the Bannu police reached the scene, along with the Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) and the Quick Response Force (QRF).
Police and security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation, added the police statement. Evidence is being collected and an investigation has been initiated.
The BDS team also engaged in clearing the affected site “to ensure timely and effective prevention of any possible further threat”, the police statement said.
Meanwhile, Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan visited the hospital and enquired after the injured, it said.
Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security forces coming under attack amid a broader surge in militant violence.
In January, two boys were injured in an explosion in the Domel area of Bannu, one of whom succumbed to his injuries after two weeks.
Earlier that month, the former nazim of Domel, Fida Muhammad Khan Wazir, was injured in a bomb blast outside his office.</p><small>2026-02-16 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6992507ac2f96.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973497/kp-remains-cut-off-from-rest-of-country-as-pti-continues-protest' target='_blank'><strong>KP remains cut off from rest of country as PTI continues protest</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained cut off from rest of the country on Sunday as activists of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf continued their protest on third consecutive day and blocked all entry and exit points of the province.
The PTI activists have blocked Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway at Swabi’s Anbar Interchange, GT Road at Khairabad Bridge, Dera Ismail Khan-Bhakkar Road, Lakki Marwat-Mianwali Road, Hazara Motorway at Abbottabad-Havelian Interchange, Kohat-Pindi Road near Khushal Garh and Upper Kohistan-Gilgit Karakoram Highway.
Protesters remained present all the time at exit and entry points and did not allow a single vehicle to enter the province, causing serious problems to passengers and motorists destined to Islamabad and other parts of the country.
Former governor Shah Farman, PTI Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem, deputy secretary information Ikram Khattana and other leaders of the party were present at Khairabad Bridge, connecting Attock district of Punjab with KP.

Commuters, motorists face hardships

Protesters have been demanding of the government to shift PTI founder Imran Khan from jail to hospital for treatment of his eye by doctors of his choice.
Speaking on the occasion, Shah Farman said that under Article-4 of the Constitution, no authority could deny treatment of his choice to a patient. He said that the people, who were not allowing treatment of Imran Khan through doctors of his choice, would be responsible if his eye was further damaged.
PTI workers blocked Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway near Swabi Interchange to all types of traffic, vowing to stay on roads till Imran Khan was shifted to hospital for medical treatment.
Vendors were seen selling various eatables while setting up stalls on motorway, converting it into a market. PTI Swabi general secretary Afsar Khan told journalists that they were not ready to go back homes under any circumstances.
“We will continue to sit here and if our demand is not accepted. This protest will continue. The federal government is responsible for the prevailing mess in the country,” he said.
Stranded commuters said that government should take action against PTI workers to open the motorway to traffic because people, especially patients, were facing difficulties.
“Where should we go, who should we beg, who should we ask and who should we request to open the motorway,” questioned Shahzad Khan, a resident of Peshawar.
Uzair Khan, a resident of Gundam who was seriously injured in a firing incident on Saturday, was not allowed to reach a hospital in Peshawar through motorway. The circumstances forced his family to pass through Swabi and Mardan but he did not reach hospital and passed away.
His relatives said that PTI workers were responsible for his death. During the last three days, it has been observed, that there is no rush at daytime at the venue of protest. In the afternoon youth start to arrive at rest area and in the evening there is a lot of crowd on motorway.
PTI workers blocked roads at four key points in Dera Ismail Khan district on Sunday, suspending traffic and causing inconvenience to commuters and motorists.
The sit-ins were held on Bhakkar Road, Multan Road, Chashma Road and CPEC route, bringing vehicular movement to a standstill at these locations. As a result, long queues of vehicles were seen on major arteries.
Witnesses said that several commuters remained stranded for hours, while alternative routes also experienced heavy congestion due to diverted traffic. The protest is being held on the call of PTI central leaders, who have urged workers to demonstrate over the deteriorating health of Imran Khan and demand his immediate release.
The district administration was monitoring the situation while residents called for restoration of traffic flow to ease their hardships.
PTI activists continued protest demonstrations in Lakki Marwat and Karak districts on the second consecutive day on Sunday.
A good number of party workers led by former district nazim Ishfaq Ahmad Khan Minakhel gathered at Darra Tang Point where they closed Bannu-Mianwali road, linking KP with Punjab and Islamabad via CPEC route.
The closure of road on the second consecutive day troubled transporters and commuters as passenger and good transport vehicles queued up on both sides of the main artery.
On the occasion, the former district nazim said that denial of access to healthcare and maltreatment by federal government had led to loss of Imran’s vision. He said that PTI activists had come on roads to hold peaceful protests against the PML-N government, which was responsible for the poor health of their party leader.
In Karak, the PTI workers gathered outside Nashapa oil and gas field and staged a sit-in there. They stopped supply from the oil and gas field as oil tankers could not enter or come out of the area.
An official of district administration confirmed disruption of oil supply from the field. PTI district president Inayat Khattak said that leaders and workers of the party decided in a meeting to shut down oil and gas fields in Makori, Nashapa and Gurguri to record their protest against non-provision of treatment facilities to Imran Khan.

The election was the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. Rahman is a scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties.
In a statement issued today, the FO said that Iqbal will represent Pakistan at the oath-taking ceremony, which is scheduled to be held on February 17 in Dhaka.







FO added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was unable to attend “due to a prior overseas engagement.”
“Pakistan’s participation in the ceremony reflects its support for Bangladesh’s democratic process and underscores its commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,” the statement added.
Rahman is the son of former Bangladeshi president Ziaur Rahman and the country’s former prime minister Khaleda Zia. He returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.
On Feb 13, BNP won an overwhelming two-thirds majority in the country’s general elections. The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.
Following the election results last week, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz extended their felicitations to the BNP and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority.
President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh. While PM Shehbaz said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership and strengthening the two countries’ “historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations.”</p><small>2026-02-16 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1614235727aa9f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973659/corrigendum' target='_blank'><strong>Corrigendum</strong></a><br><p>A story titled “Imran Khan’s right eye vision ‘improving’, says sister citing report” was published by Dawn.com on February 16.

The sit-in, which began on Friday, was announced hours after the Supreme Court (SC) was informed that only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting a strong response from the opposition alliance.
TTAP spokesperson Akhunzada Yousafzai, speaking to Dawn, said it was a surprising step that all the routes had been cleared.
On Friday, roads leading to Parliament House were blocked ahead of the sit-in.
“First of all, we are going to have breakfast after four days, as previously we were eating only dates and biscuits and were being forced to drink tap water. It has been decided to merge the sit-in at the Parliament lodges with the one at Parliament House,” he said.
The opposition’s sit-in was initially held at three places, including the Parliament House, led by TTAP head Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas. The protest outside the Parliament lodges was led by PTI parliamentarians, while at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, KP CM Sohail Afridi led the demonstration.







“Moreover, as the government is going to file a report regarding Imran Khan’s health in the Supreme Court, we will examine it and will take a further decision,” Yousafzai told Dawn.
Yousafzai stated that the sit-in was going to continue until all demands were accepted by the government.







On Sunday, a team of doctors examined the PTI founder at Adiala Jail and left the premises after around an hour, sources said.
The party rejected the inspection conducted without his family and personal physicians, terming it “malicious”.
Speaking to reporters earlier on Sunday, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said that his party, along with the opposition alliance, will continue the sit-in to pressure the government so that Imran can be taken to a hospital.
“We will not compromise on Imran’s health,” he said, adding that the government was testing the stamina of the party.
“We have decided to continue our sit-ins until our demands are accepted and our leader, Imran Khan, is taken to the Shifa International Hospital in Islamabad. Moreover, we have also decided to approach the Supreme Court of Pakistan on Monday to get justice and the right to medical treatment for Imran,” he told Dawn.
A TTAP leader, speaking on condition of anonymity on Sunday, said they had been told the previous night that Imran would be shifted to Shifa International Hospital, Islamabad, but later received messages suggesting the sit-in should be called off first.
The TTAP had also alleged that access to food, water and medicines had been blocked for protesters inside Parliament House for a third consecutive day, a day earlier, calling it a violation of democratic and constitutional values.</p><small>2026-02-16 09:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651111-medical-team-fully-satisfied-with-imran-khans-eye-treatment-says-law-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Medical team 'fully satisfied' with Imran Khan's eye treatment, says law minister</strong></a><br><p>

Naushahro Feroze Senior Superintendent of Police Mir Rohal Khoso told Dawn that all six people who died were travelling in the car, while the trailer’s driver was injured.
He said the accident took place between 5am and 6am, adding that “ostensibly, speeding and brake failure were probable reasons,” but the matter was being probed further.
SSP Khoso elaborated that one side of the National Highway in the district was under construction, which was a “contributory factor behind increasing accidents”.
He stated that, in collaboration with the motorway police, it has been decided to set up five points for checking the speed and fitness of vehicles to control the rise in accidents.
Sindh Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Odho, in a statement, ordered the Naushahro Feroze SSP to probe the accident and register a case.
Expressing his grief over the loss of lives, IG Odho ordered that legal action be taken against those responsible after determining the causes behind the accident.
Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, with the main reasons including speeding, hazardous overtaking, and disregard for traffic rules.
On Sunday, at least 11 people were killed and eight were injured after a bus collided with a trailer on the National Highway near Tando Masti in Sindh’s Khairpur district.
A day before that, 13 people died in a traffic accident involving an oil tanker and a passenger bus on the M9 Motorway near Karachi.
Crackdown against overloading and speeding ordered
In his statement, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah expressed his grief over the loss of lives in the accident and conveyed his condolences to the bereaved families.
“We share the grief of the bereaved families,” he was quoted as saying in the statement issued by his spokesperson, Abdul Rasheed Channa.
The statement said that the car involved in the incident was heading from Larkana Division’s Nasirabad taluka to Karachi.
CM Murad also issued directives for the strict implementation of traffic rules and regulations.
He ordered the Sindh IG to carry out a “crackdown against overloading and speeding”. He further directed that monitoring and fitness checks of vehicles be made more stringent across the province.
“The protection of the public’s life and property is the government’s top responsibility,” the chief minister noted.</p><small>2026-02-16 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/16133419246fcbb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1973284/the-last-of-the-mohannas' target='_blank'><strong>THE LAST OF THE MOHANNAS</strong></a><br><p>On the banks of Manchhar Lake, near Jhangara, stands the dargah [shrine] of Ghaaib Pir, a saint whose name evokes disappearance, invisibility and passage into the unseen. In Sindhi and South Asian Sufi traditions, ghaaib does not simply mean absence, it refers to that which has slipped beyond human perception, into a realm that exists but is no longer accessible.
Saints associated with the ghaaib phenomenon are believed not to have died in the conventional sense, but to have withdrawn quietly and mysteriously from the material world. Manchhar Lake itself is now in the process of becoming ghaaib and, consequently, so are the Mohanna people who live on it.
Once Pakistan’s largest freshwater lake and a shimmering expanse of sustenance and song, Manchhar Lake’s waters expanded and contracted with the seasons, swelling to over 250 square kilometres during the monsoon and retreating in the drier months. Fed by hill torrents from the Kirthar range and freshwater flows from the Indus, the lake functioned as a natural reservoir that sustained fish, birds, reeds and people. But now, its waters are increasingly saline and toxic, no longer signifying abundance.
“This lake raised us,” says Mai Jindan, a Mohanna woman seated on the edge of her houseboat. “Our mothers washed babies in its water. Our fathers cast their nets at dawn. Now we tell our children not to touch it.”

Once a pristine freshwater lake, home to the thriving Mohanna fishing community and their houseboats, Manchhar Lake is now polluted and toxic due to decades of state neglect. As the lake grows increasingly inhospitable, the dwindling Mohanna culture of the lake creeps closer and closer towards extinction. While efforts, such as those by NED’s Heritage Cell, are underway to preserve the Mohanna way of life, can the lake that sustains it still be saved?

For generations, the Mohannas lived not beside Manchhar but within it. Their houseboats, known as galiyo, approximately 38 feet long and 10 feet wide, formed floating villages that drifted with the seasons, clustering and dispersing according to water levels, fish movements and the wind. Children learned to swim before they learned to walk properly, because water was their first language. For these indigenous fisherfolk, the boats were homes, workplaces and social spaces.

The Mohanna life has long been centred around three seasons: sawan (monsoon: July-September), machhi maran (fishing season: October-March) and sukkal (dry season: April-June). Oral historians among the Mohannas, often referred to as the “Bird People”, recall ancestral fishing grounds by name, particular bends in the lake where certain fish would gather, or seasons when birds arrived so densely that the sky itself appeared to darken.
Manchhar was a cultural landscape, shaped through intimate knowledge and reciprocal care. Over 200 species of freshwater fish were recorded here in the mid-20th century. Tens of thousands of migratory birds — pelicans, ducks, cormorants and egrets— arrived each winter. Reeds grew thick along the edges, providing material for mats, shelters and boats. Fishing techniques were refined over generations, sometimes involving trained birds. Time itself was organised not by calendars but by water levels, fish migrations and monsoon winds.
The lake taught the Mohannas where to move, when to wait and when to leave. In this way, Manchhar functioned as both classroom and archive, holding generations of ecological intelligence that never entered official records. “The lake was our market, our school, our mosque,” recalls Ghulam Mustafa Mirbahar, a Mohanna elder. “Everything we needed came from it.”
But now, due to Manchhar Lake’s reduced freshwater inflows and increased toxicity, the Mohannas are under threat — much like the lake itself. In an article titled ‘How a Polluted Lake is Endangering Life in and Around It’ published in Dawn’s Herald magazine in September 2018, Namrah Zafar Moti quotes a Mohanna fisherman who recalled that, around 14 years earlier (circa 2004), there were nearly 2,000 houseboats on the lake. The Mohannas, whose lives were inseparable from the water, are now disappearing from it, pushed ashore by necessity rather than choice.
At present, around 375 people, comprising 65 families, continue to live on Manchhar Lake. The number of galiyos has now dwindled to just 44. Migratory birds also still arrive, but in fewer numbers. “When ecosystems collapse,” one Mohanna elder observes, “even flight changes.” This is a slow disappearance that has been unfolding over decades. And, like Ghaaib Pir’s disappearance, it is happening in plain sight.

MANCHHAR LAKE’S HISTORY OF NEGLECT
Located about 18 kilometres west of Sehwan Sharif in Sindh, Manchhar Lake spreads to the foot of the Kirthar mountain range. Historically, Manchhar’s health depended on regular freshwater inflows from the Indus River and hill torrents. This natural flushing kept salinity low and ecosystems resilient. But over the last two centuries, a series of interventions began to sever these lifelines.
Following the introduction and expansion of the railway system during British rule in the Subcontinent, there was a reduced reliance on river navigation, diminishing the traditional role of the Mohannas as riverine transporters.
Later on, the building of the Sukkur Barrage in 1923 and the Kotri Barrage in 1955 across the Indus obstructed natural river routes, making navigation difficult and disrupting traditional water-based livelihoods. While these projects expanded agriculture elsewhere through their tightly controlled irrigation channels, they reduced the freshwater reaching Manchhar, altering its chemistry and seasonal rhythms.
Yet, the most devastating blow came with the introduction of large-scale drainage schemes intended to carry saline and wastewater away from agricultural lands and urban centres. The Right Bank Outfall Drain (RBOD), started in 1980, was designed to divert polluted water safely to the sea. Instead, due to chronic delays, incomplete infrastructure and poor regulation, it began disgorging untreated industrial effluent, municipal sewage, pesticides and fertilisers directly into Manchhar Lake.
As freshwater inflows declined and toxic discharges increased, Manchhar’s natural flushing mechanisms failed. Salinity increased, fish died, bird populations collapsed or altered their migratory routes altogether and water once drinkable became hazardous to touch.
“The water was sweet before,” says the Mohanna Allah Dino Mallah. “You could drink it straight from your hands. But today, even the fish cannot survive in the water.”
Sedimentation carried by the drains further reduced the lake’s depth and storage capacity, concentrating pollutants and shrinking habitats. What had once been a vast, dynamic ecosystem became a stagnant basin of contamination. Peeran Mallah, a Mohanna fisherman, says, “We know when the lake is sick. The smell tells us before the tests do.”
The damage unfolded incrementally, making it easy to normalise, difficult to reverse and almost impossible to attribute to any single authority. Each intervention framed itself as development while, collectively, they dismantled the lake’s capacity to sustain life.

THE MOHANNAS UNDER THREAT
For the Mohannas, the consequences were immediate and brutal. Fishing yields fell from thousands of tonnes annually to a fraction of that. Health problems multiplied: skin diseases, respiratory illnesses and waterborne infections became common. With no access to clean water, sanitation, healthcare or consistent schooling, survival itself grew uncertain.
Fish, formerly both food and currency, became scarce, small and, often, unsafe to eat. The Mohanna woman Zarina Mallah notes, “When the fish died, everything else followed.” As a result, many families were forced to abandon their floating homes and move ashore, often into informal settlements, where they were neither recognised as landowners nor supported as displaced communities. Hence, cultural identity eroded alongside ecological collapse.
Women bore a disproportionate share of this rupture. With declining fish stocks and worsening water quality, domestic labour intensified. Water had to be sourced from farther away, illnesses cared for without medical access, children kept safe in increasingly hostile conditions. For the youngest Mohannas, born into a lake already poisoned, the idea of water as a sustainer rather than a threat is no longer intuitive.
Drying fish was once a seasonal rhythm tied to surplus. But now, “the dried fish goes to Karachi and Hyderabad to be turned into poultry feed,” explains Abdul Wahab. “The catch is mostly small fish. This is not what we used to eat.” The disappearance here is incremental — fish by fish, boat by boat, family by family.
Among the most fragile survivors of this collapse are the galiyo. Each galiyo is an archive of vernacular design, adaptive architecture and environmental intelligence. Built from local wood and reeds, these boats respond to changing water levels, winds and seasonal temperatures. Their interiors encode social organisation, gendered spaces and everyday rituals. To lose them is not merely to lose shelter but to lose an entire philosophy of dwelling on water.

In architectural terms, the galiyo represent a rare example of climate-responsive design, developed outside formal institutions. Their low freeboard and flexible joints allowed them to adapt to fluctuating water levels long before resilience entered professional vocabulary. To let them disappear would be to erase evidence that sustainable futures can emerge from vernacular knowledge rather than imported models.
This very knowledge and way of life is under threat.
“Government people come,” says the Mohanna fisherman Sain Bakhsh Mallah. “They take photos and write reports, but the water stays the same.” He says that children still listen to elders recount information and stories about routes, seasons and signs, but many already imagine their lives elsewhere.
But, without any formal training or education, what will the lives of the Mohanna youth look like elsewhere? When the Mohannas are displaced on to land, their skills become unreadable to policy, irrelevant to markets and invisible to planning frameworks. What makes this disappearance particularly devastating is that it has unfolded through decisions made elsewhere due to engineering choices, bureaucratic delays and institutional indifference.
So what can be done to safeguard the Mohanna community?
TRYING TO PRESERVE A WAY OF LIFE
The 2024 launch of the UK-Pakistan Cultural Protection Fund (CPF) pilot was an attempt at a holistic intervention that combined the restoration of Manchhar’s remaining houseboats with a deeper commitment to the survival of the community itself.
The project ‘Manchhar Lake Mohannas — Safeguarding the Last Surviving Houseboat Village from Extinction’, led by Professor Dr Anila Naeem and Farida Abdul Ghaffar, assistant professor at the Department of Architecture and Planning of Karachi’s NED University (DAPNED), sought to document, conserve and reimagine these floating structures as cultural heritage. Professor Naeem is the chairperson of DAPNED and a heritage conservation specialist.
During the first phase of the project, undertaken on an exacting 10-month timeline (April 2024-January 2025), NED’s Heritage Cell team helped repair 44 severely deteriorated houseboats. After undertaking a detailed assessment of the houseboats, a plan for repairs was made. Locals were engaged in boat-building techniques, repairs and maintenance, as the project placed architectural research in dialogue with community knowledge, conservation ethics and environmental advocacy. It was also important to facilitate the community with drinking water and toilet facilities. Skill development and tourism initiatives were piloted to create sustainable income opportunities.
Many of these houseboats were close to collapse, with rotting bases and compromised structures that made daily life unsafe. Repairs extended their lifespan by decades, allowing families to remain on water rather than being forced ashore. “If the boats had gone,” one elder says, “we would have gone with them.”

A pilot restoration of Muhammad Ashraf’s houseboat, for example, involved sourcing local wood, carefully cutting it and transporting it to Manchhar Lake under gruelling weather conditions, with temperatures soaring above 40 degrees. A rotting base was also replaced, and the houseboat was relaunched with the collective effort of over 50 community members, after a month of painstaking labour and experimentation. This first success restored not only the structure but also community confidence and faith in the project’s promise.
Beyond housing, the intervention also addressed urgent health needs. A mobile water filtration unit provided access to safe drinking water in a place where the lake itself had become toxic. Eco-toilets improved sanitation in a community that had long lived without such infrastructure. Solar-powered systems reduced dependence on fuel and external supply lines.
Fishing, the economic backbone of Mohanna life, was also supported through the construction of new fishing boats [hurro], replacing those lost to decay. While fish stocks remain depleted, mobility restored some measure of agency, allowing families to continue working rather than abandoning the lake altogether.
Children, too, were drawn into the orbit of learning. A temporary learning centre was established, initially operated on newly repaired houseboats, and later shifting to a floating bamboo structure that doubled as a communal space. For families accustomed to displacement, the sight of education taking place on water carries symbolic weight.
The second phase of the project (April 2025-January 2026) involved a series of community interactive activities, including tours, workshops and a five-day art residency. It culminated in a performative-curatorial event, ‘Manchhar Lake Mohannas – Sailing Towards Revival’, which framed Manchhar not as a closed chapter but as an unfolding story, foregrounding dialogue and visual narratives from the Mohanna community’s lived realities.
Yet even as these changes took hold, their limits were clear.
No number of repaired boats or community programmes can neutralise untreated sewage. No water filter can compensate for a lake that no longer flushes itself clean. Tree saplings planted along the Manchhar Bund and a bamboo pavilion offer shade to visitors, but they cannot alter the lake’s chemistry. Heritage tourism pilots create momentary income and visibility, but they remain fragile, dependent on conditions beyond local control. Ultimately, these efforts were holding ground and buying time in a landscape where time has been running out.
CAN MANCHHAR BE BROUGHT BACK FROM THE BRINK?
The question that hangs over Manchhar now is no longer whether it has been damaged — that reality is visible, measurable and lived daily — but whether it can still be saved. Restoration, in Manchhar’s case, requires a return to first principles: water that moves, water that cleans itself and governance that treats ecological systems as living entities rather than as disposal sites.
At the heart of Manchhar’s decline lies the severing of freshwater inflows. For centuries, the lake remained viable because it was periodically flushed by clean water from the Indus and hill torrents. This dilution kept salinity in check and allowed pollutants to disperse. Once that flow was throttled, first by barrages, then by diversions, Manchhar became a terminal basin, receiving waste but unable to release it. Stopping the poisoning, therefore, begins upstream.
Untreated industrial effluent and municipal sewage entering the lake through the RBOD and the Main Nara Valley Drain must be intercepted and treated before reaching Manchhar. This is not a technological mystery, as wastewater treatment systems exist and have existed for decades. What has been missing is enforcement, maintenance and political will. Without functional treatment plants and strict regulation of industrial discharge, every other intervention remains cosmetic.
Freshwater inflows must also be restored. Environmental flow, water released specifically to sustain ecosystems, is a measurable requirement. Without it, salinity will continue to rise, fish will fail to reproduce and birds will not return in meaningful numbers. Restoring this flow will require coordination between provincial and federal authorities, irrigation departments and environmental agencies — a level of cooperation that has historically been elusive.
Sedimentation presents another challenge. Decades of accumulated silt have reduced Manchhar’s depth and storage capacity, intensifying pollution and shrinking habitats. Dredging, combined with the creation of wetlands and sediment traps upstream, could help restore the lake’s ability to hold and cleanse water. Nature-based solutions, such as planting aquatic vegetation that absorb pollutants, offer additional pathways, but only if water quality improves enough to support life.
It was hence a welcome sight that, in 2025, the Sindh government partnered with WWF-Pakistan for an $8 million Manchar Lake revival initiative, aimed at combatting rising salinity and pollution in the lake, restoring its ecological balance, reducing environmental threats and uplifting the livelihoods of local communities impacted by the lake’s decline. However, whether or not this endeavour succeeds remains to be seen. Earlier efforts, such as the Supreme Court’s directive in 2017, calling on provincial authorities to ensure regular monitoring and revival of water filtration plants, disposal of solid waste and efforts to control the pollution level in Manchhar Lake, fell on deaf ears.
Of course, no meaningful change can be brought without the participation of the people who know the lake best. Community-led monitoring, where Mohanna observations are treated as important data rather than anecdotes, could transform how the lake is managed. Their knowledge of seasonal changes, fish behaviour and water conditions represents an archive of environmental intelligence that no satellite image can replace.
SAILING INTO AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE
Manchhar’s crisis is not an isolated failure. Across Sindh, other water bodies are showing the same early symptoms of reduced inflows, untreated waste, creeping salinity and ecological thinning.
Haleji Lake and Keenjhar Lake, both critical sources of drinking water and once-thriving ecosystems, face mounting pressure from pollution and over-extraction. They are displaying warning signs that are similar to what Manchhar Lake has experienced. If lessons are not learned here, they will be repeated — lake by lake, creek by creek — until disappearance becomes the default outcome of water governance.
By extension, Mohanna culture can only be preserved if stringent measures are taken to rehabilitate Manchhar Lake. The reality is that one of Pakistan’s most vibrant indigenous communities has long had a sword dangling over both their means of livelihood and way of life.
If targeted efforts are not made to safeguard the Mohanna community and the well-being of Manchhar Lake, both the lake and the community that resides on it will become another permanent victim of Pakistan’s wounded ecology.
The question, then, is not whether Manchhar will become ghaaib. The question is whether disappearance will once again be explained as inevitability rather than consequence.

Al Jazeera reported on Sunday that the Israeli government had approved the proposal to claim large areas of the occupied territory as property of the state if Palestinians could not prove ownership, a move which prompted outcry from Palestinian group Hamas, the Palestinian presidency, and political analysts.
“Pakistan strongly condemns the latest attempt by the Israeli occupying power to convert areas of the Occupied West Bank into so-called state property, and to expand illegal settlement activities,” the statement said.
It pointed out that these steps clearly violated international law and relevant United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, stressing that they “must be rejected” by the international community.







“The occupying power’s continued disregard for international law and its provocative actions undermine the prospects for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace in the region,” it added.
“Pakistan calls on the international community to take concrete measures to end Israeli impunity, and ensure respect for international law,” the statement said.
It once again reaffirmed full support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and for the establishment of an “independent, viable, and contiguous State of Palestine, based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital”.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership. International law states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
Palestinian group Hamas had condemned the decision on Sunday, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
However, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz described the move as an “essential security and governance measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for the state of Israel in the area”, according to the Jerusalem Post.</p><small>2026-02-16 08:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651098-woman-smuggled-from-bangladesh-seeks-reunion-with-family-after-40-year-separation' target='_blank'><strong>Woman smuggled from Bangladesh seeks reunion with family after 40-year separation</strong></a><br><p>

Akram and his father, Sajid, allegedly attacked a Hanukkah celebration in December. Sajid was shot and killed by police during the attack.
Akram has been charged with terrorism, 15 counts of murder, dozens of counts of causing wounds to a person with intent to kill and planting explosives.
He appeared in a Sydney court for about five minutes via video link from prison, according to a statement from the court and local media.
The timeline of evidence was also discussed, the court said.
The accused wore a green jersey during the hearing, which dealt mostly with technical matters such as suppressing the identification of some victims, local media said.
He reportedly spoke only one word — “yeah” — when asked by the judge whether he had heard a discussion about the extension of suppression orders.
Akram will next appear in court on March 9.
Speaking outside the court, Akram’s lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was being held in “very onerous conditions”, national broadcaster ABC said.
He also said it was too early to say whether Akram would plead guilty.
The mass shooting sparked national soul-searching about antisemitism, anger over the failure to shield Jewish Australians from harm and promises to stiffen gun laws.
‘Tactical’ training
Police and intelligence agencies are also facing difficult questions about whether they could have acted earlier.
Naveed Akram was flagged by Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019, but he slipped off the radar after it decided that he posed no imminent threat.
Police documents released following the attack said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting.
They said the suspects “meticulously planned” the attack for months, releasing pictures showing them firing shotguns and moving in what they described as a “tactical manner”.
The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State terrorist group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said.
They made a nighttime reconnaissance trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed.
And a few weeks before the Bondi Beach attack, the pair returned to Sydney from a four-week trip to the southern Philippines.</p><small>2026-02-16 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651073-planning-minister-to-attend-bangladesh-pm-elects-oath-taking-ceremony-in-dhaka' target='_blank'><strong>Planning minister to attend Bangladesh PM-elect's oath taking ceremony in Dhaka</strong></a><br><p>

He stressed that if corrective measures are not undertaken, the matter would be taken to the “people’s court”.
Speaking at a press conference at the Quetta Press Club on Sunday alongside his lawyer Barrister Muhammad Iqbal Kakar and Prof Hanif Bazai, Mr Lashkari warned that if parliament fails to act, political parties will be forgotten by both history and the people of Balochistan.
He said that in the absence of corrective measures, they would take the matter to the “people’s court” and launch a political, constitutional, and democratic struggle with public support to stop illegal actions.
He said that on March 12 last year the Balochistan Assembly passed the Mines and Minerals Act, transferring sweeping powers over the land and mineral resources of the province to federal government. He said a seven-member committee, headed by a DG-rank officer, had been granted authority to allocate lands and mineral areas — powers that he said directly contradict the 18th Cons­titutional Amendment, which devolves authority to provinces.

Ex-senator Raisani vows to take matter to people’s court if corrective measures are not taken

He expressed concern that political parties, both inside and outside parliament, remained silent on the law despite their responsibility to safeguard the public rights and act as a bridge between the state and citizens.
He said no political party raised objections to the Act, prompting him and his colleagues to mobilise the people on the issue and reach out to political leaders, lawyers, journalists, and civil society to unite against this legislation.
He alleged that deals over Reko Diq had already been finalised and described the Act as a tool to strip Balochistan province of its rights. According to him, behind-the-scenes benefits, including assembly seats and other favours, were secured by some stakeholders.
The former senator said a constitutional petition challenging the Act is currently under hearing in the court, adding that despite an executive order from the Mines Department to suspend the Act, reports of tenders and allotments continue to surface. He claimed that repeated requests for official details have gone unanswered, and even efforts to obtain a copy of the chief minister’s executive order through the courts have seen no progress.
Mr Raisani claimed he did not believe in taking “backdoor routes” to power and said they have approached the courts seeking justice and protection for people’s rights from flawed legislation. He warned that future generations’ survival depended on control over provincial resources and criticised political parties for failing to fulfil their constitutional, political and social responsibilities.
He urged the judiciary to play an effective role and said that if the parliament does not review and amend the law, they will take the issue directly to the masses.

ISLAMABAD: Carrying the largest outstanding loan portfolio on its books and a negative return on assets, the National Highway Authority (NHA) — the country’s logistics backbone — is the single largest entity bleeding the federal budget, exposing Pakistan to substantial fiscal risk despite the recent doubling of tolls.
The NHA is the “largest loss-maker”, operating on a “structural deficit model and reliant on budgetary support”, the Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the Ministry of Finance said in its Annual Aggregate Report on state-owned enterprises (SOEs) for the year ended June 30, 2025.
With accumulated losses of Rs2.074 trillion, the entity that owns and operates all the national highways and motorways accrued around Rs1.004tr in the last three years alone — about Rs295 billion each in FY24 and FY25 and Rs413bn in FY23.
Moreover, it stands out at the top of the SOE list, with the largest accrued financing cost of Rs210bn in FY25, as its toll revenue remains unaligned with debt servicing, leading to fiscal dependence and sovereign guarantee exposure.
“Currently, the NHA holds outstanding loans totalling approximately Rs3.1tr, with an annual debt accretion rate of Rs300bn. This debt portfolio generates Rs98bn in markup, which is expected to rise to more than Rs150bn per annum, creating a substantial credit risk for the government of Pakistan (GoP), which guarantees these loans”, the CMA said.
It said the presence of sovereign guarantees for public-private partnership (PPP) contracts added further financial strain, amplifying the government’s credit risk exposure.
With more than Rs115 billion in loans given by the federal government last year, it is also among the top borrowers. On the other hand, its net assets remained almost static over the last three years, actually declining slightly from Rs5.84tr in FY23 to Rs5.83tr in FY25. Its total equity has been declining over time from Rs2.57tr in FY23 to Rs2.27tr in FY24 and Rs1.95tr in FY25.
Conversely, NHA’s total liabilities have been increasing, making it the single-largest entity to accrue current liabilities. Its total liabilities amounted to Rs3.27tr in FY23, increasing to Rs3.54tr in FY24 and reaching Rs3.88tr by the end of FY25.

 

The CMU observed that National Highway Authority’s 2025 performance underscored its strategic importance yet exposed growing fiscal vulnerability. “Despite an impressive surge in toll revenues and build, own and transfer (BOT) project inflows, the authority continues to operate under a persistent deficit, driven by high depreciation and finance costs,” it said.
Operating income rose sharply to Rs83.1bn in FY25 (against Rs42.4bn in FY24), propelled by the doubling of toll income to Rs64.4bn. However, the overall income of Rs119.7bn remained insufficient against total expenditures of Rs408.1bn. Consequently, the deficit before levy and taxation stood at Rs292.98bn and the deficit after tax at Rs294.86bn, reflecting continued structural stress.
It noted that two critical components eroded National Highway Authority’s profitability. These include depreciation expense of Rs133.8bn, reflecting a heavily capital-intensive asset base and growing maintenance backlog and Rs193.5bn finance cost, up from Rs182bn last year, highlighting the escalating burden of debt and interest rate exposure.
The CMU advised diversification of funding sources through infrastructure bonds targeted at domestic institutional investors and international development markets.
It said the expansion of public-private partnerships for new road construction, maintenance outsourcing and service area development can shift part of the fiscal and operational burden to the private sector while improving efficiency and service quality.
The CMU also called for renegotiating loan terms with lenders to extend maturities, reduce interest rates or convert debt into quasi-equity instruments to create immediate fiscal space.

TOP European government officials who led a smear campaign against United Nations special rapporteur for the Palestinian territories, Francesca Albanese, have failed to apologise or withdraw their calls for her resignation, even after multiple reports confirmed the allegations were based on a fabricated quote.
France 24 and Reuters verified that Albanese did not describe Israel as the “common enemy of humanity” during a forum in Qatar earlier this month, an allegation levelled by Israeli officials and echoed by European ministers.
Transcripts of the event show she was referring to a global system of finance and weaponry. Yet diplomats from France, Germany and other nations have so far declined to correct the record.
Amnesty International has demanded that European states immediately withdraw their accusations. Its secretary general, Agnès Callamard, said ministers in Austria, Czechia, France, Germany and Italy had attacked Albanese on the basis of a “deliberately truncated video” that gravely misrepresented her remarks.
“The ministers that have spread disinformation must act beyond merely deleting their comments on social media — as some have done,” Callamard said. “They must publicly apologise and retract any calls for Francesca Albanese’s resignation.”
She described the refusal to issue corrections as political cowardice, pointing to the stark contrast between the speed with which governments condemned a UN expert and their reluctance to hold Israel accountable for actions Amnesty has characterised as genocide and apartheid.
Meanwhile, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation added its voice to the chorus of condemnations. In a statement, the bloc said the allegations were “based on misrepresented and fabricated claims” regarding remarks the rapporteur neither made nor endorsed. The OIC warned that distorting the statements of UN mandate holders risked undermining the integrity of the Human Rights Council.
Albanese also responded to the diplomatic fallout directly. Addressing the controversy, she clarified that her speech in Doha had identified the “common enemy” as the system enabling violence, specifically “financial capital”, “algorithms” and “weapons”.
“A lie was exposed. Instead of retracting it, the SYSTEM that enabled the genocide, attacks the messenger,” Alban­ese wrote on X. “France knows it stepped in something foul, but pride forbids correction.”
She noted that three European governments had accused her with a “virulence” they never applied to the perpetrators of violence in Gaza, where the death toll has reportedly surpassed 72,000.







Legal complaint filed in Paris
Legal pressure is now mounting in France over the government’s refusal to correct its public statements. Middle East Eye reported that Jurdi, the Association of Lawyers for the Respect of International Law, had filed a crime report with the Paris public prosecutor accusing the French foreign minister, Jean-Noël Barrot, of disseminating false information by a public authority.
Barrot told the French parliament that Albanese had made “outrageous and reprehensible remarks”, claiming she had targeted Israel as a nation.
Jurdi argues that because the verified transcript proves otherwise, the minister’s statement makes up a misrepresentation that could endanger the UN expert’s safety.
Support for Albanese also comes from the cultural sphere. According to AFP, over 100 figures from the entertainment industry — including actors Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon and Javier Bardem — have signed an open letter defending her work. The letter, organised by Artists for Palestine, said the rapporteur was being targeted for her defence of Palestinian rights.

TIRANA: Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama will travel to Washington next week to join the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace”, he told a podcast on Sunday.
“I will be in Washington for the official creation of the peace council and the launch of the activities of this council,” Rama said in an interview with Albanian podcast Flasim.
The board, of which Trump is the chairman, was originally intended to oversee the rebuilding of the Gaza Strip after two years of the Israel-Hamas war, but its charter appears to extend beyond the Palestinian territory.
The first meeting is scheduled to take place on February 19 in Washington.
Permanent members of the “Board of Peace” must pay $1 billion to join, leading to criticisms that the board could become a “pay-to-play” version of the UN Security Council.
Trump launched his “Board of Peace” at the WEF in January, and at least 19 countries have signed its founding charter.
Some countries — including Croatia, France, New Zealand and Norway — have already declined to join it, and others have said they could only consider doing so if its charter were changed.
Rama has previously said his country would not pay to be permanent members of the initiative.
“Albania has the privilege of being a founding state, and it will not contribute financially to join or remain as a permanent member,” Rama said on Sunday.
Romanian President Nicusor Dan also announced on Sunday that he would attend as observer the first meeting of US president’s “Board of Peace”.
“Next week I will take part in the first meeting of the Board of Peace in Washington, responding to the invitation addressed by the President of the United States of America, Donald Trump,” Dan wrote on X.
“Romania will have observer status and I will reaffirm our strong support for international peace efforts and our willingness to participate in the reconstruction process in the Gaza Strip,” Dan added on X on Sunday.







Netanyahu won’t attend
Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will not attend next week’s Gaza Board of Peace summit in Washington, with Foreign Min­ister Gideon Saar set to represent the country instead, officials said.
The statement was issued as Neta­nyahu departed for the US, where he met Trump and signed on as a “Board of Peace” member.
Italy will also participate as an observer in the “Board of Peace”, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni confirmed on Sunday, Anadolu reported.
Speaking in an interview with Italian daily Corriere della Sera, Meloni said Italy had received an invitation to attend in observer status and would respond positively.
She noted that constitutional constraints prevent Italy from formally joining the body.
Meanwhile, Trump asked Hamas to move forward with disarmament under his plan for post-war Gaza, and said peace board members pledged $5bn to the Palestinian territory’s reconstruction. “Very importantly, Hamas must uphold its commitment to Full and Immediate Demilitarisation,” Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform, ahead of a Feb 19 meeting of the board in Washington.
He added that member states of the “Board of Peace” had “committed thousands of personnel” to join the International Stabilisation Force.

In a late-night announcement, the petroleum division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot price of HSD has been increased by Rs7.32 per litre (2.7pc) to Rs275.70 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs268.38 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
The ex-depot petrol price was increased to Rs258.17 from Rs253.17 per litre, up 2pc. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
The government is currently charging about Rs105 per litre on petrol and about Rs97 per litre on diesel. Although, general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, yet the government is charging petroleum levy at the rate of Rs79 per litre on diesel and Rs87 per litre on petrol and other high octane products. This also includes Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs17-18 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 to 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during current fiscal year.

JERUSALEM: The Israeli government has approved a proposal to register large areas of the occupied West Bank as “state property”, for the first time since the Israeli occupation of the territory in 1967, in clear violation of the international law that states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories, Al Jazeera reported.
The development was annou­nced by Israeli public broadcaster KAN on Sunday when Israeli forces killed at least 12 Palest­inians in less than 24 hours, according to Gaza’s civil defence agency.
The proposal, approved by the Israel security cabinet, was submitted by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, and Defence Minister Israel Katz. “We are continuing the settlement revolution to control all our lands,” Smotrich said.
The Palestinian Presidency slammed the Israeli government’s decision, calling it a “serious escalation” and saying the Israeli move effectively nullifies signed agreements and clearly contradicts resolutions of the UN Security Council, Wafa news agency reported.
Most Palestinian land is not formally registered because it is a long, complicated process that Israel stopped in 1967. Regis­tra­tion of land establishes permanent ownership. International law states an occupying power cannot confiscate land in occupied territories.
However, Katz described the move as an “essential security and governance measure designed to ensure control, enforcement, and full freedom of action for the state of Israel in the area”, the Jerusalem Post stated.
Palestinian group Hamas condemned the decision, calling it an attempt “to steal and Judaise lands in the occupied West Bank by registering them as so-called ‘state lands’”.
In a statement, the group called the approval “a null and void decision issued by an illegitimate occupying power. It is an attempt to forcibly impose settlement and Judaisation on the ground, in flagrant violation of international law and relevant UN resolutions.”
De facto annexation
Analysts describe the move as a de facto annexation of the Palestinian territory, warning that it will profoundly reshape its civil and legal landscape by eliminating what the Israeli ministers cal­led longstanding “legal obstacles” to the expansion of illegal settlements there.
Speaking from Ramallah, political analyst Xavier Abu Eid told Al Jazeera that Israel is “packing annexation into some sort of a bureaucratic move”. He said the International Court of Justice in 2024 said that Israeli actions amount to annexation of the occupied West Bank.

 

“People should understand this is not just a step towards annexation, we are experiencing annexation as we speak today.
What the Israeli government is doing is implanting their political programme — a policy that has already been presented,” he said.
Strikes amid ceasefire
In multiple strikes since dawn on Sun­day, Israeli forces killed at least 12 people, Gaza’s civil defence agency reported.
Despite a US-brokered truce that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory, with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement.
The civil defence agency said five people were killed and several injured in the attack on a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia, five others were killed and several injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Yunis, and another Palestinian was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City. Besides, Israeli gunfire killed one person in Beit Lahia in north Gaza, it added.
“Israel doesn’t understand ceasefires or truces,” said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.
He said the people were killed as they slept. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 601 Palestinians have been killed since the truce began, while Israel claimed at least four of its soldiers were killed in the same period.

WASHINGTON: After Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir discussed “global and regional security dynamics” with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a senior US diplomat has highlighted Pakistan’s key role in Washington’s global strategy.
US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz highlighted Pakistan’s role in Washington’s global and regional diplomacy.
“We could walk around the world — Kashmir and India and Pakistan — where we faced a very serious nuclear escalation,” he said during the Munich Security Conference, underlining enduring US concerns about strategic stability in South Asia.
Ambassador Waltz also linked Pakistan to multilateral diplomacy. “The United Nations Security Council created the ‘Board of Peace’ — unanimously — with countries such as Pakistan, our friends in the UK, France and others,” he said.
He further highlighted Islamabad’s role in Washington’s engagement with Muslim-majority nations. “…having our goal of a network of friends — Muslim-majority nations such as Turkiye, Pakistan and Indonesia involved,” he said.
In another reference to regional coordination, he added: “…the President [Donald Trump] convened the countries of the region and the Muslim-majority nations, namely Pakistan, Turkiye and Indonesia.”
Earlier, during their meeting, Field Marshal Munir and Secretary Rubio focused on “matters of mutual interest, including global and regional security dynamics and counterterrorism cooperation”, said a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The meeting took place on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference, where Field Marshal Munir also engaged with European and international military leaders to discuss pressing security challenges.
In his talks with German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt, the Chancellor’s foreign and security policy adviser Gunter Sautter, and Chief of Defence Carsten Breuer, Field Marshal Munir discussed contemporary security threats, bilateral defence cooperation, and the need to promote global peace and security through multilateral dialogue.
The CDF also held talks with Renato Rodrigues de Aguiar Freire, chief of the joint staff of the Brazilian Armed Forces, and Rodolph Haykal, commander of the Lebanese Armed Forces, focusing on measures to enhance bilateral defence collaboration and address regional security challenges.
According to the ISPR, the visit and accompanying engagements were aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s defence ties and expanding cooperation with partner countries on key security issues.
