The case pertains to the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set, gifteed to Imran by the Saudi crown prince during an official visit in May 2021, at a throwaway price.
The verdict was delivered by Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand during a hearing held at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail, where Imran is incarcerated.
Imran was sentenced to a total of 17 years in prison; he was awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment under sections 34 (common intention) and 409 (criminal breach of trust) of the Pakistan Penal Code, and seven years under Section 5(2) (criminal misconduct by public servants) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.
Bushra Bibi was also sentenced to a total of 17 years’ imprisonment under the same provisions.
Both of them were also fined Rs16.4 million. As per the law, a failure to pay the fines will result in additional jail time.
The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said, “This court, while passing sentences has considered the old age of Imran Ahmed Khan Niazi, as well as the fact that Bushra Imran Khan is a female. It is in consideration of both said factors that a lenient view has been taken in awarding lesser punishment.”
It added that the benefit of Section 382-B (period of detention to be considered while awarding sentence of imprisonment) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) was “hereby given to the convicts”.
After the verdict, Imran and Bushra’s legal teams indicated their intention to challenge the decision before the high court.
The two were indicted in the case last year in December. Earlier this year in October, Imran and Bushra Bibi denied all allegations in case, terming it a fabricated and politically motivated attempt to disqualify him from politics.
Recording his statement under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) before a special court, Imran had rejected the prosecution’s narrative in the case. He alleged that the entire case was “malicious, fabricated, and politically engineered”. He further contended that he did not qualify as a “public servant” under the Pakistan Penal Code, arguing that even in his capacity as prime minister, he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he said was presented to his wife.
The PTI founder maintained that due process was followed in accordance with the Toshakhana Policy 2018. He said the gift was duly reported to the PM Office protocol section, assessed, and legally retained after payment was deposited into the national exchequer. “We complied with the Toshakhana Policy in letter and spirit,” he said.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.
‘Judgment in line with the Constitution, law’
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik, while speaking with Geo News, remarked that the judgment was “in line with the Constitution and the law”.
He stressed that “there was no political side to this, if you violate the law, it is clear that a punishment is expected”.
“The trial that went on for 15-16 months, it was proven that PTI founder and his wife caused the national exchequer significant harm as the set’s valuation was under-reported,” Malik said.
“The gift was not even submitted,” he added.
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani said that the judgment came after lengthy legal proceedings. Speaking to Geo News, he noted that the case followed a similar pattern to that of the Toshakhana-I reference.
“The state was given a gift that was not deposited, which they were legally bound to do according to the procedure for acceptance and gifts in Toshakhana,“ he said.
“According to facts that came to light during the legal proceedings, the set’s actual value was Rs70 million; however, its valuation was done at Rs5.8-5.9m,” he said.
“Unfortunately, Bushra Bibi and Imran Khan attempted to buy the set at throwaway rates,“ he said. He asserted that all the facts had “now been established in light of today’s judgement”.

A US-led coalition had already been carrying out airstrikes and ground operations in Syria targeting Islamic State suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria’s security forces.







US President Donald Trump had vowed to retaliate after a suspected ISIS attack killed US personnel last weekend in Syria.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said the strikes targeted “ISIS fighters, infrastructure, and weapons sites” and said the operation was “OPERATION HAWKEYE STRIKE”.
“This is not the beginning of a war it is a declaration of vengeance,” Hegseth said. “Today, we hunted and we killed our enemies. Lots of them. And we will continue,” he added.







Trump said on social media that the Syrian government fully supported the strikes and that the US was inflicting “very serious retaliation”.







At a speech in North Carolina on Friday night, Trump called it a “massive” blow against the ISIS members that the US blames for the Dec 13 attack on coalition forces.
“We hit the ISIS thugs in Syria. It was very successful,” Trump said at a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.
US Central Command said the strikes hit more than 70 targets across central Syria, adding that Jordanian fighter jets supported the operation.
One US official said the strikes were carried out by US F-15 and A-10 jets, along with Apache helicopters and HIMARS rocket systems.
Syria reiterated its steadfast commitment to fighting Islamic State and ensuring that it has “no safe havens on Syrian territory,” according to a statement by the foreign ministry.
Two US Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed on Saturday in the central Syrian town of Palmyra by an attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead, according to the US military.
Three other US soldiers were also wounded in the attack.
About 1,000 US troops remain in Syria.
The Syrian Interior Ministry has described the attacker as a member of the Syrian security forces suspected of sympathising with Islamic State.
Syria’s government is now led by former rebels who toppled leader Bashar al-Assad last year after a 13-year civil war, and includes members of Syria’s former Al Qaeda branch who broke with the group and clashed with Islamic State.
Syria has been cooperating with a US-led coalition against Islamic State, reaching an agreement last month when President Ahmed al-Sharaa visited the White House.</p><small>2025-12-20 05:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20094021f7264c8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962236/ppps-sherry-rehman-says-minister-must-apologise-after-heated-exchange-with-palwasha-khan-during-senate-panel' target='_blank'><strong>PPP’s Sherry Rehman says minister must apologise after heated exchange with Palwasha Khan during Senate panel</strong></a><br><p>PPP leader Sherry Rehman has said that Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan must apologise following his heated exchange with Senator Palwasha Khan during a Senate panel meeting on Friday.
Pal­washa, who is also a PPP leader, and the federal minister had traded sharp remarks on Friday over the construction of a road allegedly benefiting a private housing society during a meeting of the Senate Stan­ding Committee on Com­mu­ni­cations.

         View this post on Instagram            

In a post on the social media platform X late on Friday night, Rehman said, “What happened today in a Senate standing committee can neither become normalised nor considered acceptable. No federal minister should speak the way Aleem Khan did with Senator Palwasha in a communications committee meeting.”
Rehman further said that it was Senator Palwasha’s “absolute responsibility and right to ask questions” and to hold the government accountable.
“He must apologise. I am not even going to say that it is necessary because she is a woman. She is due that basic right of respect as an honourable member of Parliament from a federal minister,” she said.







The confrontation between the minister and Senator Palwasha had begun when the latter questioned whether public funds had been used to build a road primarily serving a private housing scheme in Lahore.
Responding angrily, the minister warned that personal attacks would be met in kind. “If you make personal attacks, you will face the same behaviour,” he said, adding that while the government was willing to clarify its position, it would not lower itself to the level he felt the senator had adopted.
However, she maintained it was her right as a parliamentarian to question the use of taxpayers’ money and reiterated that she had merely sought clarification on whether the road had been constructed to benefit a private housing society. The exchange escalated further when the minister accused committee members of being “blackmailers and dishonest”, prom­pting strong objections.
Senator Pal­wa­sha said she had been humiliated by the minister’s remarks and announced she would raise the matter with her party’s top leadership. Following the intervention of the committee chairman, Senator Pervaiz Rashid, the minister tendered an apology. But Senator Palwasha declined to accept it.
Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House following the argument, she said that if “a road funded by the public is being built, then why can we not question whether someone is trying to seek benefits for his private business?”
Expressing disappointment at the minister‘s behaviour, she said it was the “collective demeanour of Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet”.</p><small>2025-12-20 05:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6945c6b4d587f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962189/relics-of-the-zina-ordinance' target='_blank'><strong>Relics of the Zina Ordinance</strong></a><br><p>NEARLY two decades since its rollback, our law appears to be reverting to the flawed dispensation of justice under the Zina Ordinance, 1979, that took years of activism and lobbying to challenge and correct.
The Hudood Ordinances, and in particular the Zina Ordinance, brought much notoriety to Pakistan’s legal system as enabling grave miscarriage of justice and serving as an instrument of oppression of women. The Zina Ordinance introduced the offences of zina (adultery and fornication) and zina-bil-jabr (removing the offence of rape from the Pakistan Penal Code [PPC], 1860), which if proved through confession or the eyewitness testimony of four adult male Muslim witnesses would be subject to the penalty of stoning to death. Women, particularly those who defied norms and familial authority, became the primary target of often false accusations of adultery. Following the law’s promulgation, each year over 1,500 cases of zina were registered against women. Given the non-bailable nature of the offence, women accused falsely of zina would languish in jails for years, till their convictions were mostly overturned by appellate courts.

 

Under the Zina Ordinance, female victims of rape also found themselves in a pernicious legal bind. An allegation of rape, unsupported by the testimony of four male eyewitnesses, would be treated under the law as an admission of illicit intercourse, and therefore of the commission of zina. The pregnancy of a rape victim, in the absence of requisite proof, would also be tantamount to an admission of illicit sex. A rape victim who knocked on the doors of justice would, in such circumstances, be treated as a criminal and find herself behind bars.
The repeal of the Zina Ordinance became a rallying cry for the feminist movement in Pakistan, as women’s collectives and NGOs campaigned against the law through the 1980s and 1990s. It took years of campaigning before the National Assembly passed the Protection of Women (Criminal Law Amendment) Act, 2006, with a view to correct — at least in part — the injustices meted out under the provisions of the Zina Ordinance.
The statement of objects and purposes of the 2006 Act admitted that “[t]he Zina Ordinance has been abused to prosecute women, to settle vendettas and to deny basic human rights and fundamental freedoms”. The 2006 Act re-legislated rape into the PPC, undoing the evidential requirement of (male) eyewitness testimony to prove the offence. While retaining the offence of zina in the Zina Ordinance, the 2006 Act introduced a separate offence of fornication in Section 496B, PPC, subject to a penalty of five years’ imprisonment and fine.

Recent judicial decisions appear to be resurrecting the relics of an oppressive law.

In order to stem the menace of false complaints, the 2006 Act introduced Sections 203A and 203C to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, to mandate that complaints of zina or fornication may only be registered before a court. Most importantly, the 2006 Act amended the Zina Ordinance to specifically provide, in Section 5A, that under no circumstances could a complaint of rape be converted into a complaint of fornication under Section 496B, PPC.
With the horrors orchestrated under the Zina Ordinance not yet forgotten, and the feminist struggle against the law still fresh in our memories, we now find ourselves confronted with recent judicial decisions that appear to be resurrecting the relics of this oppressive law.
Last year, the Supreme Court of Pakistan, while hearing an appeal against the conviction of rape in ‘Muhammad Imran vs the State’, set aside the judgements of the lower courts on grounds of lack of evidence of absence of consent, and instead, convicted the accused of fornication, “zina with consent”, under section 496B, PPC — an offence that was neither pleaded by the victim nor charged against the accused. As pointed out in the dissenting note to this judgement, the distinction between rape and fornication rests on the presence of consent, defined in the PPC as an “unequivocal voluntary agreement, gestures of any form of verbal or nonverbal communication, and communicates willingness to participate in the specific sexual act”. Where evidence is insufficient to convince a court of law regarding the absence of consent to sexual intercourse (or other sexual acts), can the court reasonably presume — based on the absence of marks of violence or raising of a hue and cry — the existence of unequivocal and meaningful consent to convert an act of grave violence to one of consensual sex? Surely, convictions or reversal thereof cannot be based on mere presumptions of existence or absence of fundamental ingredients of an offence.
Yet in ‘Hassan Khan vs the State’ — the judgement was released earlier this month — the Sup­reme Court converted a rape conviction to one of fornication, once again grounding its decision on presumptions regarding the existence of the complainant’s consent to sex, after her evidence failed to convince the judges. Interestingly, the court relied on jurisprudence developed under the Zina Ordinance, to justify such conversion.
Given the clear prohibition in the 2006 Act, this court-led rape-to-fornication conversion is unsustainable. It sidesteps the procedural protections under the 2006 Act for registration of a complaint of fornication, allowing the court to itself step into the shoes of the complainant/ victim. As admitted by the Supreme Court in both judgements, such conversion creates the possibility that the “complainant … [may] also [be] liable to be proceeded against and punished as an accused of the offence of illicit intercourse with consent”. Not only is the complainant left hanging in the lurch of a possible fornication conviction, she is also stamped with a judicially approved label of an adulteress.
These judgements appear to be turning back the clock on years of hard-won progress, and contradict the very objectives and aims of the remedial 2006 Act, providing room for revival of the injustices that ensued under the Zina Ordinance.

Published in Dawn, December 20th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-20 04:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6945c6ec6ffaf.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962190/compliance-dividends' target='_blank'><strong>Compliance dividends</strong></a><br><p>DURING a conversation some years ago, a Sup­reme Court judge observed that as a sovereign ind­­ependent state with an independent judiciary, we should not care about international pressures or obligations that are imposed on us. I politely dissented, explaining that our sovereignty was not an abstract absolute. Instead, it was subject to treaty commitments that we as a state had made over the years.
This question of a foreign state or entity impinging on our sovereignty is raised often. Take the EU’s GSP Plus status for Pakistan, which enables a concessionary regime for Pakistani exporters. For that status to continue beyond 2027, Pakistan, as a federation, must implement 27 international treaties and conventions in all four provinces and all territories that it exercises sovereign control over, such as Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir.
The cumulative effect of these 27 conventions is that, besides the more obvious issues, the federal government across Pakistani territory has to take care of even the less noticed vegetation, grass, trees, bushes, birds, animals, watercourses, mountains, etc. For instance, the federation must ensure that there is no over-hunting that could drive a species to extinction. At another level, it is obligated to take care of its own people, and ensure they will not be discriminated against, nor deprived of life and liberty, nor face unreasonable restrictions in expressing themselves, and that they will be given dignity, with any state action against them having the law’s sanction. The rights and welfare of women and children will be protected. Labourers in factories, industries, shops, hotels, in fact all businesses, will not work in subhuman conditions and the federation will protect their well-being. Further, the federal government has to eliminate narcotics and prosecute those buying or selling narcotic substances. Corruption is also to be controlled and prevented; campaigns have to convince people to refrain from corrupt, illegal practices. So, is the EU, through the GSP Plus conditionality, asking us to do what we have not already agreed to? The answer is in the negative. Pakistani governments have ratified all 27 conventions as a sovereign choice over the years.

 

In practice, international treaties have had actually a more profound effect within Pakistan as they have reshaped governance and compelled reforms across diverse sectors. International law, contrary to popular perception, is no longer an extraneous variable that can be ignored during domestic planning or while making new laws.
If one were to count the number of treaties that Pakistan has ratified and entered into, they are way more than the domestic statutes enacted by the federal and provincial governments. Ratification of any treaty is not symbolic; it binds Pakistan to implement provisions even when national legislation is weak or inconsistent. Thus the treaties gradually begin to supersede the domestic legislation.

Compliance with international law instruments by Pakistan has been worth it.

Take the example of the UN Convention against Transnational Organised Crime. Pakistan’s domestic laws on human smuggling were historically under-enforced, but UNTOC requires effective measures against traffickers. Compliance has forced Pakistan to strengthen its investigative mechanisms, enhance border controls, and criminalise practices that previously escaped scrutiny. In another instance, open-ended concessions once granted to Gulf royal families for hunting the houbara bustard had to be curtailed considerably due to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.
Labour laws in Pakistan were often ineffective, particularly in manufacturing hubs such as Faisalabad, Gujranwala and Sialkot. The ratification of ILO conventions has compelled the labour ministry to introduce minimum labour standards, workplace safety regulations, and collective bargaining rights.
The provincial neglect of historic sites such as Taxila or Harappa has been countered by legal obligations under Unesco and cultural property conventions. Pakistan is obliged to preserve and maintain cultural landmarks including the Wazir Khan mosque, the Lahore Fort, Shalimar Gardens and several sites in Sindh, Balochistan and KP. Hence we notice the provincial government setting up bodies to more systematically maintain and preserve culturally rich sites that the federation inherited.
The Financial Action Task Force has provided another example of external legal compulsion, forcing the federal government’s hand. Provincial governments were required to adopt financial discipline and anti-money laundering measures to avoid being blacklisted. Compliance was essential for Pakistan’s integration into the global financial system. The entire law-enforcement system had to be revamped to help build an understanding of intricate mutual legal assistance laws within police, the FIA and other institutions. Regulators had to become more vigilant. The federation had to increase their budgets.

 

In my view, compliance with international law instruments by Pakistan has been worth it. Executive efforts for enforcement of ratified conventions and treaties has elevated Pakistan’s reputation as a responsible state. No wonder its role in global affairs is expanding. Its representatives interact with top world leaders and participate in background negotiations, such as those leading to the UN resolution on Gaza. Pakistan now maintains close ties with the US, China, and Iran simultaneously, reflecting a nuanced diplomatic posture that is not at variance with international law. All this contrasts with India’s increasing violations of international law, such as holding in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty and cultivating assassination networks in foreign states. By consolidating its reputation as a responsible state, Pakistan positions itself for regional leadership. Compliance with international law becomes not only a legal necessity but also a strategic advantage.
Following the 18th Amendment, many subjects of international conventions were devolved to the provinces. To ensure compliance, I recall having notified treaty implementation cells in all provinces and in the federal government during my brief tenure as caretaker federal law minister in 2013. These cells made reporting to the EU and UN bodies easier, and enabled Pakistan to demonstrate compliance at the city, provincial and federal levels.
Despite progress, challenges remain. Domestic resistance to reform, bureaucratic inertia, and political expediency often hinder implementation. Pakistan cannot afford complacency. International obligations are binding, and failure to comply risks sanctions and reputational damage. Conversely, effective efforts towards implementation offer opportunities: enhanced trade access, improved diplomatic standing, and leadership in regional and international affairs.

The Foreign Office has said that Pakistan has not been asked to send personnel, nor has the country taken a decision yet. The issue resurfaced after reports began circulating that Field Marshal Asim Munir was due to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington in the near future, with Gaza deployment to feature in the talks.

 

The FO contradicted these reports, while a White House official also said no such meeting was on the cards. Earlier, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had said that Pakistan could not take a decision until the ISF’s terms of reference were clear, adding that disarming Hamas was “not our job”.
Perhaps it is time that the state took a decision about the ISF deployment. Like most grand schemes of the Trump administration, the Gaza plan is high on hyperbole, and low on substance. Critically, the US State Department’s reported vision for foreign troops in Gaza to dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and decommission weapons “used by terrorists” — euphemisms for disarming Hamas — is incredibly problematic, especially for Arab and Muslim states.

 

Mr Trump’s scheme seeks to put Muslim states on a collision course with Hamas and other resistance groups, and attempts to do what Israel failed. It is our view that no Muslim state should be fighting Palestinian groups, essentially doing Israel’s dirty work. It is perhaps because of this unsavoury aspect of the Gaza plan that so many states have refused to commit troops.
As per reports, Azerbaijan, Jordan, Egypt and other Arab states have all said that in the current conditions, they will be unable to send troops to the occupied Palestinian territory. Pakistan must not break with this consensus, and its own stated principles, by sending troops to confront Palestinian resistance groups.
The state has taken difficult decisions such as this in the past. For example, despite significant Saudi pressure, through the collective wisdom of parliament the state preferred neutrality and refused to commit forces to the war on Yemen’s Houthis. In hindsight, this was the correct decision.
Israel cannot be trusted, and has already indicated that it intends to remain in significant parts of occupied Gaza. Muslim and Arab states, thus, should not become accessories in the US-Israeli plan to perpetuate the occupation. Hamas is willing to lay down arms, but only if there is a visible pathway for a Palestinian state.
Tel Aviv abhors the idea of a viable Palestinian state, and the implementation of the ceasefire’s second phase looks doubtful. Pakistan should, therefore, stay away from any half-baked plans to commit troops to an occupied war zone.

The ordeal began around midnight as the newsroom staff rushed to meet the first edition deadline. A reporter received repeated phone calls warning that a mob, which had been vandalising another newspaper office nearby, was moving toward their building.

 

He immediately alerted his colleagues.
“The mob may come towards our office at any moment,” he told them.
Staff quickly shut down computers and prepared to evacuate. As they took the lift down to the second floor, they were met with loud crashing sounds from below, forcing them back upstairs in a panic.
“From the fourth floor, the sounds were much clearer and sharper,” the reporter said. “That’s when we realised we had no option left.”
Fearing the mob had breached the building, the group abandoned the idea of leaving and fled to the rooftop.
From there, they could hear distant shouts and the continuing sounds of destruction but could not see what was happening in front of the building. Staff used their phones to call contacts and colleagues to understand the situation unfolding below.
Soon, the situation worsened dramatically.
“Suddenly, thick black smoke covered the rooftop. Everything turned dark,” the reporter said.
The smoke, rising through the building, made it difficult to breathe, causing eyes to burn and throats to tighten. The group moved from one corner of the rooftop to another, searching for spots where the air was clearer. There was no water left on the rooftop to wash their faces.
“One of my colleagues sat on the floor and started crying while talking to his parents on the phone,” the reporter recalled.
At one point, the Fire Service arrived with a crane, and one staff member was taken down. However, colleagues who were outside called to warn that descending was extremely risky, as the mob remained active on the street.
“We asked the Fire Service not to take us down by crane because of the risk,” he said. “They agreed.”
As the crane moved away, fear deepened that the attackers might find a way onto the roof.
The group’s rescue came after a knock on the rooftop door. A man identified himself as an army officer.
“We couldn’t trust him at first,” the reporter said. “We took time to verify before opening the door.”
After confirming his identity, they opened the door. The officer assured them they would be rescued and led them silently down the stairwell.
“Our bodies were shaking with fear,” the reporter said. “We were told not to turn on our phone lights and not to make any noise.” Then they left the office.

According to officials, unknown armed men planted an explosive device on the main rail track between Sibi and Mushkaf area of Bolan Pass and detonated it. Another incident of blasting a railway track took place in the Dasht area of Mastung district. 
“The targets were the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express and the Karachi-bound Bolan Mail,” police officials said, adding that railway operations were disrupted due to the blasts at two locations. 
After receiving information about the explosions, the two trains, which had already departed for their destinations, were stopped at different stations as a precautionary measure. Railway officials said the tracks were damaged in the explosions, adding that after security clearance, engineers and other concerned staff repaired both damaged sections. 
“Both passenger trains were allowed to proceed to their destinations after the repair work,” the officials said, adding that the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail would leave for Peshawar and Karachi, respectively, on Saturday.
Militants have made several attempts to blow up the Jaffar Express over the past two months and have succeeded twice, targeting the train in the Dasht area of Mastung district and in the Shikarpur area of Sindh.

ISLAMABAD: The recent Sup­reme Court verdict, commuting a rape conviction to a charge of fornication, has sparked considerable controversy, with the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) sharply criticising the judgement, and one judge on the bench dissenting from the majority ruling.
The NCSW noted with concern that the prosecution’s findings — including investigative evidence and judicial conclusions reached by the trial court and the Lahore High Court (LHC) — were effectively disregarded, resulting in the accused being discharged from the offence of rape.
“Such an outcome raises critical questions regarding the adjudication of sexual violence cases and the application of legal standards relating to consent,” the commission regretted.
The NCSW also highlighted that consent could not be inferred from silence, delayed reporting, or the absence of physical resistance.
“Judicial interpretation must remain informed by the complex realities of trauma, fear, coercion, and power asymmetries that frequently underpin sexual violence,” it added.
The NCSW urged the judiciary and all relevant state institutions to ensure that adjudication in cases of sexual violence was firmly grounded in constitutional guarantees of equality, dignity, and non-discrimination, as well as Pakistan’s obligations under international human rights law. “Gender-responsive interpretation of law and survivor-centred judicial reasoning are imperative to prevent re-victimisation and carrying of justice,” the statement said.
In this context, the NCSW also reiterated the need for systemic institutional strengthening, which should include increasing the number of gender-based violence (GBV) courts, enhancing technical capacity and specialisation of GBV court staff, appointment of permanent judges along with conducting large-scale sensitisation trainings for justice sector stakeholders.

 

Particular emphasis must also be placed on first responders, especially the police, to ensure survivor-sensitive handling of complaints from the outset, the statement read.
Majority verdict
In a six-page judgement issued earlier this month, the top court comm­uted the sentence of a convict from 20 years of imprisonment to five after reclassifying the offense from rape to a consensual extramarital affair.
Justices Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, who delivered the majority verdict, relied on two factors: a seven-month delay in the complainant registering a rape case and the absence of “healed marks of violence on the entire body of the alleged victim”.
The court modified the impugned judgement by setting aside the petitioner’s conviction and sentence under Section 376 PPC, acquitting him of rape, and instead convicting him under Section 496-B PPC for fornication. The court was hearing an appeal filed by Hassan Khan against the Dec 18, 2018 judgement of the LHC, which had dismissed his plea.
Dissenting note
Justice Salahuddin Panhwar, the third member of the bench, dissented and voted to dismiss the petition by refusing leave to appeal.
In his dissenting note, the judge wrote that rape and sexual harassment cases often went unreported in our society as the victims feared the consequences of reporting.
“The victim often has to justify to [their] own family members about their character at the time when [they] report … such an incident,” he added.
“In the case at hand, the victim is of young age, unmarried, her parents have passed away, she has an elder brother and record also shows evidence of threats forwarded to the victim,” the dissenting note read.
It added that it clearly made sense as to “how reluctant a girl would be in these circumstances to share such an unfortunate occurrence with her own brother”.
Justice Panwhar observed that de­­lays in reporting sexual assaults to po­­lice were not fatal to the prosecution.
Defending the absence of healed marks of violence on victim’s body, the dissenting note stated the accused was carrying a weapon. “Any victim would be reluctant to resist such a perpetrator with a weapon in hand.”
The judge observed that a rape victim should not be penalised on “account of ostensible delay in reporting what she has undergone”.
“On the contrary, kindness, encouragement, and understanding are the requirements to approbate a victim’s difficult decision to purge the society of perpetrators of such heinous offences,” he added in his dissenting note.
Chaudhry Abdul Aziz, a former LHC judge, remarked that apparen­tly the majority judgement had tak­en “a very cautious view” by commuting the sentence of rape into fornication.
A good judge had to be very skeptical while deciding cases of rape, he said, adding: “The majority verdict seems to have tried to maintain a balance”.

LAHORE: In another case linked to the May 9 riots, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Saturday acquitted former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, while awarding 10-year prison sentences to senior PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmoodur Rashid and former senator Ejaz Chaudhry.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the verdict inside Kot Lakhpat Jail after concluding the trial of the accused in FIR No 852/2023, which relates to an attack on the entrance gate of the GOR-I Club Chowk. The case had been registered by the Race Course police, who later submitted a challan against 25 accused persons, including PTI leaders and party workers.

 

In the same case, the court also handed down 10-year imprisonment sentences to PTI workers Qasim Elahi, Muhammad Shehbaz, Mushtaq and Abdullah. However, the judge acquitted 12 other accused due to a lack of sufficient evidence against them.
This marks the fifth case in Lahore in which Mr Qureshi has been acquitted, while Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mehmoodur Rashid have been convicted. The majority of those convicted were charged with participating in the attack while armed with clubs, pelting stones and chanting slogans.
Previously, verdicts have alre­ady been announced in several other cases arising from the May 9 unrest, including trials related to the attack on Shadman police station, violence at Sherpao Bridge, the burning of police vehicles near Rahat Bakery, and the torching of a Supreme Court judge’s squ­ad vehicle near Jinnah House.
Barrister Taimur Malik, counsel for Shah Mahmood Qureshi, stated that despite the acquittal, the PTI vice chairman would not be released from Kot Lakhpat Jail as his bail pleas in three other cases are still pending. He expressed hope that bail in those cases would be granted sooner rather than later, instead of Mr Qureshi having to wait for the completion of the trials.
“We have now obtained his bail or acquittals in around 50 cases across Punjab and Islamabad over the last three years,” the counsel added.
The May 9 riots erupted following the arrest of PTI founder Imran Khan by the National Accountability Bureau from the premises of the Islamabad High Court. Subsequently, PTI leaders and workers launched protests across the country, during which military installations and public property were attacked.
Joint letter
Separately, five senior PTI leaders currently incarcerated at Kot Lakhpat jail issued a joint letter through their lawyer, stating that dialogue is the only viable path to steer the country out of its ongoing crises.
The letter, signed by Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed, stated that the party’s central leadership firmly believes that dialogue at all levels is the sole workable solution to the prevailing situation.
The incarcerated leaders said that Pakistan has been grappling with severe political, economic and social crises for the past three years and eight months, and that it is the responsibility of every patriot to think in the national interest and pursue objectives through peaceful and constitutional means.
According to the PTI leaders, negotiations alone can help pull the country out of the current turmoil. The letter further stated that the PTI founder has asked the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan to engage in consultations with national political parties in order to chart a way forward.
It added that broad-based consultation opens the door to meaningful dialogue. The imprisoned leaders also expressed hope that Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas would provide guidance to the nation during this critical period.

Four security forces personnel were martyred when an attempt by terrorists to attack a security forces camp was foiled in the area of Boya in North Waziristan district.
In a statement, the FO said that Pakistan condemned the attack in the strongest possible terms and identified the attackers as members of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, a group under the TTP umbrella.







“To convey our strong demarche, the Afghan deputy head of mission was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” the statement read.
“The ministry conveyed Pakistan’s grave concern over the continued support and facilitation provided by the Afghan Taliban regime to the FAK/TTP, enabling them to carry out terrorist attacks against [the] Pakistan Military and the civilian population along the Pak-Afghan border and in adjoining areas,” it added.
The FO emphasised that the permissive environment enjoyed by the Fitna-al-Khawarij in Afghanistan contradicts Kabul’s commitments to Pakistan and the international community.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“Pakistan has demanded a full investigation and decisive action against the perpetrators and facilitators of the terrorist attacks launched against Pakistan from Afghan soil,” the statement said.
Islamabad also asked Kabul to take “immediate, concrete and verifiable measures against all terror groups operating from its territory, including their leadership and deny the continued use of Afghan soil for terrorism against Pakistan”.
The FO warned the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan “reserves the right to defend its sovereignty and protect its citizens, and will take all necessary measures to respond to terrorism originating from Afghan soil”.
Pak-Afghan relations
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the TTP remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
The Foreign Office also said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.
On December 1, Saudi Arabia quietly facilitated a round of direct talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan aimed at easing tensions over cross-border terrorism, but the discussions wrapped up without any breakthrough.
A recent United Nations Security Council report rejected the Taliban’s claim that terrorist groups are not using Afghan territory for cross-border violence, calling the assertion “not credible” and warning that neighbouring states increasingly view Afghanistan as a source of regional insecurity.
The assessment, contained in the sixteenth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, was submitted to the UN Security Council, as international concern grows over Afghanistan’s security landscape more than four years after the Taliban returned to power in August 2021.
“The de facto authorities continue to deny that any terrorist groups have a footprint in or operate from its territory. That claim is not credible,” the report said.</p><small>2025-12-20 02:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19233121c013cfd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962059/us-very-grateful-for-pakistans-offer-to-be-part-of-gaza-stabilisation-force-marco-rubio' target='_blank'><strong>US ‘very grateful’ for Pakistan’s offer to be part of Gaza stabilisation force: Marco Rubio</strong></a><br><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday disclosed that Pakistan had accepted inclusion in the proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza, while stopping short of confirming a firm troop commitment.
Last Tuesday, Pakistan attended a conference in Qatar, which was hosted by US Central Command, to discuss the ISF’s command structure and other unresolved operational issues. Pakistan was among nearly 45 countries attending the meeting.
Responding to a question on whether Washington had received Pakistan’s consent to deploy troops for peacebuilding in Gaza, Rubio said the United States was “very grateful to Pakistan for their offer to be a part of it, or at least their offer to consider being a part of it,” adding that further clarity was still required before any country could be asked to formally commit.







“I feel very confident that we have a number of nation-states acceptable to all sides of this who are willing to step forward and be a part of that stabilisation force and certainly, Pakistan is key, if they agree to do so,” he added.
Rubio noted that key issues related to the force’s mandate, command structure, and funding arrangements were still under discussion.
“I think the next step here is announcing the Board of Peace [and] the Palestinian technocratic group that will help provide daily governance,” the secretary added.
“Once that‘s in place, I think that will allow us to firm up the stabilisation force, including how it’s going to be paid for, what their rules of engagement are, what their role will be in demilitarisation and so forth.”



The US State Department has formally approached more than 70 countries seeking troops or funding for the proposed force. Some 19 countries have reportedly so far indicated willingness to assist through troops, logistics, or equipment, with international deployment in Gaza potentially beginning as early as next month.
Diplomatic sources also told Dawn that Pakistan was considering deploying 3,500 troops as part of the ISF.
Rubio’s remarks come a day after Pakistan articulated its official position. Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesman, Tahir Andrabi, said Islamabad had not yet decided on contributing troops to the ISF, indicating that discussions were still at an exploratory stage rather than reflecting a final commitment.
The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of Israel’s onslaught.
In September, US President Donald Trump unveiled a 20-point peace plan, which laid the foundation for the peace agreement signed in October by Israel and Hamas.
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement was the establishment of the ISF, composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries.
In November, the UN Security Council adopted a US-drafted resolution endorsing President Donald Trump’s plan to end the conflict in Gaza, which also authorises the deployment of the ISF to the Palestinian enclave.
Thirteen UNSC members, including Pakistan, voted in favour of the resolution, while Russia and China abstained. However, Hamas rejected the resolution and also decried the establishment of an international force whose “mission includes the disarmament” of Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza.
International troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as next month to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force, two US officials told Reuters, but it remains unclear how Palestinian Hamas fighters will be disarmed.</p><small>2025-12-20 02:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/20072459d469b8c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962208/partial-strike-as-lawyers-divided-over-ihc-judges-removal' target='_blank'><strong>Partial strike as lawyers divided over IHC judge’s removal</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A visible split among lawyers in the federal capital on Friday resulted in only a partial strike, as a small group of lawyers observed the call issued by the Islamabad District Bar Association (DBA) to protest the removal of Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, while the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) played down the verdict that led to his ouster.
Justice Jahangiri was removed from office thro­ugh a short order passed by an Islamabad High Court (IHC) division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan. The bench ruled that his elevation to the high court was “without lawful authority” and that he had “ceased to hold” the office with immediate effect.

 

The short order was announced at around 3:30pm. However, sources said Justice Jahangiri had left his chamber for his residence approximately half an hour earlier, adding that he may have been informed of the decision before its formal announ­cement. An official of his court told Dawn that the judge personally met and embraced each staff member before leaving, telling them: “We will meet again if God so wills.”
Following the verdict, DBA President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar announced a strike to protest the decision. The IHCBA, however, chose not to issue any such call.
IHCBA Secretary Chaudhry Manzoor Jajja told Dawn that the verdict was “like one of the many decisions the IHC passes every day” and said there was no justification for a strike. He added that IHC judges — including Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Jahangiri himself — had previously opposed strikes over what he described as peripheral issues.
As a result of this division within the legal fraternity, the strike had only a limited impact. While routine attendance was reported at the Supreme Court, the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and the Islamabad High Court, only a small number of lawyers boycotted proceedings at the sessions courts. A senior sessions court official estimated that fewer than 10 per cent of lawyers abstained from hearings in solidarity with the ousted judge.
Meanwhile, the IHC administration issued a duty roster for the coming week that did not include Justice Jahangiri’s name. Hearings in cases fixed before his bench were cancelled, and the administration is expected to redistribute his caseload among other available judges. Even before the formal de-notification, Justice Jahangiri’s name was removed from the IHC website.
Late on Thursday night, the Presidency confirmed that President Asif Ali Zardari had approved the de-notification of Justice Jahangiri on the advice of the prime minister, in compliance with the IHC order. The move followed a direction in the short written order instructing the law ministry to de-notify him. The ministry forwarded a summary through the Prime Minister’s Office, which was subsequently approved by the president.







The controversy originated from a letter that surfaced on social media last year, purportedly issued by the University of Karachi (KU). During the proceedings, KU Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui submitted records stating that the university syndicate had cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, alleging that it had been obtained through “unfair means”. He claimed the judge had been found cheating and creating a disturbance in an examination hall in 1988 and was debarred until 1992, but had allegedly appeared in an examination in 1989 under a changed name.
Justice Jahangiri’s counsel, Advocate Muhammad Akram Sheikh, argued that a sitting judge could only be removed through the procedure prescribed under Article 209 of the Constitution, which requires proceedings before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). However, amicus curiae Barrister Zafarullah Khan contended that where a judge’s eligibility or qualification was in question, the SJC process was not applicable, citing past judicial precedents.
The bench observed that the qualification to hold the office of a high court judge was personal to the individual and independent of judicial performance. It noted that sufficient opportunity had been provided to Justice Jahangiri to submit his reply and credentials, but he failed to do so.

ISLAMABAD: In a major policy reversal amid a slight improvement in fiscal stability, the government on Friday withdrew a ban on double benefits of pension and salary for re-employed civil, judicial and military bureaucrats, introduced earlier this year and touted as a major pension reform.
The Ministry of Finance silently issued a terse notification stating that two earlier relevant orders, dated April 22 and June 19, 2025, on the subject, “are hereby withdrawn with immediate effect”.
The bureaucracy had earlier restored its perks and privileges on account of board memberships in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) ab initio, and secured executive allowances and transport monetisation allowances exceeding Rs300,000 per month on top of salaries, allowances, and other ancillary benefits.
Under the April 22, 2025, order, the government formally notified that public servants would have to choose between the new salary and pension upon rejoining the public service on a contract or regular basis after retirement.
“It has been decided that henceforth, in an event where a pensioner of the federal government after the age of 60 years, is reemployed/appointed in public service after retirement whether on regular/contract or whatsoever mode of employment, the pensioner shall have the option to retain either pension or to draw the salary of said employment during the currency of that employment,” the notification had stated.
The policy was amended on June 19 amid pressure from powerful bureaucrats, who argued that those opting to draw a salary “may face difficulties” in restoring their pensions once re-employment ended. The revised order allowed pensioners to continue receiving a pension during re-employment, provided their salary was reduced by an amount equivalent to the gross pension.
However, the pressure kept on mounting, leading to the withdrawal of both earlier notifications. This restores the old lucrative scheme under which re-hired government employees used to receive the salary of the incumbent employment, whether on contract or regular, and pension simultaneously, and, in some cases, multiple pensions.
This not only had an additional financial burden on the exchequer but also hampered the career progression of other employees.
This was part of the pension reforms the government had taken in hand to contain ever-rising pension liabilities under the IMF loan programme.
The measure allowing only salary or pension was initially announced by the then finance minister, Ishaq Dar, in the 2022-23 budget, but could not be implemented until it was reannounced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in last year’s budget, before the IMF signed off on a new programme.
One of the key decisions of these reforms — a contributory pension scheme for personnel of the armed forces — has already been delayed by another year to 2026, despite a notification implementing it with effect from June 2025.
When contacted, finance ministry spokesperson Qumar Sarwar Abbasi did not respond to a question about the forum that approved the latest reversal, as the earlier notifications had followed cabinet decisions and budget announcements in parliament.
He, however, said that “this specific change in relation to pensions had resulted in difficulties for the government in acquiring the services of experienced professionals for positions in various commissions and tribunals, etc, due to the reduced incentives”.
Also, this change applied to a very small number of individuals, and, in financial terms, the savings were negligible, he said. “It has, therefore, been decided to withdraw the change and restore the previous arrangement,” Mr Abbasi said.
On the other hand, the government has already introduced a contributory fund scheme for new entrants to the civil government and the armed forces of Pakistan.
In July, the government opened an unlimited financial avenue for senior bureaucrats through SOE board meetings while also imposing austerity measures on these enterprises.

ISLAMABAD / LAH­ORE: Reporting normalisation of Chenab River flows off late, Pakistan on Friday said it had sought an explanation from India over an “extraordinary reduction” in the river flows after what it described as the complete discharge and subsequent refilling of the Baglihar dam, in violation of the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty.
In a statement, the Min­istry of Water Reso­urces said the discharge of the Chenab River (mainstem) had “successfully stabilised following a significant period of volatility”.
It said Pakistan’s Commissioner for Indus Waters had taken up the matter with his Indian counterpart and sought details and data regarding the reduction in flows “under the framework of the Indus Waters Treaty”.

 

According to the ministry, hydrological records for the first half of Dece­mber 2025 showed the unusual decline persisted from Dec 10 to Dec 16. During the period, flows frequently dropped, with the lowest reading reco­rded at 870 cusecs, which was far below the historical 10-year minimum range of around 4,018 to 4,406 cusecs for those dates.
The ministry said satellite imagery was reviewed to assess the cause of the decline at Marala. It said a “significant reduction” in the surface area of Baglihar was observed in imagery dated Dec 8, which then increased in imagery from Dec 13.
“This reduction, followed by an increase in the surface area of Baglihar reservoir, leads us to believe that India has emptied the Baglihar reservoir followed by its refilling,” the ministry said.
It maintained that under the Indus Waters Treaty, India cannot empty the dead storage of reservoirs of run-of-the-river hydropower projects built on the western rivers. It said an explanation had therefore been sought through the Permanent Indus Commission.
The ministry said a “positive shift” in river hydrology began on Dec 17, when flows began to rise steadily. By 7am on Dec 17, the flow had reached 6,399 cusecs, bringing it back within the historical 10-year range for the first time since the mid-month decline.
It said data shared by the Punjab Irrigation Dep­a­rtment — responsible for monitoring Chenab flows at Marala (excluding Jammu and Manawar Tawi) for onward transmission to the Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters — showed that by Dec 19 (Friday), flows were within the 10-year range of maximum and minimum readings.
For instance, the readings on Dec 19 showed flows of 4,505 and 6,494 cusecs, which align with or exceed historical expectations for this time of the year.
The ministry said continuous monitoring would remain in place to respond to any future fluctuations. It added that information attributed to sources other than the office of the Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters “carries no effect whatsoever”.
Jhelum inflows
Officials, however, said the Jhelum River had also been experiencing disruptions as Indian authorities were holding and releasing water abruptly.
A senior irrigation department official said the river was also experiencing less inflows from upstream (India) to downstream (Pakistan) at Mangla Dam.
“It is really serious and alarming as well because around 15 million of the total 25 million acres of agricultural land, which is irrigated through various canals, is either receiving less or no water these days,” he added.
According to an internal report, Jhelum inflows and outflows at Mangla were 5,000 cusecs and 33,000 cusecs, respectively, on Dec 14. Inflows then fell to 3,300 cusecs on Dec 15 and remained at that level through Dec 19, while outflows stayed at 33,000 cusecs.
By comparison, the report said inflows recor­ded on Dec 19-20 last year were 4,400 cusecs, with outflows of 25,000 cusecs.
A Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) official pointed to similar readings at the Kerot Hydropower Project upstream of Mangla, suggesting abrupt upstream regulation by India. “The data at Kerot is also almost the same, which supports the view that water is being held and released abrupt­ly,” the official said, calling it a “serious matter”.
Another irrigation department official said the Chenab and Jhelum systems were crucial for irrigation through headworks, barrages and link canals, and warned that disruptions could harm crops. The official stressed that Pakistan had also faced difficulties during recent floods due to sudden releases without prior information.
Pakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Syed Mehr Ali Shah could not be reached for comment despite repeated attempts by Dawn.
However, he was earlier quoted by a TV channel as saying that the Jhelum flows were being observed. “For now, we have written a letter to India about the Chenab River. We will look into the issue further upon receipt of a reply,” Mr Shah said, stressing that Pakistan would raise its voice whenever India stops water.

The order, signed on Thursday, directs the US attorney general to move swiftly towards reclassifying marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act. If approved, marijuana would be shifted from Schedule I — a category that includes heroin and peyote — to Schedule III, which covers drugs with a lower potential for abuse and recognised medical uses. 
Senior administration officials said the primary objective of the move is to expand medical research into marijuana and cannabis-derived products, allowing scientists to better evaluate both their therapeutic benefits and potential risks. 
As part of the broader easing of restrictions, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is expected to allow some beneficiaries access to hemp-derived CBD products as early as April, officials added. 
Speaking at the White House, President Trump said marijuana would remain illegal at the federal level and continue to be regulated under a patchwork of state laws. “We have people begging for me to do this, people that are in great pain for decades,” he said, while stressing that he has no personal interest in using the drug. “A lot of people do want it. A lot of people need it.”

Flight PK860 was scheduled to land at Lahore airport at 8pm, however, it diverted to Dammam’s King Fahd International Airport due to a technical issue, said the PIA spokesperson.
The Boeing 777 aircraft had 437 passengers on board, excluding the crew. While still in Saudi airspace, the aircraft switched its transponder frequency to 7700 — signifying a general emergency.
The ‘7700 squawk’ is an aviation term for when a pilot sets an aircraft’s transponder code to 7700, alerting air traffic control to an emergency on board.
It signifies a serious issue, such as engine trouble or a medical emergency, and makes the plane a high-priority for immediate attention and assistance.
The plane landed safely at Dammam airport and is undergoing checks by engineering staff on the ground, confirmed the PIA spokesperson. The airline did not elaborate on the nature of the emergency.
The airline also did not comment further on passenger facilitation or the time needed before the flight resumes its journey to its destination.
In September 2019, a PIA flight from Lahore to Jeddah was delayed due to a “technical fault” in the aircraft, a spokesperson said.
The spokesperson denied media reports that the plane had caught fire and said that the plane made an emergency landing soon after a technical fault was detected.
About 200 passengers were onboard PK759 when it took off at 9:30am. The flight was scheduled to take off at 12pm in a different aircraft.
“PIA’s staff is taking care of the passengers in the airport lounge,” the spokesperson said.
On November 3 this year, aircraft engineers represented by the Society of Aircraft Engineers of Pakistan (SAEP) refused to issue clearance certificates to aircraft, because of which hundreds of passengers were stranded at different airports due to long delays in the flights, especially those scheduled for Saudi Arabia.
According to SAEP representatives, the protest was carried out over two primary issues: salary disparities, safety and the unavailability of spare parts.
The next day, PIA said it restored flight operations with some alternate arrangements after delays due to what it called a “strike”, but the SAEP stated there was no strike from their side and the engineers were only adhering to mandatory safety and certification protocols.
However, on November 6, SAEP President Abdullah Jadoon and Secretary General Awais Jadoon were dismissed from service.</p><small>2025-12-19 19:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191000224809199.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962009/4-security-forces-personnel-martyred-in-attack-on-camp-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>4 security forces personnel martyred in attack on camp in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>Four security forces personnel were martyred when an attempt by terrorists to attack a security forces camp was foiled in the area of Boya in North Waziristan district, said a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Friday.
“On 19 December 2025, in a heinous and cowardly terrorist act, Khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij attacked security forces camp, in general area Boya, North Waziristan District.”
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The military’s media wing added that the terrorists “attempted to breach the perimeter security, however, their nefarious designs were swiftly foiled by the vigilant and resolute response by own troops”.
The terrorists then rammed an explosives-laden vehicle “on [the] outer perimeter wall, resulting in its collapse and considerable damage to adjacent civilian infrastructure, including a mosque”.
The ISPR stated that the car bomb attack inflicted damage to nearby homes and other structures and inflicted “severe injuries to fifteen local civilians, including innocent children and women”.

In an earlier report, police and hospital sources reported that 11 civilians were injured as a result of the blast, and they were rushed to the district headquarters hospital in Miranshah for treatment.
“However, during the intense fire exchanges, four brave sons of soil Havildar Muhammad Waqas (age: 42 years, resident of District Kotli), Naik Khanwaiz (age: 38 years, resident of District Mansehra), Sepoy Sufyan Haider (age: 25 years, resident of District Vehari) and Sepoy Riffat (age: 32 years, resident of District Leyyah) having fought gallantly, paid the ultimate sacrifice and embraced Shahadat,” stated ISPR, giving details of the martyred personnel.
The military further said that the “hideous” act of terrorism was planned and orchestrated by Afghanistan-based khwarij and “is in contrast to assertions made by Afghan Taliban Regime, claiming non presence of these terrorist groups operating from their soil”.
“Pakistan expects from Afghan Taliban Regime to fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij against Pakistan as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost.”
The military warned that Pakistan reserves the right to hunt down and eliminate the terrorists and their facilitators to ensure the safety of the Pakistani people.
The incident comes two months after four terrorists were killed after security forces foiled a suicide attack on a military camp in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali.
State media reported at the time that one terrorist rammed a vehicle loaded with explosives into the wall of the security forces’ camp after which three more tried to enter it.
Friday’s incident comes as a spate of terrorist attacks continues in Pakistan. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year.</p><small>2025-12-19 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640412-shumaila-imran-farooq-a-life-shaped-by-mqm-politics-unresolved-assassination' target='_blank'><strong>Shumaila Imran Farooq: a life shaped by MQM politics, unresolved assassination</strong></a><br><p>

Taiwan’s Premier Cho Jung-tai said the attacks at Taipei Main Station and Zhongshan Station were “a deliberate act”, although the motive was not immediately clear.
Cho said in a statement that the suspect wore a mask and threw “five or six gasoline bombs or smoke grenades” at Taipei Main Station.
According to the Taipei City Fire Department, a total of four people were confirmed dead, including the suspect, a 27-year-old man. Five other people were injured, it added.
The city’s mayor said the suspect had apparently jumped off a building and that he was wanted for evading military service.
One of the victims was killed while trying to stop the attack at the Main Station, Mayor Chiang Wan-an told reporters.
“Unfortunately, he was attacked and passed away … we are all deeply saddened,” he said.

A witness of the attack at the Main Station told local network EBC News that he had seen a “man rush up and try and subdue” the attacker, who was “wearing a gas mask and a bulletproof vest”.
“At first I thought it was a drill, then I saw a person holding a knife and throwing smoke grenades,” said the witness, who did not give his name.
The mayor said that “we understand that the suspect committed suicide by jumping from a building to evade arrest, and has been confirmed dead.”
High alert
A second witness told EBC News that “someone ran out wearing a gas mask and started throwing canisters that released gas.
“I quickly ran away. He kept throwing them behind me. I didn’t count how many (canisters) but there was a constant banging and clanging sound,” added the witness, who also did not give his name.
“I didn’t hear any explosions, but a lot of gas kept spraying out.” Cho, the island’s premier, earlier said three people suffered cardiac arrest as a result of the attacks, and several people had “injuries from stab wounds and blunt force trauma to various parts of their bodies”.
Authorities said they were ramping up security across the island in response to the attacks.

“All important locations… including railway stations, highways, subway stations and airports are maintaining a high level of alert and vigilance,” Cho told reporters.
Images released by Taiwan’s Central News Agency show a canister on the ground at the Main Station, with officers examining potential evidence at the scene.
A video posted on social media shows a thick cloud of white smoke covering an underground section of a metro station, with some people standing at a distance.
President Lai Ching-te said Taiwanese authorities will “quickly clarify the details of the case. There will be no leniency and we will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of our citizens.”
Violent crime is rare in Taiwan, though an attack in 2014 horrified the normally peaceful island when a man went on a stabbing spree on Taipei’s metro, killing four people. He was executed for the killings in 2016.</p><small>2025-12-19 16:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640394-pakistan-raises-water-flow-concerns-with-india-over-unusual-chenab-river-fluctuations' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan raises water flow concerns with India over 'unusual Chenab River fluctuations'</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X, the interim administration wrote that a Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight carrying Sharif Osman Hadi’s remains landed at Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport in Dhaka at 5:48pm local time (4:48pm PKT) after departing from Singapore, where he was undergoing medical treatment.







Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, the youth leader who died, was a spokesperson for the Inquilab Mancha (Platform for Revolution) and participated in the protests that overthrew Hasina. He was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last Friday while launching his election campaign.
Hadi, an outspoken critic of India, was initially treated at a local hospital before being flown to Singapore for advanced medical care, where he died after spending six days on life support.
Meanwhile, the United States Embassy in Dhaka stated in a post on X that Hadi’s funeral prayers will be held after afternoon prayers around 2pm in front of the National Parliament building on Manik Mia Avenue.
“Extremely heavy traffic is expected in the area and throughout Dhaka. US citizens should practice vigilance and remember that gatherings intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and escalate into violence,” the post warned.
“ You should avoid demonstrations and exercise caution in the vicinity of any large gatherings. ”







Chief adviser of the interim administration Muhammad Yunus also confirmed in a post on X that the funeral would be held at 2pm at the southern plaza of the Bangladeshi parliament building.
Although calm had returned to much of the country on Friday morning, protesters carrying national flags and placards continued demonstrating at Shahbagh in central Dhaka, chanting slogans and vowing not to return until justice was served.

 

Residents in the Muslim-majority South Asian nation of 173 million said they were worried there could be fresh violence later on Friday.
The National Citizen Party, formed by students who led protests that forced then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to flee the country last year, also warned of possible violence later in the day.
Nearly 1,500 people gathered peacefully at the national mosque in Dhaka after Friday prayers for a rally called by Khelafat Majlis, a religiopolitical party.

According to Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star, around 100 protesters gathered in Chowhatta and demanded that those responsible for Hadi‘s killing be brought to justice and also called for the resignation of Dhaka’s home affairs adviser if their demands were not met.
“Addressing the gathering, protesters alleged that the killing had been carried out ‘at the behest of India’ and blamed the Awami League and its affiliated bodies, particularly the banned Chhatra League,” the newspaper reported.

In Dhaka, videos circulating on social media showed mobs vandalising the offices of the country’s largest daily newspaper, Prothom Alo, as well as The Daily Star, on Thursday night.
The fire service said the blaze at The Daily Star was under control. Troops were deployed to the scene, and firefighters rescued journalists trapped inside the building.
The demonstrations were marked by emotionally charged slogans invoking Hadi’s name, with protesters vowing to continue their movement and demanding swift justice.
Several areas remained tense, with additional police and paramilitary forces deployed to prevent further violence.
Chief adviser of the interim government, Muhammad Yunus, issued a statement from his office condemning the arson and urging citizens to resist mob violence.
“This is a critical moment in our nation’s history when we are making a historic democratic transition,” he was quoted as saying. “We cannot and must not allow it to be derailed by those few who thrive on chaos and reject peace.”
Yunus added that the upcoming elections were “inseparable” from Hadi’s dreams and that honouring his sacrifice would require restraint, responsibility and a commitment against hatred.







“To the journalists of The Daily Star, Prothom Alo and New Age: we stand with you. We are deeply sorry for the terror and violence you have endured,” the statement read.
“The nation has witnessed your courage and tolerance in the face of terror. Attacks on journalists are attacks on truth itself. We promise you full justice.”
The statement also condemned the lynching of a Hindu man in Mymensingh, vowing that there would be “no space for such violence in new Bangladesh”.
UN rights chief urges probe into killing
The United Nations human rights chief voiced alarm at Hadi’s killing and called for a swift and impartial investigation.
“I urge the authorities to conduct a prompt, impartial, thorough and transparent investigation into the attack that led to Hadi’s death, and to ensure due process and accountability for those responsible,” UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.
He urged calm as protesters rallied across Bangladesh.
“Retaliation and revenge will only deepen divisions and undermine the rights of all,” he warned.
With parliamentary elections scheduled for February, Turk stressed that it was vital to ensure an environment where all individuals could participate safely and peacefully in public life and freely express different views.
“I urge the authorities to uphold the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and security of journalists at this critical time, and prevent further escalation of unrest,” the rights chief added.
Government blames ‘fringe elements’
Bangladesh has been governed by the interim administration led by Nobel laureate Yunus since August 2024, after Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising.
The government has been grappling with fresh protests over delayed reforms, and warnings of unrest by Hasina’s party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the vote. The elections are scheduled for February 12.
It urged the people of Bangladesh to resist all forms of mob violence, which it said were committed by a “few fringe elements”.
Earlier, in a televised address to the nation, Yunus declared Saturday a day of state mourning in honour of Hadi.
Violence was also reported in a number of cities across Bangladesh, including the port city of Chittagong, where protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission.
The unrest follows fresh anti-India protests this week, with ties between the neighbours deteriorating since Hasina fled to Delhi.
On Wednesday, hundreds of demonstrators marched toward the Indian High Commission in Dhaka, chanting anti-India slogans, while also demanding Hasina’s return.</p><small>2025-12-19 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19205752130705e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962043/kp-governments-non-cooperation-with-institutions-may-lead-to-governors-rule-kundi' target='_blank'><strong>KP government’s non-cooperation with institutions may lead to governor’s rule: Kundi</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Friday warned the PTI that the KP government’s non-cooperation with federal institutions might lead to the imposition of governor’s rule in the province.
The talks of governor’s rule in KP emerged after Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said that the imposition of governor’s rule in KP was being “seriously considered”, linking the need for this potential move to the “security and governance issues” in the province.
“The PTI cannot end the sentence of its party founder Imran Khan by attempting to forcibly shut down Islamabad or Peshawar, as protests and sit-ins cannot secure his release,” Kundi said, referring to the opposition party’s multiple attempts to march to the federal capital and its protests in Peshawar to put pressure on authorities for the release of the former prime minister.
Speaking to the media, the KP governor said Imran, who is currently serving his sentence in Adiala prison in Rawalpindi, was enjoying “VVIP facilities” in the prison and that “road blockades would not change his legal fate”.
“I don’t wish Imran Khan to be treated in the same manner as PTI leaders desired for their opponents,” he said.
Kundi said if the KP government cooperated with federal institutions, there would be no need for the governor’s rule. However, non-cooperation, particularly on the repatriation of Afghan refugees, could lead to such a step.
Citing the PTI-led federal government’s decision to hold talks with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in 2021, Kundi said the PTI had advocated engagement with terrorists. “But today, the state would never negotiate with those who take up arms against it,” he added.“No country allows foreigners to live without visas. The same rule applies in Pakistan,” he said.
Pakistan had provided solid evidence that Afghan soil was being used against Pakistan, but Kabul was not taking the matter seriously, he said. “No foreigner would be allowed to stay in Pakistan without a visa,” he added, noting that Afghan refugees could return legally. “All Afghans are not terrorists, but a few elements are creating problems,” the governor said.
He said that, though PTI had refused to shake hands, the talks with them were still welcome, but political dialogue was not possible without the PML-N. He alleged that PTI was now attempting to bring in an “imported opposition.”
Criticising KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the governor said the chief minister and his cabinet appeared to be operating from outside Adiala prison rather than governing the province. “The real issue in KP is governance. There has been no visible development over the past two years, or even during the last 13 years,” he said, calling the province a “hub of corruption”.
He ruled out the era of “selective accountability,” saying recent judgments proved that accountability was applied to institutions and extended to the judiciary.
The governor also condemned the May 9 violence, saying no patriot could commit such acts.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar earlier said “governor’s rule is not the face of any martial law” and added that if the conditions merit it, then it was within the Constitution to implement it.</p><small>2025-12-19 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19211118ffc67c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962042/heated-argument-over-road-project-between-aleem-khan-palwasha-khan-mars-senate-standing-committee-session' target='_blank'><strong>Heated argument over road project between Aleem Khan, Palwasha Khan mars Senate standing committee session</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A heated exchange was witnessed between Minister for Communications Aleem Khan and Senator Palwasha Khan on Friday during a meeting of the Senate Committee on Communications over a question related to the construction of a road project.
The confrontation began when the PPP senator raised a question about a road she alleged was benefiting a private housing society in Lahore.
Pulwasha maintained that it was her right to “seek clarification on a project funded with public money and question whether the road had been built to benefit a specific private entity”.
A bitter exchange then took place between the minister and the senator. “I cannot stand the allegations set against me; I consider this offensive,” the minister said.
Senator Palwasha responded that the minister became furious over being “just questioned.”

         View this post on Instagram            

“I just asked a question whether you sought any benefit from it or not; it was not an allegation,” the senator clarified.
Aleem then reportedly said he would respond in kind if such “personal attacks” were made, adding that he did not wish to descend to what he described as a “lower level of discourse”.
Senator Palwasha, noting that the minister reacted angrily to legitimate parliamentary scrutiny, claimed he became “enraged” when asked to respond.
“You are angry at being questioned because you are guilty,” the senator stated.
“We will treat you the way we are treated,” Aleem responded. “If you speak about our person, we will also speak about yours,” he added.
As tempers flared, the committee chairman repeatedly attempted to defuse the situation and restore order.
“Mr chairman, is this any way to behave?” Palwasha questioned.
The senator then formally demanded a ruling on the minister’s conduct from the chairman of the committee, reiterating that her question was limited to transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.
“Give a ruling on the conduct of the federal minister,” she demanded.
The senator also urged the committee chairman to intervene and issue a ruling on what she termed the minister’s inappropriate behaviour.
“A ruling should be given on this behaviour,” Palwasha reiterated.
Speaking to the media outside the Parliament House following the argument, she said that if “a road funded by the public is being built, then why can we not question whether someone is trying to seek benefits for his private business?”
Expressing disappointment at the minister‘s behaviour, she said it was the “collective demeanour of Shehbaz Sharif’s cabinet”
She also maintained that she will bring this matter to her party’s senior leadership.
Senator Bilal Ahmed Khan Mandokhail, a committee member, said that while ministers are routinely questioned in committees, the exchange was “inappropriate”.
He added that after the chairman’s intervention, the minister offered an apology, which Senator Palwasha declined to accept.</p><small>2025-12-19 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640385-cm-murad-says-red-warrants-to-be-issued-for-foreign-extortion-gangs' target='_blank'><strong>CM Murad says red notices to be issued for foreign extortion gangs</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement issued by the FO, President Zardari is visiting the Middle Eastern country at the invitation of his Iraqi counterpart, Abdul Latif Jamal Rashid.
The visit underscores the “longstanding, brotherly relations between Pakistan and Iraq, rooted in shared bonds of faith, culture, and mutual respect”, the FO said.







It added that during his meetings with the Iraqi leadership, President Zardari will review bilateral relations between the two countries and explore ways to further strengthen cooperation across key areas of mutual interest, including trade and investment, energy, reconstruction, manpower, technology, education and people-to-people exchanges.
The discussions will also cover regional and international developments, as well as cooperation at multilateral forums, according to the FO statement.
“The visit is expected to reinforce the traditionally warm and cordial ties between the two countries, identify new avenues of partnership, and enhance people-to-people linkages, particularly in the context of religious tourism and economic collaboration.
“The official visit reflects Pakistan’s continued engagement with Iraq and its commitment to fostering a result-oriented, forward-looking, and strategic partnership that contributes to Iraq’s stability and development, as well as to regional peace and prosperity,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-19 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19180522e96d845.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962038/trump-epstein-shared-close-relationship-marked-by-pursuit-of-women-nyt' target='_blank'><strong>Trump, Epstein shared ‘close’ relationship, marked by ‘pursuit of women’: NYT</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump and late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein shared a close relationship, with the latter calling Trump his “best friend”, according to a New York Times investigation published on Thursday.
Epstein, a convicted sex offender, died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking of underage girls. He held close associations with several influential people, including business tycoons and celebrities.
In November, Democrats released emails that suggested Trump was aware of the financier’s sexual abuse and definitely “knew about the girls.”
According to the NYT, while Trump was not found implicated in Epstein’s abuse and trafficking of minors, it appeared that the two men’s relationship was “far closer” than what the US president maintains.
“Beginning in the late 1980s, the two men forged a bond intense enough to leave others who knew them with the impression that they were each other‘s closest friend,” NYT reported, with Epstein reported to have claimed that he was Trump’s “closest friend for 10 years”.

NYT found that the two shared a distinct relationship, with the common interest of “pursuing women”.
“With other men, Epstein might discuss tax shelters, international affairs or neuroscience. With Trump, he talked about sex,” the report said, citing accounts of former employees.
The investigation detailed that throughout the 1990s, Epstein was Trump’s “most reliable wingman”.
It said that the two often “visited each other’s offices and spoke often by phone,” citing interviews with former employees of Epstein.
According to NYT, Epstein’s partner, Ghislaine Maxwell, introduced six women to Trump, one of whom was a minor; however, none of the women accused the US president of inappropriate behaviour.
According to an email released by Congress, the NYT found that Epstein once “boasted” that he “gave” Trump a 20-year-old woman.
In another instance, an Epstein employee from that era told the NYT that Trump would “occasionally send over modelling cards for Epstein to peruse, like a menu”.
The report also detailed that Epstein’s former assistant kept “daily handwritten notes” with instructions to either call Trump or return his call, indicating his regular presence in Epstein’s life.
The NYT found that in November 1993, at a beauty pageant press luncheon attended by Trump, a contestant, Beatrice Keul, alleged that Trump “groped” her and forced himself on her during a private meeting.
Before the meeting, she recalled that she was approached by Epstein, who told her, “I’m Jeffrey. I’m Don’s best friend.”
Epstein was not affiliated with the pageant, Keul said.
“He said, ‘Don likes you very much,’ and that they were organising parties at Mar-a-Lago and he would love me to join,” NYT quoted Keul as saying.

She alleged that Epstein pushed her and went on about “wealth he kept in Swiss banks, then about famous friends with whom he could arrange meetings,“ adding that this “hunting method” was routine.
In another instance, a woman who had attended several parties at Epstein’s mansion recalled that Trump was a “household name, someone Epstein often bragged about to the women around him, yet also seemed to compete with”.
“It was like a pissing contest — who had the most women,” the NYT quoted her as saying.
However, the two men’s relationship “soured” after allegations appeared against Epstein around the mid-2000s, the report said, beginning with a Page Six item in The New York Post.

The report mentioned Virginia Giuffre, who was at the centre of Epstein’s removal from the Mar-a-Lago club. Giuffre, then 18, was a masseuse at Trump’s exclusive club.
After she went public with her allegations, Epstein wrote to Maxwell that Trump had not received more attention in the case, considering that “he spent hours at my house” with Giuffre.
However, Giuffre, who died by suicide in April, maintained that “Trump had never had sex with her, and that she couldn’t remember seeing him in Epstein’s homes,” the NYT said.
NYT found that Epstein “resented Trump’s efforts to distance himself,” according to his emails.
On November 13, Congressional Democrats released 19 new images from the estate of the late Epstein, which included photos of now-President Trump.
In one black-and-white photo, Trump was seen smiling with several women — whose faces are redacted — on each side of him. A second image shows Trump standing beside Epstein, and a third, less-clear image shows him seated alongside another woman, whose face is also redacted, with his red tie loosened. It was not clear when or where the photos were taken.
“Everybody knew this man,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the photos.

The rain-hit second semi-final was reduced to 27 overs a side, and Pakistan skipper Farhan Yousaf’s decision to field first proved decisive as Bangladesh were bundled out for 121 in 26.3 overs.
Subhan led the charge with a probing spell of 4-20, accounting for key batsmen Azizul Hakim and Kalam Siddiki to leave Bangladesh reeling.
Huzaifa Ahsan offered excellent support with figures of 2-10, while Ali Raza and Mohammad Sayyam chipped in with a wicket apiece.
Samiun Basir was the lone resistance for Bangladesh with a 33-run knock before being run out at the close of the innings.
Pakistan’s chase was briefly checked when wicket-keeper-batter Hamza Zahoor fell for a duck, but opener Sameer Minhas ensured there were no further alarms.
The right-hander anchored the innings with a composed unbeaten 69 off 57 balls, striking six fours and two sixes. H
e added 85 runs for the second wicket with Usman Khan, who scored a brisk 27 before falling lbw to Samiun.
Ahmed Hussain stayed with Minhas till the end as Pakistan reached 122 for two in just 16.3 overs, sealing victory with 63 balls to spare.
Subhan was named player of the match for his incisive bowling performance.
Pakistan will now meet India in Sunday’s final at the ICC Academy Ground, setting up a high-profile clash between the traditional rivals.

Dubai’s Emirates airline axed 13 flights on Friday and there were also delays and cancellations at neighbouring Sharjah’s airport after the overnight downpour, which woke residents with lightning flashes and loud cracks of thunder.
Sharjah’s main street was completely flooded early on Friday, with residents seen wading through it in bare feet. One man rode his bicycle through the water, which reached the top of its wheels.







The scenes evoked memories of April 2024, when record rains caused widespread flooding and forced the cancellation of more than 2,000 flights at Dubai’s major international air hub.
On Thursday, Dubai police had urged residents to stay in unless “absolutely necessary” as the rainstorm approached.
Early on Friday, water-pumping trucks were seen around Dubai clearing blocked roads and large puddles in the streets.
The Dubai Airports website showed dozens of flights had been delayed on Friday and some cancelled.
“Some flights … are cancelled or delayed due to adverse weather,” a Dubai Airports spokesperson said.
The National Centre of Meteorology had warned of rainfall across the country from Thursday to Friday, including in Dubai and the capital Abu Dhabi.
Other Gulf states also experienced heavy rain, including Qatar where the Arab Cup football’s third-place play-off between Saudi Arabia and UAE was cancelled on Thursday.

Last year’s downpours in the UAE, the heaviest since records began 76 years ago, killed at least four people and brought Dubai to a standstill for days.
A study published by the World Weather Attribution group found that global warming caused by fossil fuel emissions “most likely” exacerbated the intense rain that lashed the UAE and Oman last year.</p><small>2025-12-19 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/191648472f29c95.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962036/over-1000-patients-have-died-awaiting-evacuation-from-gaza-since-july-2024-who' target='_blank'><strong>Over 1,000 patients have died awaiting evacuation from Gaza since July 2024: WHO</strong></a><br><p>More than 1,000 patients have died while waiting for urgent medical evacuation from war-ravaged Gaza in the last year and a half, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday.
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on X that the UN agency and its partners had “evacuated over 10,600 patients from Gaza with severe health conditions, including over 5,600 children” since the start of the war more than two years ago.
But he warned that “many more patients remain in Gaza awaiting evacuation to receive appropriate healthcare”.







Citing numbers from the health ministry in Gaza, Tedros said that 1,092 patients were known to have died while awaiting medical evacuation just between July 2024 and November 28, 2025.
“This figure is likely underreported,” he warned, calling on “more countries to open doors to patients from Gaza, and for medical evacuation to the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, to be restored”.
“Lives depend on it.”
The WHO has previously estimated that more than 16,500 patients still need treatment outside of Gaza, while a top official with the charity Doctors Without Borders told AFP earlier this month the actual number was likely “three to four times that number”.
Up to December 1, over 30 countries had taken patients from Gaza, but only a handful, including Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, had accepted large numbers.
A US-sponsored ceasefire has halted fighting in Gaza, which began after Hamas’s deadly attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.
But the deal, in effect since October 10, remains fragile as Israel and Hamas accuse each other almost daily of violations.</p><small>2025-12-19 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/19162751abfb5c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962034/pakistan-targets-january-for-inaugural-panda-bond-tranche-says-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan targets January for inaugural panda bond tranche, says finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan is targeting January to issue its first panda bond tranche, part of a planned programme of up to $1 billion, the Ministry of Finance said on Friday, as Islamabad seeks to diversify funding sources and tap China’s onshore debt market.
The inaugural issuance is expected to raise the equivalent of about $250 million, with further tranches to follow under a phased programme once regulatory approvals are completed, the ministry said after Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb chaired a review meeting on the plan.
Approvals from multilateral partners have already been secured, and final clearances from Chinese regulators are expected by early January, the statement said.
The panda bond programme, denominated in yuan and sold on China’s domestic market, is part of Pakistan’s broader debt management strategy as it works to stabilise its economy under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme.







Pricing for the inaugural bond will be determined closer to the launch once all regulatory requirements are completed, the ministry said.
The finance ministry said engagement with Chinese institutional investors had been constructive, reflecting improving confidence in Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook following recent policy reforms.
Preparatory work has already begun for subsequent tranches within the planned $1bn panda bond programme.
Moody’s raised its long-term foreign-currency issuer rating to Caa1 with a stable outlook in August 2025, citing an improving external position supported by reforms and IMF support. S&P Global Ratings upgraded Pakistan to B- with a stable outlook in July 2025.
Pakistan has relied heavily on bilateral and multilateral financing, including short-term funding from Middle Eastern banks, but is now looking to broaden its investor base through markets such as China’s onshore bond market.</p><small>2025-12-19 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640330-may-9-case-yasmin-rashid-sarfraz-cheema-among-others-handed-10-year-imprisonment' target='_blank'><strong>ATC hands 10-year imprisonment to Yasmin Rashid, other PTI leaders in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

This observation by UN special rapporteurs was made in a report dated October 16, which was made public on December 15. The report outlined India‘s military response to the Pahalgam attack, as well as New Delhi’s decision to hold the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in “abeyance” following the incident.
The five UN experts who compiled the report also observed that New Delhi’s actions that “may be taken to disrupt the flow of water to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty” appeared to risk violating the rights to work and livelihood, an adequate standard of living — including the rights to water and food — a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and development.
The attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22 resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
A day after the attack, India decided to immediately hold the IWT in “abeyance”. For its part, Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share under the treaty an “act of war”, noting the treaty had no provision for unilateral suspension.
Under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, three rivers that flow westwards — Indus, Chenab and Jhelum — were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers of the Indus Basin.
Roughly two weeks after the Pahalgam incident, India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, an act which led to the worst between the old foes in decades. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people, before agreeing to a ceasefire.
UN Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms while Countering Terrorism Ben Saul, UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Right to a Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment Astrid Puentes Riano, UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions Morris Tidball-Binz and UN Special Rapporteur on the Human Rights to Safe Drinking Water and Sanitation Pedro Arrojo-Agudo, as well as an independent expert on the promotion of a democratic and equitable international order George Katrougalos discussed these events in detail in their October report.
‘Unlawful use of force’
The UN experts noted that while India maintained it had exercised its “right to respond and preempt, as well as deter … cross-border attacks” by lauching strikes in Pakistan, New Delhi “did not notify the UN Security Council that its operation was in the exercise to of the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, under the procedures required by that article“.
They emphasised that Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter and customary international law “prohibits India from the threat or use of armed force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Pakistan, whether such force is targeting state or non-state actors”.
“We note further that under Article 51 of the United Nations Charter and customary international law, India may only exercise the right of self-defence in foreign territory where it is necessary and proportionate in response to an armed attack committed by a foreign state, whether directly by state forces or where a state ‘sends’ non-state forces to attack,” they added.
The experts further highlighted that Article 51 required “the victim state“ to report the armed attack to the Security Council.
“There is no separate right to unilaterally use military force in foreign territory in order to counter terrorism.”
The experts also said, “We are concerned that India has not disclosed credible evidence that the militants who committed the Pahalgam attack were sent to attack India by the Government of Pakistan.”
Reiterating that India had not notified the Security Council of any claim of self-defence in carrying out strikes in Pakistan, they experts observed: “It appears that India has violated the prohibition on the use of force under article 2(4) of the UN Charter, and may itself have committed an armed attack on Pakistan, entitling Pakistan to exercise self-defence under Article 51 of the Charter, risking escalation that could pose grave danger to life in both states.”
“The unlawful use of force would consequently constitute a violation of the right to life under Article 6 of the ICCPR (International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights),“ the experts said.
They further noted that “the illegal use of force on foreign territory would also constitute a violation of the foreign state’s sovereignty and the duty of non-intervention in a foreign state”.
‘Abeyance’ of IWT
Discussing the “abeyance” of IWT by India in a unilateral action, the UN experts highlighted its significance for Pakistan.
They noted that rivers irrigate 18 million hectares of farmland in the country (about 80 percent of Pakistan’s arable land), particularly in the food bowl provinces of Punjab and Sindh, contributing 24 per cent of Pakistan’s gross domestic product.
“The rivers are thus vital in providing food security and livelihoods within Pakistan’s population of 240 million people. Limited water storage in Pakistan means that it relies on the unimpeded flow of river water.
“Any disruption of the flow of water under the Indus Waters Treaty (such as by filling large pondage pools and reservoirs, opening dam gates to flood downstream, or the mass release of sediment) could have serious impacts onistan, human rights in Pak including the right to work and livelihood, the right to an adequate standard of living (including the right to water and the right to food), the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and the right to development,” they said.
The experts further stated that Pakistan was “already a water-stressed country and is one of the ten countries most vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, including water scarcity”.
They said they were “deeply concerned” that any disruption of the flow of water to Pakistan a a consequence of India holding the IWT in “abeyance” could “severely affect the human rights of millions of people […] who rely on the river for agriculture, industry, drinking water and sanitation and healthy ecosystems”.
They emphasised that the “obligation to respect rights requires states to refrain from directly or indirectly interfering in the enjoyment of the right, including where state conduct has foreseeable transboundary effects”
In this connection, they also cited the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which says: “States parties have to respect the enjoyment of the right [to water] in other countries. International cooperation requires states parties to refrain from actions that interfere, directly or indirectly, with the enjoyment of the right to water in other countries.
“Any activities undertaken within the state party’s jurisdiction should not deprive another country of the ability to realise the right to water for persons in its jurisdiction”. States must not prevent the cross-border supply of water and water should never be used as an instrument of political and economic pressure”.
The experts further said that the duty to respect the right to water required refraining from any activity that denied or limited equal access to adequate water, and maintaining access to existing water supplies.
“We note further that there is a strong presumption against retrogressive measures and that if any such measures are taken, the state must prove that they were introduced after the most careful consideration of all alternatives and that they are duly justified by reference to the totality of ICESCR (International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) rights in the context of the full use of the state party’s maximum available resources,” they added.
Moreover, the UN experts highlighted that the International Court of Justice had “consistently affirmed states’ obligation to prevent significant transboundary environmental harm, most recently in its 2025 advisory opinion on climate change”.
“The court emphasised that this duty forms part of customary international law and constitutes an erga omnes obligation (obligation towards all), owed to the international community as a whole.
“In this regard, the right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is indispensable for the enjoyment of all human rights and is foundational for states to fulfil their broader human rights obligations,” they stressed.
The UN experts also expressed the concern that the suspension or termination of the IWT could violate the “right of self-determination of peoples and the right to development in Pakistan in relation to their common water resources”.
They further said that there did not appear to be “any valid international legal grounds for holding the IWT in abeyance so as to justify the “potential interferences in human rights in Pakistan of disrupting the flow of water assured under the treaty”.
“We are concerned that the unilateral suspension of the treaty would not appear to constitute a valid countermeasure precluding the wrongfulness of the act under the law of treaties,” the experts said.
They said that India had not disclosed “credible evidence” that Pakistan had committed an internationally wrongful act by carrying out, or diligently failing to prevent, the Pahalgam attack, and that such threats continue, thereby justifying countermeasures to prevent the continuing violation.
“Even if Pakistan were responsible, we are concerned that the suspension of the treaty would not be proportionate to the injury suffered, given the severe adverse impacts on the human rights of Pakistanis from the disruption of the flow of water. We further emphasise that countermeasures must not in any case affect obligations for the protection of fundamental rights, which are engaged by the effects of suspending the treaty,” the experts said.
They also noted that the procedural preconditions of countermeasures, namely giving notice and offering to negotiate, did not appear to be fulfilled.
On concerns over cross-border terrorism, water-sharing
The UN experts further expressed concern that disputes over cross-border terrorism and water-sharing may persist as long as the “underlying dispute” about the status of occupied Kashmir was not “peacefully settled in accordance with international law.
In this regard, the UN experts posed six questions to the Indian government.
They called on the Indian government to provide comments on the aforementioned allegations and to indicate whether it would provide “reparation and apology for violations of the right to life resulting from the unlawful use of force in Pakistan”.
They also asked for an explanation for whether India would fulfil its obligations under the IWT “in good faith” and refrain from taking measures that interfere with Pakistan’s legal rights under the treaty and consequently the human rights of those in Pakistan dependent on the flow of water.
They also sought clarification on the measures India was taking or planned to take to prevent “harming human rights” as a result of disrupting the IWT.
They further asked whether India would peacefully settle any disputes with Pakistan over the IWT and only seek to modify it in accordance with its provisions on modification.
The UN experts also sought an explanation on the steps which will be taken to pursue a peaceful settlement of the occupied Kashmir issue, in accordance with international law and the right of self-determination.
“While awaiting a reply, we urge that all necessary interim measures be taken to halt the alleged violations and prevent their re-occurrence and in the event that the investigations support or suggest the allegations to be correct, to ensure the accountability of any person(s) responsible for the alleged violations,” they said.
President welcomes report
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari welcomed the UN report, according to a press release by the president’s media wing. The statement quoted the president as saying that the report “raises serious concerns over India’s military actions against Pakistan in May this year and its wider conduct affecting global and peace and stability”.
The president said the report reinforced Pakistan’s long-standing position that the unilateral use of force across international borders constituted a violation of the UN Charter and a grave breach of Pakistan’s sovereignty.
President Zardari also said that the findings relating to civilian deaths, damage to populated areas and religious sites of Pakistan in May, and the heightened risk of escalation caused by India were “deeply disturbing”.
He appreciated the report’s observations on India’s unilateral declaration of “holding in abeyance” its obligations under the IWT, its aggressive posture and statements and the serious civilian losses resulting from Indian aggression, it added.
According to the statement, he said that the IWT remained a “binding international agreement and a cornerstone of regional stability”, stressing that bypassing agreed dispute-resolution mechanisms and actions affecting water flows “violated Pakistan’s rights and risked creating serious human rights consequences”.
President Zardari also said the report also reflected growing international concerns over India’s conduct as a “rogue state that increasingly acts as a global bully, relying on coercion, intimidation and the normalisation of force and violence rather than law and dialogue,” the statement said.
He noted that serious reports of transnational violence and targeted killings attributed to India, raised in multiple countries, point to a “dangerous pattern that extends beyond the region and undermines global norms”.
The president expressed concern that the report “clearly manifests the irresponsible state behaviour of India”.
“India has long stonewalled its minorities and ignored its commitments to international forums such as the UN, but this pattern of rogue behaviour cannot continue indefinitely,” he said, and underscored that such behaviour cannot be allowed to persist, according to the press release.
The president also noted the report’s clear conclusion that international law did not recognise any separate right to unilateral military action under the pretext of counter-terrorism.
He said the affirmation of Pakistan’s inherent right to self-defence under international law highlighted the “seriousness of the violations identified,” the statement added.
Zardari welcomed the UN experts’ scrutiny of India’s regional conduct, “including concerns relating to support for terror outfits and the use of an illegitimate Afghan government to advance hostile objectives”, and called for transparency and accountability in this regard.
The president also welcomed the call by UN special rapporteurs for credible evidence, compensation for civilian losses, adherence to treaty obligations and a commitment to peaceful dialogue, including on occupied Kashmir, the statement added.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace, restraint and respect for international law, and said that Pakistan would “continue to pursue diplomatic and legal avenues to safeguard its sovereignty, protect the rights of its people and promote stability in the region”.
