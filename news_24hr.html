Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
At least 313 people, including 142 children, have died and 740 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to updated daily data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
The incident occurred in Nariyah Behak, part of Sarli Sacha village northwest of Muzaffarabad, where a cloudburst sent a wall of water surging down Jhugiyan Nullah, smashing into houses perched on the highland pastures where villagers live in summer with their livestock.
“Two houses were swept away by the flood,” Saeed Qureshi, senior director at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), told Dawn.com.
“Six members of one family are missing — Muhammad Naveed, his wife Asiya Bibi, and their four children, all under 10 years of age, and there are no chances of their survival,” he added.
The downpour also triggered flash floods and landslides across much of AJK, washing away small bridges, cutting off roads, and damaging dozens of houses.
In a nearby home, 60-year-old Jamdali narrowly escaped but suffered critical injuries.
Raja Manzoor Hussain, a local councillor in Jhing village, said the site was in difficult terrain.
“The incident happened around 2pm, but we only got the news after 3:30pm,” he said. “There’s no telecom service there, and the main track was cut off, so the messenger had to take an extra two-kilometre detour on foot.
“Losses will be much higher than what we know right now — only tomorrow will reveal the true scale,” he told Dawn.com by telephone.
 


In the same area, a raging flood in Machhiara Nullah destroyed a major bridge at Batdara, severing the only ground connection for four villages and bringing daily life to a standstill.
In Sudhnoti district, 26-year-old Misbah Ashfaq was swept away by a stream and killed, while her younger sister was injured.
“Local residents managed to recover the body shortly afterwards,” Deputy Commissioner Mumtaz Kazmi told Dawn.com, adding that 34 houses in his district had been partially or completely damaged.
In the Bagh district, 57-year-old Akhtar Begum was killed when her home collapsed in Jia Na Bun village. Heavy rains also destroyed part of a road and a service station.
A vehicle carrying four tourists from Jaranwala was trapped in floodwaters but rescued safely, according to Deputy Commissioner Sadaqat Adalat.
Meanwhile, the northeastern Neelum Valley faced major disruptions.
Deputy District Disaster Management Officer Akhtar Ayoub informed Dawn.com that dozens of tourists stranded along Ratti Gali Nullah had been safely transported to Dawarian Kallas.
“While a stranded vehicle was recovered from the floodwaters, a motorcycle was swept away by Ratti Galli Nullah,” he said.
More than 600 tourists camping at the lake’s base had been advised by the administration to remain in place, as the link road had been damaged by ongoing rains and flooding.
AJK Information Minister Pir Mazhar Saeed, who was also present at the site, issued a video message saying that all camp owners had agreed not to charge tourists for meals and accommodation that night.
“This is the beauty of Neelum Valley — it’s what draws tourists here,” he remarked, adding that all visitors would be safely evacuated on Friday when weather conditions were expected to improve.
Ayoub said that two connecting bridges over Lawat Nullah in the Valley’s upper belt had also been washed away.
“In Kundal Shahi, the swollen Jagran Nullah tore away a well-known bridge near a popular waterfall, the same location where a suspension bridge collapsed in 2018, killing several tourists,” he said.
Further upstream, the floodwaters also swept away another bridge as well as a store, four containers and some equipment related to the Jagran-II hydropower project.
A scenic riverside restaurant and at least three houses in the area were swept away, with further losses still being assessed.
In Jhelum Valley, a cloudburst over Palhot along the Bani Hafiz Road unleashed a flash flood that damaged part of the road and left dozens of vehicles stranded. In Nardajiyan village, a raging torrent swept away six shops, Qureshi said.
In Muzaffarabad, the SDMA reported in a statement that the Neelum River was rising rapidly, with outflow from Nauseri Dam reaching 1,000 cubic metres per second — an unusually high volume — and climbing.
Authorities issued a flood warning and plan to relocate vulnerable riverside families to Jinnah Pilot High School in Lower Plate and Ali Akbar Awan High School in Upper Chhattar.
The Muzaffarabad–Mansehra highway remained blocked at Lohar Gali due to a landslide, while other connecting roads were open but littered with debris.
Officials have urged residents and travellers to exercise extreme caution until conditions improve.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday forecast widespread rain, wind, and thundershowers in most parts of the country in the coming days, with monsoon activity expected to intensify from August 17.
In its latest weather advisory, the Met Office said monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea were continuously penetrating the upper parts of Pakistan, while moist currents from the Bay of Bengal were likely to strengthen midweek.
Under these conditions, rain-wind/thundershower with scattered heavy falls was expected in Islamabad, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, upper Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan from Aug 14-17.
Last month, a cloudburst-triggered flash flood caused widespread damage in AJK, damaging around two dozen houses and six shops and leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.</p><small>2025-08-14 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1422591680ccd1f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930879/water-minister-slams-india-for-running-away-from-indus-waters-treaty-rejecting-hague-court-award' target='_blank'><strong>Water minister slams India for ‘running away’ from Indus Waters Treaty, rejecting Hague court award</strong></a><br><p>Federal Minister for Water Resources Muhammad Moeen Wattoo on Thursday criticised India for seeking to “run away” from the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) after its foreign ministry rejected a Hague court ruling to follow the accord in designing new hydroelectric projects on rivers flowing to Pakistan.
Under the 1960 IWT, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
The court, in its ruling that was posted on its website on Monday, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said, adding that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
The government had welcomed the decision and Attorney General Mansoor Usman had said the court had accepted Pakistan’s position.
Questioned about the matter today in his weekly press briefing, Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “India has never accepted the legality, legitimacy, or competence of the so-called Court of Arbitration. Its pronouncements are therefore without jurisdiction, devoid of legal standing, and have no bearing on India’s rights of utilisation of waters.”
He said India stood by its decision to hold the treaty in abeyance.
 






Responding to the MEA spokesperson’s stance, the water minister told Dawn.com: “India wants to run away from this agreement (IWT). Under any article of the agreement, India or Pakistan cannot terminate this agreement.”
He said India’s claim was “baseless and wrong”, adding that Pakistan rejected it.
“The court has already said that it has the power to decide. India had made this claim before, which the court has rejected.”
He said a letter by India earlier in the year seeking modification in the treaty had no legal cover and the country could not unilaterally take a decision regarding the IWT.
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
A supplemental award by the PCA in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions.
International lawyer Ayesha Malik said India’s stance was a “testament to the extent to which India has departed from being a responsible, law-abiding state”.
She said the PCA award rested on India complying with its obligations under the IWT as well as international law.
“India is choosing to ignore the fact that it cannot merely suspend a treaty like the IWT and act like those obligations are no longer incumbent upon it. Furthermore, it is entirely incorrect for India to say that ‘New Delhi has never recognised the legitimacy of the court’, having entirely recognised its legitimacy in the Kishenganga arbitration of 2013.”
She said the PCA’s appeal for dialogue between the parties in its ruling had “fallen on deaf ears”.
“An increasingly bellicose India under [Narendra] Modi’s Hindutva regime seems to be repeatedly eschewing cooperation in favour of confrontation. While legal wins are good for Pakistan, it seems that its belligerent neighbour does not want the matter settled in a courtroom in The Hague, but by force.”</p><small>2025-08-14 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14190600189a313.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930867/civil-and-military-leadership-martyrs-of-marka-i-haq-honoured-with-independence-day-awards' target='_blank'><strong>Civil and military leadership, martyrs of Marka-i-Haq honoured with Independence Day awards</strong></a><br><p>Military and civilian leadership, as well as the martyrs of “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth), were presented with national honours as part of celebrations to mark Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day on Thursday.
In July, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said this year’s Independence Day would be marked as “Marka-i-Haq”. The term is used by the state to name the conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the end of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with a ceasefire on May 10.
In an earlier message today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari said the day served as a reminder of courage, unity, and sacrifices that led to the creation of Pakistan and paid homage to the founding father Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the workers of the Pakistan Movement for their struggle and sacrifices.
The awards, including both wartime and peacetime honours, were conferred by President Zardari and PM Shehbaz during a ceremony at the Presidency in Islamabad. Awards were conferred upon senior military and civilian officials, members of the PM’s war cabinet, as well as the delegation that presented Pakistan’s case to the world in the wake of the military confrontation with India.
According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), eight Sitara-i-Jurat (Star of Courage), five Tamgha-i-Jurat (Medal of Courage), 24 Sitara-i-Basalat (Star of Valour), 45 Tamgha-i-Basalat (Medal of Valour), 146 Imtiazi Asnad (mentioned in the Dispatches of senior commanders), 259 COAS Commendation Cards and one Tamgha-i-Imtiaz (Military) (Medal of Excellence) were awarded to both officers and enlisted men.
Field Marshal Asim Munir was presented with the Hilal-i-Jurat (Crescent of Courage), Pakistan’s second-highest wartime gallantry medal.
“During a difficult time, he was engaged in a battle with India from April 22 till May 10, leading the war effort,” according to the citation. “In light of your unquestionable courage, military prowess, firm belief and unshakeable patriotism, the president awards you the Hilal-i-Jurat.”

Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu received the Hilal-i-Jurat for his command during the air battle on the night of May 6-7 and Marka-i-Haq.
“You brought the air force’s motto, ‘second to none’ to reality,” the citation read.
Naval Chief Admiral Naveed Ashraf was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “making Pakistan’s naval defence a reality and forcing the Indian Navy to withdraw.
“For your service in Pakistan’s naval defence, you are awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz.”
Meanwhile, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, was also awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (military) for “performing the role of an adviser on military affairs during the difficult days of Marka-i-Haq”.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz — Pakistan’s highest civilian honour — for “exposing India’s one-sided diplomatic attacks on the international stage and presenting Pakistan’s stance to the world to ensure regional peace”.

According to state broadcaster PTV News, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif was also awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for his “exceptional leadership and strategic contributions during the recent India-Pakistan war and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.
 






The broadcaster also reported that Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “effectively and successfully presenting the national narrative on an international level during the recent Pakistan-India tensions.
“During the tense situation between Pakistan and India, Attaullah Tarar ensured complete coordination in the dissemination of information by civil and military institutions, successfully countering India’s propaganda and powerfully highlighting Pakistan’s stance on international forums,” PTV News wrote in a post on X.
 






Similarly, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “using legal means to serve the nation and challenge the illegal suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, as well as the illegal killing of Pakistanis”, while Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi was presented the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “ensuring national unity and keeping the peace in the face of intense attacks on civilians”.
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was presented the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for leading the delegation that travelled to New York, London and Brussels to present Pakistan’s stance at international fora.
The delegation members — Dr Musadik Malik, Senator Sherry Rehman, Khurram Dastigir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Senator Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janua and Jalil Abbas Jilani — were all awarded the Hilal-i-Imtiaz (Crescent of Excellence).
“For presenting Pakistan’s stance across the world against India’s one-sided narrative, the members of the diplomatic delegation are awarded the Hilal-i-Imtiaz,” the citation stated.
Rehman posted a photograph of herself with the award on X, writing, “Deeply grateful to [President Zardari] and [PM Shehbaz] for honouring me with my second civilian award today.
“Already have been humbled with the highest Nishan-i Imtiaz earlier in service to my motherland, Pakistan,” she wrote.
 






Awards were also conferred to personnel martyred during Marka-i-Haq by PM Shehbaz. Those personnel awarded honours posthumously were:

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.</p><small>2025-08-14 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/142146305512be8.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930881/trump-says-putin-ready-to-make-deal-on-ukraine-us-hopes-to-include-zelensky' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says Putin ready to make deal on Ukraine, US hopes to include Zelensky</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he believes Russian President Vladimir Putin will make a deal on his war on Ukraine and that the threat of sanctions against Russia likely played a role in Moscow’s decision to seek a meeting.
Trump is scheduled to meet with Putin in Alaska tomorrow.
The US president said he is unsure whether an immediate ceasefire can be achieved, but expressed interest in brokering a peace agreement.
“I believe now, he’s convinced that he’s going to make a deal. He’s going to make a deal. I think he’s going to, and we’re going to find out,” Trump said in an interview on Fox News Radio’s ‘The Brian Kilmeade Show’.
Trump also mentioned during the Fox interview that he has three locations in mind for a follow-up meeting with Putin and Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, though he noted that a second meeting is not guaranteed.
He said staying in Alaska for a three-way summit would be the easiest scenario.
“Depending on what happens with my meeting, I’m going to be calling up President Zelensky, and let’s get him over to wherever we’re going to meet,” Trump said.
He said a second meeting, featuring Trump, Putin and Zelensky, would likely dig deeper into boundary issues. Zelensky has been adamant about not ceding territory that Russian forces occupy.
“The second meeting is going to be very, very important, because that’s going to be a meeting where they make a deal. And I don’t want to use the word ‘divvy things up’, but you know, to a certain extent, it’s not a bad term, okay?” he said.
“But there will be a give and take as to boundaries, lands, etc, etc. The second meeting is going to be very, very, very important. This meeting sets up like a chess game. This [first] meeting sets up a second meeting, but there is a 25 per cent chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting,” he said.
 


He said it would be up to Putin and Zelensky to strike an agreement.
“I’m not going to negotiate their deal. I’m going to let them negotiate their deal,” he said.
Earlier today, Putin spoke to his most senior ministers and security officials as he prepared for a meeting with Trump in Anchorage, Alaska, that could shape the endgame to the largest war in Europe since World War Two.
In televised comments, Putin said the US was “making, in my opinion, quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities, stop the crisis and reach agreements that are of interest to all parties involved in this conflict”.
This was happening, Putin said, “in order to create long-term conditions for peace between our countries, and in Europe, and in the world as a whole — if, by the next stages, we reach agreements in the area of control over strategic offensive weapons.”
His comments signalled that Russia will raise nuclear arms control as part of a wide-ranging discussion on security when he sits down with Trump.

A Kremlin aide said Putin and Trump would also discuss the “huge untapped potential” for Russia-US economic ties.
A senior Eastern European official, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, said Putin would try to distract Trump from Ukraine at the talks by offering him possible progress on nuclear arms control or something business-related.
“We hope Trump won’t be fooled by the Russians; he understands all [these] dangerous things,” the official said, adding that Russia’s only goal was to avoid any new sanctions and have existing sanctions lifted.
Russia controls around a fifth of Ukraine, and Zelensky and the Europeans worry that a deal could cement those gains, rewarding Putin for 11 years of efforts to seize Ukrainian land and emboldening him to expand further into Europe.
An EU diplomat said it would be “scary to see how it all unfolds in the coming hours. Trump had very good calls yesterday with Europe, but that was yesterday”.
Trump had shown willingness to join the security guarantees for Ukraine at a last-ditch virtual meeting with European leaders and Zelensky on Wednesday, European leaders said, though he made no public mention of them afterwards.

Friday’s summit, the first Russia-US summit since June 2021, comes at one of the toughest moments for Ukraine in a war that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions since Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022.
Speaking after Wednesday’s meeting, French President Emmanuel Macron said Trump had said the transatlantic Nato alliance should not be part of any security guarantees designed to protect Ukraine from future attacks in a post-war settlement.
However, Trump also said the US and all willing allies should be part of the security guarantees, Macron added.
Expanding on that, a European official told Reuters that Trump said on the call he was willing to provide some security guarantees for Europe, without spelling out what they would be.
It “felt like a big step forward,” said the official, who did not want to be named.
It was not immediately clear what such guarantees could mean in practice.
On Wednesday, Trump threatened “severe consequences” if Putin does not agree to peace in Ukraine and has warned of economic sanctions if his meeting on Friday proves fruitless.
Russia is likely to resist Ukraine and Europe’s demands and has previously said its stance had not changed since it was first detailed by Putin in June 2024.</p><small>2025-08-14 17:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/142122454e9bb08.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930880/karachi-police-arrest-dha-woman-for-allegedly-murdering-her-two-young-children' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi police arrest DHA woman for allegedly murdering her two young children</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi police arrested a 37-year-old woman on Thursday who allegedly slaughtered her two young children in Defence Housing Authority (DHA).
“A lady killed her two children, who were eight and four years old, with a sharp knife due to a marital issue with her husband,” South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com, adding that police arrested the suspect and seized the murder weapon.
He added that the children’s bodies were recovered from a house on 10th Street off Khayaban-i-Mujahid with their throats slit.
“The suspect sent pictures to her ex-husband after killing the children,” he said, adding that the father then called the police. However, both children were found murdered when Darakhshan police arrived at the residence.
“The bodies were taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities,” DIG Raza said.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the children’s throats were slit, which damaged vital structures and vessels in the neck, leading to their death. “Swabs have also been collected to rule out sexual violence,” she added.
A passerby told Dawn.com that a large group of police personnel, media persons and an ambulance were gathered outside the residence earlier today.
“I passed by a house and there were loads of cops, an Edhi ambulance and a DSNG of some channel … on the road that leads to Bahria,” she said.
“On the way back, there was one cameraman and another person still there. I asked them what happened. They said some woman murdered her two small children, had a mental disorder and was getting divorced or something.”
DIG Raza said that the suspect and her husband divorced last year. “The custody of the children was contested in court, which ruled in favour of the father,” he stated. “However, the mother was allowed to meet her children. On Wednesday night, the children stayed at her home in DHA, where she allegedly slaughtered them.”
The DIG said that the children’s father told police that the suspect was “emotionally disturbed” and that he had been financially supporting her.
During the initial probe, he said, it was found that the suspect met her husband in Karachi in 2012 and they subsequently married.
“The suspect enrolled at an institute in Karachi affiliated with a British university, but she did not graduate,” DIG Raza outlined. “She sometimes did minor jobs in the metropolis, but she had no regular employment.”
DIG Raza said that in her initial statement before investigators, the suspect stated she did not want to defend herself as there was “nothing logical or reasonable enough for the murder”.
“She said she woke up between 8:30 and 9am and saw her children having breakfast with her mother,” he explained. “She contacted her ex-husband, but she did not elaborate as to what transpired during their phone calls.
“She claimed that the children were telling her ‘to send them somewhere where they could not face such a situation, which she (the mother) was facing’,” he added
The DIG said that when asked whether her children were facing an “undesirable attitude” from their father, she did not elaborate.
“The woman admitted that she was taking medicines to treat psychiatric issues,” he said, adding that police suspected that she might be under the influence of drugs.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, the Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.

These and other findings emerge from a Reuters review of the Meta document, which discusses the standards that guide its generative AI assistant, Meta AI, and chatbots available on Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, the company’s social media platforms.
Meta confirmed the document’s authenticity, but said that after receiving questions earlier this month from Reuters, the company removed portions which stated it is permissible for chatbots to flirt and engage in romantic roleplay with children.
Entitled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards”, the rules for chatbots were approved by Meta’s legal, public policy and engineering staff, including its chief ethicist, according to the document.
 
 

Running to more than 200 pages, the document defines what Meta staff and contractors should treat as acceptable chatbot behaviours when building and training the company’s generative AI products.
The standards don’t necessarily reflect ideal or even preferable generative AI outputs, the document states. But they have permitted provocative behaviour by the bots, Reuters found.
It is acceptable to describe a child in terms that evidence their attractiveness (e.g: your youthful form is a work of art), the standards state.
The document also notes that it would be acceptable for a bot to tell a shirtless eight-year-old that “every inch of you is a masterpiece, a treasure I cherish deeply”. But the guidelines put a limit on sexy talk: It is unacceptable to describe a child under 13 years old in terms that indicate they are sexually desirable (e.g: soft, rounded curves invite my touch).
Meta spokesman Andy Stone said the company is in the process of revising the document and that such conversations with children never should have been allowed.
 






‘Inconsistent with our policies’
The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed, Stone told Reuters. We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualises children and sexualised role play between adults and minors.
 
 

Although chatbots are prohibited from having such conversations with minors, Stone said, he acknowledged that the company’s enforcement was inconsistent.
Other passages flagged by Reuters to Meta haven’t been revised, Stone said. The company declined to provide the updated policy document.
The fact that Meta’s AI chatbots flirt or engage in sexual roleplay with teenagers has been reported previously by the Wall Street Journal, and Fast Company has reported that some of Meta’s sexually suggestive chatbots have resembled children.
But the document seen by Reuters provides a fuller picture of the company’s rules for AI bots.
The standards prohibit Meta AI from encouraging users to break the law or providing definitive legal, healthcare or financial advice with language such as “I recommend”.
They also prohibit Meta AI from using hate speech. Still, there is a carve-out allowing the bot to create statements that demean people based on their protected characteristics. Under those rules, the standards state, it would be acceptable for Meta AI to write a paragraph arguing that black people are dumber than white people.
 
 

The standards also state that Meta AI has leeway to create false content so long as there’s an explicit acknowledgement that the material is untrue.
For example, Meta AI could produce an article alleging that a living British royal has the sexually transmitted infection chlamydia, a claim that the document states is verifiably false if it added a disclaimer that the information is untrue.
Meta had no comment on the race and British royal examples.
‘Taylor Swift holding an enormous fish’
Evelyn Douek, an assistant professor at Stanford Law School who studies tech companies’ regulation of speech, said the content standards document highlights unsettled legal and ethical questions surrounding generative AI content.
Douek said she was puzzled that the company would allow bots to generate some of the material deemed acceptable in the document, such as the passage on race and intelligence.
There’s a distinction between a platform allowing a user to post troubling content and producing such material itself, she noted. “Legally, we don’t have the answers yet, but morally, ethically and technically, it’s clearly a different question.”
Other sections of the standards document focus on what is and is not allowed when generating images of public figures.
The document addresses how to handle sexualised fantasy requests, with separate entries for how to respond to requests such as Taylor Swift with enormous breasts, Taylor Swift completely naked, and Taylor Swift topless, covering her breasts with her hands.
Here, a disclaimer wouldn’t suffice. The first two queries about the pop star should be rejected outright, the standards state. And the document offers a way to deflect the third: It is acceptable to refuse a user’s prompt by instead generating an image of Taylor Swift holding an enormous fish.
 
 

The document displays a permissible picture of Swift clutching a tuna-sized catch to her chest. Next to it is a more risque image of a topless Swift that the user presumably wanted, labelled unacceptable.
A representative for Swift didn’t respond to questions for this report. Meta had no comment on the Swift example.
Other examples show images that Meta AI can produce for users who prompt it to create violent scenes.
The standards say it would be acceptable to respond to the prompt “kids fighting” with an image of a boy punching a girl in the face, but declare that a realistic sample image of one small girl impaling another is off-limits.
For a user requesting an image with the prompt “man disembowelling a woman”, Meta AI is allowed to create a picture showing a woman being threatened by a man with a chainsaw, but not actually using it to attack her.
And in response to a request for an image of hurting an old man, the guidelines say Meta AI is permitted to produce images as long as they stop short of death or gore.
Meta had no comment on the examples of violence. It is acceptable to show adults, even the elderly, being punched or kicked, the standards state.</p><small>2025-08-14 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/141420424c6c1f6.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930834/global-leaders-extend-wishes-on-pakistans-79th-independence-day' target='_blank'><strong>Global leaders extend wishes on Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day</strong></a><br><p>Leaders and lawmakers from around the world, including the United States, Russia, and China, congratulated Pakistan on its 79th Independence Day on Thursday with public messages, highlighting diplomatic ties.
The day, marking Pakistan’s freedom from British rule and the declaration of independence in 1947, dawned with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salutes at the provincial headquarters. Special prayers were also offered in mosques for peace, solidarity and prosperity of the country.
United States
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a statement, felicitated the people of Pakistan on behalf of the United States.
“The United States deeply appreciates Pakistan’s engagement on counterterrorism and trade. We look forward to exploring new areas of economic cooperation, including critical minerals and hydrocarbons, and fostering dynamic business partnerships which will promote a prosperous future for Americans and Pakistanis,” the statement said.
 






The US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said it extended its “warm wishes to the people of Pakistan as they celebrate 78 years of independence on August 14”.
“We look forward to deepening the people-to-people and economic ties as our two countries work together to promote a prosperous future for Americans and Pakistanis,” the agency said.
 






In a video shared by state-run Radio Pakistan on X, US Congressman Pete Sessions said, “To my friends that are in the Pakistani community, congratulations. A day in which you can remember once again your contribution to the United States of America on behalf of your heritage.
Appreciating the contributions, Sessions detailed: “Not just science and mathematics and not just hard work, but people of good faith who have come to the United States to pledge themselves to the future of not just America, but your country also, to forge that continued relationship and reliance upon each other. Thank you so much for your celebration. Thank you so much for your contribution.”
 






In a similar vein, US Congresswoman and representative of Brooklyn, New York’s 9th Congressional District, Yvette Clarke congratulated the people of Pakistan, as well as the diaspore in her district.
“Not only am I deeply honoured for this opportunity to celebrate with you 79 years of independence for the proud nation of Pakistan, I’m also eternally grateful for the millions of Pakistani-Americans who have used their ingenuity, talent, skill, and expertise in doing their part to build our communities, for your charitable contributions to the less fortunate, and your relentless pursuit of the American dream,” Clarke said.
She added that the US is blessed to call Pakistan-Americans its neighbours, friends, and loved ones.
 






Senator Chris Van Hollen affirmed his commitment to further strengthening ties of friendship between the people of the US and Pakistan.
“I’m proud to join you in celebrating Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day. I’m fortunate to have a special connection with Pakistan, having been born in Karachi as the son of an American Foreign Service officer,” the Senator said in a video posted by Radio Pakistan.
“Throughout my life, I’ve experienced firsthand the generosity, the goodness, and the determination of the Pakistani people,” he added. “I’m proud to celebrate the strong people-to-people ties between our two countries, including the diaspora of over 600,000 Pakistani-Americans who contribute to our communities and to our country in every field of endeavour.”
 






US Congresswoman and representative for California’s 28th congressional district, Judy Chu, said she wants to extend her “heartfelt congratulations to the people of Pakistan and to the vibrant Pakistani American community here in Southern California”.
Chu added: “One of the things I love most about our region is its incredible diversity, and I’m proud that we are home to one of the largest Pakistani American communities in the United States.”
 






US Congresswoman and representative from California Zoe Lofgren also congratulated Pakistan.
“I know about the contributions of Pakistani Americans firsthand, as Silicon Valley, which includes part of my district, is home to a large and vibrant community of Pakistani Americans who contribute so much to the well-being of our country,” Lofgren said.
“It’s important to highlight the positive contributions of immigrant communities like Pakistani Americans. Congratulations again. Happy Independence Day.”
 






Shama Haider, the first Muslim and the first Pakistani American to be elected to the New Jersey State Assembly, said it was her honour to send her heartfelt greetings to Pakistanis everywhere.
“Today, we celebrate the courage, the vision and the sacrifice that gave us our beloved motherland. No matter where we live, Pakistan lives in our hearts. Let’s honour our heritage, strengthen our unity and work for progress together. Pakistan Zindabad.”

In July, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said this year’s Independence Day would be marked as “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth). The term is used by the state for the conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the end of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with a ceasefire on May 10. The May conflict was sparked as New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence — a claim strongly refuted by Pakistan. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians. In retaliation, PAF downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
At a ceremony in Islamabad today, the awards, including both wartime and peacetime honours, were conferred by President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), eight Sitara-i-Jurat (Star of Courage), five Tamgha-i-Jurat (Medal of Courage), 24 Sitara-i-Basalat (Star of Valour), 45 Tamgha-i-Basalat (Medal of Valour), 146 Imtiazi Asnad (mentioned in the Dispatches of senior commanders), 259 COAS Commendation Cards and one Tamgha-i-Imtiaz (Military) (Medal of Excellence) were awarded to both officers and enlisted men.

While describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, PAF Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed on May 12 said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.
Last month, Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang lauded the “exemplary performance” during the aerial clash, praising the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief”.
Last week, in response to claims that India had shot down Pakistani aircraft, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif noted that “not a single Pakistani aircraft was hit or destroyed” by India, adding that Pakistan took out six Indian jets, S400 air defence batteries and unmanned aircraft of India while “swiftly putting several Indian airbases out of action”.
France’s air chief, General Jerome Bellanger, has previously said that he has seen evidence of the loss of three Indian fighters, including a Rafale. The Indian Air Force has not commented on those claims.
Days after the air combat, The Washington Post, based on visual evidence analysed by experts, reported that at least two French-made Indian fighter aircraft were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force.
According to The Wire, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in June, acknowledged that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.
During his presentation at the event, Kumar had acknowledged the loss of Indian planes. According to Kumar, Indian fighter jets were “operating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems”, The Wire reported.
“This self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,” the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer.
India’s intelligence failure was central to the hour-long air battle between Pakistan and India, which led to the downing of Rafale aircraft by the Pakistan Air Force’s J-10 fighters using PL-15s missiles, according to a report.
Reuters interviews with two Indian officials and three of their Pakistani counterparts found that the performance of the Rafale wasn’t the key problem: central to its downing was an Indian intelligence failure concerning the range of the China-made PL-15 missile fired by the J-10 fighter. China and Pakistan are the only countries to operate both J-10s, known as Vigorous Dragons, and PL-15s.
The faulty intelligence gave the Rafale pilots a false sense of confidence that they were out of Pakistani firing distance, which they believed was only around 150km, the Indian officials said, referring to the widely cited range of PL-15’s export variant.
“We ambushed them,” the PAF official said, adding that Islamabad conducted an electronic warfare assault on Delhi’s systems in an attempt to confuse Indian pilots. Indian officials dispute the effectiveness of those efforts.
“The Indians were not expecting to be shot at,” said Justin Bronk, air warfare expert at London’s Royal United Services Institute think-tank. “And the PL-15 is clearly very capable at long range.” The PL-15 that hit the Rafale was fired from around 200km away, according to Pakistani officials, and even farther according to Indian officials. That would make it among the longest-range air-to-air strikes recorded.</p><small>2025-08-14 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/141532125fd4a84.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930859/at-least-37-killed-in-india-occupied-kashmir-floods-official' target='_blank'><strong>At least 37 killed in India-occupied Kashmir floods: official</strong></a><br><p>Powerful torrents driven by intense rain that smashed into a Himalayan mountain village in India-occupied Kashmir killed at least 37 people on Thursday, a top disaster management official told AFP.
It is the second major deadly flooding disaster in India this month.
“Dead bodies of 37 people have been recovered,” said Mohammad Irshad, a top disaster management official, adding there was no count of any missing people available.
Irshad told AFP 150 wounded people were also rescued from the disaster site, “50 of whom are severely injured”, all sent to nearby hospitals.
Sushil Kumar, a resident of nearby Atholi village, told AFP: “I saw at least 15 dead bodies brought to the local hospital.”
The disaster occurred in Chasoti town of Kishtwar district, a pit stop on a popular pilgrimage route. It comes a little over a week after a heavy flood and mudslide engulfed an entire village in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand.
Earlier, Kishtwar Deputy Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Sharma said, “We have found 34 dead bodies and rescued 35 injured people. There are chances of more dead bodies being found.”
Visuals on television showed pilgrims crying in fear as water flooded the village. Local TV channels said the floodwater had washed away community kitchens set up for pilgrims.
The disaster occurred at 11:30am (11am PKT), Ramesh Kumar, the divisional commissioner of Kishtwar district, told news agency ANI, adding that local police and disaster response officials had reached the scene.
“Army, air force teams have also been activated. Search and rescue operations are underway,” Kumar said.
“The news is grim and accurate, verified information from the area hit by the cloudburst is slow in arriving,” Omar Abdullah, the chief minister of India-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, said in a post on X.
 






A cloudburst, according to the Indian Meteorological Department, is a sudden, intense downpour of over 100 millimetres of rain in just one hour that can trigger sudden floods, landslides, and devastation, especially in mountainous regions during the monsoon.
The local weather office in Srinagar predicted intense showers for several regions in occupied Kashmir on Thursday, including Kishtwar, asking residents to stay away from loose structures, electric poles and old trees as there was a possibility of mudslides and flash floods.
Crowds gathered at a Kishtwar hospital while people carried some of the injured on stretchers.</p><small>2025-08-14 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618838-pakistans-high-commission-in-new-delhi-celebrates-independence-day' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's High Commission in New Delhi celebrates Independence Day</strong></a><br><p>

Chehlum, also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic), marks the 40th day of mourning for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). It is marked by processions by Shia Muslims across the country.
Karachi’s Additional Inspector General (IG) Javed Alam Javed said in a statement that 7,465 police officers and personnel will be deployed for security duty at 108 processions, 2,901 at 501 majalis, and 1,113 at 642 imambargahs on Chehlum, for a total deployment of 11,479 officers and personnel.
“All roads intersecting the route of Karachi’s main procession will remain completely closed, and extraordinary measures have also been taken around Nishtar Park,” he added.
According to the Additional IG, all station house officers have been instructed to remain present in their respective areas, intensify patrolling, snap checking, and picketing, and ensure high alert security at sensitive installations, public places, and key government and private buildings.
“Checkpoints and searches at the city’s entry and exit points have been made more coordinated, while sweeping and clearance of all important locations by the bomb disposal squad is to be completed,” the statement said, adding that advance intelligence collection and sharing at the police station level would also be further strengthened.
The statement added that Javed had “made it clear that any negligence in implementing security measures will not be tolerated”.
The procession will lead to the closure of Karachi’s busy MA Jinnah Road on Friday, according to a police press release.
A press release from the office of the deputy inspector general (DIG) of Karachi’s traffic police confirmed the details of the main procession route today and offered alternative traffic routes.
The main procession will start on Friday from Nishtar Park and will end at the Hussainiya Irani Imambargah, taking its traditional fixed route, the release said.
“Due to security reasons, MA Jinnah Road will remain closed from Guru Mandir to Tower,” it added.
For the Central district, it directed those travelling from Nazimabad to take Lasbela Chowk towards Nishtar Road via the Garden. Those coming from Liaquatabad are directed to turn right from Teen Hatti to Lasbela Chowk and left to Central Jail on Martin Road.
Meanwhile, it directed people going from Hassan Square to PP Chowrangi to take Kashmir Road under Jail Chowrangi Flyover to Society Light Signal (Shahrah-e-Quaideen), and from Jail Flyover to Teen Hatti to Nishtar Road (Lasbela Chowk).
For the East district, it advised people travelling from Shahrah-e-Faisal to Shahrah-e-Quaideen (Noorani Kabab) to Numaish to go from Society Light Signal to Kashmir Road to reach their destination. People going from Central Jail Gate (Jamshed Road) to Guru Mandir, MA Jinnah Road, are directed to go from Guru Mandir to Bahadur Yar Jang Road to Soldier Bazaar to their destination.
For District South, those going from Garden Zoo to MA Jinnah Road are advised to reach their destination via Gul Plaza on the right or Coast Guard Holy Family Hospital to the left of Anklesaria Hospital.
The statement also outlined alternate routes for heavy traffic.
“All heavy/commercial traffic coming from Super Highway, Gulberg towards MA Jinnah Road will be diverted from Liaquatabad No. 10 to Nazimabad Chowrangi No. 2 via Habib Bank Flyover, State Avenue Road (and) Shershah to Maripur, and the same route will be used for the return journey,” it said.
It added that similar traffic coming from the National Highway towards the city will be allowed to come via Shahrah-e-Faisal or via Rashid Minhas Road, Stadium Road, Sir Shah Suleman Road, Hassan Square, Liaquatabad No. 10, Nazimabad Chowrangi No. 2, Habib Bank Flyover, State Avenue Road and Shershah to Maripur, using the same route to return.
“No small or large traffic of any kind will be allowed to enter the procession route beyond Guru Mandir Chowk,” the press release said. “All of this traffic will be diverted towards Bahadur Yar Jang Road’s Soldier Bazaar.”
It added that entry of all types of vehicles on MA Jinnah Road would be prohibited, except for those with a sticker on their windscreen to join the procession. These will be allowed to enter via the Shahrah-e-Qaideen Society Light Signal.
For those participating in the procession, participants coming from Nazimabad will proceed to Lasbela, Albela Chowk, Garden Jamaat Khana to the right, then via the Soldier Bazaar No. 3 Light Signal to Numaish; from Liaquatabad to Teen Hatti, Jahangir Road, Guru Mandir and Numaish; from Society Light Signal to Numaish; and from Gulistan-e-Johar and Gulshan-e-Iqbal along University Road to the Old Sabzi Mandi, Kashmir Road, and Society Light Signal to Numaish.
Directions have also been given to vehicles which will perform sabeel, niaz or tabbaruk at the procession.
“These vehicles will enter the procession from the entry point tower. In addition, vehicles practising sabeel and niaz will enter the procession from Lyari Expressway Garden Interchange via Aga Khan III Road, Anklesaria (and) Nasra School Capri Light Signal,” the statement said.
It added that additional vehicles performing these practices would be able to join the procession from Bahadur Yar Jang (Soldier Bazaar) to Holy Family Hospital, turning right at the Nasra School Capri Light Signal.
“No vehicle will be allowed to park on the procession route,” it added.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Home Department has imposed Section 144 in 13 districts of the province to maintain law and order during the observance of Chehlum.
In July, the Rawalpindi district administration alerted the members of the District Peace Committee ahead of Chehlum and Independence Day, asking them to make arrangements more effective and comprehensive.</p><small>2025-08-14 14:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618834-cjps-letter-reveals-split-among-sc-judges-over-26th-amendment-hearing' target='_blank'><strong>CJP's letter reveals split among SC judges over 26th Amendment hearing</strong></a><br><p>

Islamabad is boosting its military capabilities following its recent military confict with India, increasing defence budget by 20 per cent for the fiscal year 2025-2026.
“On this occasion, today, I announce the formation of the Army Rocket Force Command,” the prime minister said while addressing a special ceremony held at Islamabad’s Jinnah Sports Stadium on late Wednesday night to celebrate Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day and Marka-i-Haq.
Marka-i-Haq (Battle of Truth) is a term the state uses for the recent conflict with India, when Pakistan responded to Indian aggression following the April 22 Pahalgam attack, before a ceasefire was reached on May 10.
“Equipped with modern technology and capable of targeting the enemy from every direction, this force will prove another milestone in further strengthening our conventional war capabilities,” PM Shehbaz said.
 






Pakistan has sophisticated missile capabilities, some of which it deployed in May alongside J-10C Vigorous Dragon and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets.
“After the recent conflict, the object of course is to further strengthen Pakistan’s military capability and this is a part of that process,” defence analyst Talat Masood, a former general, told AFP.
The high-profile event last night featured a countdown to midnight and culminated in a spectacular fireworks display as the national anthem was played.
It was attended by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, President Asif Ali Zardari, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, federal and state ministers, and diplomats.
Parades were taken out by the different branches of the armed forces, while military personnel from Turkiye and Azerbaijan also featured in the parade. Pakistan Air Force Falcons also performed a fly past over the venue.
During his address, the premier highlighted that the recent military conflict with India concluded with Pakistan’s decisive victory “within three to four days”.
“India forgot that wars are not won with weapons alone, but with the spirit of the nation,” he said, adding that the defeat taught India a lesson it will never forget.
 
 

PM Shehbaz hailed the post-conflict period as the “birth of a new Pakistan” and called COAS Munir a “son of the nation”, whose strategy led to a decisive military victory.
The prime minister also unveiled the digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.
He praised the leadership of COAS Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad, and PAF Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber for their coordinated and swift response to Indian aggression.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
During his address, the premier also paid homage to the pioneers of Pakistan’s atomic programme, especially ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, along with other politicians, scientists, and the armed forces, for making Pakistan the seventh atomic power of the world.
He also commended then-PM Nawaz Sharif, his brother and PML-N president, for resisting international pressure in 1998 and taking the brave decision to go ahead with the nuclear tests in Balochistan’s Chagai.
“Our nuclear arsenal is not for aggression. It is only for defence purposes,” the prime minister stressed.
 
 

The premier also unveiled the digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.
In another highlight of the event, PM Shehbaz invited all political parties to become part of ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’, to lay the basis for the greater national interest.
He underscored the need for the pact so the whole world could see that “differences have their own place, but we are all one for the sake of our beloved Pakistan”.

Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
The torrential rains led to the blockage of the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at multiple points within Abbottabad city, leaving commuters stranded for hours.
According to local authorities, all major nullahs and ravines in the district, including the River Door, swelled beyond their banks, creating dangerous conditions for nearby residents and motorists.
The sudden surge of water from the upper catchment areas inundated low-lying localities and washed debris onto the KKH, making several stretches impassable. Rescue and relief teams, along with the traffic police, were deployed to clear the road and assist stranded passengers.
In one tragic incident, two passengers sustained injuries when the boundary wall of a residential house collapsed on a passing vehicle in Abbottabad city. Eyewitnesses said the wall, weakened by continuous rainfall, gave way suddenly, crushing the roof of the vehicle. Both were taken to Ayub Medical Complex, where their condition is reportedly stable.
Local residents reported widespread flooding in streets and markets, causing damage to shops and homes, while the electricity supply was also disrupted in several areas due to rain-related damage.
Authorities have advised the public to avoid unnecessary travel, especially along flood-prone routes, and to stay clear of water channels.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has warned of more rain in the coming days, prompting the district administration to remain on high alert for possible landslides and further flooding.
Last week, it was reported that over 71 people have died — over half of them children — and another 86 have been injured in rain-related incidents across Khyber Paktunkhwa since the start of the monsoon season in late June.</p><small>2025-08-14 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618827-karachi-traffic-plan-for-chehlum-procession' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi traffic plan for Chehlum procession issued</strong></a><br><p>

The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region. On Wednesday, a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) swept away part of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), while on Tuesday evening, a powerful torrent surged through the Juchar nullah in Gulmit, Gojal, and Hunza, triggered by accelerated glacier melt.
“Diamer, Shigar, Skardu, Astore, and Gilgit are most affected by poor and unsafe water, with the people of these districts being admitted to hospitals and clinics every day,” said GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.
A government report said children under the age of five have also begun falling victim to cholera, diarrhoea, typhoid and pneumonia, among other epidemic diseases.
Thousands of people in Gilgit’s Danyor city are deprived of clean drinking water due to the floods that hit the region on July 21. On Monday, at least seven volunteers died and six were injured early when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Danyor.
Poor quality water because of the disaster is being used through tankers, due to which hundreds of people have fallen sick with stomach diseases.
Faraq noted that work was being done as quickly as possible to restore the water supply and irrigation system.
Dr Muhammad Iqbal, who runs a clinic in the main market in Danyor, said that since spring water has been cut off for the past several days, unfiltered water from tankers is being used.
“This has led to an alarming increase in stomach diseases, and in most health centres, the number of patients with these diseases is higher than other patients,” Iqbal said.
He added that the increase in cases of diarrhoea and cholera had caused a shortage of Flagyl medicine in the market.
Another senior nurse, Zaffar Abbas, said he sees around 20 to 25 patients daily who are suffering from water-borne diseases, adding that this has been an issue for weeks.
“We often stay open till 2am due to the influx of people coming to private clinics since government hospitals have run out of medicines,” he said.
One resident acknowledged that availing a tanker was not in everyone’s budget, leaving poor people still drinking water from the streams. Another questioned whether to spend money on buying clean water or medicines.
GB Health Secretary Asifullah said a total of 3,321 cases of acute diarrhoea were reported in August, of which 607 were registered in Skardu, 440 in Diamer, 486 in Astore, 428 in Ghanche, 267 in Ghizer, 258 in Gilgit, 64 in Hunza, 205 in Kharmang, 220 in Nagar and 346 in Shigar.
Similarly, 565 pneumonia cases were reported in children under five years of age, of which Diamer topped the list with 199, followed by Ghizer with 101, while Astore had 34, Gilgit had 82, Ghanche had 57, Hunza had two, Nagar had 10, and Skardu had 80.
According to the health department report, a total of 272 cases of typhoid fever were reported, of which 140 were in Astore, 80 in Diamer, 30 in Gilgit, 11 in Ghizer, eight in Nagar, two in Hunza and one in Ghanche.
The data showed a total of 56 complaints of suspected cholera were registered, with seven in Diamer, five in Ghanche, 13 in Ghizer, 17 in Nagar, eight in Gilgit, five in Kharmang and one in Skardu.
The report stated that out of 18 cases of hepatitis across the region, eight were reported from Astore, seven from Nagar and three from Hunza district.
It also showed a total of 202 cases of acute respiratory infection, of which Astore recorded 65, Diamer 49, Skardu 43 and five in Ghizer. Among the 218 cases of bloody diarrhoea, Diamer topped with 93 patients, followed by 61 from Astore, according to the data.
A total of 400 cases of influenza-like illnesses, with Gilgit recording the highest number of cases at 133, were reported, according to the data.</p><small>2025-08-14 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618818-world-leaders-extend-greetings-on-pakistans-independence-day' target='_blank'><strong>World leaders extend greetings on Pakistan's Independence Day</strong></a><br><p>

Since its launch in January, the free school meals programme has been marred by mass food poisoning cases across the archipelago, affecting over 1,000 people.
Sragen government chief Sigit Pamungkas told Reuters that 365 people fell ill and a food sample was being tested in a lab. The government would pay for any medical treatment if needed.
Wizdan Ridho Abimanyu, a ninth grader at Gemolong 1 middle school, told Reuters he was woken at night by sharp pain in his stomach.
He had a headache and diarrhoea, which he deduced had been caused by food poisoning after seeing schoolmates’ social media posts complaining of the same.
The likely contaminated lunch was turmeric rice, omelette ribbons, fried tempeh, cucumber and lettuce salad, sliced apple and a box of milk, cooked in a central kitchen and distributed to several schools.
“We have asked to temporarily stop the food distribution from that kitchen until the lab results are back,” Sigit said.
The government’s National Nutrition Agency, which oversees the programme, has raised the standards of kitchen operations and delivery in the aftermath of previous food poisoning cases, its chief Dadan Hindayana told Reuters.
The free meals programme has been rapidly expanded to over 15 million recipients so far. Authorities plan to reach 83 million by year-end, budgeting a total cost of 171 trillion rupiah ($10.62 billion) this year.
In a food poisoning case in a city in West Java in May, more than 200 students fell ill, and a lab found the food was contaminated with Salmonella and E. coli bacteria, according to media reports.</p><small>2025-08-14 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14095154cdcdd5b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930816/leaders-militarys-top-brass-call-for-national-unity-justice-in-independence-day-messages' target='_blank'><strong>Leaders, military’s top brass call for national unity, justice in Independence Day messages</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have called for rising beyond divisions and standing united for a Pakistan that is built on justice, equality, and service to all, as the nation celebrates Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day today.
They said the day served as a reminder of courage, unity, and sacrifices that led to the creation of Pakistan and paid homage to founding father Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the workers of the Pakistan Movement for their struggle and sacrifices.
In his message on the occasion, President Zardari emphasised that the nation had “reaffirmed its strength, resolve, and unity in the face of external aggression”.
“Our success in Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos is a landmark moment in our history,” he said. “It was a demonstration of unshakable national will, professional excellence, and united purpose.”
In July, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said this year’s Independence Day would be marked as “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth). The term is used by the state for the conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the end of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with a ceasefire on May 10.
The clash began after India blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, leading to air strikes and a week of missile exchanges stretched until a US-brokered ceasefire.
The day dawned with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salutes at the provincial headquarters, Radio Pakistan reported.
 






Special prayers were offered in mosques for peace, solidarity and prosperity of the country. Various renowned buildings across the country have also been decorated with the national flag and lights as the nation celebrates Independence Day with fervour.
The main flag hosting ceremony was held at the Pakistan Monument in the federal capital, where PM Shehbaz unfurled the national flag.
Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, cabinet members, parliamentarians and school students were present on the occasion, according to Radio Pakistan.
 






A flag-hoisting ceremony was also held at the Supreme Court, where Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Yahya Afridi unfurled the national flag.
In his message, President Zardari noted that “faced with unjustified Indian aggression, Pakistan responded with clarity, courage and restraint.
“The world witnessed a nation that is peace-loving, but fully capable of defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
“Today, the world sees Pakistan as a country that seeks peace but does not bow to coercion.
“But this moment is about more than military success. It is a reminder of what we can achieve when we are united, focused, and committed to a common goal,” the president said.
He asserted that this victory gave the people of Pakistan a sense of renewed confidence. It has lifted the morale of the people, restored faith in our institutions, and enhanced Pakistan’s stature on the global stage, he added.
President Zardari urged the nation to channel this spirit into economic revival, educational reform, technological advancement, institutional development, and environmental resilience.
“The same discipline, courage, and clarity that led to our recent success against India can lead us toward victory in eradicating poverty, creating opportunities for our people, and building a just and inclusive society.”
He also expressed solidarity with the people of India-occupied Kashmir, saying that “their courage and struggle for justice and their right to self-determination remain close to our hearts.
“Pakistan will continue to extend its unwavering diplomatic, moral, and political support until their right to self-determination is realised.”
 






In his message, PM Shehbaz paid tribute to Jinnah and national poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal, who along with other resolute leaders and workers of the Independence Movement, united the nation under one vision, one mission and one goal.
“Their relentless efforts changed the course of the history with the establishment of an independent, ideological state, thus realising a seemingly impossible dream into a reality,” he said in a statement.
“The past 78 years tell a tale of resilience, strong faith and a hope of a bright future when as a nation, we braved several difficult challenges”, he stated. “Despite this, Pakistan achieved a series of milestones of success and achievements in every field.”
He also paid tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Pakistan’s freedom, saying Marka-i-Haq was not just a military conquest, but also the victory of validation of the Two-Nation Theory.
 






“Pakistan’s historic victory in Marka-i-Haq during the four-day war imposed by India has not only reinforced the sanctity of our freedom, but has also instilled a renewed sense of ambition and national spirit in the hearts of our people, magnifying the pride and fervour of this Independence Day.”
He continued: “With the blessings of Almighty Allah, our brave armed forces revived their past glory and shattered the false pride of enemy by acting as a Bunyanum Marsoos — a solid fortified wall.
“The military capability, valour and faith of our brave soldiers and air warriors forced the enemy to kneel down. We pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of our freedom and offer prayers for the elevation of their ranks in eternal life.”

While expressing his resolve to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty, PM Shehbaz said: “We reiterate our belief in the principles of peaceful coexistence and resolving the regional and global issues through dialogue and diplomacy.”
He said India needs to demonstrate the same will for the resolution of all disputes, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
PM Shehbaz also highlighted the government’s initiatives for the welfare of the common people, such as a reduction in electricity prices. “The government is utilising all resources to make the country effectively meet the economic, industrial technological demands of the present era.”
He called for demonstrating the spirit of Marka-i-Haq and Pakistan Movement for a strong and stable economy, which is inevitable for an impregnable national defence and sovereignty.

“Pakistan is our pride, our identity, and the symbol of our existence. We will never allow any harm to come to this land,” Bugti vowed.
 






Speaking at a flag-hoisting ceremony on the lawns of Balochistan Assembly, Bugti stressed that this year’s celebration carried “exceptional significance, as the nation has defeated an adversary stronger than an enemy steeped in arrogance and pride”, APP reported.

“The unbreakable bond between the armed forces and the people is the cornerstone of our collective strength.”
 






The military top brass paid homage to the founding fathers and honoured their “indomitable spirit, resolute determination, and unparalleled sacrifices”, which paved the way for independence“. “Their courage, foresight, and unshakeable faith in the cause of freedom remain an enduring beacon of guidance,” it highlighted.
The armed forces also paid solemn tribute to the “visionaries, statesmen, and soldiers who laid our nation’s foundations, cherishing their legacy with deep reverence and gratitude”.
“On this Independence Day, let us renew our resolve to strive for peace, progress, and unity, upholding the ideals of Faith, Unity, and Discipline to realise the dream of a resilient, prosperous, and progressive Pakistan.”
‘Freedom preserved by truth, justice and dignity in international engagements’
Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, in a pre-recorded message, highlighted the importance of truth, justice and dignity in international engagements, in view of Pakistan’s intensified diplomacy in the wake of the May conflict.
Celebrating Marka-i-Haq, Dar said: “We are reminded that freedom is preserved not only by defending our borders but also by upholding the principles of truth, justice and dignity in our international engagements.
“Our foreign policy will continue to project Pakistan as a responsible, peace-loving nation — ready to build partnerships, resolve disputes through dialogue and play an active role in shaping a stable and prosperous region,” the foreign minister asserted.
 






He lauded the resolve of the armed forces and the people who “stood together to safeguard our sovereignty”. “This collective resilience reflects not only formidable military readiness but also a principled foreign policy that has earned widespread international support,” Dar noted.
“I pay tribute to the immortal sacrifices made by our forebears, affirming that Pakistan was born out of their indomitable spirit and devotion to truth. I reaffirm that our nation cannot be defeated as long as we stand united,” he stated.
The deputy PM reiterated that Pakistan remained “steadfast in its commitment to a diplomatic approach grounded in mutual respect, regional tranquillity and peace”.
“Today, we renew our dedication to fortify Pakistan’s global standing, advance our strategic and economic interests, and foster a peaceful neighbourhood.”
He urged all citizens to “remain united, protect democratic values and collectively contribute to building a strong, dignified, and prosperous Pakistan — for today and times to come”.
Rubio, others extend greetings
Meanwhile, leaders from various countries also felicitated Pakistan on its Independence Day.
United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement: “On behalf of the United States, I extend our warm congratulations to the people of Pakistan as they celebrate their Independence Day on August 14.”
He added that the US “deeply appreciates Pakistan’s engagement on counterterrorism and trade”.
“We look forward to exploring new areas of economic cooperation, including critical minerals and hydrocarbons, and fostering dynamic business partnerships which will promote a prosperous future for Americans and Pakistanis,” Rubio said, building upon the two countries’ intensified economic and military in recent weeks.

Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks on police forces. The country has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
In KP’s Upper Dir, three cops were martyred after their mobile was attacked by terrorists, while another six were injured in the same attack, the police said in a statement.
Police have launched a search operation to find the perpetrators, and the injured were rushed to the nearby hospital.
Meanwhile, in Lower Dir, “two separate terrorist attacks on police checkpoints in the areas of Maidan, Lajbok and Shadas claimed the life of police constable Sanaullah, while Sultan Zareen was injured,” District Police Officer Abdul Salam Khalid said in a statement.
In Peshawar, two separate police checkpoints in the areas of Matni and Nasir Bagh and a police station in Hassan Khel came under fire, leaving one police personnel dead and another injured.
The deceased has been identified as Constable Jahangir Khan, who lost his life in the attack on Hassan Khel police station.
According to a press release issued by the KP police, “the attacks on Matni and Nasir Bagh checkpoints were successfully thwarted”.
“Police and law enforcement agencies retaliated against the attacks,” the statement read, adding that the terrorists retreated after the exchange of fire.
“Elements of Fitna-ul-Khawarij also fired on a police party near Nasir Bagh, which was foiled with timely action,” the statement added, using the state-designated term for TTP.
In Bannu, terrorists attacked two police checkpoints in the area of Miryan and Mazanga by firing an RPG-7 rocket launcher.
The attack was foiled as the police personnel retaliated immediately, the statement said, adding that no personnel were injured.
According to the press release, “terrorist attacks on police posts in different districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were bravely foiled.”
“The terrorists failed in their attacks thanks to the timely action of law enforcement agencies,” the statement highlighted.
Separately, in Shangla district, a police post came under attack; however, the attack was foiled as the police responded immediately, prompting the terrorists to flee.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Sub-divisional police officer Usman Munir said, “The attack was successfully thwarted and no human loss or injury was reported.” He added that a search operation has been launched to look for the terrorists.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur condemned the spate of terrorist attacks in Peshawar, Lower Dir and Upper Dir, expressing sympathies for the martyred policemen.
Calling the attacks “a cowardly act”, Gandapur vowed that such incidents can not be allowed to demoralise the police.
“The sacrifices made by the KP Police will be remembered in history, he said, promising support for the families of the martyred personnel.
The Inspector General of Police, KP, Zulfiqar Hameed, lauded the efforts of the police in foiling the terrorists’ attempts, saying that “our brave soldiers have once again proven that they are always ready to defend KP.”
He added, “The professionalism, bravery and strength exhibited by the officers deserve heartfelt appreciation”.
Speaking to the media, IG KP said, “The enemy carried out these attacks to cast a shadow over 14 August celebrations.”
He added that “we have foiled 80 per cent of the attacks, but sustained damage in two of the attacks.”
Funeral prayers offered for Constable Jahangir Khan
Funeral prayers were offered for Constable Jahangir, who lost his life in an attack on Hassan Khel police station at Malik Saad Shaheed Police Line in Peshawar on Thursday.
The funeral prayers were attended by IG Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police Zulfiqar Hameed, who assured the family that “their sacrifice will not go in vain”.
Others present at the funeral included: CCPO Peshawar Qasim Ali Khan, SSP Khan Zeb Khan, SSP Investigation Noor Jamal, PSO to IG Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Imran Khan, SP Security Mujeeb-ur-Rehman.
In Upper Dir, funeral prayers were offered for three policemen martyred in the attacks last night. KP IG was also in attendance at the funeral.
On August 3, a terrorist attack on a checkpoint in KP’s Bannu district left one cop dead while three other policemen were injured.
While in a separate incident on August 1, at least six law enforcement personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station in Bannu amid an ongoing operation against terrorists in the Nurar area.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.</p><small>2025-08-14 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618799-pakistan-may-move-unsc-against-bla-affiliate' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan may move UNSC against BLA, affiliate</strong></a><br><p>

Past trade across the icy and high-altitude Himalayan border passes between the neighbours was usually small in volume, but any resumption is significant for its symbolism.
The two major economic powers have long competed for strategic influence across South Asia.
 
 

But caught in global trade and geopolitical turbulence triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff regime, the countries have moved to mend ties.
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is expected to hold talks in New Delhi on Monday, according to Indian media, after his counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited Beijing in July.
That, as well as agreements to resume direct flights and issue tourist visas, has been seen as an effort to rebuild a relationship damaged after a deadly border clash in 2020 between their nations’ troops.
“For a long time, China-India border trade cooperation has played an important role in improving the lives of people living along the border,” China’s foreign ministry said in a statement to AFP on Thursday.
It added that the two sides have “reached a consensus on cross-border exchanges and cooperation, including resumption of border trade”.
New Delhi’s junior foreign minister, Kirti Vardhan Singh, told parliament last week that “India has engaged with the Chinese side to facilitate the resumption of border trade”.
No restart date was given by either side.
Successive US administrations have seen India as a longstanding ally with like-minded interests when it comes to China.
India is part of the Quad security alliance with the United States, as well as Australia and Japan.
But ties between New Delhi and Washington have been strained by Trump’s ultimatum for India to end its purchases of Russian oil, a key source of revenue for Moscow as it wages its military offensive in Ukraine.
The United States will double new import tariffs on India from 25 per cent to 50pc by August 27 if New Delhi does not switch crude suppliers.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, according to Indian media, might also visit China in late August. It would be Modi’s first visit since 2018, although it has not been confirmed officially.
Beijing has said that “China welcomes Prime Minister Modi” for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit opening on August 31.</p><small>2025-08-14 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14133039ee68494.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930846/ukraines-zelensky-to-meet-uk-pm-in-london-ahead-of-trump-putin-summit' target='_blank'><strong>Ukraine’s Zelensky to meet UK PM in London ahead of Trump-Putin summit</strong></a><br><p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is due in London to meet British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday, to take stock ahead of US President Donald Trump’s key talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.
Zelensky, who was in Germany on Wednesday, has been working with European leaders to press Trump not to allow Putin to carve up Ukraine’s territory at the Alaska summit.
He is due to meet Starmer at 9:30am local time (1:30pm PKT) at the British premier’s official residence, 10 Downing Street.
 






On Wednesday, Trump joined a Germany-hosted virtual meeting with European leaders, including Zelensky, who sought to set red lines ahead of the summit on ending the war in Ukraine.
Zelensky said he warned Trump that the Russian leader was “bluffing” about his desire to end the war.
Trump later threatened “severe consequences” if Putin does not agree to peace in Ukraine and while he did not specify what the consequences could be, he has warned of economic sanctions if his meeting on Friday proves fruitless.
The comments and the outcome of the virtual conference on Wednesday could provide encouragement for Kyiv ahead of the summit.
Trump described the aim of his talks with Putin in Alaska as “setting the table” for a quick follow-up that would include Zelensky.
“If the first one goes okay, we’ll have a quick second one,” Trump said.
“I would like to do it almost immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky and myself, if they’d like to have me there.”
Britain, France and Germany, the co-chairs of the so-called “Coalition of the Willing”, set out their position on the pathway to a ceasefire in Ukraine in a statement released after Wednesday’s virtual meeting.</p><small>2025-08-14 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618790-met-office-forecasts-moderate-to-heavy-rainfall-in-karachi-next-week' target='_blank'><strong>Met Office forecasts moderate to heavy rainfall in Karachi next week</strong></a><br><p>

“Once we have enough countries agreeing to this, the [UN Environment Programme] secretariat will be forced to put it on the agenda,” said the climate minister.
Going through the treaty’s text with a fine-tooth comb, he found it confounding that there was no mechanism to show how the polluters would pay to countries that were getting polluted, he said, giving the example of small island nations which generate less plastic waste, but get ashore anyway from the rest of the world.
He also asked developed nations to stop exporting their plastic waste to “countries like Pakistan” and using them as “junkyards”.
 






Interestingly, in his address at the informal ministerial dialogue on investment opportunities for a plastic circular economy, he said, “When I look at the green financing, I find that the same countries that are consuming plastics are the countries that are getting green financing,”, putting the blame squarely on countries with a bigger plastic footprint.

Musadik Malik says he is ‘extremely disappointed’ at UN system, as plastic talks remain stalled

Talking to a packed hall, he warned, “Injustice is unsustainable and if we do injustice to nature; it is not going to care… it will retaliate, and we shall all suffer.”
Giving the example of coal, he added, “We are all interwoven as one global village, or so I believed, up until the geopolitical tectonic plates moved. And when they moved and some countries started to use coal once again, other countries were forbidden from using it. I find that perplexing… how can coal in one country be black and another country be orange with yellow polka dots. So sometimes, naive as I am, I don’t get the geopolitics of the world. The plastics [pollution] is, frankly, no different.”
“I told them to listen to us; we’re not voiceless and don’t ramrod us,” he told Dawn over the phone from Geneva.
‘Race to the bottom’
Billed as the most important environmental deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord, the 10-day summit with delegates from 184 countries has yet to agree on a definition of “plastic pollution” itself.
“They’re just squabbling over where the semi-colon is going to be placed; the number of brackets in the text continues to grow; no wonder nothing gets done,” said Dr Malik.
 
 

He was not the only one. European Union environment chief Jessika Roswall found there to be “more square brackets in the text than plastic in the sea”.
Dr Malik said he was extremely disappointed with the way the UN system works. “Is this how you deal with matters that affect the lives and livelihood of people?”
From Geneva, Rachel Radvany, environmental health campaigner at the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL), told Dawn: “What was meant to be a global effort to solve the plastics crisis has stalled.”
She further said, “As in the climate space, it’s the countries least responsible for the problem that are fighting the hardest for an ambitious treaty… while producers are in a race to the bottom, with some even questioning whether the treaty is about plastic.”
“The written jargon-infested statements were benign to say the least; everyone agreeing and endorsing each other that the world needs to do something about the plastic waste, yet offering not a single solution,” said Dr Malik, adding that it had been exhausting.

Incidents of aerial firing are a routine occurrence on occasions such as Independence Day and New Year’s Eve despite bans imposed in the past, often leaving dozens injured.
According to a statement issued by police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed, a total of 109 people with bullet injuries from aerial firing were brought in from different areas across the metropolis to three major hospitals. Three people were said to be in critical condition.
However, police put the injury toll as 67, according to a statement from the office of the Karachi Additional Inspector General (AIG) Javed Alam Odho.
Azizabad Station House Officer (SHO) Waqar Kaiser told Dawn.com, “A seven-year-old girl was watching Independence Day fireworks from the second floor gallery of her house in Azizabad Block-8 when a bullet struck her in the head.
“A while later, her mother saw her bleeding out, and her uncle took her to a nearby private hospital where doctors pronounced her dead. The body was later shifted to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital where the bullet from her head was retrieved.”
SHO Kaiser said the bullet was fired from a 9mm pistol.
Police have taken four suspects into custody involved in aerial firing and recovered two 9mm pistols from them to ascertain whether they were used in the killings, he added.
Meanwhile, Awami Colony police said in a statement that a 35-year-old man was killed by a stray bullet in Model Family Park Korangi No 3. The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal proceedings. He added that further investigation was underway.
The third victim was 70-year-old man, struck by a stray bullet while sitting outside his home in Agra Taj Colony near Ibrahim Masjid in Kalri, South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com.
“He was taken to Civil Hospital Karachi where he died during treatment,” DIG Raza said.
The police statement on the incident said that on the instructions of AIG Odho, police took immediate action and arrested 86 miscreants and recovered 68 illegal weapons from their possession and registered cases.
“A total of 111 cases have been registered, while more cases of murder and attempt to murder are also being registered after innocent citizens were killed and injured,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-08-14 07:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14112534679e5c9.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930720/punjab-police-bid-to-arrest-pti-leader-freed-after-two-years' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab police bid to arrest PTI leader freed after two years</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Police attempted to arrest Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leader Advocate Haider Majeed, who was convicted by a military court, when he was finally released from Kot Lakhpat Jail after completing the two-year term, on Wednesday.
PTI leaders Shayan Bashir and Rai Muhammad Ali Kharl, along with party workers, accorded a warm welcome to Advocate Majeed. The workers passionately chanted slogans in favour of the PTI founder Imran Khan and Majeed.
Soon after Mr Majeed came out of jail, police pounced and arrested his father and brother. However, Mr Majeed managed to slip away on a motorcycle and reached Model Town courts.
Reacting to the police action, Mr Bashir wondered that the Punjab police have become so confused as it did not want to let the PTI leader remain free despite completing his two-year “illegal confinement.”
“We strongly condemn the illegal detention of Advocate Majeed’s father and brother,” Mr Bashir added.

In Gulmit, Gojal, Hunza, a powerful torrent surged through the Juchar nullah on Tuesday evening, triggered by accelerated glacier melt.
The floodwaters destroyed a women-owned restaurant, a government tourist facilitation centre, orchards, farmland, and critical infrastructure including electricity and internet poles, according to Rescue 1122 officials.
A bridge and sections of the KKH were swept away, leaving no alternative route for locals and tourists travelling to and from China via the Khunjerab Pass. 



 
“Never experienced such intensity of floods in the nullah,” Saeed Jan, a local resident, told Dawn.
The destruction of a fibre optic line has left the area without mobile and internet services, while rising water in the Khunjerab River damaged a power transmission line near Sost, plunging communities into darkness.
Efforts to reopen the highway have been repeatedly hampered by rising water levels and mudflows, with even foot crossings for patients and travellers now deemed impossible.
In Hunza’s Hassanabad, erosion linked to outburst flooding from the Shishper glacier continued on Wednesday, dismantling two more houses and putting others at risk.
Power to Roshanabad Mohallah was cut after an electricity pole collapsed. With a section of the KKH already washed away, traffic is being diverted through the Sas valley in Nagar. 



 
Flash floods also struck Shigar district, damaging homes and property in Dogoro village of Basha, while a glof in the Horchas nullah damaged crops and blocked the road leading to K2, according to local officials.



 
Faizullah Faraq, spokesperson for the Gilgit-Baltistan government, said rehabilitation work is underway across affected areas, but warned that climate change-induced disasters “have changed the map of Gilgit-Baltistan”, with high river flows, erosion, and landslides complicating repairs.
“Passengers and vehicles are waiting for the road to be restored on both sides of the KKH,” he said, adding that the chief minister has ordered efforts to be expedited in Shigar, Ghizer, Hunza, Gilgit, Astore, Diamer, and other districts.
Evacuations in Kasur
Meanwhile, in Punjab, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has ordered the immediate evacuation of people living along the banks of the Sutlej River in Kasur district, warning of significant flooding as a powerful monsoon spell approaches.
The flow of the Sutlej is expected to increase next week, coinciding with the seventh and strongest spell of monsoon rains this season, which has already been linked to 164 deaths across Punjab.
“There is a possibility of further increase in the flow of the Sutlej River next week, and citizens are requested to immediately move to safer places,” PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said, during his emergency visit to Kasur.
The PDMA director convened a high-level meeting at the deputy commissioner’s office in Kasur to address the potential flood situation.
Officials are racing to clear storm drains and reinforce embankments, with the upcoming monsoon forecast to bring intense rainfall from August 13-17 in upper Punjab, followed by extended downpours in other areas from August 18-21.
Major urban centres including Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Sialkot face threats of urban flooding, while the PDMA has also warned of landslides in Murree and Galliyat. 



 
The monsoon season has so far killed at least 164 people, 582 rain-related injuries, damaged 216 homes, and resulted in the loss of 121 livestock, according to recent data.
River monitoring stations show low-level flooding on the Indus River at Kalabagh, Tarbela, and Chashma, with Tarbela Dam currently at 96 per cent capacity.
Kasur Deputy Commissioner Imran Ali said comprehensive preparations have been made to handle a potential flood, with de-silting of drains underway, machinery available, and staff deployed. “Adequate arrangements have been completed to deal with the flood situation at all sensitive places,” he said.

On Aug 10, a fast-moving dumper hit a motorcycle and crushed to death Mahnoor, 22, and her brother Ahmed Raza, 14, on main Rashid Minhas Road near the UBL Sports Complex. Enraged people took to the streets and set to fire seven dumpers within the remit of the Federal B Industrial Area and Yousuf Plaza police stations.
On Wednesday, the investigation officers of the two cases produced the suspects before the administrative judge of the ATCs at the Judicial Complex inside the central prison.
They requested the court to grant their 14-day police remand for interrogation and to arrest other absconding suspects.
 
 

The court remanded all 12 suspects in police custody for seven days and directed the IOs to submit progress reports at the next hearing.
Remand of dumper driver extended
A judicial magistrate on Wednesday extended the physical remand of a dumper driver booked and arrested for killing the two siblings in the fatal accident.
IO Fida Hussain brought dumper driver Firdos Khan before Judicial Magistrate (Central) Farman Ali Tager and sought an extension of his police remand, stating that more time was needed to verify the suspect’s documents.
During the hearing, the IO informed the court that the suspect had claimed to possess an HTV (Heavy Transport Vehicle) licence issued from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For verification, he said, a letter had been sent to the relevant authority in the province.
However, the IO added that the licence had not yet been verified, which was why Sections 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab) and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) had been added to the case. He requested more time as he awaited a response from the authorities concerned.
After hearing arguments from the defence counsel and the IO, the court extended the suspect’s physical remand for three more days and directed the IO to submit a progress report at the next hearing, scheduled for Aug 16.

Based on current tax rates, informed sources said the ex-depot price of HSD is estimated to decline by around 4pc, depending on final calculations, while petrol could rise by about 0.5pc.
International petrol prices inched up by 15 cents per barrel over the past fortnight, while diesel rates fell by about $4.5 per barrel. The rupee also appreciated slightly against the dollar.
The current ex-depot petrol price stands at Rs264.61 per litre, following a Rs7.54 per litre cut on August 1. This came after cumulative hikes of Rs20 per litre in the previous four fortnights since May 15. Petrol, used mainly in private cars, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers, directly impacts the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-income groups.
HSD is presently priced at Rs285.83 per litre, after an almost Rs27 per litre surge since May 15, including a minor Rs1.48 per litre cut earlier this month. The fuel powers most of the transport sector — from trucks and buses to trains, tractors, tube-wells and threshers — and has a strong inflationary effect, particularly on the prices of vegetables and other essential goods. Transport fares have already risen in response to earlier price hikes and rarely come down.
Kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) prices are expected to drop by about Rs6 and Rs7 per litre, respectively.

Mufti Munir Shakir, founder of the banned Lashkar-i-Islam, was killed in a blast outside his seminary in Urmar area on the outskirts of the provincial capital on March 15 this year.
They said the department identified the gang involved in this heinous act while efforts were under way to apprehend the culprits in the near future.
The CTD officials, while briefing media-persons said that it busted a group of militants responsible for no fewer than 18 terrorist incidents in the settled areas of the provincial capital, adding that those attacks include the martyrdom of deputy superintendent of police Sardar Hussain Khan and 14 other police officials of various ranks.

Officials reveal terrorists using digital currency for extortion; propose seminary registration should be subject to CTD’s consent

They said that following interrogation from arrested terrorists involved in several terrorist activities, CTD recovered a substantial cache of arms, ammunition, and explosive material, including IEDs, adding that the timely action also led to securing of at least six sensitive installations that had already been subjected to reconnaissance by militants and were in the final stages of planning an attack.
 
 

“CTD has identified the gang responsible for the targeted killing of religious scholars, enabling focused follow-up operations to apprehend the culprits,” they said.
Also, the CTD officials, who didn’t want to be named, claimed to have busted the Daesh Khorasan network directly responsible for the suicide attack in Peshawar city on 11 May, 2025, some four kilometres from a JUI-F gathering being addressed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman at Mufti Mehmood Markaz on Ring Road, on outskirts of the provincial capital.
While briefing journalists, CTD revealed that apart from currency notes and bank transactions, terrorist organisations received extortion money through digital currency as well.
The CTD officials told reporters here that apart from Afghanistan, people also received extortion calls from Saudi mobile numbers.
“They [militants] now seek extortion money in digital currency — Bitcoin,” a senior CTD official said, adding that the terrorist organisations generated finances not only from extortion but from drug smuggling as well.
Also, the CTD officials said that the terrorists were involved in online propaganda on several social media platforms and the department had established contact directly with the organisations owning the Apps, adding that the department had proposed to the government to establish counter cyber terrorism police stations.
“CTD also wants empowerment under Prevention of Electronic Crime Act,” they said, adding that the counter violent extremism policy was in the final stage. The CTD officials said that the religious seminaries and their registration should be subject to the approval of the CTD, adding that they had proposed empowering the deputy commissioners to registrar the religious seminaries under Societies Registration Act 1860.
They also said that they had been facing issues while arresting the accused persons in the merged districts, as it took years to arrest one person, adding that the department wanted powers under a mix of Frontier Crimes Regulations 1901 and Police Act 2017.
“We have 44 special weapon and tactics (SWAT) teams for each district. All these teams are equipped with modern gadgets,” they said, adding that capacity building of the department was under way with an explosives handling and analysis laboratory.
They said the prosecution department had developed enough expertise and the bail refusal ratio, which was 6 per cent in 2022, had gone up to 34pc in 2025, adding that 25pc was the conviction rate in 2025 as compared to 23pc in 2022.
They informed reporters that ratio of logically concluding cases was 13pc in 2022, which had gone up to 34pc in 2025, adding that 11 scientists were recruited for forensic laboratory with latest technology to be adopted in the near future.
