According to the first information report (FIR) available with Dawn.com and lodged by an injured complainant, Zahid Noor at the City police station: “Seven people from two families were killed in the firing when they were returning from the picnic at Raigi Sheno Khel area of Kohat district.”
It said that they had gone for the picnic to Tanda dam and upon returning from it, they came under attack from two sides, resulting in the deaths of six people on the spot.
The FIR copy said that one of the injured succumbed to the injuries at the KDA hospital.
Kohat District Police Officer Dr Zahidullah told Dawn.com that upon investigation, police found that the incident was a result of old enmity, adding, ’’the ones who were targeted have a history of enmity.“
The DPO further added that the deceased went to Tanda Dam, where, on their return — they were attacked. “There were a total of 11 individuals, of whom seven were attacked,’’ Zahidullah added.
According to the DPO, the deceased and injured mainly belonged to Tehsil Sadda of Kurram district and had been residing in Mohammad Zai village of Kohat for a long time due to family enmity.
The DPO told Dawn.com that police have started an investigation.
The police have initially registered a case against unknown persons and started further investigation. Moreover, after the incident, the relatives wanted to protest by placing the bodies on Hangu Road, but the protest was cancelled due to the efforts of local elders and the assurance of the police that  the culprits would be arrested at the earlier.
The first information report was lodged under sections 302 (premeditated murder) and 324 (attempt to commit qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Last month, rivals shot dead two individuals and injured another over a murder enmity in the Miankhel Bazaar of Kohat city, police had said.
In June, the police arrested PPP leader and former provincial minister Malik Amjid Afridi in Islamabad in connection with the murder of former district nazim Engineer Malik Asad.

The KP government declared an emergency on Saturday as torrential rains ravaged homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction across Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and beyond, with authorities warning that dozens of victims may still be trapped under debris.
According to state-run Radio Pakistan, additional relief goods are being dispatched to the flood-affected areas on the directives of PM Shehbaz, who is personally monitoring the relief operations of the National Disaster Management Authority in all flood-affected districts of KP.
“Teams of federal Ministers, on the instructions of the prime minister will participate in the relief operations in the flood-affected areas,” Radio Pakistan reported.
 






Federal Minister for Gilgit Baltistan and Kashmir Affairs and States and Frontier Regions, Amir Muqam will supervise the distribution of relief goods in districts Shangla and Buner.
Minister for Power Division Awais Leghari will look after activities in Buner, and Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Yousaf will oversee operations in Mansehra. Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Mubarak Zeb will supervise relief distribution activities in Bajaur.
“Additional trucks carrying relief goods are being sent to the affected districts under the Prime Minister’s Relief Package,” Radio Pakistan reported. “The relief goods include ration, tents, and medicines, which are being district administrations.”
PM Shehbaz directed the NDMA chairman to stay in constant contact with the  disaster management authorities of the provinces and Gilgit-Baltistan for better and coordinated relief efforts.
The PDMA completed its delivery of aid and relief packages later today, having successfully sent 89 trucks to Buner, Bajaur, Swat and Shangla.
The relief supplies included 1,800 family tents, 1,000 winterisation tents, 3,100 mattresses, 3,500 pillows, 1,500 hygiene kits, 3,300 kitchen sets, 2,100 pieces of tarpaulin, 3,300 mats, 4,400 mosquito nets, 3,800 blankets, 1,000 jerry cans, 1,000 beds, 1,750 solar lamps, 10 de-watering pumps, 10 generators, 100 life jackets and 500 gas cylinders.
The goods were delivered “keeping in mind the basic needs of the victims”, a statement from the authority read. “These supplies will be helpful in the immediate housing, daily life and rehabilitation process of the people in the affected areas.”
 






The authority added that it released Rs800 million for the affected districts, with Rs500m of that sum released to Buner to compensate affected families.
“Clear instructions have been issued to the deputy commissioners to provide financial assistance to the affected families as soon as possible,” the statement added. “PDMA has also ensured that there is no hindrance during the relief operations.”
Meanwhile, focal persons were posted at the Provincial Emergency Operation Centre to ensure the timely exchange of information and effective coordination between institutions.
The PDMA director general was quoted as saying that the authority is ready at all times to provide aid.
Meanwhile, PTV News reported that under the orders of the army chief, the Pakistan Army has started distributing rations to people in areas affected by flooding.
“Despite [the] bad weather, Pakistan Army helicopters are engaged in rescue and relief operations in various areas of Buner, Shangla and Swat,” the broadcaster wrote in a post on X, adding that helicopters have delivered rations to the area of Khwar Banda.
The post added that the rations include flour, rice, pulses, milk powder, salt, tea leaves and cooking oil, further stating that Pakistan Army helicopters are also transporting injured people, women and children from remote areas to safe locations.
“Pakistan Army doctors have set up medical camps in the affected areas, where free medicines are being distributed,” PTV News added.
A video attached to the post shows personnel dropping sacks and boxes of rations from a helicopter.
 






Earlier in the day, the KP PDMA released an update on the death and injury toll across the province, as well as damage to infrastructure and loss of cattle
Buner district alone has accounted for 209 deaths and 120 injuries, according to the report, with 36 dead and 21 injured in Shangla.
Mansehra recorded a total of 24 deaths and five injuries, with a similar toll of 21 deaths and five injuries in Bajaur.
According to the PDMA report, 16 men died in Swat while two were injured. Meanwhile, in Lower Dir, five people died due to thunder strikes and roof collapse, with three people injured. Thunder strikes also killed three people in Battagram.
 


A total of 159 houses have been damaged — 62 of them fully — while 57 schools across KP have also been partially damaged.
According to initial details from the Buner Deputy Commissioner’s Office, machinery has been deployed to the affected areas. “However, due to continuous heavy rainfall, it is currently impossible to reopen the causeway at Gadezai.”
District officials and rescue teams have already been dispatched to the affected locations in the Gokand and Pir Baba areas, per the report, which also noted that rescue teams have recovered the dead bodies at Daggar Village.
In Swat, two women and several school students were safely rescued by local authorities.
“The situation remains critical in certain areas, and necessary response and relief operations are underway,” the PDMA report quoted a statement from the additional deputy commissioner’s office.
KP Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told AFP that the operation to rescue people trapped under debris is ongoing.
“There is still concern that dozens of people may be trapped under the rubble… the chances of those buried under the debris surviving are very slim,” Faizi said.
He added that around 2,000 rescue workers were engaged in recovering bodies from the debris and carrying out relief operations across nine districts, where rain was still hampering efforts.
AFP journalists in Buner saw half-buried vehicles and belongings lying strewn in the sludge, with mud covering houses and shops. Flooded roads hampered the movement of rescue vehicles, as a few villagers worked to cut fallen trees to clear the way after the water receded.

Meanwhile, KP PDMA Director General Asfandyar Khattak told AFP that those missing in Buner “could be trapped under the rubble of their homes or swept away by floodwaters”.
He noted that in Shangla, dozens of people are also reported missing.
“There is no electricity or mobile signal in Buner, as power lines and mobile towers were damaged,” he added.
KP CM says govt will relocate people from flood-prone areas
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has said that the government will relocate people who are in flood-prone areas and also provide them with houses.
Addressing the media in Swat, he said, “We will provide them (flood victims) with houses, but will request them to move to safer areas and will establish new settlements as well.”
Speaking about encroachments along rivers, the KP CM said: “We will not tolerate encroachments. The most thorough operation was done against them in Dera Ismail Khan, and I call on other parties and parliamentarians to also work towards that.”
“I would make the claim that the manner in which this rescue operation was done in such a quick manner, there is no parallel in history,” Gandapur added while responding to a question.
He said that the rescue phase of the operation is over, and now the authorities will be moving onto restoration and then compensation, reiterating that the government will compensate all the personal losses of the people.
He also spoke about the introduction of new technology to prevent damage due to flooding, because of cloud bursts and landslides.
Over 850 rescued across Buner
More than 850 people have been rescued and shifted to safer places while 181 bodies have been recovered in Buner’s districts of Gaddizi, Bishoni, Malikpur, Balokhan and other nearby areas which were worst affected, according to an update from Buner Rescue 1122 issued today.
“Dozens of houses in different districts have been reduced to rubble; agricultural lands and infrastructure have been severely damaged, while reports of loss of life are also alarming,” the update said.
In Daggar, the capital of Buner, 30 people died in Gokand, Kot and other districts, while 202 people, including women and children, were shifted to safer places.
A total of 41 bodies were recovered from Chagharzai while 35 people were rescued in injured condition and taken to the Rural Health Centre Hospital Gulbandi.
Three bodies were also recovered from the Salmani area of Mandanr and shifted to the district headquarters hospital.
“Buner Rescue 1122 personnel are continuously engaged in search and rescue operations day and night in the affected areas,” the statement said.
“Rescue personnel and emergency vehicles from Swabi have also joined the operation, while special rescue teams from Peshawar are also participating in relief activities in the affected areas.”
Rescue teams and district officials are continuously present in the field and on high alert to provide timely assistance to the affected people, it added.
Flooding caused by climate change: Sherry Rehman
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman wrote in a post on X that the flooding in KP, GB and AJK was “obviously triggered by global climate change”.
The senator, who previously served as a climate change minister, noted that climate change was being fuelled by rising emissions and “local institutional indifference to building real resilience for communities and society”.
“The mega monsoon of 2025 has already claimed over 300 lives — most in KP — triggering landslides that wiped out villages, hampering rescue efforts with helicopter crashes … mass displacements,” Rehman wrote.
 






The senator wrote that forests act as a shield against excess flooding, reducing bare-ground heating and “blunting climate shock and slowing water cascades”.
“Deforestation in Pakistan is driven by illegal logging, wildfires, and the conversion of forest land for agriculture, commercial development, and mushrooming housing schemes,” she wrote. “Pakistan has the highest deforestation rate in South Asia and only retains five per cent forest cover.
“In the last 33 years, Pakistan’s forest cover has alarmingly shrunk by 18pc, falling from 3.78 million hectares in 1992 to a mere 3.09 million hectares in 2025,” Rehman added.
“This devastating loss is most acute in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s districts like Swat, Chitral, Dir, Kohistan, and Shangla, where the illegal timber mafia relentlessly exploits ancient pine and deodar forests despite government bans imposed since 2002 and 2017.”
The senator added that locals reported the destruction of 30 to 40pc of Swat’s forests, with the potential for losses of up to 70pc if deforestation continues unchecked.
Punjab PDMA orders restriction of tourists to Murree
The Punjab PDMA has ordered that tourists be restricted from travelling to Murree and other “disaster-vulnerable areas in view of the ongoing surge in monsoon activities, particularly in mountainous regions.”
A letter in this regard was sent from the Punjab Board of Revenue to the secretary to the Government of Punjab, Tourism Department, the Rawalpindi Division Commissioner and the Murree Deputy Commissioner.
The government authority asked to restrict tourist entry to vulnerable and hazard-prone sites until the current monsoon spell subsides, as well as to
coordinate with law enforcement agencies for restrictions under Section 144, wherever required.
The authority also asked to ensure wide public awareness through electronic, print and social media regarding safety advisories.
Meanwhile, the Lower Dir district administration, on the orders of the KP government, distributed compensation cheques to the heirs of the five people who died in a roof collapse incident due to rain in Maidan area’s Suri Pao village.

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations.
Pakistan said it downed six Indian planes during the conflict, including advanced French-made Dassult Rafale jets. India’s highest-ranking general has also acknowledged that its forces suffered losses in the air, but denied losing six aircraft.
 
 

Addressing a seminar in Lahore today, Naqvi said he was involved in several matters surrounding the war with India and was privy to several key pieces on information.
“The army, air force, navy and government have all been acknowledged during the past month-and-a-half, but our intelligence agencies were doing important work behind the scenes,” he said.
“Our institutions had information on India’s (plans) well ahead of time. We knew whatever they (India) planned, what aircraft they would use. Our intelligence agencies’ role was so important, but they do not come forward. We need to acknowledge them.”
The interior minister said that when Indian planes were downed, the decision was made not to announce this without evidence.
“We had radar data, but we needed field evidence,” he explained. “Within minutes, we received video footage of all six planes which were shot down. We have this footage.”
Naqvi then outlined two incidents where seven Indian missiles struck a Pakistani base, adding that once they were launched, it became clear they were heading across the border.
“People got worried, we have important hardware at this base,” he said, not mentioning the base’s name or location. “Not a single missile hit that base. Some fell short, some hit outside the base.
“When we launched our missiles, we targeted military installations near populated areas, but made every effort to avoid civilian casualties,” Naqvi added. “We destroyed one of their biggest oil depots and there were no civilian casualties. That is when we knew that God was helping us.”
The interior minister added that Nur Khan Airbase near Rawalpindi, which was struck by Indian missiles, suffered no damage.
“We had damage at one base where a member of the air force was martyred, but that’s about it,” he said.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
In July, United States President Donald Trump said that five jets were shot down during the conflict. He made his remarks at a dinner with some Republican US lawmakers at the White House, but did not specify which side’s jets he was referring to.
While describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, PAF Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed on May 12 said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.
Last month, Chinese air force chief Lieutenant General Wang Gang lauded the “exemplary performance” during the aerial clash, praising the “decisive and measured response delivered by PAF pilots under the resolute leadership of the air chief”.</p><small>2025-08-17 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17190617e16e5a8.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931465/case-dismissed-against-transgender-persons-held-for-organising-objectionable-party-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Case dismissed against transgender persons held for organising ‘objectionable’ party in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>A Lahore magistrate on Sunday dismissed the case against transgender persons allegedly organising an “objectionable” private party after police had arrested them earlier.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the case was dismissed after “no incriminating material is available on record which connects the accused persons with the commission of alleged offences.
“Hence, the request of 10 days for physical remand of the accused persons is hereby turned down, and the accused persons present in the court are hereby discharged in this case.”
The order added that no private witness of the occurrence was associated during the raid, nor were any statements taken.
“Moreover, no permission for making a raid is attached with the file on a private place. Prima facie, it seems that the accused persons were included in the case on the basis of forged and concocted facts,” the order said.
Lawyer Haider Butt represented the accused in the case. He confirmed to Dawn.com that all the accused were released and the case was discharged against them.
According to the first information report (FIR) of the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the Punjab government ordered the arrests after videos of the party, purportedly involving 50-60 individuals, including transgender persons, went viral on social media.
Fashion designer Maria B initially posted videos on her social media accounts, demanding action against “transgender activists” that she claimed featured in the clips, terming such gatherings “against the moral values of the country.”
Per the FIR, the footage, dated August 1, allegedly contained “explicit content, prompting public outcry and a swift response from law enforcement.”
The case was registered on behalf of the government at the Naseerabad police station against “a group of 50 to 60 transgender persons under sections 292 (sale of obscene material), 292-A (printing/advertising obscene matter), and 294 (obscene acts in public) of the Pakistan Penal Code, alongside Section 6 of the Sound System Act.”
Following the arrests, Deputy Inspector General of Police (Operations) Lahore, Faisal Kamran, had said, “Promoting obscenity under the guise of a party or photoshoot is a serious legal offence.”
He said that illegal and unethical acts will not be tolerated in any form. “All individuals involved in the incident will be brought to justice.”
Kamran added that the screening of the banned film Joyland, which features a transgender love affair, was also stopped in the city. “Strict action will be taken against any activity conflicting with Islam and the law.”
The movie was set to screen in Lahore today, nearly two years after it was barred from cinemas in Punjab. The long-awaited screening was said to take place at an alternative venue instead of a movie theatre.
Responding to the development, Islamabad-based transgender rights activist Nayyab Ali said in a post on X that individuals seen in the video were “not trans activists” and had “nothing to do with our movement.”
Ali also alleged that the video was shot at a private party and only went viral after Maria B posted it, saying, “If it’s fahashi (vulgarity), then who spread it to millions? Maria B did. That’s a crime itself.”
Meanwhile, human rights activists raised concerns over the potential misuse of morality laws on social media. “While obscenity laws exist, their vague wording often leads to arbitrary enforcement, disproportionately targeting marginalised communities,” said a legal expert, requesting anonymity.
The government authorities also vowed to expand the crackdown on “immoral activities” across the province.</p><small>2025-08-17 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17164649272e9e5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931468/death-of-senior-journalist-being-probed-from-all-possible-angles-police-official' target='_blank'><strong>Death of senior journalist being probed from ‘all possible angles’: police official</strong></a><br><p>The police on Sunday said that they were investigating the death of senior DawnNews TV reporter “from all possible angles,” hours after his body was found in Sindh’s Sanghar district.
The senior journalist was found dead in his car, parked on Hyderabad Road in Sanghar, on Saturday night under what police termed “mysterious circumstances”. The body was found in the driving seat, with a gunshot wound to the head.
Sanghar Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abid Baloch told Dawn.com that police were investigating the death of DawnNewsTV reporter Khawar Hussain Bajwa from “all possible angles”.
“The postmortem of the journalist was conducted in Sanghar’s Civil Hospital, and police are awaiting the provisional findings of the process,” he said.
“Apparently, there is a single bullet wound from a 9mm pistol with an exit wound on the left side of the temple”, SSP Baloch said, adding that only one bullet casing was found.
“We are not drawing any conclusion at this point and are looking at this case from all possible angles,” the SSP explained.
According to Sanghar police, Hussain’s body had been kept in the cold storage facility at the Red Crescent hospital in Latifabad, as his parents are said to be arriving from the United States early on Monday morning.
“Then the body will be taken to Sanghar, which is the ancestral home of the journalist, for burial,” the SSP said.
Meanwhile, Sanghar police obtained a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera recording of a restaurant, outside of which was the car in which his body was found.
The SSP stated that a guard at the restaurant told police that he arrived at around 7pm for his duties, and Hussain arrived in his vehicle 45 minutes to an hour later.
The guard told the police that the journalist had used the restaurant’s toilet and then sat back in the vehicle.
“After some time when he didn’t place any order, the guard, out of curiosity, went towards the vehicle and reported back to the restaurant manager, telling him he noticed something unusual with a man sitting inside,” the SSP said.
“Two waiters arrived to confirm the watchman’s statement and found out that blood was oozing from the right side of his [Hussain’s] temple, with a 9mm pistol in his right hand,” SSP Baloch added.
According to the SSP, Hussain’s brother-in-law told police that he didn’t inform them about his Saturday arrival, although he asked them to hold an annual religious ritual as per the family’s tradition. Hussain neither told friends in Sanghar about his visit nor did he attend the ritual.
“His sister confirmed that he had celebrated Eidul Azha with her on her insistence, after their parents shifted to the US this May,” the SSP said.
Last night, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and sought a report from the police chief, with instructions that the investigation be handed over to the best police officer.</p><small>2025-08-17 12:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17170354703579d.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931469/child-killed-parents-injured-as-ambulance-hits-motorcycle-in-kps-haripur' target='_blank'><strong>Child killed, parents injured as ambulance hits motorcycle in KP’s Haripur</strong></a><br><p>A child was killed while her parents were injured when a speeding ambulance hit their motorbike near Sikandar Pur in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Haripur city on Sunday, police said.
The local police quoted the injured Muhammad Yaseen as saying that he was travelling to Haripur with his wife, Sameena Bibi and six-month-old daughter, Fatima Bibi, by motorcycle.
“When we reached near Sikandarpur on the busy Chappar Road, a recklessly driven ambulance hit us from behind,” Yaseen was quoted as saying by Hasan Khan, spokesperson for the Haripur district police officer. “Fatima died instantly, and we both suffered minor injuries.”
Hadi Khan, an eyewitness, told Dawn.com, “The girl died instantly after being crushed under the tyres of the ambulance.”
The injured couple and the girl’s body were transported to the Haripur Trauma Centre, where the parents received emergency treatment and were later discharged from the hospital, according to the spokesperson.
It was the second road accident of a similar nature reported from Haripur.
“On Saturday evening, a one-month-old boy was also died and his parents were injured when their motorcycle collided with a motor car on Khanpur road,” the spokesperson said.
Earlier this month, a policeman escorting a foreign delegation was killed while six others, including a deputy superintendent of police, were injured when a van overturned near the Chechiyan interchange on Hazara Motorway, some four kilometres from Haripur city.
The incident, according to police, occurred when the front tyre of the escort van burst and the driver lost control, causing it to overturn.</p><small>2025-08-17 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619212-karachi-likely-to-receive-moderate-to-heavy-rainfall-through-august-23' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi likely to receive moderate to heavy rainfall through August 23</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement from Rescue 1122, the Awami Express train was travelling from Lahore to Karachi when the incident happened.
“Four coaches of the train suddenly derailed due to brake failure near the Lodhran Railway Station”, the statement said.
“The incident left one person dead while another 33 were injured, out of which 11 received medical assistance at the site of the incident, and the rest were immediately rushed to the District Hospital in Lodhran.”
It further said that two critically injured persons were transferred to a hospital in Bahawalpur.
Expressing grief over the loss of life, Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi vowed to take disciplinary action against those responsible for the incident.
He ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed authorities to submit a report within seven days.
“No one can be allowed to play with human lives under any circumstances. We have started reforms within the railways department, and people will benefit from it soon,” Abbasi said in a statement.
The minister directed the railway authorities to complete the restoration of the track, as trains scheduled to pass through the track were diverted.
Pakistan Railway Headquarters has called an emergency meeting for tomorrow, presided over by the railway minister. The minister said he will also visit the site of the accident.
The rest of the passengers were accommodated in an alternate train, according to the railway ministry.
The incident comes days after two coaches of the Peshawar-bound Awam Express derailed close to the Khanpur railway station near Rahim Yar Khan, leaving multiple passengers injured, while another Multan-bound Musa Pak Express also got off the track, raising questions about the safety of Pakistan railways.
Earlier this month, at least 29 people were injured as an Islamabad Express passenger train derailed near Kala Shah Kaku in Punjab’s Sheikhupura district.

In the biggest tax overhaul since 2017, Modi’s government on Saturday announced sweeping changes to the complex goods and services tax (GST) regime which will make daily essentials and electronics cheaper from October, helping consumers and also companies like Nestle, Samsung and LG Electronics.
At the same time, in his Independence Day speech on Friday, Modi urged Indians to use more goods made domestically, echoing calls from many of his supporters to boycott US products after Donald Trump hiked tariffs on imports from India to 50 per cent as of August 27.
 
 

The tax cut plan comes with costs given GST is a major revenue generator. IDFC First Bank says the cuts will boost India’s GDP by 0.6 percentage points over 12 months but will cost the state and federal government $20 billion annually.
But it will improve weak stock market sentiment and bring political dividends for Modi ahead of a critical state election in the eastern state of Bihar, said Rasheed Kidwai, a fellow at New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation.
“GST reduction will impact everyone, unlike cuts to income tax, which is paid by only 3-4pc of the population. Modi is doing this as he is under a lot of pressure due to US policies,” said Kidwai.
“The move will also help the stock market, which is now politically important as it has a lot of retail investors.”
India launched the major tax system in 2017 that subsumed local state taxes into the new, nationwide GST to unify its economy for the first time.
But the biggest tax reform since India’s independence faced criticism for its complex design that taxes products and services under four slabs — 5pc, 12pc, 18pc and 28pc.
Last year, India said caramel popcorn would be taxed at 18pc but the salted category at 5pc, triggering criticism about a glaring example of GST’s complexities.
Under the new system, India will abolish the 28pc slab — which includes cars and electronics — and move nearly all of the items under the 12pc category to the lower 5pc slab, benefitting many more consumer items and packaged foods.
Government data shows the 28pc and 12pc tax slabs together garner 16pc of India’s annual GST revenue of roughly $250 billion last fiscal year.
‘A brighter gift’ and politics
Bihar is a key state politically and goes to the polls by November. A recent survey by the VoteVibe agency showed Modi’s opposition has an edge largely because of a lack of jobs.
“Any tax cut has wide public appreciation. But of course, the timing is purely determined by political exigencies,” said Dilip Cherian, a communications consultant and co-founder of Indian public relations firm Perfect Relations.
“It seems to be an indication of some mixture of frustration as well as recognition that there is a broad public pushback against high and crippling rates of taxation.”
Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has seized on his tax announcement, posting on X that on the Hindu festival of lights, Diwali, “a brighter gift of simpler taxes and more savings is waiting for every Indian.”
 






Modi has vowed to protect farmers, fishermen and cattlemen, following Trump’s surprise tariff announcement on India, after trade talks between New Delhi and Washington collapsed over disagreement on opening India’s vast farm and dairy sectors and stopping Russian oil purchases.
The latest round of trade talks between the two nations set for August 25-29 has also been called off.</p><small>2025-08-17 09:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/17133424ef7727b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931457/salman-agha-to-lead-pakistans-asia-cup-squad-as-babar-rizwan-left-out' target='_blank'><strong>Salman Agha to lead Pakistan’s Asia Cup squad as Babar, Rizwan left out</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan left out Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan from the T20 squad named on Sunday for the Asia Cup and a warm-up tri-series beginning this month against Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates, according to a press release issued by the Pakistan Cricket Board.
Azam and Rizwan have been star performers in the shortest format in the past, but have not played since December, which head coach Mike Hesson put down to other players performing well while addressing a press conference.
 






“We know what a fine player Babar (Azam) is,” said Hesson.
“Babar has been asked to improve in certain areas, like taking on spin and in terms of his strike rate, and he is working hard on these things.
“The players we have are performing well and having a positive impact,” said Hesson.
Since Hesson took over as head coach in May, Pakistan have played three T20 series — winning 3-0 at home but losing 2-1 away to Bangladesh. They then beat the West Indies 2-1 in the United States.
“Our focus is to win the tri-series and the Asia Cup, and the aim is to peak from these pinnacle events,” said Hesson.
All-rounder Salman Agha will lead the side, which also sees the return of fast bowlers Mohammad Wasim and Salman Mirza.
Mirza took seven wickets in Bangladesh but was left out of the squad against the West Indies.
Opener Fakhar Zaman also returns after being injured for a one-day international series in the West Indies last week, which Pakistan lost 2-1.
The tri-series, which starts on August 29, and the Asia Cup from September 9 will both take place in the UAE.

The Peruvian wing wizard dazzled during his time in the English Premier League but the highlight of his coaching career came back in 2018 when, as assistant coach, he took his home country to their first World Cup finals in 36 years.
“We need to work really had to make Pakistan competitive at international level,” Solano said in an in-house PFF interview. “My ambition is like everyone in the federation. We want to have a solid foundation and build a competitive league that allows the talent in the country the opportunity to play.”
 






Solano stressed he wanted to build a solid team that would play attacking football “to win games”.
His first assignment comes next month when Pakistan face hosts Cambodia, Iraq and Oman in Group ‘G’ in the qualifiers for the 2026 AFC Under-23 Asian Cup.
“We need to focus and have a strong mentality,” he said. “We need to go to Cambodia and try to qualify [for the tournament finals].”
The 50-year-old said as a coach he will not stick to strict philosophy but use a formation that utilises the strengths of his players best.
“I believe we can play different systems depending upon the players. We will know their strengths when we begin training.”
The camp for the Under-23 probables begins in Abbottabad from Sunday.
Published in Dawn, August 17th, 2025</p><small>2025-08-17 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68a12a0e60d6d.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931343/sindh-earmarks-land-for-first-b2b-green-power-project' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh earmarks land for first B2B green power project</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Sindh government has allotted 300 acres of land in Jhimpir to Moro Power Company (MPC) for establishing a 100-megawatt hybrid wind and solar project, the first business-to-business (B2B) electricity venture under the province’s own regulator.
Officials said the project, to be executed under the Sindh Electric Power Regulatory Authority (SEPRA), will enable MPC to supply power directly to industries in Nooriabad through the Sindh Trans­mission and Despatch Company (STDC).
The initiative is aimed at providing industries with reliable and cheaper renewable energy, reducing costs and strengthening the provincial industrial base.
Sindh is the only province in Pakistan to have its power regulator, giving it authority to set tariffs and oversee generation, transmission and distribution independently of the federal government. The Jhimpir project is therefore viewed as a pioneering step towards decentralised power generation in the country.

Moro Power to set up 100MW wind-solar hybrid project in Jhimpir

Energy Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said the provincial government was determined to tap Jhimpir’s wind corridor, which has the potential to produce up to 50,000MW at a record-low rate of Rs8 per unit. “We are making all-out efforts to exploit this natural resource, which can spur industrial growth and economic development in Sindh,” he said.
 
 

MPC Chief Executive Officer Mustafa Abdullah said the company would install 65MW of wind turbines and 35MW of solar panels. “We have already signed a term sheet with a dozen industries in Nooriabad to supply power at Rs20/kWh and are in talks with Alfalah Asset Management and other banks for project financing,” he said.
Mr Abdullah added that MPC was negotiating with Bank of Punjab, Faysal Bank and JS Bank to form a consortium for 80pc debt financing under the $7bn green funds made available by the World Bank for Pakistan. “This will be the first project under SEPRA to supply affordable electricity to industries by 2026,” he noted.
He said STDC would build transmission lines to link the Jhimpir site with the Nooriabad Industrial Estate, only 20 kilometres away. “This initiative will not only improve industrial competitiveness but also promote a low-carbon future,” he remarked.
Growing renewable footprint
The Jhimpir wind corridor has already attracted 36 power producers with a combined generation capacity of 1,845MW. Officials believe the provincial government’s push for renewable energy could draw billions of dollars in further investment and create employment opportunities.
MPC pointed out that countries such as China, Germany and India have made major strides in wind energy, with installed capacities of 700,000MW, 120,000MW and 50,000MW, respectively.
Pakistan, though endowed with strong wind corridors in Sindh and Balochistan, remains at an early stage of harnessing its potential. Analysts believe provincial-led projects such as this can accelerate progress by bypassing federal bottlenecks.
Observers also see Sindh’s B2B model as a potential template for other provinces, particularly in the face of recurring disputes over circular debt and grid constraints at the federal level.
A senior energy official said the Jhimpir initiative could mark a turning point for Sindh’s energy landscape. “With its vast renewable resources, Sindh can lead Pakistan’s clean energy transition. By supplying industries with affordable power, such projects can fuel sustained industrialisation and economic stability.”
 
 

Mr Abdullah echoed this view, saying the project would demonstrate how private investment, international green funds and provincial autonomy could converge to deliver sustainable energy solutions.
The provincial government, meanwhile, is counting on renewable projects to cut reliance on costly imported fuels, reduce carbon emissions and expand its industrial footprint. If successful, the Jhimpir hybrid plant could not only reshape Sindh’s power sector but also serve as a model for the rest of the country.

Westernisation is the import and adoption of European culture, social and political ideas, and technology by non-Western societies. Interestingly, even though the US became perhaps the most active exporter of Westernisation after World War II, its own creation in the late 18th century was an outcome of Westernisation. 
The US’ national and cultural identity were strongly influenced by European philosophy and history. Industrialisation in the US was significantly influenced by Britain, with early American industrial development largely based on British models and technologies.
Non-Western countries embraced Westernisation because it was linked to social, political and economic modernity and ‘progress’. It was closely linked to capitalism and democracy, even though many non-democratic regimes adopted it as well. But, by the late 1970s, critiques against Westernisation in non-Western regions began to find more space than before in the politics and intelligentsias of these regions. Westernisation started to be seen as a tool of ‘cultural imperialism’ and a cause of identity loss and the erosion of ‘traditional ways of life.’
For example, many Muslim-majority countries initiated projects to replace Westernisation’s economic, political and cultural products with ‘Islamic’ products. Ideas such as ‘Islamic constitutions’, ‘Islamic banking’, ‘Islamic science’ etc began being applied in the economic, political and cultural spheres. Such ‘Islamisation’ projects were an overarching response/reaction to Westernisation.

For decades, Pakistan’s political and cultural discourse has been framed as a struggle against ‘Westernisation’. But the real story is more complex — and China’s pragmatic approach to
Westernisation shows that modernisation need not be hostage to ideology or faith

But this did not mean the outright rejection of ‘Western’ technology — as long as it was applied in an ‘Islamic manner.’ Western cultural products too were not rejected, as long as they did not offend ‘Islamic sensibilities.’ The outcome of all this was a complex fusion that produced societies of co-existing contrasts. But in such societies, it actually became almost impossible to reach a convincing consensus on exactly what was ‘Islamic’ and what wasn’t. 
Westernisation in various Muslim countries was systematically demonised, but its ‘modernisation’ aspects prevailed. On the one hand, modernisation was compartmentalised (or only made available to certain sections of the society), and, on the other hand, it was ‘Islamised’ (for the ‘masses’). 
Additionally, ‘postmodernism’ as a collection of political, economic and cultural critiques comprehensively vilified Westernisation — even though postmodernism too was a product of the West. Postmodernism romanticised ‘localism’ and saw the world as an assemblage of islands with their own ‘ways of life.’ 
Yet, postmodernism also celebrated hybridity and the mixing of cultures, which gave credence to what became to be known as ‘globalisation’. This dual and often contradictory nature of postmodernism is present in many Muslim-majority regions. Contradictions can produce a constructive synthesis but, in this case, it mostly produced confusion and identity crises. 
Westernisation is no more a troubling spectre, though. One adopts it as a necessity — even selectively. Many non-Western countries have begun to use Western technologies and economic ideas to further evolve them and call them their own. China is an excellent case in point. 
 


From 1979 onwards, the Chinese adopted Western economic and cultural ideas and technologies by first fully understanding them and then tweaking them in an entirely pragmatic manner (instead of on the basis of an ideology or faith). There might be a Chinese system of banking, for example, but it’s not called Confucius or Maoist banking. 
Anyone talking disparagingly about Westernisation in Pakistan vis-a-vis Islam is only deepening the confusion. If they are willing to look beyond this, they will notice that, from the 1980s onwards, the more alarming issue has been that of ‘Indianisation’. And this is due to how ‘Islamisation’ was concocted to supposedly stall Westernisation. Let me explain. 
‘Islamisation’ projects not only produced a complex (and confusing) duality, they also triggered sectarian and ethnic polarisation, especially in multi-ethnic/multi-sectarian regions such as Pakistan. The country’s polity contains multiple ideas of ‘true Islam.’ State-backed ‘Islamisation’ projects created tensions because these may not be acceptable to certain sects and sub-sects and even to certain ethnic groups. This triggers tensions that weaken Pakistani nationalism and identity. 
Indian cultural products such as Bollywood films, though first banned in Pakistan in 1965, were unofficially allowed to be watched at home on VCRs in the 1980s — ironically during a dictatorship that was busy constructing an ‘Islamisation’ project in the country. The dictatorship did this to push so-called ‘un-Islamic’/‘Western’ behaviour indoors (such as watching films, holding ‘dance parties’, drinking alcohol etc), as the dictatorship got busy ‘Islamising’ the outdoors.
Years later, those bothered by the resultant contradictory duality began to see India as some magical place of democracy, secularism, freedom and, of course, great films. As the ‘Islamised’ outdoors became a mere aesthetic exercise to appease anti-Westernisation crusaders, Indianisation began working as a middle path between Westernisation and ‘Islamisation’ for an increasing number of Pakistanis. 
Intellectuals, advertising executives, commercial brands, artists and everyday folk began revering Indian cultural, academic and political content because Pakistan’s own content in this regard continued to be weighed down by ‘Islamisation’. However, eventually, India itself began to roll back its revered democracy and secularism, bringing exclusivist ideologies such as Hindutva to the surface. Also, India’s cultural products began taking a more crass, anti-Pakistan turn.
The consequential retreat of Indianisation in Pakistan has been painfully slow. But it is receding. However, its influence on anti-state ethnic and Islamist groups (both militant and political) has grown. They see India as their vessel through which they will achieve their goals. 
To neutralise Indianisation, which has now taken a more sinister turn, Pakistan needs to engage with Westernisation as China has. It has to be a pragmatic engagement, based on economic and political requirements. The engagement needs to be free of any ideology or faith, though.

While many participants expressed concern over a looming security vacuum and its likely spillover into Pakistan, a few struck a markedly optimistic tone. Among them was a retired senior military official who declared confidently: “The good days are returning. The Delhi-leaning set-up in Kabul is on its way out. With the Taliban back in charge, all Islamabad needs to do is press for the closure of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan [TTP] and Baloch separatist sanctuaries in eastern Afghanistan, and the Taliban will comply. They owe us.”
He was not alone. Across Pakistan’s political and security establishment, the Taliban’s return in August 2021 was initially greeted with a cautious but clear sense of opportunity. A friendly regime in Kabul appeared to serve Islamabad’s long-standing strategic goals: rolling back Indian influence, reducing Western presence and restoring Pakistan’s central role in shaping regional outcomes.
Then-prime minister Imran Khan hailed the moment as the breaking of “the shackles of slavery.” Then-interior minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed, speaking triumphantly at the Torkham border crossing, predicted the rise of “a new bloc” that would elevate the region’s global significance. Even Khawaja Muhammad Asif, then in opposition and now defence minister, posted a photograph of Taliban leader Mullah Baradar alongside US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, captioned: “You may have the power, but God is with us. Allah-o-Akbar.”

Four years on from the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, the optimism surrounding what was being hailed as a geopolitical victory for Pakistan has vanished. Instead, Pakistan is contending with a rising wave of militant violence from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to Balochistan, and which threatens to expand inland. What options does Islamabad have to rethink its Afghan strategy?

Four years later, that optimism has all but vanished. As Afghanistan slips from international headlines, Pakistan faces mounting costs from what was once hailed as a strategic win. Instead of securing its western frontier, Islamabad confronts a resurgence of militant violence, a worsening security climate and a strained relationship with a regime it once considered an ally.
Drawing on recent fieldwork in both countries, this article examines how the Taliban’s return has deepened Pakistan’s domestic security crises, exposing the limits of its longstanding strategic assumptions.
ACROSS THE BORDER, VIOLENCE RISES AGAIN
For the political and religious elders of Bajaur, the stakes could not have been higher. With the government poised to launch a new counterterrorism operation in the district bordering Afghanistan against the TTP and the Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP) — the local affiliate of the transnational Islamic State network — they took it upon themselves to negotiate a peaceful resolution through a jirga.
Their appeal to local TTP commanders was straightforward: either retreat into Afghanistan or relocate to remote mountainous areas to engage security forces. Such a move, they argued, would spare civilian populations from the destruction, displacement and the fear that inevitably follow armed conflict in villages.
Yet the militants, sensing a shift in regional power dynamics, refused.
Emboldened by the Taliban’s victory in Afghanistan, the TTP leaders, according to a participant in the jirga, demanded terms that Pakistan could never accept. The talks collapsed, making renewed conflict all but inevitable. The renewed military operation was launched on August 11.
The Taliban’s triumph in Kabul has emboldened militant groups across Pakistan’s western belt. Alongside the TTP, groups such as the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Baloch ethno-separatist organisations such as the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) have exploited the shifting regional balance to intensify their insurgencies against the Pakistani state.
ISKP — previously weakened by crackdowns by the US, the former Afghan government, and the Taliban — has also been reinvigorated since the Taliban’s takeover. After facing sustained pressure from the Taliban inside Afghanistan, some ISKP fighters crossed into Pakistan, particularly into Bajaur, where the group has since carried out several high-profile attacks.
The release of this year’s Global Terrorism Index (GTI) by the Institute for Economics and Peace think-tank coincided with an attempted hijacking of the Jaffer Express passenger train in Balochistan by BLA militants in March, an incident that drew international attention.
According to the GTI, Pakistan is now ranked as the world’s second most terrorism-affected country, after Burkina Faso, a name unfamiliar to many Pakistanis. The report also highlighted a troubling reality: three Pakistani militant groups, the TTP, the BLA and the ISKP, are among the world’s 10 deadliest terrorist organisations, posing a formidable challenge to Pakistan’s counterterrorism strategy.
Findings from the GTI, corroborated by statistics from law enforcement agencies and other security research organisations, indicate that Pakistan has witnessed a sharp escalation in terrorism since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021. In the years since, the country has faced a renewed wave of attacks, including suicide bombings, targeted assassinations, and complex assaults on military installations, political gatherings and mosques.
RESURGENCE OF MILITANT GROUPS
Until 2020, militant outfits such as the TTP and the Hafiz Gul Bahadur group were under sustained pressure from multiple fronts. Pakistan’s large-scale counterterrorism campaigns, including Operation Zarb-i-Azb launched in 2014, inflicted heavy losses on their ranks. Internal divisions further weakened these groups, while US drone strikes eliminated much of their senior leadership. By that period, many TTP factions had either gone dormant or dispersed into Afghanistan’s eastern provinces, including Khost, Kunar and Nangarhar.
In Balochistan, too, attacks by the BLA and other major separatist organisations had declined, due to a persistent security crackdown and internal splintering.
However, the US-Taliban peace talks in Doha and the subsequent American withdrawal from Afghanistan breathed new life into Pakistani militant groups, particularly the TTP. The anticipation of a Taliban victory triggered a wave of reunifications among previously fragmented TTP factions.
By mid-2020, several key splinters, including those aligned with al-Qaeda, had rejoined under the leadership of TTP chief Mufti Noor Wali. In internal communications, Wali praised the Afghan Taliban’s unity and urged Pakistani jihadist groups to follow suit, reportedly telling his commanders: “The jihad in Pakistan will not succeed until all mujahideen unite under one flag, as our Afghan brothers have done.”
The Taliban’s return to full power in August 2021 was a watershed moment for militant ideologues across the region. For the TTP, it was both an inspiration and a validation of their long-term strategy.
Since then, Pakistan has seen a sharp resurgence in insurgent violence. In 2024, terrorist attacks rose 70 percent from the previous year, reaching 521 incidents. These claimed 852 lives, a 23 percent increase in fatalities, according to the Pak Institute for Peace Studies. The surge marks the fourth consecutive year of escalating attacks on security forces and related casualties since 2021.
“PERMISSIVE ENVIRONMENT” IN AFGHANISTAN
The Pakistani military recently claimed it had killed 47 militants in two separate raids, as they attempted to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Balochistan’s Zhob district, one of the deadliest cross-border clashes in recent months. While the military provided few details, it identified the militants as belonging to Fitna al-Khwarij, a term coined by the military leadership for the TTP and other Islamist militant groups.
“While the US may have ended its presence, it left behind an unstable Afghanistan, making it a sanctuary for regional militant groups,” a senior security official in Islamabad tells me. “Whether it is ideological confidence, access to abandoned US weaponry, or physical sanctuaries, these groups are receiving active support or passive facilitation from the Taliban administration in Kabul.”
A recent report by the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team echoed these concerns. It noted that the TTP, operating in a “permissive environment” in Afghanistan, now fields around 6,000 fighters and has acquired advanced weaponry, significantly enhancing its operational capabilities with substantial logistical and tactical support from the de facto Afghan authorities.
Muhammad Feyyaz, a Lahore-based academic specialising in terrorism studies, describes the Taliban’s return as “costly” for Pakistan. “Before the takeover, Pakistan faced no existential threat from Afghanistan. Now, Taliban-ruled Afghanistan poses exactly that,” he says. He said that the Taliban administration is actively backing the TTP’s efforts to regain Pakistan’s tribal belt as part of a larger vision for a transnational Islamic emirate.
While Pakistan’s military demonstrated during Operation Zarb-i-Azb that it could inflict severe damage on militant networks, the security environment of today is fundamentally different, more fragmented, more complex, and far less conducive to decisive action. The political, security, and economic realities of post-2021 Pakistan are inextricably linked to the dramatic shifts in Afghanistan following the Taliban’s return to power.
Pakistan has not been able to mount an effective counterterrorism response against TTP, the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction and other groups due to the US exit from Afghanistan, fractured relations with the Taliban, divergent postures on the TTP and the growing state-society gap in the areas along with Afghanistan-Pakistan border regions, according to Abdul Basit, an expert at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.

POLITICAL CHAOS, FRACTURED CONSENSUS
In recent weeks, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur has been navigating turbulent political waters. Meeting with jirga leaders from the former tribal districts, he encountered a unified stance against any new military operation and the mass displacement it could trigger. Tribal elders instead proposed a broad-based, empowered jirga, including federal and provincial representatives, elders and key stakeholders, to open dialogue directly with the Taliban administration in Kabul.
Gandapur also faces resistance from within his own party. From jail, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan has warned against authorising military action in KP, particularly in the merged tribal districts. The party’s stance is explicit: no renewed operations on home soil.
This is a sharp contrast to 2014, when the Karachi airport attack and the Army Public School (APS) massacre forged an unprecedented national consensus behind Operation Zarb-i-Azb. Political parties, civil society and the media stood united.
Today, however, major political parties, including PTI, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) and the Awami National Party (ANP), openly oppose a new offensive, warning of mass displacement and social disruption. Grassroots peace campaigns in KP are already rallying public resistance, underscoring that, without political consensus, the state’s ability to act decisively will remain limited. Since 2008, residents have endured multiple operations under different names, yet neither peace has returned nor terrorism has been eradicated, local activists complain.
CROSS-BORDER SANCTUARIES
A decade ago, the TTP was weakened by internal divisions, defections to the ISKP and the loss of senior leaders to US drone strikes. Today, the picture is starkly different. Since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in August 2021, the TTP has consolidated its splinter factions, absorbing smaller outfits linked to al-Qaeda and sectarian militancy.
“They’ve now dispersed across Pakistan, while securing hideouts in Afghanistan,” a senior Peshawar-based law enforcement official says. “The Taliban regime not only shelters them but also arms them with modern weapons and night-vision gear abandoned by US forces.” This level of support marks a significant shift from the previous Afghan government of Ashraf Ghani, which had at times cooperated with Islamabad to capture senior TTP leaders, such as Maulvi Faqir Muhammad of Bajaur.
The Taliban administration’s release of hundreds of imprisoned TTP fighters from Afghan jails has revitalised the insurgency, allowing the group to regroup, rearm and conduct operations with heightened sophistication, according to officials.
Adding to the complexity is the emergence of a new jihadist alliance, Ittehadul Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), comprised of the Hafiz Gul Bahadur faction, Lashkar-i-Islam, and Inqilab-i-Islami Pakistan. Since its formation, the IMP has conducted numerous attacks against Pakistani police and armed forces, primarily in southern KP. The alliance has also expressed its intention to expand operations into other provinces, including Punjab.
The overall conflict has also seen a growing use of drones by both militant groups and state security forces, tactics that have, tragically, increased civilian casualties, including children.
ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS, REDUCED US SUPPORT
Pakistan now confronts the challenge of counterterrorism in an environment devoid of the robust external support it enjoyed a decade ago. In 2014, political stability, relative economic health, and American assistance, including funding, intelligence sharing, and targeted drone strikes, played a decisive role in degrading TTP capabilities.
Today, the economic situation is far bleaker. Mounting debt and fiscal instability have left fewer resources for intelligence gathering, advanced technology procurement, and the deployment of specialised manpower, all crucial to effective counterterrorism operations.
According to Basit, “The US exit from Afghanistan, which had provided intelligence and financial assistance while also restricting TTP and other groups’ movements into Afghanistan, altered regional dynamics.”
There are signs of renewed, albeit limited, US cooperation. Washington recently acknowledged Pakistan’s role in capturing a regional ISKP leader linked to the 2021 Kabul airport attack that killed American troops. Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir’s two visits within just one and a half months to Washington underscore Islamabad’s efforts to re-engage with the US security establishment.
On August 11, the U.S. administration designated the BLA and its suicide bomber unit, the Majeed Brigade, as foreign terrorist organizations.
However, Basit warns that it will be nowhere near the coordination we witnessed during the war on terror or the pre-2021 era.
“During that time, it was a US-led, Pakistan-assisted counterterrorism template. Now it is a Pakistan-led, US-enabled counterterrorism equation, where Washington will provide technical support, training and intelligence assistance, and some specialised counterterrorism equipment,” he adds. “But, there will be no funding made available to Pakistan.”
He says that counterterrorism is no more a top priority for the US; it is a tactical concern, and the Munir-Trump bromance will unlock limited, tactical and transactional cooperation on counterterrorism.
BETWEEN BROTHERHOOD AND BLOWBACK
“It’s easy for Pakistan to demand the expulsion of muhajireen from Afghanistan,” says Qari Jamaluddin, a mid-ranking official in the Taliban administration, using the term to refer to Pakistani militants who sought refuge in Afghanistan after Pakistan launched Operation Zarb-i-Azb in 2014. “But such demands do not align with the jihadist worldview, nor with the principles of Islamic or Pashtun brotherhood.”
We met in Kabul on a cold evening in late 2023. I had first known Jamaluddin during his Karachi days. A staunch loyalist of the Taliban’s first regime, his family fled to Pakistan following the 2001 US invasion. In exile, he attended a madressah [religious school] and ran a cloth shop, but his conviction in the Taliban’s eventual return never faltered. “It was only a matter of time,” he would often say.
Shortly after Kabul fell in August 2021, Islamabad pressed the Taliban leadership to stop the TTP from launching attacks inside Pakistan. The effort failed. Instead, the Taliban urged Islamabad to address the TTP’s so-called “grievances” and offered to mediate peace talks, a proposal that exposed the depth of their reluctance to act against former battlefield allies. Talks began but quickly collapsed, leading to renewed violence.
Officially, the Taliban administration denies harbouring foreign militants and frames Pakistani concerns as internal political matters. Yet their counterterrorism policy remains selective: while actively targeting the ISKP, they tolerate the TTP. The Taliban refrain from labelling the TTP as terrorists, viewing them instead as ideological kin and historical comrades-in-arms.
Jamaluddin characterises Islamabad’s support for the Taliban as strictly transactional. “Pakistan backed us to counter Indian influence but, at the same time, it handed over our leaders to the Americans. We endured it because every insurgency needs sanctuaries in a neighbouring country.”
In Pakistan, the Taliban once found an enabling ecosystem across segments of society that allowed them to reorganise and mount a lethal insurgency from around 2003 onward. Without that support, Jamaluddin acknowledges, the Taliban’s rise to power would have been far more difficult.
“It was not the Pakistani state, but the TTP, Pakistani religious activists and madressah teachers that stood unwaveringly with the Taliban,” he says. “They fought and died for us while being hunted by US drones in North Waziristan.”
Many Taliban leaders and experts argue that the reluctance to confront the TTP runs deeper than politics. “The relationship between the Taliban and the TTP is built upon shared ideological, historical, and cultural bonds,” says Jabbar Durrani, an Afghan researcher based in Britain. “This connection extends beyond the top leadership to include their rank-and-file members, who often maintain close personal and operational ties.”
Former-Afghan refugee minister Khalilur Rehman Haqqani, later assassinated in an ISKP attack in December 2024, recounted in a 2023 TV interview how TTP founder Baitullah Mehsud once captured dozens of Pakistani security personnel to secure the release of Taliban prisoners, including Haqqani himself. For many Taliban leaders, such episodes are enduring reminders of shared sacrifice.
This history reinforces the perception among the Taliban’s ranks in Afghanistan that cutting ties with the TTP would be both ungrateful and dangerous. “Any heavy-handed move against the TTP,” warns Durrani, “could trigger internal dissent and drive their fighters into the arms of ISKP, already locked in a bitter conflict with the Afghan Taliban.”

PAKISTAN’S RESPONSE
Frustrated by a surge in terrorist attacks, Pakistan has adopted a mix of hard and soft power tactics to pressure the Taliban administration in Kabul into acting against the TTP.
Since 2022, the Pakistani military has carried out at least three airstrikes in eastern Afghanistan, the most significant occurring in December 2024, when jets targeted suspected Pakistani militant hideouts in Paktika province.
In parallel, Islamabad has sought to exert economic and demographic pressure. Since September 2023, it has expelled over one million undocumented Afghans, imposed a strict visa regime at the previously open Chaman border crossing, and tightened Afghan transit trade. These measures, which drew condemnation from UN agencies and human rights organisations, have disrupted bilateral trade and restricted Afghanistan’s access to essential imports.
While Pakistan’s Interior Ministry defended the expulsions as a “sovereign right to regulate illegal foreign nationals”, the timing suggested a calculated move to increase pressure on Kabul.
IS PAKISTAN’S AFGHAN POLICY A FAILURE?
“Whether it was the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 or the US-led intervention in 2001, Pakistan could not remain neutral,” a senior military official remarks when asked if the country’s Afghan policy has failed, as many critics contend. “Our geographic location has never afforded us the luxury of detachment. Proximity to conflict zones involving global powers has historically required us to take sides, always to safeguard national interests,” he adds.
Pakistan’s longstanding policy toward Afghanistan has been a subject of intense debate, often viewed by critics as a series of miscalculations. Yet, officials in Islamabad defend their approach as a necessary response to a complex geopolitical landscape, driven by the country’s unique geographic position. The Taliban’s refusal to act against anti-Pakistan militants now exposes the limits of Islamabad’s longstanding reliance on non-state actors.
From arming the Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet Union in the 1980s to supporting the Taliban’s rise in 1996, and even after its ouster in 2001, Pakistan has often viewed Afghanistan less as a sovereign neighbour and more as “strategic depth.” Critics contend this policy has produced severe blowback, fuelling militancy, straining border relations and deepening Pakistan’s diplomatic isolation.
Today, after four years of the Taliban’s rule, Pakistan is attempting a delicate balancing act. While it extended swift recognition to the Taliban regime in 1996, its response to the Taliban’s return in August 2021 has been far more cautious. Islamabad has not formally recognised the new government but has granted it de facto recognition, allowing ambassadorial work to continue. This measured approach reflects lessons learned from the international censure that followed its early recognition in the 1990s.
Islamabad is now advocating for an “inclusive” political settlement in Afghanistan, a position it shares with other regional powers such as China, Russia and Iran. This stance, which emphasises incorporating diverse ethnic and political factions, marks a strategic shift away from an over-reliance on any single group, such as the Taliban, and highlights Pakistan’s effort to align its policy with international consensus.
The future of Pakistan’s Afghan policy hinges on whether this new approach can navigate the intricate dynamics of internal security, regional rivalries and the push for international legitimacy.
A TASTE OF RESOLVE
The resurgence of militant groups such as the TTP and Baloch separatists has emerged as Pakistan’s most pressing security challenge in years. The threat is no longer confined to the country’s peripheries, but is steadily encroaching inland.
In Punjab’s Bhakkar district, authorities have warned government employees to avoid neighbouring areas of KP, amid credible kidnapping threats. In Balochistan, the suspension of internet services until August 31 underscores the severity of the separatist threat and the daily disruption it inflicts on residents.
Four years of the Taliban’s rule in Afghanistan have not led to regional stability but have instead fuelled a complex web of security, political and economic challenges for Pakistan. A stark and uncomfortable comparison arises: while the Taliban, with limited resources, has managed to maintain internal control and weaken ISKP, Pakistan, despite its vast and sophisticated security infrastructure, continues to struggle with resurgent militancy.
This disparity compels an honest and critical reassessment of Pakistan’s security doctrine. The question is whether the tools and strategies that served Pakistan for decades are still effective against a fundamentally changed, more fragmented and more complex threat.
With violence escalating in KP, Islamabad may soon be forced to abandon limited, intelligence-led crackdowns in favour of sustained, large-scale military campaigns. For many, ongoing peace talks between local jirgas and the TTP serve a dual purpose: proving that all peaceful avenues have been exhausted and building public support for stronger action.
Yet, success will not be measured by force alone. Rebuilding public trust, demonstrating decisive gains and avoiding the cycles of the past will be critical. The path Pakistan chooses in the coming months will not only determine the fate of this insurgent wave. It will shape the country’s security trajectory for years to come.

Guan Jing

GILGIT: The body of Chinese mountaineer Guan Jing, who died on Aug 12 after being hit by falling rocks while descending from the K2 peak, has been recovered and brought to the mortuary in Skardu.
The incident occurred on the Abruzzi Spur route between Camp-I and the Advanced Base Camp — a section notorious for frequent rockfalls. Guan had successfully reached the summit on Aug 11 with a group of climbers before beginning her descent.
According to Karrar Haidri, senior vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the Chinese climber died of a head injury caused by falling rocks. The evacuation was carried out by Army Aviation, which transported the body by helicopter from Concordia.
Earlier, a team of mountaineers had attempted the recovery on foot after poor weather had grounded helicopter operations. Guan Jing died on Aug 12, a day after summiting K2 with her group in Gilgit-Baltistan.
Her body was later found 100-150 metres above the Advanced Base Camp, at an altitude of around 5,400 metres. At 8,611 meters, K2 is considered one of the world’s most dangerous and technically challenging mountains, with a fatality rate far higher than that of Mount Everest.
Mr Haidri extended his deepest condolences to Guan Jing’s family, friends and the international mountaineering community, calling her loss “deeply tragic”.

Addressing a jirga at Gopalum Khall here on Saturday, leaders from various political parties, including ANP, JI and PPP, said both militants and the military should stay away from their area, adding that residents would not migrate under any circumstances.
Addressing the jirga, elders including ANP Lower Dir general secretary Malik Muhammad Zaib Khan, Malik Aftab Khan, JI’s Malik Faramosh Khan, PPP’s Talimand Syed, Inayat, Habibur Rehman, Malik Alam Zaib, Malik Hayat Khan, Malik Zahir Khaliq and others recalled that during 2008-09, the people of Khall had resisted militants’ entry, as a result the region remained peaceful.
The elders said ensuring peace was the responsibility of the state, but its reluctance to take decisive action against a handful of militants had raised doubts.

They warned the government not to shed Pashtun blood for “foreign interests” and demanded the return of weapons earlier taken from local tribes, so they could defend themselves.
The jirga participants pledged cooperation with police in maintaining order but said if the situation worsened, they would call in the army.
FAREWELL PARTY: A farewell ceremony was held at the Dir Scouts Fort in Balambat for outgoing commandant Brigadier Sanaullah.
Political leaders from Upper and Lower Dir, peace jirga members, and the newly-appointed commandant Colonel Arsalan attended the party.
Speaking on the occasion, the tribal and political elders lauded Brigadier Sanaullah’s efforts for peace and extended him the best wishes.
In his address, the outgoing commandant said the support of local elders had been crucial in maintaining stability in both the districts.
He said during his two-year tenure he worked to strengthen coordination between the public and security forces, ensuring unity against anti-state elements.
Brigadier Sanaullah noted that several disputes were resolved through jirgas to promote harmony, adding that the people of Dir were patriotic, brave and had always supported the forces in difficult times.
He urged the political and community elders to remain united for peace, development and prosperity and to extend full support to state institutions against militants.

Roads and bridges were swept away, thousands — including tourists — remained stranded at multiple locations, and electricity, mobile, and internet communication were disrupted in the region.
Cloudburst-triggered flash floods hit multiple areas, adding to the misery of local communities.
According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), a nine-year-old boy, Zulqarnain Haider, tragically lost his life in a landslide while returning from the summer pasture to his village, Hanochal in Haramosh Valley of Gilgit, on Saturday.
Addressing a press briefing, GB Home Minister Shams Lone said that the Baltistan Highway bridge had been swept away, cutting off four districts of Baltistan from Gilgit for a second consecutive day.

Since Friday, at least 35 people have lost their lives, many more have been injured, and four people remain missing. “So far, 318 houses have been completely destroyed, and 674 have been partially damaged,” Lone said, adding that the GB government lacked the resources to cope with the massive devastation. However, he noted that army troops were conducting relief operations.
 
 

A portion of the Naltar Highway was swept away, leaving a large number of tourists stranded. The flash floods in Naltar also damaged three hydropower generation stations, suspending electricity supply to Gilgit. Residents are also facing a shortage of drinking water.
In Datuchi, Bagrot Valley, a bridge and nearly half a dozen houses were damaged, while in Ghanche district, flash floods destroyed three key bridges, cutting off several villages. Dozens of houses were damaged, and 67 families in Haldi village were shifted to tents.
River erosion in the Guru Jaglot area of Gilgit damaged several homes, with floodwaters entering many houses. In Haton village, flash floods destroyed three homes, private infrastructure, crops, and agricultural land. Thousands of residents in Ghizer district also remained cut off from other areas.
The Karakoram Highway (KKH) at Gulmit has remained closed for several days, disconnecting residents of Gojal and severing the Pakistan-China road link.
NDMA issues alert
Meanwhile, the National Disaster Ma­­nag­ement Authority (NDMA) has issued an alert warning of possible glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs), heavy rain, and landslides in the northern areas until September 7.
The NDMA also advised tourists to avoid travelling to affected regions and not to cross rivers or streams.
GB has been experiencing an unusual heatwave since June, resulting in unprecedented glacier melting. Temperatures have risen by 48pc above normal, which has been the main cause of the recent disaster.

Speaking to Dawn before leaving for Buner, activists of welfare organisations said that the people in their neighbouring district were in dire need of foodstuff and drinking water after flash floods swept away their houses and crops and badly damaged road infrastructure.
Al-Khidmat Foundation, Swabi, president Wajid Ali Shah said that they had sent medicines worth Rs1 million along with five doctors and 15 paramedical staff to Buner.
“Similarly, on our request five trucks containing dry foodstuffs have reached Buner from our Rawalpindi wing and 15 ambulances of medicines and paramedical staff have also commenced their duty in the affected areas,” Mr Ali said.
“We have also planned to dispatch more foodstuff, tents and medicines to Buner by Saturday evening,” he said. “Right now, we are focused on three areas, including medicines, foodstuffs and tents. These things are badly required in Buner.”
Similarly, Bahrul Amin, president of Sitara Welfare Organisation, Maneri Bala, said that they have collected sugar, rice, drinking water, and about Rs0.2 million cash, which would be distributed among the affected people.
“We have just informed our United Arabs Emirates wing, which will soon send donations. Another team would be dispatched soon to Buner,” he said. “We have decided to go to Pir Baba area, which is worst-hit by the calamity.”
In addition, Al-Salfiya Welfare Organisation, Pabini, members said that they had started collecting donations for the flood-hit people of Buner, while concentrating on medicines and foodstuffs.
Ready-made food and rations are needed for the homeless people, they said.
Various other welfare bodies were seen in action to help people of Buner district.

Following reports of possible rise in the water levels of river Sutlej as India could release water into the river, the district administrations of Vehari and Lodhran swung into action. Field staff have been alerted and relief camps are being set up in riverian areas of the districts.
According to an official handout issued on Saturday, Lodhran Deputy Commissioner Dr Lubna Nazir visited flood relief and monitoring camps at Basti Jagear Horan, Zamindara Bund Adam Wahan and Jhoke Janan.
She told the media that the district administration was alert and relief camps had been established at the government school buildings. She said that the population around the camps had been told to immediately shift to the relief camps in case of an emergency.

She said the camps were equipped with necessary medicines and foodstuff. The revenue field staff was deputed to supervise the distribution process if need arose, she added.
She said the Rescue 1122 had ample life-saving equipment, including boats and the district administration had also set up a flood emergency control center. The DC inspected the relief camps and checked the stocks of medicines and other material. She also directed to immediately remove encroachments along the banks of the river.
On the occasion, the district heads of Rescue 1122, irrigation, revenue, health and livestock departments gave a detailed briefing to the DC regarding the arrangements.
In Vehari district, flood relief camps had been set up near village Lakha Suldera. DC Imrana Tauqeer visited the camps along with Vehari Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) revenue Babar Suleman and reviewed the arrangements.
She directed the officials of Rescue 1122, irrigation, health, food and livestock departments to stay alert to deal with any emergency situation.
The ADC also asked the officials to alert the adjacent population and be ready to move to the relief camps along with their cattle in case of an emergency.
He asked the officials of health and livestock departments to ensure that ample stock of medicine were available at the camps. The food department was also directed to ensure adequate stock of edibles was available.

“Can a governor be engaged in politics? The governor should not carry any political party’s flag. He should raise the slogan of Pakistan Zindabad, not represent any party,” he said while talking to the media after laying the foundation stone of several development projects in district Korangi.
In a thinly veiled comment on Mr Tessori’s recent statement in which he talked about the comeback of “bhai” and revival of “old MQM”, the mayor said: “Perhaps he thinks of himself as ‘Bhai’.”
As the office of the president and provincial governors are apolitical, the mayor called on the prime minister to take immediate notice of the matter.

Mr Wahab said that public convenience and urban development were his top priorities.
“Today’s Karachi is transforming under the leadership of Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and the people are expressing full confidence in the Pakistan Peoples Party,” he said. “We are serving without discrimination or bias. We don’t care which UC belongs to whom; if there are Karachiites living there, then Bilawal Bhutto’s party will certainly deliver services. We see serving the people of Korangi as an opportunity and are passionate about it,” he added.
Mayor Wahab highlighted that after 22 years, an improvement was finally made to Karachi’s water infrastructure with the completion of the new Hub Canal. “This revolutionary step is a slap in the face of those who only made promises.”
He added that the K-IV project has already been inaugurated five times by five different prime ministers and leaders, but no real progress was made. “Now, your jiyala mayor and deputy mayor have completed the new Hub Canal, which is improving water supply for citizens. We’ve also begun work on the parts of the K-IV project assigned to our government.”
He also mentioned that a center for special children has been established in Korangi by the PPP, where free medical treatment, education, and training are provided.
With the support of the Sindh chief minister and the health minister, a Child Health Center has also been set up in the district, fully equipped by the PPP government, he said.

• Urges all Pakistanis to extend a helping hand to distressed families
• Condemns Sindh governor’s remarks as ‘attack on democracy’
ISLAMABAD: The PTI has decided to postpone its political activities nationwide in the wake of catastrophic flooding and natural disasters across the country’s northern regions and directed its leaders and workers to join relief and rescue operations.
In a statement on Saturday, the PTI Central Media Department expressed “deep grief and heartfelt condolences over the tragic loss of lives” and announced it would stand “in complete solidarity with the bereaved families”.
The move follows recent devastating floods in Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“The PTI immediately put on hold all political activities and directed its leaders and workers to wholeheartedly step forward at this critical time to assist their fellow countrymen, ensuring that every possible relief reaches the affected people to help mitigate their sufferings in this trying period,” the statement read.
It also said the recent spell of torrential rains and flash floods wreaked havoc, “claiming hundreds of precious lives, displacing countless families, and causing widespread devastation”.
The leadership urged members to set aside political engagements and mobilise resources for relief efforts, while appealing to the nation for a helping hand and generous support to share in the suffering of their fellow citizens.
 
 

“In this challenging time, PTI reaffirms its commitment to serving the people and will continue to support all efforts aimed at mitigating the crisis,” the statement concluded. “We pray for the safety and recovery of all affected communities and urge collective action to overcome this calamity”.
Earlier, on Aug 5, the party had called for protest rallies on Aug 14 but later cancelled them. But despite cancellation a number of its workers were arrested.
Reaction over Tessori’s remarks
Separately, PTI has strongly condemned remarks by Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, alleging his comments were a “direct attack on democracy” and a grave insult to the people of Karachi.
A PTI spokesperson said Mr Tessori’s recent remarks undermine the democratic process. He cited a comment from the governor, “Go ahead, vote again — what happened the last time?” as evidence.
He said such statements suggest elections are meaningless and that decisions are made by powerful and unelected quarters.
He stated that Tessori also asked people if they wanted the old MQM back, which he called “a clear reference to the return of Altaf Hussain’s style of politics, long associated with violence, fear, and extortion in Karachi”. He alleged the remarks exposed the MQM’s democratic posturing as a facade.
“Tessori’s comments are part of a dangerous attempt to disillusion the public and erode their faith in the power of the vote,” the spokesperson added. “They are being used to justify the blatant rigging witnessed in the 2024 general elections.”

• Punjab PDMA issues ‘red alert’ for multiple districts
• Tarbela Dam is 98pc full; India releases more water
RAWALPINDI/LAHORE: The authorities have been asked to remain on their toes amid a fresh spell of monsoon rains, set to start from today till the 21st, which will cause torrential downpours across the country along with thunder and windstorms.
The new spell coincides with a warning of heavy flooding in Punjab’s rivers due to an increase in water level on the back of the heavy monsoon rains and glacial melt in the northern parts of the country, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where over 200 people had died in a single day due to flash floods.
The Pakistan Meteorological Depart­m­ent (PMD) said widespread rain-wind/thu­­ndershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is expected in Kash­mir (Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Ra­­walakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Have­­li, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur) and Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, Shigar) from August 17 to 19 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, widespread rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is ex­­p­e­cted in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Sha­ngla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan from August 17 to 19.
 
 

In Punjab, widespread rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls, at times very heavy) is expected in Islam­abad/Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Atto­­ck, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazir­ab­­ad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad and Sahiwal from Au­­g­­ust 17 to 19 with occasional gaps. Scat­tered rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is also likely in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan, Ba­­­­hawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rajanpur, and Rahimyar Khan from August 18 to 20.
In Sindh, rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is expected in Mithi, Tharparker, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Sha­heed Benazirabad, Karachi, Thatta, Bad­in, Sajawal, Tando Allayar, Tando Muh­a­mmad Khan, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad from August 17 to 22 with occasional gaps.
In Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qilla Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur from August 17 to 21.
The PMD said the downpour may generate flash floods in local nullahs and streams in different parts of KP, Punjab, and Kashmir from August 17 to 19, while flash floods in the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and eastern parts of Baloch­istan from August 18 to 21 are also likely.
Urban centres, including Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar, and Gujranwala, may experience urban flooding from August 17 to 19, it said, adding that several cities in Sindh, including Karachi and Hyderabad, may experience the same from August 17 to 22 with occasional gaps. During the forecast period, landslides and mudslides may cause road closures in the hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Galiyat, and Kashmir.
Punjab floods warning
On the other hand, Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued red alerts for multiple districts and warned about heavy flooding in the coming days due to an increase in water levels in reservoirs and rivers.
The Indus River is swelling to medium levels at Kalabagh and Chashma Barrage, while low-level flooding is ongoing at Tar­bela and Taunsa Barrage. Sutlej River is experiencing low-level flooding at Ganda Singh Wala, with a water flow of 68,000 cusecs. Jhelum River is flowing normal at key points and adjoining streams. Chenab River’s flow is normal at key points, while low-level flooding persists in Nullah Palkho (Cantonment). Ravi River’s flow is normal at key points, while low-level flooding continues in Nullah Basantar.
Tarbela Dam is 98 per cent full while Mangla Dam is 68pc full. India’s water releases, meanwhile, have increased to 50,000 cusecs.
The PDMA urged citizens, especially those living near riverbanks, to immediately move to safer locations, cooperate with the authorities concerned in case of emergency evacuations, and refrain from recreational activities near the rivers during flood conditions.
The PDMA also warned of heavy rainfall in most districts of Punjab, particularly the northern districts facing risks of torrential rains and cloudbursts. The seventh spell of monsoon rains is relatively stronger, with forecasts of severe downpours, it added.

Sanghar SSP Abid Ali Baloch told Dawn that the police received information about the presence of the body inside the car and rushed to the spot. The body was found in the driving seat, with a gunshot wound in the head, he said. The police also found a pistol in his hand, he added.
Police moved the body to hospital and started an investigation. He said Mr Husain’s family hailed from Sanghar. As his parents and other family members live in the US, the purpose of his visit from Karachi was being ascertained, the SSP said.
Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the unnatural death and sought a report from the police chief, with the direction that the investigation be handed over to the best police officer.
Director News and Current Affairs of the channel said they were waiting for police investigations to complete before commenting on the issue.

“Netanyahu is now a problem in himself,” Frederiksen said in an interview with the Jyllands-Posten daily, adding that the Israeli government was going “too far”. She also criticised Israel over plans to build a new settlement in the occupied West Bank.
She described the humanitarian situation in Gaza as absolutely appalling and catastrophic.
Frederiksen added that she wa­­nted to consider “political pressure, sanctions, whether against settlers, ministers, or even Israel as a whole”, referring to trade or research sanctions.

Israeli strikes kill 39 more in Gaza City

“We are not ruling anything out in advance. Just as with Russia, we are designing the sanctions to target where we believe they will have the greatest effect,” added Frederiksen, whose country is not among those who  have said they will recognise the Palestinian state.
Israeli fire kills 39 more
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli attacks killed 39 people on Saturday, warning that intensifying strikes on a Gaza City neighbourhood were placing its remaining residents in mortal danger.
 
 

The Israeli forces have killed at least 61,827 people and wounded 155,275 since October 2023.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said conditions in the Zeitun neighbourhood were rapidly deteriorating, with residents having little to no access to food and water amid heavy Israeli bombardment.
Bassal said Israel was carrying out “ethnic cleansing” in Zeitun.
He said about 50,000 people are estimated to be in that area of Gaza City, “the majority of whom are without food or water” and lacking “the basic necessities of life”.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s cabinet approved plans to seize Gaza City, one of the most densely populated parts of the territory which has been devastated by more than 22 months of bombardment.

The study titled “Bangladeshi and Pakistani Women in Good Work” warns that women from these communities are disproportionately excluded from meaningful employment due to discrimination, structural inequalities and inflexible workplaces.
The numbers paint a dismal picture. In 2022, almost half of Pakistani and Bangladeshi women in London (48.1pc) were economically inactive, compared to just 15.3pc of men from the same background. Their unemployment rate stood at 16.9pc, which is more than three times higher than men’s 5.5pc. The most alarming is the gender pay gap: Pakistani women in London earn on average 60pc less than men, the widest disparity of any ethnic group.
Calling the findings “shocking”, London’s Deputy Mayor for Communities and Social Justice Dr Debbie Weekes-Bernard, said: “It is unacceptable that experienced Pakistani and Bangladeshi women are still being passed over for promotions, or feel compelled to change their names to secure interviews. These stories reveal the resilience of these women, but also the urgency of dismantling the barriers that hold them back.”

Greater London Authority study explores causes of high unemployment rate, gender gap

The report draws on interviews with 32 women who spoke about their frustration but also determination.
 
 

One solicitor described the financial hurdles she faced trying to qualify: “Now the LPC [legal practice course] costs £14,000. I was saving really hard to finance it. When I explained my dad’s a taxi driver, they just looked at me blankly. For others it was easy — their parents could just pay,” said one account who identified herself as Khadeja, a British Pakistani who is 30-35 years old.
Others spoke of being overlooked at work despite clear capability. “Last year, there was a position that came up… They didn’t give it to my colleague, who had over 10 years of experience. Instead, they gave it to a White woman who couldn’t manage the team. My Bengali colleague still does everything,” said Farzana, a British Bangladeshi community worker.
Amna, a Pakistani teacher who moved to London two years ago, recounted: “I went for an interview and they told me my accent would confuse students. They said our accents were not matching.”
Another barrier is discrimination tied to visibly Muslim identities. “Many times when we wear hijab, they treat us differently, like can she really work? Can she even speak?” said Mahmuda, a Bangladeshi volunteer, whose words mirror the experiences of many Pakistani women.
Balancing family responsibilities with careers also weighs heavily. Affordable childcare emerged as a key demand. “If I put my children into childcare so I could do a longer workday, most of my pay would go towards it. It’s not feasible,” said Zayna, a British Bangladeshi administrator.
Despite these obstacles, many women displayed resilience. One Pakistani policy manager, Anisa, said she only got her start through a diversity internship: “Otherwise, I wouldn’t really be here. The field is very White and very elite.”
The report calls for urgent reforms such as blind recruitment, recognition of overseas qualifications, affordable childcare as well as targeted progression schemes for Pakistani and Bangladeshi women.
“Economic growth and reducing inequality must go hand in hand, so no community is left behind,” Dr Weekes-Bernard emphasised. “Business leaders, local authorities and City Hall must redouble efforts to build inclusive workplaces that reflect London’s diversity.”
The testimonies of Pakistani women reveal the depth of the challenges.
As one participant summed up: “We are qualified, we are capable, but we are invisible in the higher positions. It feels like the glass ceiling is even thicker for us.”

According to a notification issued by the IHC additional registrar (judicial), the bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan has been assigned exclusively to decide matters related to the “Commercial Litigation Corridor” (CLC).
It “will adjudicate references filed under the Income Tax Ordinance, Sales Tax Act, Federal Excise Act and Customs Act,” according to the notification.
Sources said the two judges will not hold single benches until a backlog of around 2,000 CLC cases is cleared. In the meantime, petitions on their individual dockets will be taken up by other available benches.
The decision was taken by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar under the IHC Practice and Procedure Rules 2025 (Volume-V), in line with the directives issued by the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC) in its 53rd meeting on July 11 this year.

Justices Babar Sattar, Ejaz Ishaq Khan limited to tax matters only

According to the notification, a specialised company bench comprising Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz will hear matters under Section 5(4) of the Companies
Act 2017, as well as cases under Section 8(B) of the Corporate Restructuring Companies (Amendment) Act 2021, and the SECP Act 1997.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir has been designated as a single-judge bench to hear cases relating to educational institutions, including medical colleges.
In addition, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jehangiri and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz will take up cases under the Financial Institution (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance 2001, exercising the court’s original civil jurisdiction, as well as civil suits under the Privatisation Commission (Amendment) Act 2020. This order supersedes Office Order No. F. (126)GenI/IHC/152 dated July 18, 2025.
The four notifications (Nos 32, 33, 34 and 35 dated Aug 13, 2025) will be published in Part-III of the Gazette of Pakistan and circulated among relevant stakeholders, including bar councils, government departments and registrars.
Legal experts said that with this development, IHC’s senior judges, including those who had challenged the transfer and subsequent seniority of the incumbent chief justice, would now be occupied with clearing the years-long backlog of financial cases.

The satellite was laun­ch­­ed from China’s Xich­ang lau­­nch centre on July 31.
The satellite has established stable communication links with ground stations and started acquiring high-resolution images for sending them to the ground.
This will make data available for various sectors of national life.
The satellite has high-quality imaging capabilities that will revolutionise urban planning and infrastructure development. It will also help monitor urban sprawl and development trends.
It will strengthen the na­­tural disaster prevention sys­­tem and enable rapid response by providing tim­ely data that could alert authorities to possibility of floods, landslides, earthquakes and other disasters.
The satellite will also play a role in environmental protection, such as monitoring melting of glaciers and deforestation.
According to experts, it will help boost agricultural production.
The satellite is expected to play a key role in execution of development projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor, mapping transport networks, identifying geo-hazards and enabling the effective use of natural resources.
