The latest threat came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week.
Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, which he subsequently extended to 15.
Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump answered: “The most I can say — I am considering it.”
After the talks in Geneva, Tehran said the two sides had agreed to submit drafts of a potential agreement, which Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told US media would be the “next step”.
“I believe that in the next two, three days, that would be ready, and after final confirmation by my superiors, that would be handed over to Steve Witkoff,” he said, referring to Trump’s main Middle East negotiator.
Araghchi also said US negotiators had not requested that Tehran end its nuclear enrichment programme, contradicting statements from American officials.
“We have not offered any suspension, and the US side has not asked for zero enrichment,” he said in an interview released Friday by US TV network MS NOW.
“What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran’s nuclear programme, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever,” he added.
His comments stand in contrast to information relayed by high-ranking US officials, including Trump, who has repeatedly said Iran must not be allowed to enrich uranium at any level.
Western countries accuse the Islamic republic of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes.
Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy.
Economic hardships sparked protests in December that evolved into a nationwide anti-government movement last month, prompting a crackdown from authorities.
‘No ultimatum’
The two foes held an initial round of discussions on February 6 in Oman, the first since previous talks collapsed during the 12-day Iran-Israel war last June, which the US joined by striking Iranian nuclear facilities.
Washington has pursued a major military build-up in the region in tandem with the talks, and both sides have traded threats of military action for weeks.
On Thursday, Trump again suggested the US would attack Iran if it did not make a deal within the timeframe he laid out.
“We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen,” Trump told the inaugural meeting of the “Board of Peace”, his initiative for the post-war Gaza Strip.
Iran’s ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be “legitimate targets” if the United States followed through on its threats.
Araghchi, however, insisted that “there is no ultimatum”.
“We only talk with each other how we can have a fast deal. And a fast deal is something that both sides are interested about,” he said.
“We are under sanctions, (so) obviously any day that sanctions are terminated sooner it would be better for us,” he said, adding Iran had “no reason to delay”.
Washington has repeatedly called for zero enrichment, but has also sought to address Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its alleged support for militant groups in the region — issues which Israel has pushed to include in the talks.
The Israeli army said on Friday that it was on “defensive alert” regarding the situation with Iran, but that its guidelines for the public remained unchanged.
Ratcheting up the pressure, Trump has deployed a significant naval force to the region.
After sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and escort battleships to the Gulf in January, he ordered a second carrier, the Gerald Ford, to depart for the Middle East.
Iranian naval forces also conducted military drills this week in the Gulf and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz in their own show of force.</p><small>2026-02-20 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20201615d21144e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974599/us-supreme-court-rejects-trumps-global-tariffs' target='_blank'><strong>US Supreme Court rejects Trump’s global tariffs</strong></a><br><p>The US Supreme Court struck down on Friday President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs that he pursued under a law meant for use in national emergencies, rejecting one of his most contentious assertions of his authority in a ruling with major implications for the global economy.
The justices, in a 6-3 ruling, upheld a lower court’s decision that the Republican president’s use of this 1977 law exceeded his authority. The Supreme Court reached its conclusion in a legal challenge by businesses affected by the tariffs and 12 US states, most of them Democratic-governed, against Trump’s unprecedented use of this law to unilaterally impose the import taxes.
Trump has leveraged tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a key economic and foreign policy tool.
They have been central to a global trade war that Trump initiated after he began his second term as president, one that has alienated trading partners, affected financial markets and caused global economic uncertainty.

 

Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate over the next decade trillions of dollars in revenue for the United States, which possesses the world’s largest economy.
Trump’s administration has not provided tariffs collection data since December 14.
But Penn-Wharton Budget Model economists estimated on Friday that the amount collected in Trump’s tariffs based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act stood at more than $175 billion. And that amount likely would need to be refunded with a Supreme Court ruling against the IEEPA-based tariffs.
The US Constitution grants Congress, not the president, the authority to issue taxes and tariffs. But Trump instead turned to a statutory authority by invoking IEEPA to impose the tariffs on nearly every US trading partner without the approval of Congress.
Trump has imposed some additional tariffs under other laws that are not at issue in this case. Based on government data from October to mid-December, those represent about a third of the revenue from Trump-imposed tariffs.
IEEPA lets a president regulate commerce in a national emergency.
Trump became the first president to use IEEPA to impose tariffs, one of the many ways he has aggressively pushed the boundaries of executive authority since he returned to office in areas as varied as his crackdown on immigration, the firing of federal agency officials, domestic military deployments and military operations overseas.

 

Trump described the tariffs as vital for US economic security, predicting that the country would be defenseless and ruined without them.
Trump, in November, told reporters that without his tariffs “the rest of the world would laugh at us because they’ve used tariffs against us for years and took advantage of us”.
Trump said the United States was abused by other countries, including China, the second-largest economy.
After the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in November, Trump said he would consider alternatives if it ruled against him on tariffs, telling reporters that “we’ll have to develop a ‘game two’ plan”.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and other administration officials said the United States would invoke other legal justifications to retain as many of Trump’s tariffs as possible.
Among others, these include a statutory provision that permits tariffs on imported goods that threaten US national security and another that allows retaliatory actions, including tariffs against trading partners that the Office of the US Trade Representative determines have used unfair trade practices against American exporters.
None of these alternatives offered the flexibility and blunt-force dynamics that IEEPA provided Trump, and may not be able to replicate the full scope of his tariffs in a timely fashion.
Trump’s ability to impose tariffs instantaneously on any trading partner’s goods under the aegis of some form of declared national emergency raised his leverage over other countries.
It brought world leaders scrambling to Washington to secure trade deals that often included pledges of billions of dollars in investments or other offers of enhanced market access for US companies.
But Trump’s use of tariffs as a cudgel in US foreign policy has succeeded in antagonising numerous countries, including those long considered among the closest US allies.
IEEPA historically had been used for imposing sanctions on enemies or freezing their assets, not to impose tariffs. The law does not specifically mention the word tariffs.
Trump’s Justice Department had argued that IEEPA allows tariffs by authorising the president to “regulate” imports to address emergencies.
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that if all current tariffs stay in place, including the IEEPA-based duties, they would generate about $300bn annually over the next decade.
Total US net customs duty receipts reached a record $195bn in fiscal 2025, which ended on September 30, according to US Treasury Department data.
On April 2, on a date Trump labeled “Liberation Day”, the president announced what he called “reciprocal” tariffs on goods imported from most US trading partners, invoking IEEPA to address what he called a national emergency related to US trade deficits, though the United States already had run trade deficits for decades.
In February and March of 2025, Trump invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs on China, Canada and Mexico, citing the trafficking of the often-abused painkiller fentanyl and illicit drugs into the United States as a national emergency.
Trump has wielded his tariffs to extract concessions and renegotiate trade deals, and as a weapon to punish countries that draw his ire on non-trade political matters. These have ranged from Brazil’s prosecution of former president Jair Bolsonaro, India’s purchases of Russian oil that help fund Russia’s war in Ukraine, and an anti-tariffs ad by Canada’s Ontario province.
IEEPA was passed by Congress and signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter. In passing the measure, Congress placed additional limits on the president’s authority compared to a predecessor law.
The cases on tariffs before the justices involved three lawsuits.
The Washington-based US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit sided with five small businesses that import goods in one challenge, and the states of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon and Vermont in another.
Separately, a Washington-based federal judge sided with a family-owned toy company called Learning Resources.</p><small>2026-02-20 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/201945034e74ed2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974598/59-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-parts-of-country-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>5.9-magnitude earthquake jolts parts of country: PMD</strong></a><br><p>A 5.9-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of KP on Friday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said.
The earthquake struck at 6:09pm at a depth of 101 kilometres, with its epicentre located in the Hindu Kush region in Afghanistan, the department said.
According to DawnNewsTV, tremors were felt in Shangla, Swat, Mardan, Swabi and Nowshera.
In Shangla, tremors were felt at the time of Iftar, prompting people to rush out of their homes. No casualties or damages were reported from the district.
Pakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.
Earlier this week, a 5.6-magnitude earthquake was recorded 86km northeast of Balochistan’s Khuzdar.
Last month, an earthquake of magnitude 5.8 jolted parts of Pakistan, including Gilgit-Baltistan, Peshawar and adjacent areas of KP.
The same month, another 5.8-magnitude earthquake jolted parts of the country. Tremors were felt in Islamabad and parts of KP.

The State Department said the US secretary thanked Pakistan for supporting Trump’s Gaza peace plan and for joining the first meeting of the “Board of Peace” as a founding member.
He also offered condolences over the Jan 31 attacks in Balochistan and the Feb 6 bombing in Islamabad and reaffirmed the importance of continued partnership in counter-terrorism.
The talks covered Pakistan’s participation in the recent Critical Minerals Ministerial in Washington, with the United States welcoming Islamabad’s engagement and discussing cooperation in developing Pakistan’s energy and mineral resources, as well as commercial opportunities for American companies.
Separately, as per a press release issued by the Press Information Department (PID), during his meeting with Rubio, the premier congratulated him and US President Donald Trump on the “successful” inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s readiness to “work with the Board of Peace for the implementation of the Gaza peace plan”.
It added that during the meeting, “both sides underscored the importance of Pakistan-US strategic relations and expressed satisfaction over the momentum and positive trajectory of the partnership, under the leadership of President Trump”.
Both leaders also agreed to improve bilateral trade, economic activities, and mutual cooperation in counter-terrorism efforts, it further added.
During the meeting, the premier “emphasised the importance of continued high-level engagement between Pakistan and the US to advance common goals in a rapidly evolving global environment,” the statement said.
Meanwhile, in a post on X, Rubio reiterated his appreciation for Pakistan’s support for the Gaza Peace Plan and for joining the board.
“In our meeting, we discussed the importance of our strategic relationship on critical minerals development and counterterrorism,” he further said.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar responded to Rubio’s post and thanked him. He said Pakistan valued its “longstanding relationship with the United States”.
The foreign minister added that the two diplomats had “meaningful discussions” on advancing peace, cooperation in fighting against terrorism, and expanding bilateral economic and trade ties.
“We look forward to further strengthening our strategic partnership in all areas of shared interest,” said Dar.







Shehbaz stresses need to end ceasefire violations in Gaza
Earlier, addressing the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace — formally established last month after being proposed in September 2025 — Prime Minister Shehbaz stressed the need for an end to ceasefire violations in Gaza, calling it “very important” for achieving durable peace in the war-torn territory.
“The people of Palestine have long endured the illegal occupation and immense suffering. And, to achieve long-lasting peace, it is very important that ceasefire violations must end to preserve life and advance reconstruction efforts,” he said, adding that Palestinians must exercise full control over their land and future in line with UN Security Council resolutions.
Praising Trump’s role, the prime minister said that through his “untiring support and great efforts, long-lasting peace in Gaza will be achieved” and that it would remain his legacy.
Under its charter, the US government serves as the board’s depository and the Donald J Trump Institute of Peace has been designated as its headquarters.
A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November last year authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to help establish an International Stabilisation Force in Gaza following the October ceasefire under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas. The truce, however, has remained fragile with repeated violations.
In his remarks, Prime Minister Shehbaz also credited Trump with defusing the four-day Pakistan-India crisis in May 2025, saying his intervention had “potentially averted the loss of tens of millions of people” and describing him as “a man of peace” and “a saviour of South Asia”.
Speaking before the Pakistani leader, Trump recalled his contacts with both Islamabad and New Delhi during the conflict, saying he had warned the two countries that the United States would halt trade negotiations and could impose 200 per cent tariffs if the fighting continued.
“I called them and said I am not doing trade deals with you two guys if you don’t settle this up,” he said, adding that the threat of economic consequences helped bring about a de-escalation.
Trump also referred to his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, and praised the Pakistani leader for publicly acknowledging his role in stopping the conflict.
The prime minister, in turn, lauded what he called Trump’s “bold diplomacy” and “dynamic leadership” in resolving international crises and bringing calm to global hotspots.
The Washington engagements underscored Pakistan’s effort to expand economic cooperation with the United States — particularly in the energy and minerals sectors — while aligning with a US-led diplomatic initiative on Gaza and highlighting Trump’s mediation role in South Asia.
PM Shehbaz meets global leaders
The prime minister also held informal meetings in Washington with global leaders who had arrived to attend the inaugural session of the Board of Peace, said a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
The premier met with the King of Bahrain Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa, President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev, President of Kazakhstan, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev and President of Indonesia Prabowo Subianto.







The statement added that “important regional and global issues” were discussed during the meeting.
“Pakistan’s participation in the Board of Peace reflects its efforts toward establishing peace in Gaza, reconstruction initiatives, global peace, and the growing success of Pakistan’s diplomatic policy,” said the statement.
Separately, state-run APP reported that he also held a meeting with International Development Finance Corporation Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Black on Friday.







An APP post on social media platform X said PM Shehbaz praised the corporation’s portfolio of over $1 billion and pointed to the synergies between the economic priorities of Pakistan and the US, which “present mutually beneficial opportunities to enhance B2B engagement”.
For his part, Black briefed the prime minister on the agency’s strategic initiatives, priorities and project pipeline in Pakistan, and showed interest in enhancing DFC’s footprint in Pakistan, the post said.</p><small>2026-02-20 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20191524ed1af79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974593/understanding-the-culling-game-jujutsu-kaisens-most-confusing-arc' target='_blank'><strong>Understanding the Culling Game: Jujutsu Kaisen’s most confusing arc</strong></a><br><p>When the Shibuya Arc concluded with Jujutsu Kaisen Season 2 in late 2023, it posed many questions. What did Kenjaku really do? What were his true intentions? What would happen now that thousands of sorcerers were awakened? This article will be a comprehensive guide to all these answers and everything else you need to know before diving into the third and latest season of Jujutsu Kaisen.
By neutralising Gojo Satoru within the prison realm, Kenjaku (or faux Geto) was free to set his master plan into motion — unleashing the age of cursed energy.
Using Mahito’s “Idle Transfiguration” technique, Kenjaku altered two groups of people he had previously marked. The first group rapidly awakened innate cursed techniques and became jujutsu sorcerers, while the second had been fed sealed cursed objects over the years. When Kenjaku released the seals at the end of the Shibuya Arc, these humans’ bodies were permanently overtaken by the ancient entities inhabiting them, essentially reviving elite sorcerers from hundreds of years ago.
Unfortunately for the protagonists, Megumi’s older sister, Tsumiki, was revealed to be among the ones who were marked by Kenjaku. As a result, she, alongside everyone else, was forcibly entered into the “Culling Game”.
What is the Culling Game?
After awakening hundreds of new and old sorcerers across Japan, the next step in Kenjaku’s plan was to enter everyone into the “Culling Game”, a brutal jujutsu battle royale, forcing newly awakened and ancient sorcerers to fight to the death.
By pitting players against one another, Kenjaku aims to unlock their full potential and accelerate their growth in strength. In the jujutsu world, this forced slaughter constitutes one of the most heinous acts of terrorism imaginable.
To ensure his plan proceeds without any sort of external interference or protests, Kenjaku established a strict set of rules governing the game.
The rules of the Culling Game
The Culling Game Arc is notorious for its heavy exposition dumps, much of which stems from the complex mechanics of the game itself.
Kenjaku establishes eight rules in total, starting with a requirement for players to enter one of ten designated arenas within 19 days of their awakening. This effectively ensures no one can dodge the start of the game by any means, as failure to comply will likely lead to death, as stated in the second rule.
The third rule opens the Culling Game to all jujutsu sorcerers, even those who were not recently awakened by Kenjaku. It states that non-players would become players upon entering one of the designated arenas, with their willing entry signalling their pledge to participate in the game.
The fourth rule is what makes this game such a transgression: the game will award players points if they can end the life of another player. However, as rule five states, not all kills will be awarded the same number of points. Instead, the game master reserves the jurisdiction to award whatever value they see fit to someone’s life.
The sixth rule is what Itadori and co. are truly after. It states that once players accumulate 100 points, they can negotiate with the game master to add an additional rule to the game.
The Jujutsu High team aims to enter the game and subsequently exploit this rule to allow Tsumiki and the other innocent people to freely exit the game. However, the seventh rule places certain restrictions on the creation of new rules, stating that the game master can nullify any and all new conditions that directly contradict any of the previous rules or tamper with the continuation of the Culling Game as a whole.
The eighth and final rule is simple but effective in making sure that each and every awakened sorcerer takes part in the games: if a player’s points do not increase by the first 19 days of the game’s commencement, they will likely face death.</p><small>2026-02-20 15:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651995-new-fleet-of-electric-buses-to-hit-islamabad-roads' target='_blank'><strong>New fleet of electric buses to hit Islamabad roads</strong></a><br><p>

In his suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran levelled baseless allegations against him. He sought a decree for the recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for the publication of defamatory content.
The defamation suit said Imran wrongly accused PM Shehbaz of offering Rs10bn to the latter through a common friend in exchange for withdrawing the Panama Papers case.
The PTI founder had contended in his reply that he had disclosed the alleged incident for the consumption of the public at large, and an act in the interest of the public good did not constitute any defamation. He maintained that he did not specifically attribute any statement to the PM Shehbaz while narrating the incident.
A three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Ayesha A Malik and including Justices Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and Ishtiaq Ibrahim, took up a set of review petitions filed by Imran in the case.
The court also issued a notice to the respondent as no one was present on behalf of PM Shehbaz and directed the court office to fix the case for a hearing at the earliest.
Senator Barrister Ali Zafar, who was representing Imran, argued before the SC that his client could not appear before the trial court as he was injured after being shot in the leg, referring to an assassination attempt on the former premier in November 2022.
Zafar said the trial court had closed the right to defend despite previously acknowledging the PTI founder’s injury.
Now, a trial court has commenced recording evidence and testimonies of witnesses in the case, the counsel said.
At that, Justice Malik wondered how the trial court had “terminated the right to defence” after acknowledging that Imran had been injured.
Subsequently, the SC issued a notice to the respondent and directed the court office fix the review petitions for hearing at the earliest.
Imran had filed review petitions in the case after the trial court had close the right to defence — a decision that was upheld by the Lahore High Court (LHC) and endorsed by the SC on February 21, 2023.
The trial court, through its order on October 20, 2022, had dismissed Imran’s objections in the case over the rejection of PM Shehbaz’s interrogatories — a set of written questions served by one party to the other — and directed the PTI founder to submit his answers.
Later, through a subsequent order of November 24, 2022, the trial court struck off the right of defence due to the non-submission of answers to the interrogatories.
Previously, the SC had held in a 2-1 majority judgment in the case that Imran had been “wilfully contumacious and disobedient” throughout the trial court proceedings and that the trial court had not committed any “illegality or material irregularity” in the exercise of its jurisdiction through its orders of closing the right to defend.
The LHC had also rightly declined to interfere in its revisional jurisdiction, former judge Syed Mansoor Ali Shah had observed at the time in the judgement authored by him.
He had made these observations as the court heard an appeal moved by Imran challenging the December 7, 2022 LHC order of upholding the sessions court’s closure of Imran’s right to defend.
Justice Malik, who was also a member of that bench, had dissented from the majority judgement. She had held that in a case plagued by adjournments since 2017, the court must weigh the balance between a fair trial and the legitimate grounds for the request for adjournment.
She had observed that Imran’s public shooting and subsequent injury at a political rally justified the grant of an adjournment for a reasonable time under the circumstances, adding that the right to defence could not be struck off without considering all relevant factors.
Justice Malik had further stated that the trial court’s order sheet showed it had proceeded in a “mechanical manner” and granted numerous adjournments without so much as imposing costs so as to discourage the same.
“No doubt the courts are overburdened with work, and judges are faced with the daunting task of handling a vast number of cases every day; nevertheless, it is the court’s responsibility to manage each case before it diligently by applying the provisions of the procedural law,” she had observed.
She added that the striking off of the petitioner’s right to defence at that stage, while ignoring the legitimate factors in play, would be a “gross injustice”.
The balancing act of justice must be upheld, and under these circumstances, the right to a fair defence must prevail, Justice Malik had observed while setting aside the trial court order and remanding the matter again to the trial court to grant a reasonable opportunity to the petitioner to file answers to the interrogatories.
On the other hand, Justice Shah had observed that Imran’s conduct disentitled him from the indulgence of this court in its discretionary jurisdiction under Article 185(3) of the Constitution.
He added that his appeal was without substance on merits.
He had observed that interrogatories served as a useful tool to shorten litigation and reduce expenses. However, he added that the process of interrogatories had unfortunately been “abused in the present case and, in fact, misused to prolong the trial”.
The former SC judge had said that such “abuse of the process of interrogatories has to be curbed with a heavy hand”.
The fair use of the process of interrogatories should be encouraged, for it would result in saving considerable time and money, and would thus be beneficial to the parties of the case as well as to the administration of justice in general, Justice Shah had observed.</p><small>2026-02-20 14:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20193200938324e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974595/pakistan-to-tour-bangladesh-next-month-for-a-3-match-odi-series' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to tour Bangladesh next month for a 3-match ODI series</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday that the Green Shirts would tour Bangladesh in March for a three-match One Day International (ODI) series.
In a press release, the PCB said, “Pakistan men’s cricket team will tour Bangladesh for a three-match ODI series, the Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed on Friday.”
It said that the team would arrive in Bangladesh on March 9 and hold a training session the next day, ahead of the opening ODI against the hosts on March 11.







The board added that the second ODI would be played on March 13, while the third and final match was scheduled for March 15.
It added that all three matches would be played at the Shere Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka.
“This will be Pakistan’s second tour of Bangladesh since July 2025. Pakistan last toured Bangladesh for a three-match T20I series in July, which the hosts won 2-1. Meanwhile, Bangladesh toured Pakistan for a three-match T20I series in May/June last year, which the Salman Ali Agha-led side won 3-0,” the PCB said.
The development comes after Pakistan announced it would boycott the match against India during the ongoing T20 World Cup. The decision came after Bangladesh’s request to shift its matches out of India was rejected amid tensions between the two countries, which led to the team being replaced by Scotland in the tournament.
The situation ultimately led to a delegation from the International Cricket Council visiting Pakistan, after which it was announced that Pakistan would play the match against India.
However, the ICC also announced that Bangladesh would not face any penalty for opting out of the tournament and would also host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031.</p><small>2026-02-20 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20185025b89313b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974592/pti-assails-pm-shehbaz-for-attending-bop-meeting-reiterates-objection-to-joining-without-consultation' target='_blank'><strong>PTI assails PM Shehbaz for attending BoP meeting, reiterates objection to joining without consultation</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Friday criticised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for attending the inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace, and reiterating its objection to Pakistan joining the board without consultation.
The Board of Peace — formally established last month after being proposed in September 2025 and originally meant to oversee peace in Gaza — held its inaugural meeting on February 19, attended by several world leaders, including PM Shehbaz.
In a statement posted on X, the party said it once again expressed “grave concern over the government of Pakistan’s decision to join the Board of Peace without transparency, parliamentary debate, or consultation with major political stakeholders of the country”.
“Decisions of such international significance must be rooted in constitutional procedure, democratic oversight and national consensus,” it said.







The party maintained that it did not recognise the legitimacy of the present Parliament, formed after the “manipulated 2024 elections”.
“Nevertheless, even this Parliament was bypassed in this decision-making process, further eroding democratic norms and public trust,” it said.
Drawing a contrast with former premier Imran Khan, the party said that he had “been among the most steadfast and vocal supporters of Palestinian rights on the global stage”.
“His position on Palestine has always been clear and uncompromising,” it added. The party said that it stood “firmly with the Palestinian people and categorically rejects any plan imposed without their consent”.
It reiterated its unwavering support for a just and lasting resolution through an independent and sovereign Palestinian state, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and long-standing PTI policy.
It said that Pakistan’s role in global peace initiatives must strengthen the United Nations framework rather than promote “parallel arrangements that weaken international law and accountability”.
“Any initiative that claims to advance peace while excluding the very people under occupation contradicts the fundamental principles of justice and self-determination that PTI has always stood for,” the party said.
It also called into question the credibility of the Board of Peace, saying: “Palestinians remain excluded from the process while Israel continues to be included, even as violence persists in the Gaza Strip and the occupied West Bank.”
The opposition party stressed that “a peace mechanism without Palestinian representation can only be termed as control”.
The party strongly criticised PM Shehbaz for attending the inaugural meeting and for “making statements that compromise Pakistan’s dignity, independent foreign policy and historically principled stance on oppressed peoples”.
The government’s decision to join the board, first announced last month, was criticised by political parties, including the PTI, and analysts. The government had defended the move in Parliament, with PM Shehbaz later saying that Pakistan had joined after the federal cabinet gave the go-ahead.</p><small>2026-02-20 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20184441f5ff12b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974590/punjab-issues-list-of-proscribed-organisations-warns-citizens-against-giving-charity-to-these-entities' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab issues list of proscribed organisations, warns citizens against giving charity to these entities</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab home department on Friday issued a list of 89 proscribed organisations and unregistered charitable institutions, warning citizens that giving charity to these entities would be treated as a crime under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.

“All registered institutions can be verified through the QR code printed on their certificates. Citizens should ensure that their donations reach the rightful beneficiaries rather than terrorists,” he said.

Longstanding political tensions between India and Pakistan have led to the border rivals only playing each other in international cricket events, although their recent Colombo showdown at the ongoing T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka only went ahead after Pakistan called off a boycott.
It has been claimed that politics has also led to an effective ban on Pakistani players participating in the Indian Premier League, world cricket’s most lucrative T20 franchise competition.
And with several IPL owners now owning teams in several different countries, opportunities for Pakistani cricketers to participate in various leagues are in danger of being reduced further.
The BBC has now reported that the issue could be a factor during next month’s player auction for English cricket’s Hundred, a 100 balls-per-side competition featuring eight franchises rather than the traditional 18 first-class counties.
Players will go under the hammer in London on March 11-12, with the BBC reporting that the four Indian-affiliated Hundred teams — Manchester Super Giants, MI London, Southern Brave and Sunrisers Leeds — will deliberately avoid selecting players from Pakistan.
More than 50 Pakistani cricketers have registered their availability, with four other teams involved in the bidding.
The ECB have been unable to substantiate the BBC allegations, but former England captain Vaughan has called for the governing body to investigate the issue thoroughly.
Vaughan, referencing the ECB’s stated aim of cricket becoming the most inclusive sport in the country, posted on Friday on X: “The ECB need to act fast on this … they own the league, and this should not be allowed to happen … The most inclusive sport in the country is not one that allows this to happen.”







An ECB spokesman said: “The Hundred welcomes men’s and women’s players from all over the world and we would expect the eight teams to reflect that.
“Almost 1,000 cricketers from 18 nations have registered for The Hundred auction, with representation on the longlist of over 50 players respectively from Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Pakistan and West Indies.”
Only two Pakistan internationals — Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim — appeared in last year’s Hundred, the final edition before new investors became involved.</p><small>2026-02-20 13:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651989-earthquake-tremors-jolt-parts-of-khyber-pakhtunkhwa' target='_blank'><strong>5.6-magnitude earthquake jolts Islamabad, Pindi, parts of KP</strong></a><br><p>

Soldier Bazaar Station House Officer (SHO) Rizwan Patel confirmed that the owner-cum-builder Mohammed Irshad had been arrested after the registration of a first information report (FIR). He said the held suspect had rented out the building to the victims.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered on the complaint of sub-inspector Khalid Mehmood at the Soldier Bazar police station under sections 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab), 288 (negligent conduct with building), 285 (negligent conduct with respect to fire or combustible matter), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees) and 337-A (punishment of shajjah) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, police received information on early Thursday morning about the collapse of a building in Gul Rana Colony, in which several people were killed and injured.
Upon reaching the spot, the complainant said that one portion of the structure had completely collapsed. He said that the building, spread over 40 square yards, had been constructed using heavy-duty steel channels and nylon sheets. He further said that the building was a ground plus three-storey structure.
The sub-inspector said that a man named Shahid Rasool lived on the first floor with his family. He said that at around 3:30am, Rasool’s wife lit a match to prepare Sehr, adding that the room was already full of gas due to a leakage.
This led to the explosion, which caused the whole building to collapse, he said. The complainant further said that the rescue officials recovered at least 15 dead bodies from the rubble, while 15 others were injured in the incident.
The official stated that the owner of the building had constructed the structure “illegally” in approximately 2007/2008. He said that the gas connection was also provided “illegally through pipes installed in a haphazard and unsafe manner, leading to the unfortunate incident.
According to the FIR, the suspect committed negligence by installing substandard gas lines in an “illegally” constructed building.
The complainant further said that the Bomb Disposal Unit had examined the destroyed building and submitted their report. He said that according to the unit, the gas leakage occurred because of substandard gas pipelines, which led to a gas leak and ultimately triggered an explosion when a match was lit.</p><small>2026-02-20 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651968-pms-scheme-applicants-urged-to-collect-laptops-from-university' target='_blank'><strong>PM's scheme: Applicants urged to collect laptops from universities</strong></a><br><p>

A notification issued by the Punjab School Education Department on February 19, available with Dawn, stated that the new dress code will come into effect from February 23 (Monday).
The department directed all chief executive officers (CEOs) of district education authorities (DEAs) to ensure the implementation of the directives across Punjab.
The notification said that teaching was a profession that commanded respect, authority and moral leadership in society, and the dignity and credibility of teachers was reflected through their “conduct and appearance”.
It stated that a “well-defined dress code” would enhance respect for teachers among students, parents and the community, while also promoting discipline, equality and a focused learning environment within educational institutions.
Under the approved policy, all teachers, irrespective of gender, cadre or geographical location, will be required to wear a black gown during school hours.
The notification said the gown must be worn over modest and decent attire in accordance with cultural, social and ethical norms.
For male teachers, the recommended dress code included shalwar kameez in “plain and sober colours” or pants and a shirt with closed shoes or sandals with straps.
Female teachers were advised to wear a “suitable dress that reflects dignity”, along with closed shoes or modest sandals.
The notification said that the heads of educational institutions would be responsible for ensuring day-to-day compliance, while CEOs at the district level were directed to ensure strict implementation through monitoring mechanisms.
The department termed the matter “most important” and instructed authorities to implement the orders in letter and spirit.
However, the move was criticised by teachers’ representative bodies.
Punjab Teachers Union (PTU) General Secretary Rana Liaqat told Dawn that the environment in many parts of the province was not suitable for wearing gowns during school hours.
He said many educational institutions lacked basic facilities, including sweepers to maintain cleanliness, and questioned how teachers would manage the gowns in such conditions.
He further said that a suitable gown would cost between Rs3,000 and Rs 4,000, adding that one teacher would require at least two gowns.
Liaqat suggested that instead of gowns, the government should direct teachers to wear shalwar kameez with a waistcoat or dress pants with a plain shirt at the primary, middle and high school levels.
He proposed that gowns could instead be made part of the uniform for higher education teachers at colleges and universities.
He said teachers at the primary, middle and high school levels could not financially afford the additional expense and demanded that if the government wanted to enforce the policy, it should provide monthly financial assistance or a stipend for the gowns.
He also pointed out that many schools did not have security guards or designated office space to safely store the gowns, questioning who would be responsible in case they went missing and teachers had to bear the financial loss.</p><small>2026-02-20 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2015353954a3438.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974583/us-negotiating-with-india-on-venezuelan-oil-sale-us-envoy-says' target='_blank'><strong>US negotiating with India on Venezuelan oil sale, US envoy says</strong></a><br><p>The United States is in “active negotiation” over the sale of Venezuelan oil to India, to help India diversify its sources of crude oil, US Envoy Sergio Gor said on Friday.
The US has made diversification away from Russian crude a condition for cutting tariffs on goods imported from India, the world’s third-biggest oil importer and consumer.
“The Department of Energy is speaking to the Ministry of Energy here, and so we’re hoping to have some news of that very soon,” Gor told reporters on the sidelines of an event in New Delhi where India joined the US-led Pax Silica initiative aimed at building a silicon supply chain for high-tech products.
US President Donald Trump this month agreed to cut tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent under an interim trade deal.
He also removed a 25pc punitive levy after India agreed to end the purchase of Russian oil, which the US said helps fund Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
He said India would buy more oil from the US and potentially Venezuela.
A final trade deal with India will be signed “sooner than later” as a “few tweaking points” are required, Gor said, adding Trump has been invited to India by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The interim trade deal is set to become effective in April, and the US is likely to issue a formal notification this month to reduce its tariff on Indian goods to 18pc, India’s trade minister, Piyush Goyal, said on Friday.
The US and allies imposed sanctions on Russia’s energy sector following Russia’s 2022 invasion. India then became the top customer for Russian seaborne crude, which it bought at rock-bottom prices, to the consternation of Western nations.
“On the oil, there’s an agreement … We have seen India diversify on their oil. There is a commitment. This is not about India. The United States doesn’t want anyone buying Russian oil,” Gor said.
The US had pitched the sale of Venezuelan oil to India to help replace Russian oil imports.
It granted licences to trading houses Vitol and Trafigura to market and sell millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil after capturing Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro last month and reaching a supply agreement with interim president Delcy Rodriguez.
State-run Indian Oil Corp, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum, as well as private-sector refiners Reliance Industries and HPCL-Mittal Energy, have ordered Venezuelan oil, Reuters has reported.</p><small>2026-02-20 10:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20145948aca1e3d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974582/policy-efforts-taken-by-pakistan-under-eff-helped-stabilise-economy-rebuild-confidence-imf' target='_blank'><strong>Policy efforts taken by Pakistan under EFF helped ‘stabilise economy, rebuild confidence’: IMF</strong></a><br><p>Policy efforts undertaken by Pakistan under the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF) “helped stabilise the economy and rebuild confidence,” the lending agency’s spokesperson said on Thursday.
IMF Communications Director Julie Kozack made the statement during a weekly press briefing.
In response to a question regarding Pakistan’s progress in meeting terms set by the Fund, Kozack said, “Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF have helped stabilise the economy and rebuild confidence.”
She further said that fiscal performance had been “strong”. Kozack said that Pakistan currently had a primary fiscal surplus of 1.3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), which was “in line with programme targets”.
“Headline inflation has been relatively contained. And Pakistan posted its first current account surplus in 14 years in FY25,” Kozack added.
She also said that an IMF staff team was expected to visit Pakistan starting February 25 for discussions on the third review under the EFF and the second review under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
Kozack also highlighted the IMF’s recent Governance and Corruption Diagnostic report, which she said “includes proposals for reforms, including simplifying tax policy design, levelling the playing field for public procurement, and improving the asset declaration transparency”.
It is worth mentioning that an IMF mission led by Iva Petrova is due to visit Pakistan later this month to review the implementation of the $7 billion EFF and the $1.1bn RSF facilities.
During the almost two-week visit ending March 11, the engagements would be of greater significance as both sides would also discuss budget proposals based on performance this year and set broad contours of the upcoming budget (for the fiscal year 2026-27), particularly those relating to provincial finances.
The programme’s performance as of end-Dece­mber 2025 — the period for review — has mostly been up to the mark, alb­eit with a revenue shortfall, which authorities bel­i­eve could be reduced following a recent super tax ruling by the Federal Cons­t­ituti­onal Court that went in the government’s favour.
Upon the successful completion of the review, Pakistan will be eligible for the disbursement of about $1bn (760 million Special Drawing Rights) under the EFF and another $200m under the RSF by the end of April.
The EFF is a longer-term IMF loan programme designed to help countries address deep-seated economic weaknesses and medium-term balance-of-payments problems.</p><small>2026-02-20 10:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/201445500680854.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974580/ppps-raza-rabbani-calls-for-placing-pact-with-us-for-redeveloping-roosevelt-hotel-before-parliament' target='_blank'><strong>PPP’s Raza Rabbani calls for placing pact with US for redeveloping Roosevelt Hotel before Parliament</strong></a><br><p>PPP stalwart and former Senate chairman Raza Rabbani on Friday said that the deal inked with the United States to redevelop the Roosevelt Hotel in New York “must be placed” in Parliament.
In a press release, Rabbani said, “The strategic economic initiative, including collaboration with the US General Services Administration, regarding the operation, maintenance, renovation and redevelopment of the Roosevelt Hotel has been signed without taking the people into confidence.”
Rabbani said the hotel was “prime property” in New York and dealings pertaining to it must be transparent.
“Parliament should have been taken into confidence before signing such memoranda of understanding (MoUs),” he said.
He further highlighted that earlier, a deal with the US relating to minerals in Balochistan was “broken by international media”.
“Till date, the details of this deal have not been made public,” he said. Rabbani further said that the PPP should move a private members’ bill, wherein all foreign agreements, once signed, would need ratification in Parliament.
“I had moved such a bill when in the Senate,” he said.
The remarks come a day after Pakistan and the US signed an MoU to launch a structured framework for cooperation on the future of the Roosevelt Hotel in New York, marking a key development in Islamabad’s efforts to secure maximum value for the landmark property under its privatisation strategy.
According to the finance ministry, the agreement was finalised in Washington and executed by US General Services Administration (GSA) Administrator Edward C. Forst and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff witnessed the signing.
“It establishes a structured, time-bound framework for joint evaluation of the technical, commercial, and economic parameters of cooperation, reflecting a shared commitment to transparent, disciplined, and mutually beneficial progress,” the ministry said.







The statement noted the Roosevelt Hotel’s prime location in Manhattan and the complexity of New York zoning and municipal process, saying the “institutional coordination aims to reduce execution risk, enhance regulatory clarity, and maximise transaction value”.
“Such facilitative frameworks are consistent with international practice in cross-border real estate and infrastructure projects,” it added.
“The objective remains to secure maximum value for this property in alignment with the government’s privatisation strategy while strengthening Pakistan-United States economic ties,” the statement concluded.
Named after former US president Theodore Roosevelt, the century-old property in midtown Manhattan is seen as one of Pakistan’s most valuable foreign assets, which it acquired in 2000. Faced with mounting losses, the over 1,000-room hotel was shut in 2020, and has also operated briefly as a migrant shelter.
The hotel is located near marquee New York destinations such as Grand Central Terminal, Times Square, and Fifth Avenue, placing it in one of Manhattan’s most valuable commercial zones.</p><small>2026-02-20 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/20153716651eaff.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974579/interim-phf-president-lifts-ban-on-hockey-team-captain-amid-pro-league-controversy' target='_blank'><strong>Interim PHF president lifts ban on hockey team captain amid Pro League controversy</strong></a><br><p>The newly appointed interim president of the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani, announced the lifting of the ban on the national team captain, Ammad Shakeel Butt, state-run APP reported on Friday.
On Thursday, former president Tariq Hussain Bugti imposed a two-year ban on national captain Butt, citing findings of a committee regarding alleged misconduct. He also announced his resignation amid controversy over the national team’s tour of Australia for the FIH Pro League.
In a statement issued today, the interim president lifted the ban, stressing that “transparency and fairness would guide all decisions under his tenure,” APP quoted him as saying.
Wani, who was the Secretary of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC), also vowed to “revive and strengthen the country’s national game”.
He gave assurances to the stakeholders that a comprehensive plan would be developed, “aimed at stabilising the federation, rebuilding trust and revamping team management to restore Pakistan’s lost glory in international hockey”.
“As the newly appointed ad-hoc president of PHF, I assure stakeholders of our commitment to revive and strengthen hockey in Pakistan,” APP quoted him as saying.
He added that “immediate steps” were underway to resolve “organisational and administrative issues”.
Wani elaborated that the “short-term” focus of the federation would be to stabilise its affairs, and the medium-term plan involved “developing a clear strategic vision, enhancing coaching and training structures and fostering institutional coordination among relevant bodies”.
The interim president also shared plans that the federation aims to partner with the private sector to ensure improved support to the players.
“Our players should focus on training and matches, while we handle the rest,” he was quoted as saying.
He assured that “welfare and performance would remain at the centre of reforms”.
Additionally, he announced elections for a new PHF leadership and expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for “reposing trust in him” as the interim head, as per APP.
On Thursday, PM Shehbaz appointed Wani as ad-hoc president of the federation, following the resignation of his predecessor.
The developments came amid controversy over the national team’s tour of Australia, where accommodation arrangements could not be secured on time, forcing players to spend several hours on the road.
The team’s overall performance in the Pro League also came under criticism.
However, shortly after Bugti’s resignation, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi met the hockey players, including Ammad Butt and Hanan Shahid.
Speaking to the media after the meeting, when asked about the reported two-year ban, Butt said Naqvi told him there was no ban and that the same team that toured Australia would travel to Egypt.
The ban had reportedly been imposed under the PHF constitution, raising questions over the process for its reversal.</p><small>2026-02-20 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651927-islamabad-police-suspend-dolphin-squad-officers-over-alleged-assault-on-couple' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad police suspend Dolphin Squad officers over alleged assault on couple</strong></a><br><p>

Last week, President Zardari had said it was the duty of leaders to fight and go to jail to protect their party and safeguard the people. Without naming Imran, he added that they had already started complaining about conditions in jail after an 18-month detention, while he himself had spent 14 years in prison without losing courage.
“We strongly condemn Asif Ali Zardari’s recent rhetoric on the founder of the PTI,” the letter said, adding that Imran was currently serving his jail term “in difficult conditions” with dignity.
“The government should stop politicising the health of the PTI founder,” it added.
The letter further stated that Imran’s sisters and personal doctors should be taken into confidence and that he should be treated.
The PTI leaders requested the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) to “fully engage in politics” in Parliament.
The PTI leaders, in the letter, further said that “officials at all levels of PTI should reorganise the party”, taking the organisation to the grassroots level for local body elections across the country.
The letter called for the issues of rising terrorism in the country, rising inflation, unemployment, out-of-school children and corruption to be highlighted “everywhere”.
On February 12, Imran, currently incarcerated at Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, claimed that his right eye had only 15 per cent vision remaining, following which the Supreme Court (SC) ordered the formation of a medical team to examine him. The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children.
The opposition alliance, TTAP, had staged a six-day sit-in at Parliament House over Imran’s health.
It also doubled down on its earlier demands, including the PTI founder’s “complete and confidential access” to his personal physicians Dr Aasim Yusuf and Dr Faisal Sultan and copies of his medical tests and diagnostic reports.
In January, the five PTI leaders had written another open letter demanding that the government provide proper medical treatment to Imran when it was reported that he was suffering from an eye infection.
The inmates also appealed to the chief justice to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment was given as soon as possible.</p><small>2026-02-20 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2011540189b78c4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974564/tarar-says-pakistan-earned-great-recognition-and-honour-at-board-of-peace-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Tarar says Pakistan earned ‘great recognition and honour’ at Board of Peace meeting</strong></a><br><p>Minister of Information Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan had received “great recognition and honour” at the Board of Peace meeting, terming it a moment of pride for the country and its people.
In a video shared on X by Radio Pakistan on Friday, the information minister said that the way US President Donald Trump praised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir, and appreciated Pakistan’s role, had added to the country’s prestige and enabled it to gain wider global recognition.







He added that the praise had raised Pakistan’s stature and that the country had “emerged as an important player on the global stage”.
Tarar described the development as a success of Pakistan’s foreign policy and “the result of teamwork between the prime minister and field marshal”.
He added that PM Shehbaz had consistently raised the Palestinian cause at every platform, especially at the United Nations (UN) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
“Today, he stated three points: that Palestinians have a right to their land, that they should be granted self-determination in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, and that the establishment of an independent Palestinian state is essential for lasting peace,” he said, adding that these remarks reflected the heartfelt sentiments of Palestinians and were a source of pride for Muslims.
The minister further said the “confident body language” of both leaders signaled a strong rapport and enhanced Pakistan’s prestige.
“Pakistan’s foreign policy is making significant strides forward; from a time of isolation, the nation’s standing has transformed dramatically, showing that honest leadership yields positive results,” he added.
The inaugural meeting of the Board of Peace was held in Washington on February 19, with US President Donald Trump leading the session at the US Institute of Peace.
PM Shehbaz attended the meeting at Trump’s invitation.
Addressing the meeting, PM Shehbaz called for an end to ceasefire violations in Gaza, stressing that it was “very important” for achieving long-lasting peace in the war-torn territory.

 

The Board of Peace was first proposed in September 2025. It formed part of a 20-point Gaza peace plan. The plan followed a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas earlier that year.
The board’s establishment was endorsed by a UN Security Council resolution.
Resolution 2803, adopted in November, authorised international cooperation for Gaza’s reconstruction. The board’s charter includes humanitarian and reconstruction responsibilities. It also allows for broader conflict resolution roles.</p><small>2026-02-20 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651906-pti-slams-punjab-govt-for-acquiring-rs11bn-jet-for-chief-minister' target='_blank'><strong>PTI slams Punjab govt for 'acquiring Rs11bn jet for chief minister'</strong></a><br><p>

Australia crashed out of the group stage following losses to Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka, triggering acrimony on the home front.
Former players and pundits have zeroed in on Australia’s preparations for the tournament which saw members of the squad arrive late to a warmup series in Pakistan after prioritising the Big Bash League.
Australia were thumped 3-0 by Pakistan before failing to qualify for the World Cup’s Super Eight phase.
McDonald dismissed criticism that Australia had not prioritised the tournament, saying the team had been “fully locked into (it) for a period of time”.
“I have heard that sort of narrative that T20 World Cups don’t matter to us,” he told reporters.
“I think all that is a response to the performances of Australian cricket teams in these competitions.
“We won in 2021 and we haven’t been as successful since then. The expectations on the Australian cricket team are high — and rightfully so.
“But to sit back and say that we’re prioritising other formats or other versions of the game and not the T20 World Cup is entirely false.”
Australia were missing leading pace bowlers Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood due to injury but McDonald said the available players were good enough but had not performed.
“It shouldn’t be about the players that we’re missing,” said McDonald, who is also a selector.
“It should be looking at the performances and we’re disappointed in those. We need to own those and the critique is fair and reasonable.”
Australia finish their tournament with a dead rubber against Oman in Pallekele later on Friday.</p><small>2026-02-20 05:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/651892-inside-story-of-medical-review-of-imran-satisfaction-in-private-doubts-in-public-over-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>Inside story of medical review of Imran: Satisfaction in private, doubts in public over treatment</strong></a><br><p>

Mountbatten-Windsor, who turned 66 on Thursday, had been questioned all day by detectives from Thames Valley Police.
Earlier this month, the police force said it was looking into allegations that he had passed documents to the late convicted sex offender while working as a trade envoy.
The arrest of the senior royal, eighth in line to the throne, is unprecedented in modern times.
“I have learned with the deepest concern the news about Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor and suspicion of misconduct in public office,” King Charles said in a statement.
A Reuters witness saw the former prince leaving a police station in Aylsham, eastern England, where he was met by a small group of photographers and television crews, just after 1900 GMT.
A Reuters photograph taken after his release shows him seated inside a car, appearing visibly shaken.

Thames Valley Police said later on Thursday that “the arrested man” had been “released under investigation.”
‘The law must take its course’
Although Buckingham Palace was not informed in advance about the arrest, Charles said the authorities had the family’s “full and wholehearted support and cooperation”.
“Let me state clearly: the law must take its course,” the monarch said in his statement.
“Meanwhile, my family and I will continue in our duty and service to you all.” The king visited a fashion show in London on Thursday, making no further public comment.
Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship.
His office did not respond to a request for comment and he has not spoken publicly since the release of more than 3 million pages of documents by the US government relating to Epstein, who was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor in 2008.


Members of the media work outside the entrance to the Wood Farm on the Sandringham Estate, which is reported to be serving as interim accommodation for Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, younger brother of Britain’s King Charles, formerly known as Prince Andrew, who was arrested this morning on suspicion of misconduct in public office, after the U.S. Justice Department released more records tied to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, in Norfolk, Britain, February 19, 2026.

Those files suggested Mountbatten-Windsor had in 2010 forwarded to Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places he had visited on official trips as the government’s Special Representative for Trade and Investment.
He was forced to step down from that role in 2011 after his close links to Epstein first emerged.
“Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,” Thames Valley’s Assistant Chief Constable Oliver Wright said in a statement.
“We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time.”
The arrest marks a new low for the former prince, who was forced to quit all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and was then stripped by his older brother of his titles and honours last October amid further revelations about their relationship.
Unmarked police cars
Earlier, six unmarked police cars and around eight plain-clothes officers were pictured at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in eastern England where Mountbatten-Windsor now resides.
Thames Valley Police officers were also searching the mansion on the king’s Windsor estate where Mountbatten-Windsor lived until he was forced out amid anger at the Epstein revelations.
While being arrested means that police have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and that the royal is suspected of involvement in an offence, it does not imply guilt.
A conviction for misconduct in a public office carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, and cases must be dealt with in a Crown Court, which deal with the most serious criminal offences.
Police have previously said misconduct in public office, which is a ‘common law’ offence and is not covered by written statute legislation, involved “particular complexities”.
Giuffre lawsuit in 2022
The king’s brother settled a civil lawsuit brought in the United States by the late Virginia Giuffre who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager at properties owned by Epstein or his associates.
The current police investigation is not related to this or any other allegation of sexual impropriety.
“Today, our broken hearts have been lifted at the news that no one is above the law, not even royalty,” the family of Giuffre, who died by suicide last year, said in a statement.

In response to Mountbatten-Windsor’s earlier arrest, US President Donald Trump said it was a “shame.” “I think it’s very sad. I think it’s so bad for the royal family,” Trump told reporters.
“It’s very, very sad to me… to see what’s going on with his (King Charles’) brother.”
Were Mountbatten-Windsor to ultimately face criminal charges, he would join a very small group of senior British royals who have formally been accused of offences.
His elder sister Princess Anne was fined for speeding in 2001, and the following year became the first royal to be convicted of a criminal offence in 350 years when she appeared in court to plead guilty to failing to stop one of her dogs, named Dotty, biting two children.
King Charles I was tried for treason in 1649 towards the end of the English Civil War, found guilty and beheaded.
The misconduct investigation is not the only accusation against Mountbatten-Windsor into which police are looking.
Anti-monarchy campaign group Republic has reported him over allegations he was involved in the trafficking of a woman to Britain for sex in 2010.
Thames Valley Police said it was assessing allegations that a woman had been taken to an address in Windsor, where the former prince lived until recently.
US lawmakers have also said he should testify before committees in the United States over what he knew about Epstein.
Meanwhile former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has also called for a police investigation into the extent of Epstein trafficking women without proper checks by the authorities through London’s Stansted Airport, saying this had been overlooked by previous inquiries into Mountbatten-Windsor.
Essex Police said on Wednesday it was looking into the issue.</p><small>2026-02-20 05:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/200720099c243b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974507/govt-to-honour-net-metering-requests-filed-before-feb-8-under-old-rules' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to honour net-metering requests filed before Feb 8 under old rules</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: To salvage government credibility, Power Minister Awais Leghari on Thursday decided to honour all applicants of net-metering solar connections till the change of regulations on Feb 8 and directed electricity distribution companies (Discos), including K-Electric, for its implementation.
At a meeting of the Power Division’s attached entities, the minister was informed that 5,165 consumers had applied for net-metered connections by the cut-off date of Feb 8 — the day the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) notified the Prosumers Regulations 2026, replacing the net-metering framework with net billing and negatively affecting rooftop solar economics for households and industry.
All these applications entailed a net-metering capacity addition of about 250.8 megawatts.

 

“All net metering applications received by Feb 8 be processed under the previous regulations and facilitated by all electricity distribution companies, including K-Electric, under the net metering framework,” the power minister said.
He also issued instructions for immediate implementation to all power distribution companies. “As of Feb 8, a total of 5,165 applications had been submitted across all distribution companies, including K-Electric. The­se applications will collectively add 250.822MW of capacity to the national grid,” an official statement said.
Sources said some of the minister’s close aides opposed the move, arguing it would add to the roughly 6,900MW already installed under net-metering and could encourage litigation by future applicants against the new regulations.
However, the minister contended that net capacity addition in this category was only 250MW, but even if it was 1,500MW equivalent of applications, the government was legally and morally bound to honour its own regulations and commitments.
He was of the view that, within a legal framework, these applicants had accrued rights which could not be denied. However, once the new regulations are notified and in place, citizens will be free to make fresh investments.
The sources said all the Discos and K-Electric were required during the meeting to re-verify their prosumer applications received before Feb 8 and sign respective documents to avoid any exclusions or inclusions on political, financial or other influences.
“The decision by the federal power minister has removed uncertainties surrounding the pending applications,” the Power Division said, adding that the minister directed that transparency be maintained in the processing of all requests. Consumers have also been advised to register any complaints on the issue by calling the helpline at 118.
Earlier, Nepra published draft regulations for public comments on Dec 12, 2025, which prompted the power companies to stop entertaining applications under the previous regulations in place since 2015. The proposal attracted public backlash over both the proposed changes and the retrospective curtailment of benefits
Following widespread criticism, including from parliamentary bodies, the prime minister intervened and restored contractual benefits for existing licensees. How­ever, criticism persisted over the treatment of applications submitted during the period between the draft’s issuance and the formal notification of the new regulations, which took effect from Feb 9.
During public hearings at Nepra, several interveners had also registered their complaints that, despite the regulator seeking only feedback, distribution companies had already stopped accepting new solar applications and were discouraging online registrations through various means.
Nepra Chairman Was­eem Mukhtar and Member (Development) Maqsood Anwar declared such unilateral actions illegal and assured participants they would not be allowed to continue. They said the Power Division should have acted in line with assurances previously given by the power minister, and that the regulator would ensure a reversal of the measures and take strict action against those responsible.

In a social media post, Trump said he would order Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth and other agencies to release the information, calling the matter “extremely interesting and important.”







Earlier in the day, Trump, without providing evidence, accused former President Barack Obama of improperly disclosing classified information when discussing aliens publicly, saying Obama “made a big mistake.”
“He took it out of classified information … He’s not supposed to be doing that,” Trump told reporters while traveling to Georgia.
During an interview with podcast host Brian Tyler Cohen released on Saturday, Obama was asked if aliens were real.
“They’re real, but I haven’t seen them, and they’re not being kept in … Area 51. There’s no underground facility unless there’s this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States,” Obama said.
Area 51 is a classified Air Force facility in Nevada that fringe theorists have speculated holds alien bodies and a crashed spaceship. CIA archives released in 2013 said it was a test site for top-secret spy planes.
Pentagon investigations
There was no indication in Obama’s remarks that the former president released classified information. Obama’s office did not respond to a request for comment.
“I saw no evidence during my presidency that extraterrestrials have made contact with us. Really!” Obama said in an Instagram post on Sunday.
In the post, Obama explained his belief that aliens exist by saying the statistical odds of life beyond Earth were high because the universe is so vast. He added that the chances of extraterrestrial life visiting Earth were low, given the distance.
Following his comments on Obama, Trump added that he had not seen evidence that aliens exist, saying, “I don’t know if they’re real or not.”
In recent years, the Pentagon has investigated reports of UFOs, and senior military leaders said in 2022 they found no evidence to suggest that aliens had visited Earth or crash-landed here.
A 2024 Pentagon report said US government investigations since the end of World War Two had found no evidence of extraterrestrial technology and most sightings were misidentified ordinary objects and phenomena.
The website of the National Archives and Records Administration says it has records related to UFOs across numerous collections.</p><small>2026-02-20 04:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/19235448a805618.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974390/pakistan-not-among-5-nations-announced-to-have-committed-troops-for-international-stabilisation-force-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan not among 5 nations announced to have committed troops for International Stabilisation Force in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Thursday promised $10 billion and Muslim-majority nations offered funding and troops for Gaza at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington.
Pakistan, however, was not named among the five nations who have committed troops for the International Stabilisation Force, which will be tas­k­ed with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.

 

Trump brought together allies from around the world — many authoritarians, with few Western democrats who traditionally ally with the United States — to hail his peacemaking at the first Board of Peace meeting.
Presiding with a gavel over the meeting in the gleaming Washington building of the former US Institute of Peace, which has been gutted and renamed after the 79-year-old Republican, Trump hailed the “powerful people” who joined his board.
“We will help Gaza. We will straighten it out. We’ll make it successful,” Trump said, holding up a document with pledges before the disco beats of his adopted theme-song “YMCA” came on the speakers.
“We will make it peaceful, and we will do things like that in other spots. Spots will come up, things will happen,” Trump said.
Troops pledges
The Board of Peace came together after the Trump administration, teaming up with Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
The plan’s second phase calls for the disarmament of Hamas.
In a first for an Arab country, Morocco announced it was ready to send police as well as officers to the nascent International Stabilisation Force.
The force’s American commander, Major General Jasper Jeffers, said that Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan and Kosovo were also sending troops and announced that an Indonesian officer would serve as his deputy.
Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country, earlier said it was ready to send 8,000 troops — nearly half of the 20,000 sought.
Trump hailed Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto, who attended, calling the former military officer accused of human rights abuses in East Timor a “tough cookie.”
Nickolay Mladenov, a veteran Bulgarian diplomat named high representative for Gaza by the United States, also announced the beginning of recruitment for a post-Hamas police force in Gaza and said 2,000 people had applied in the first hours.
Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi was also asked about the ISF and Pakistan’s view on it during a weekly briefing in Islamabad today.
In response, he said: “We understand that a decision is awaited on the contours of the mandate of the International Stabilisation Force, and till such time, we’re not in a position to take any decision on this matter.
“We have identified our red lines quite explicitly. The deputy prime minister and the foreign minister has done so here from this platform, and elsewhere. Pakistan can be part of a peacekeeping mandate, but we would not be part of any disarming/ demilitarisation mandates. This discussion at [the Board of Peace meeting in] Washington might take place today. We will update you as and when these developments take place.”
For his part, Trump said during the moot in Washington that he hoped the use of force to disarm Hamas would not be necessary. He said Hamas had promised to disarm and it “looks like they’re going to be doing that, but we’ll have to find out.”
Foreign Minister Gideon Saar, representing Israel at the meeting, demanded disarmament of Hamas and “a fundamental deradicalisation process” in Gaza.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in Israel that Hamas will be disarmed one way or the other. “Very soon, Hamas will face a dilemma - to disarm peacefully or disarmed forcefully,” he said.
In Gaza, Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said any international force must “monitor the ceasefire and prevent the (Israeli) occupation from continuing its aggression”. Disarmament could be discussed, he said, without directly committing to it.
Gaza reconstruction
Trump, who has sharply curtailed foreign aid, said the United States would contribute $10bn to the Board of Peace. Trump did not explain exactly where the money would go and whether Congress had approved the contribution he announced for the institution, which has drawn criticism for its opaque nature.
He also announced that contributing nations had raised $7bn as an initial down payment for Gaza reconstruction.
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates each promised at least $1bn. White House Press Secretary said more than $6.5bn was pledged, presumably excluding Trump’s offer.
Trump also said FIFA will raise $75 million for soccer-related projects in Gaza and that the United Nations will chip in $2 billion for humanitarian assistance.
“Together we can achieve the dream of bringing lasting harmony to a region tortured by centuries of war, suffering,” said the realtor-turned-president, who has spoken improbably of building tourist resorts in Gaza.
Trump will wield veto power over the Board of Peace and can remain its head even after leaving office, while countries that want to stay on permanently rather than enjoy a two-year stint will need to pay $1bn.
Critics say the Board of Peace remains vague, including how it would interact with existing institutions, including the United Nations, to which Trump has drastically cut support.
“It’s a confused mix of ambition and narcissism, unleavened by any effort at intellectual coherence,” said Bruce Jones, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

The cumulative impact of Israel’s military conduct during the conflict in Gaza and blockade of the territory, has inflicted living conditions “increasingly incompatible with Palestinians’ continued existence as a group in Gaza”, said the UN human rights office.
“Intensified attacks, the methodical destruction of entire neighbourhoods and the denial of humanitarian assistance appeared to aim at a permanent demographic shift in Gaza,” the office said in a report.
“This, together with forcible transfers, which appear to aim at a permanent displacement, raise concerns over ethnic cleansing in Gaza and the West Bank.”
The report covered Nov 1, 2024 to Oct 31, 2025. It highlighted the Israeli security forces’ “systematic use of unlawful force” in the occupied West Bank and annexed East Jerusalem.
The report also pointed to “widespread” arbitrary detention and the “extensive unlawful demolition” of Palestinian homes. The aim, it said, was to “systematically discriminate, oppress, control and dominate the Palestinian people”.
These actions are altering “the character, status and demographic composition of the occupied West Bank, raising serious concerns of ethnic cleansing”, it added.
‘Inhumane choice’
In Gaza, the report condemned the continued killing and maiming of “unprecedented numbers of civilians”, the spread of famine, and destruction of the “remaining civilian infrastructure”. During the 12 months covered in the report, at least 463 Palestinians, including 157 children, had starved to death in Gaza, it said.
“Palestinians faced the inhumane choice of either starving to death or risking being killed while trying to get food,” it added. The famine, the malnutrition and the “foreseeable and repeatedly foretold” deaths directly resulted from actions taken by the Israeli government, said the report.
Any use of starvation of civilians as a method of war constitutes a war crime, it said — and depending on the intent, it could also constitute genocide.
During the period covered by the report, Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups continued to hold Israeli and foreign hostages seized during the Oct 7, 2023 attack on Israel — dead or alive — as “bargaining tools”.
The rights office said the treatment of the hostages amounted to war crimes. “Israeli forces, Hamas, and other Palestinian armed groups committed serious violations of international humanitarian law in Gaza, gross violations and abuses of international human rights law, and atrocity crimes,” the report concluded.
On Tuesday, Israel’s far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich vowed to encourage “emigration” from the Palestinian territories. The West Bank would form the largest part of any future Palestinian state, but many on Israel’s religious right view it as Israeli land.

WASHINGTON: War clouds are looming over the Middle East, as US warplanes and aircraft carriers head toward Iran in preparation for possible military action.
Renewing his threats towards Tehran, President Donald Trump indicated on Thursday that the country has around 10 days to reach a deal with Washington, or “bad things will happen”.

 

CNN and CBS reported on Wednesday that the US military would be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Lea­vitt warned on Wednesday there were “many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran”.
“Iran would be very wise to make a deal with Pre­sident Trump,” she said.
Trump’s comments came shortly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued his own warning to Iran saying, “If the ayatollahs make a mistake and attack us, they will receive a response they cannot even imagine”.
The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, reported that Trump had been briefed on his military options with “all of them designed to maximise damage”, including a campaign to “kill scores of Iranian political and military leaders, with the goal of overthrowing the government”, unnamed US officials told the newspaper.
The US has, meanwhile, been building up its military forces near Iran, incl­uding warships, fighter jets, and refuelling aircraft, laying the foundation for a potentially sustained campaign against Iran — should Trump give the order.
Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed.
Speaking at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting, Trump even praised the “magnificent” B-2 bombers that “totally decimated the nuclear potential” of Iran last summer, saying they helped bring peace to the Middle East for the first time in 3,000 years.
Iran has also sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps holding war games earlier this week in the Strait of Hormuz.
Iran’s joint exercise with Russia came days into an extended series of Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, with Iranian state television showing special forces units deployed on helicopters and ships.
Amid the escalating warnings, Poland on Thursday ordered all its citizens in Iran to “leave immediately”.
Germany meanwhile moved troops out of northern Iraq, reducing its footprint to the minimum necessary to keep its base there functional, citing escalating regional tensions.
Dozens of German soldiers have been relocated away from the base in Erbil, capital of Iraq’s autonomous Kurdistan region.
Russia has also called for restraint, with a Kremlin spokesperson saying, “We are currently witnessing an unprecedented escalation of tension in the region, but we still hope that political and diplomatic means and negotiations will continue to prevail in the search for a settlement”.

• SBCA chief concedes original documents pertaining to action against building violations not found           
KARACHI: The Gul Plaza Judicial Commission on Thursday summoned the municipal commissioner as an official of Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) could not assist it and was unaware about the facts and record of the ill-fated building.
The single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court also recorded the testimonies of various officials, including Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) Director General Muzammil Hussain Halepoto, Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) Chief Executive Officer Ahmed Ali Siddiqui, Deputy Commissioner (South) Javed Nabi Khoso and Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
At the outset of the hearing on Thursday, Director Land (lease) KMC Syed Adnan Hyder Zaidi turned up to testify before the commission, but he could not offer a satisfactory reply to various questions about the legal status and lease of the plot in question.
The commission summoned the municipal commissioner, who is the top bureaucrat of the KMC administration, to appear in person for recording  statement and provision of relevant records on Feb 23.
‘SBCA has no record of notices sent to Gul Plaza admin over violations’
SBCA DG Halepoto deposed that one Anwar Ali got the building plan approved in 1979, the construction started in 1986, while the lease of the plot had expired in 1983 and the same was renewed in 1991.
A revised plan was approved in 1998, and dozens of unauthorised shops were regularised in 2003, and an application was filed seeking a sale no objection certificate (NOC) in 2005, but in fact all the shops were already sold out apart from the basement, he added. 
He also maintained that permission was sought in 2015 to build additional floors, but the same was turned down. The mezzanine floor of the building was not available in the records of the authority, and there were a total of 18 gates in the building, he added.
When the commission inquired about records and action taken by the SBCA over these violations, the SBCA chief conceded that only photocopies of such documents were available, as the original record could not be found. 
He also claimed that the role of SBCA ended after issuing the completion certificate of a building and therefore, the management of the building was responsible. However, action can be taken if the complaints were filed or on the recommendations made by building inspectors.
The commission also confronted him about the number of notices issued to Gul Plaza management regarding such violations. In reply, the SBCA chief said that no such record was available, and that it was an uphill task to inspect all buildings across the province, as the authority has only 1,381 employees.
KWSC chief says nearest hydrant was 14 kilometres away from shopping mall
KWSC CEO Siddiqui deposed that an emergency was declared at all hydrants soon after receiving information about the blaze from the chief fire officer and the nearest hydrant was 14 kilometres away from the ill-fated building.
Replying to a question of commission about dedicated water lines for fire stations, he stated that water was provided to fire tenders for six hours on a daily basis from the hydrants and a water storage facility was also available at the headquarters of the fire brigade.
DC (South) Khoso testified that he was rushed to Gul Plaza after receiving information about the blaze and contacted the emergency services while many people had managed to come out of the building in 20 to 30 minutes after the fire broke out.
Dr Summaiya Syed testified that initially, eight injured persons were brought to the Burns Centre at the Civil Hospital, and they were discharged after providing necessary treatment.
She also stated that six and 19 bodies were brought on Jan 18 and Jan 19, and therefore, human remains were brought to the hospital in the next five days, and the same were beyond recognition and DNA samples were collected for identification.
Pakistan Infrastructure Development Company General Manager Shafi Chachar informed the commission that the M. A. Jinnah Road has been partially closed due to the Green Line extension project, and hurdles were removed for fire tenders to timely reach the site.
Management doesn’t have sub-lease record: Pasta
Gul Plaza Traders Association president Tanveer Pasta, who had recorded his statement on Wednesday, also turned up on Thursday in pursuance of the commission’s directive and further testified that usually, the plaza was closed between 10:30 to 11pm, and the gates of the building gradually started closing from around 10:30, and it took 20 to 25 minutes for the complete shutdown.
He said that 280 CCTV cameras were installed at the building and in 2003 the parking was shifted from the basement to the rooftop.
He further stated that the record of sub-lease was not available with the management of the building, as it was only collecting maintenance charges and managing the CCTV cameras and watchmen.
The commission asked a provincial law officer to inform it whether the Rescue 1122 service came within the domain of the provincial or city governments. 
Adjourning the hearing till Monday, the commission also handed over questionnaires to these officials/witnesses and directed them to submit the same at the next hearing.
