The meeting, listed on the president’s official schedule, will be held in the Cabinet Room and closed to the press.
The lunch is being seen in Islamabad as a major diplomatic win, particularly because earlier this month, an Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance and Indian media depicted it as a diplomatic success, contrasting it with the apparent inability of the Pakistani delegation to secure a similar meeting. Gen Munir’s invitation to the White House is now being projected by officials in Islamabad as a diplomatic counterpoint to those narratives.
This development also marks a notable success for Pakistan in the ongoing diplomatic contest that followed last month’s air combat with India — a confrontation that brought South Asia dangerously close to nuclear conflict. Munir is in the US on a five-day official visit.
 
 

Field Marshal Munir, who was elevated to Pakistan’s rare five-star rank last month — the first such promotion since Ayub Khan in 1959 — has made headlines during his trip, urging India to engage with Pakistan “as a civilized nation,” rather than attempting to impose regional hegemony.
Speaking to members of the Pakistani American community on Monday evening, he strongly rejected Indian claims that Pakistan was behind the terrorist attack in Pahalgam, calling it a pretext for cross-border aggression. He accused India of seeking to establish a dangerous “new normal” of violating international borders, which Pakistan had forcefully rejected. “We would rather embrace martyrdom than accept this dishonour,” he said.
The interaction at the Four Seasons Hotel in Washington’s Georgetown neighbourhood drew a large and enthusiastic crowd, with supporters showering the army chief with rose petals and chanting slogans in his praise. Protesters aligned with the opposition PTI party demonstrated outside, calling for democratic reforms and the release of jailed leaders, but their voices were largely drowned out inside the venue.
In his remarks, Munir also addressed the broader regional landscape, declaring Pakistan’s “clear and strong” support for Iran in its war with Israel while also backing US efforts to de-escalate the situation. “We want this war to end immediately,” he said.
One of the most consequential developments during Munir’s visit, however, has been Pakistan’s strengthened counterterrorism partnership with the United States — particularly against the militant Islamic State Khorasan (IS-K) group. On Tuesday, Gen Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command, described Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner” in the fight against IS-K, praising Islamabad’s operations along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
Gen. Kurilla revealed to the House Armed Services Committee that Pakistani operations, supported by US intelligence, had killed dozens of IS-K militants and captured multiple high-value individuals, including Mohammad Sharifullah, one of the masterminds of the Abbey Gate bombing in Kabul that killed 13 American troops.
“The first person Munir called was me,” Gen Kurilla said. “He said, ‘I’ve caught him — ready to extradite him back to the US Please tell the Secretary of Defence and the President’.” Sharifullah was promptly extradited.
In a separate statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee, Kurilla noted that Pakistan had conducted “dozens of operations” to dismantle IS-K’s presence in the border regions and continues to play a pivotal role in countering terrorism in Central and South Asia.
 
 

The Centcom chief’s comments reflect a growing acknowledgement in Washington that Pakistan remains essential to regional stability. As Kurilla noted, while the Taliban have pushed IS-K militants into the tribal areas, these sanctuaries still allow the group to plan and plot attacks not just against regional allies, but also the US homeland.
Despite the security challenges Pakistan faces — including over 1,000 terrorist attacks last year alone, which claimed the lives of some 700 security personnel and 2,500 civilians — Gen Kurilla said Pakistan “has been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world”.
During his interaction with the diaspora community, Gen Munir emphasised Pakistan’s gratitude for the role overseas Pakistanis play in bolstering the national economy. He dismissed concerns over brain drain, describing it instead as a “brain gain.”
He avoided discussing domestic politics directly, and when one attendee attempted to criticise former prime minister Imran Khan, Munir discouraged it. When another guest jokingly suggested that political opponents might need their “software fixed,” the general responded that democratic societies must protect the right to dissent.
The evening concluded with pledges of renewed commitment from both the army chief and the diaspora to work toward a stronger, more resilient Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-18 10:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18125513c2ff181.jpg?r=134625' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917867/khamenei-vows-no-mercy-for-israel-as-iran-claims-firing-hypersonic-missiles-on-6th-day-of-war' target='_blank'><strong>Khamenei vows ‘no mercy’ for Israel as Iran claims firing hypersonic missiles on 6th day of war</strong></a><br><p>Iran claimed firing hypersonic missiles at Israel on Wednesday as Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed his country would show “no mercy” to its longtime archfoe, hours after US President Donald Trump demanded Tehran’s “unconditional surrender”.
Israel launched wide-scale air strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities, military sites and private residences on Friday, killing top commanders, scientists, and civilians. It claimed the strikes are part of a broader operation codenamed ‘Rising Lion’ to deter Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which the latter has consistently denied, saying its uranium enrichment programme is for civilian purposes.

Latest developments:

Death toll in Iran rises to nearly 600, US-based rights group says
Iran warns will respond firmly if US becomes directly involved in Israeli strikes
IRGC says it used hypersonic Fattah-1 missiles; Israel hits 2 centrifuge production sites in Tehran, Karaj
Trump’s National Security Council meets but officials say no decision yet

Options under consideration by US reportedly include using giant ‘bunker-buster’ bombs

Evacuation of foreign nationals continues; some Israelis return


“We must give a strong response to the terrorist Zionist regime. We will show the Zionists no mercy,” Khamenei posted on X, hours after Trump’s escalatory remarks.
 






Iran’s ambassador to the United Nations, Ali Bahreini, said his country had conveyed to Washington that it will respond firmly to the United States if it becomes directly involved in Israel’s military campaign.
Bahreini told reporters that he saw the US as “complicit in what Israel is doing”. Iran would set a red line, and respond if the US crosses it, he said, without specifying what actions would provoke a response.
“We will not show any reluctance in defending our people, security and land — we will respond seriously and strongly, without restraint,” Bahreini told reporters.
The Iranian envoy called Trump’s remarks “completely unwarranted and very hostile”. “We cannot ignore them. We are vigilant about what Trump is saying. We will put it in our calculations and assessments.”
“I am confident that [Iran’s military] will react strongly, proportionally and appropriately. We are closely following the level of involvement in the US […] We will react whenever it is needed,” he asserted.
Turkish President RecepTayyip Erdogan also said  Iran had the “legitimate” right to defend itself in the face of Israel’s ongoing bombing campaign.
“It is a very natural, legitimate and legal right for Iran to defend itself against Israel’s thuggery and state terrorism,” the Turkish leader said, a day after he referred to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as “the biggest threat to the security of the region”.
The US has so far only taken indirect actions in the current conflict with Iran, including helping to shoot down missiles fired toward Israel. It is deploying more fighter aircraft to the Middle East and extending the deployment of other warplanes, three US officials told Reuters.
Trump met with his National Security Council earlier today to discuss the conflict, ending after an hour and 20 minutes with no immediate public statement.
While he has repeatedly vowed to avoid wading into the “forever wars” of the Middle East, Trump ordered the USS Nimitz aircraft carrier to the region along with a number of US military aircraft.
US officials stressed he has not yet made a decision about any intervention, according to AFP.
Thomas Massie from Trump’s Republican Party said that he introduced an Iran War Powers Resolution with fellow lawmaker Ro Khanna to prohibit US involvement in the Israel-Iran war.
“This is not our war. Even if it were, Congress must decide such matters according to our constitution,” he said. Democratic Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Greg Casar were among several lawmakers who voiced their support for the resolution.
 






The most likely option under consideration by Trump would be the use of giant US “bunker-buster” bombs against Iran’s deeply buried Fordow nuclear facility that Israel’s bombs cannot reach.
“Bunker buster” is a broad term used to describe bombs that can penetrate about 61 metres below the surface before exploding, according to the Associated Press. Therefore, the precision-guided bombs are used to attack “deeply buried and hardened bunkers and tunnels”.
The BBC’s Frank Gardner termed it the “30,000lb question”; the US has them but Israel does not, he noted. The New York Times said Trump was also considering allowing US tanker aircraft to refuel Israeli combat jets so they could carry out long-range missions.
A large majority of Americans say the United States should not get involved in the fighting, according to a new Economist/YouGov poll.
Sixty per cent of those surveyed say they do not support US involvement in the hostilities, while 16pc say they back it, according to Newsmax. The rest of 24pc said they were unsure whether they supported American military action.
Death toll in Iran rises to nearly 600: rights group
Washington-based group Human Rights Activists put the total death toll in Iran at 585 people, with 1,326 other wounded, Washington Post reported. The group added that it had identified 239 of those killed in Israeli strikes as civilians and 126 as security personnel.
In its last update on Monday, Iran’s health ministry had said 224 Iranians had been killed and over 1,000 injured, most of them civilians.
So far, 24 people have been killed in Israel, more than 800 have been wounded and over 3,800 have been evacuated from their homes, CNN quoted a statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office as saying.
Iran has launched more than 400 missiles and hundreds of drones towards Israel since Friday, the office said. It added that the strikes have hit 40 sites across Israel, resulting in nearly 19,000 damage claims submitted to the tax authority.
Israeli military strikes have hit two facilities in Iran that made parts for centrifuges, the machines that enrich uranium, the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said today, identifying them as the Tesa Karaj workshop and the Tehran Research Centre.
“At the Tehran site, one building was hit where advanced centrifuge rotors were manufactured and tested. At Karaj, two buildings were destroyed where different centrifuge components were manufactured,” the IAEA said on X.
 






Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said that hypersonic missiles were used during the latest attack on Israel.
“The 11th wave of the proud Operation Honest Promise 3 using Fattah-1 missiles” was carried out, the IRGC said in a statement carried by state television, claiming that Iranian forces “have gained complete control over the skies of the occupied territories”.
Hypersonic missiles travel at more than five times the speed of sound and can manoeuvre mid-flight, making them harder to track and intercept.
 






Iran also sent a “swarm of drones” towards Israel, where the army said it intercepted two over the Dead Sea area. The Israeli military said two barrages of Iranian missiles were launched toward Israel in the first two hours of Wednesday morning. Explosions were heard over Tel Aviv.
Israel told residents in the area of Tehran to evacuate so its air force could strike Iranian military installations.
Iranian news websites said Israel was also attacking a university linked to the IRGC in the country’s east, and the Khojir ballistic missile facility near Tehran, which was also targeted by Israeli airstrikes last October.
An Israeli military official claimed 50 fighter jets struck around 20 targets in Tehran overnight, including sites producing raw materials, components and manufacturing systems for missiles.
Iran’s semi-official Mehr news agency reported clashes earlier today between security forces and unidentified gunmen in the city of Rey, south of Tehran, adding the assailants may be linked to Israel and intended to carry out “terrorist operations in densely populated areas of the capital”.
The IRGC last night claimed hitting a “major centre” of Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency in Tel Aviv, Tasnim reported.
Iran’s police forces intercepted 14 drones and identified hostile drone-producing workshops and drone-carrying vehicles across various provinces, police spokesperson Saeed Montazerolmahdi said today, according to the Iranian Labour News Agency.
On the other hand, Israel is running low on defensive “Arrow” missile interceptors, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing an unnamed US official, raising concerns about the country’s ability to counter long-range ballistic missiles from Iran.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the report.
A cyberattack yesterday crippled Sepah Bank, one of Iran’s main state-owned banks, the Fars news agency reported.
With air raid sirens regularly screaming over Tel Aviv, some people relocated to an underground parking lot below a shopping mall.
“We’ve decided to permanently set camp here until it’s all clear, I guess,” 30-year-old Mali Papirany told AFP.
Iran also said it had detained five suspected Mossad agents on charges of tarnishing the country’s image online, Iranian news agencies reported.
“These mercenaries sought to sow fear among the public and tarnish the image of the sacred system of the Islamic Republic of Iran through their calculated activities online,” the Tasnim and Isna news agencies quoted a statement from the IRGC as saying.
They added that the arrests had been made in the western province of Lorestan.
Evacuations from Iran, Israel continue
Thousands of people were fleeing Tehran on Wednesday after Trump said yesterday they should leave the capital, Reuters reported.
Authorities have placed limits on how much fuel can be purchased. Oil Minister Mohsen Paknejad told state TV that restrictions were in place to prevent shortages but there would be no problem supplying fuel to the public.
Meanwhile, more countries started evacuating their nationals from Iran and Israel.
Britain said it was temporarily withdrawing the family members of staff who work at the country’s embassy and consulate in Israel due to the significant risks posed by the conflict.
“Family members of staff at the British embassy in Tel Aviv and the British consulate in Jerusalem have been temporarily withdrawn as a precautionary measure,” Britain’s foreign office said on its travel advice page for Israel.
“The embassy and consulate continue with essential work including services to British nationals,” it added.
The families of Russian diplomats left Israel as well, Russia’s ambassador to Tel Aviv Anatoly Viktorov was quoted as saying by Times of Israel.
Over 770 Pakistani pilgrims and students have already returned home, as of Monday.
 


China’s foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said 791 of its nationals “have been relocated from Iran to safe areas”, adding some Chinese nationals have also safely evacuated from Israel.
The first batch of Chinese citizens departed from Tehran via land route into Turkmenistan on Tuesday, according to China News Service.
The Japanese government has also started making arrangements to send a military plane to Djibouti as part of its effort to help Japanese nationals in Iran and Israel evacuate, commercial broadcaster Fuji Television Network said.
Greece has repatriated 105 of its citizens and foreign nationals from Israel, its foreign ministry said.
“The people repatriated were transported to Athens from Sharm El-Sheikh, in Egypt, onboard C-130 and C-27 Greek air force planes,” the ministry said in a statement.
Along with Greek citizens and their families, other people on the flight included citizens of Albania, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, France, Germany, Georgia, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States, it said.

Flights took off for Israel today from Cyprus, ferrying home Israelis stranded abroad during the conflict with Iran, Reuters reported, citing airport sources and web flight tracking sites.
Israel’s airspace has been closed since the two countries began trading attacks on Friday, stranding tens of thousands whose flights to Tel Aviv were cancelled.
Israel announced special flights for the repatriation of its nationals on Tuesday. Its Transportation Ministry has said as many as 150,000 Israelis are abroad, with about a third trying to get home.
According to a report by Israeli publication Haaretz, the marina in Herzliya — a coastal town on the outskirts of Tel Aviv — and others like it in Haifa and Ashkelon, are now becoming gathering spots for many who want to leave Israel using flotillas.
Trump says ‘we now have total control’ of Iran skies
In a series of posts on Truth Social, Trump’s increasingly irate tone and choice of words indicated that the US was not far from intervening to support Israel, its closest ally in the region.
“We now have completely and total control of the skies over Iran,” he posted, prompting many to question what he meant by “we”.
The US president has maintained that his country is not involved in the Iran-Israel conflict yet, but threatened Iran with severe consequences if it targeted US troops and assets in the Middle East.
He then posted “unconditional surrender”, an apparent demand addressed at Tehran.
Trump also made a veiled threat against Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying “we know exactly where the so-called ‘Supreme Leader’ is hiding … We are not going to take him out (kill!), at least not for now”.
Trump’s sometimes contradictory and cryptic messaging about the conflict between close US ally Israel and longtime foe Iran has deepened the uncertainty surrounding the crisis. His public comments have ranged from military threats to diplomatic overtures, not uncommon for a president known for an often erratic approach to foreign policy.
Reuters reported yesterday that the US military was deploying more fighter aircraft to the Middle East and extending the deployment of other warplanes.
The deployments include F-16, F-22 and F-35 fighter aircraft, and officials said had so far been used to shoot down drones and projectiles targeting Israel.
Four US Stratofortress bombers are currently stationed at a remote US base in the Indian Ocean, an AFP analysis of satellite imagery indicated. The four B52H bombers, which can carry nuclear weapons or other precision-guided munitions, were spotted on a southern tarmac at Diego Garcia on Monday at 2:22pm PKT.
US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth also described the deployments as defensive in nature. A White House official said Trump spoke to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by phone on Tuesday.
The US already has a sizeable force in the Middle East, with nearly 40,000 troops in the region, including air defence systems, fighter aircraft and warships that can detect and shoot down enemy missiles.
 
 

British PM Keir Starmer, speaking at the Group of Seven nations summit in Canada that Trump left early, said there was no indication the US was about to enter the conflict.
The US said that it will close its embassy in Jerusalem until Friday amid the growing military conflict between Israel and Iran, as speculation mounts about possible American intervention.
“Given the security situation and in compliance with Israel Home Front Command guidance, the US Embassy in Jerusalem will be closed tomorrow (Wednesday, June 18) through Friday (June 20),” the embassy said in a statement posted on Tuesday to its website.
Regional influence weakens
Khamenei’s main military and security advisers have been killed by Israeli strikes, hollowing out his inner circle and raising the risk of strategic errors, according to five people familiar with his decision-making process.
With Iranian leaders suffering their most dangerous security breach since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the country’s cybersecurity command banned officials from using communications devices and mobile phones, Fars news agency reported.
State television appealed to Iranians on Tuesday to delete WhatsApp from their phones, charging that the messaging app gathers users’ location and personal data and “communicates them to the Zionist enemy”.

Israel launched its air war, its largest ever on Iran, on Friday after saying it concluded Iran was on the verge of developing a nuclear weapon.
Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and has pointed to its right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, including enrichment, as a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Israel, which is not a party to the NPT, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.
Netanyahu has stressed that he will not back down until Iran’s nuclear development is disabled, while Trump says the Israeli assault could end if Iran agrees to strict curbs on enrichment.
Before Israel’s attack began, the 35-nation board of governors of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), declared Iran in breach of its non-proliferation obligations for the first time in almost 20 years.
However, a US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”, a report from CNN released on Tuesday said.
 
 

The IAEA said on Tuesday that an Israeli strike directly hit the underground enrichment halls at the Natanz facility.
Israel says it now has control of Iranian airspace and intends to escalate the campaign in coming days. But Israel will struggle to deal a knock-out blow to deeply buried nuclear sites like Fordow, which is dug beneath a mountain, without the US joining the attack.

According to the WHO, the Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), commonly known as Congo Virus, causes severe viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks with a case fatality rate of 10-40 per cent. There is no vaccine available for the disease. According to experts, the CCHF virus is primarily transmitted to people either by tick bites or through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter. In April, the National Institute of Health (NIH) issued an advisory urging prevention of Congo fever ahead of Eidul Azha.
The 42-year-old man, a resident of District Malir, was admitted to Indus Hospital in Korangi, where he tested positive for CCHF on June 16, Media coordinator for the Sindh health ministry, Meeran Yousuf told Dawn.com.
The patient passed away the next day. A team of health experts visited his residence but found the door locked.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Yousuf said, “The team assumed that the family took away the body for burial at their native place somewhere.”
The disease can spread via human-to-human transmission, from close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons, according to the WHO.
Onset of symptoms is sudden, with fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain and stiffness, backache, headache, sore eyes and sensitivity to light.
On Tuesday, a 22-year-old animal handler from the North Waziristan tribal district died of CCHF at the Hayatabad Medical Complex.
The first case of the disease in Pakistan was reported in 1976 when a surgeon, along with three healthcare providers, died following an infection from a patient.</p><small>2025-06-18 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18130702539c03d.png?r=131959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917884/careem-announces-end-of-ride-hailing-service-in-pakistan-from-next-month' target='_blank'><strong>Careem announces end of ride-hailing service in Pakistan from next month</strong></a><br><p>Careem will suspend its ride-hailing service operations in Pakistan from July after nearly a decade in the industry, its CEO announced on Wednesday, adding that its journey in the country would continue “in a different role”.
Mudassir Sheikha, Careem’s CEO and co-founder, shared a post on LinkedIn announcing “a new chapter” for the company.
“It is with a heavy heart that I share this update: Careem will suspend its ride-hailing service in Pakistan on July 18,” Sheikha said, adding that it was “an incredibly difficult decision.”
“The challenging macroeconomic reality, intensifying competition, and global capital allocation made it hard to justify the investment levels required to deliver a safe and dependable service in the country.
“In the end, the Careem Rides team had to make this tough call,” he said.
 





He called the ride suspension “the end of an iconic chapter — one built with purpose, grit and a ton of relentless hustle”.
Sheikha highlighted some of Careem’s notable achievements while operating in Pakistan, including safe rides on demand, women travelling with strangers, and smartphones and digital payments for everyday use.
“The challenges were real and formidable. But our Pakistan team was brilliant and fearless — bold, determined, and literally on a mission to create millions of jobs for captains across the country,” he said.
He lauded his team for building a service that millions of Pakistanis relied on “to move and earn”.
“They delivered significant public goods: digital infrastructure, trust, regulation, capability, confidence — all of which paved the way for countless local and global digital ventures to take root in Pakistan.”
Sheikha added that “while ride-hailing is sunsetting, Careem’s journey in Pakistan continues in a different role.
“Careem Technologies (the spinout building the Everything App) will continue to build from Pakistan for the region.”
Sheikha said that nearly 400 Careem employees from across all functions, including engineering, are building the Everything App and its ecosystem of verticals (food/grocery delivery, payments, and more).
“This presence is only set to grow, with over 100 open roles and the expansion of our Falcon/NextGen programme that brings in top graduates from Pakistani universities and gives them hands-on training on building highly scalable systems,” Sheikha elaborated.
“Pakistan is in Careem’s DNA — our first line of code was written here, and the country remains a rich source of innovation and talent for us,” he said.
The company said Careem Care will be available till September 18 to help users with any pending issues or questions, according to an update sent to a Dawn.com staffer who uses the app.
“If you have remaining balance in your Careem Wallet, we’ll be in touch soon with clear instructions on how to reclaim it,” the update said.
In April 2024, Uber made the decision to cease operating its ride-hailing app in Pakistan, saying: “Our subsidiary brand Careem will continue to operate, with the Careem app offering ride-hailing services across Pakistan and earning opportunities for drivers.”
Careem officially entered the Pakistani market in October 2015, offering an app, a website and a helpline where customers could order rides. It operates in 12 countries across the Middle East and North Africa, Turkiye and Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-18 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18111401069003f.png?r=111412' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917875/what-is-netanyahus-endgame' target='_blank'><strong>What is Netanyahu’s endgame?</strong></a><br><p>For years, allies and adversaries alike have ridiculed Benjamin Netanyahu as the boy who cried wolf. The far-right hardliner has long been haunted by the prospect of an Iranian nuclear bomb, decrying that Tehran is just “weeks away” from such a weapon for over three decades now. A poster boy for genocide, he may be, it takes a man of a certain skillset to be able to be taken seriously after being so wrong for so long.
Despite his faulty calculus, Netanyahu never really let up. From infamously waving a cartoon sketch of an Iranian bomb at the UN in 2012 to privately lobbying Western leaders into a broader military entanglement with Ayetollahs, the Israeli premier has long prized a war with Iran as the crown jewel of his sordid legacy.

So when he finally signed off on a series of “pre-emptive strikes” that looked to target Iran’s nuclear centrifuges and military brass in the early hours of Friday, it wasn’t really much of a surprise. On the contrary, the post-attack script was practically writing itself.
“If we don’t attack, then it’s 100pc that we will die,” he argued in a video statement to the nation, hours after 200 Israeli warplanes zipped into Iranian airspace and dropped hundreds of bombs, rocking cities with explosions and jolting people out of their beds.
Old habits die hard, and sure enough, Bibi once again asserted the same, old, tired trope: that “Iran has produced enough highly enriched uranium for nine atom bombs” and was “taking steps to weaponise this enriched uranium”. In typical Bibi fashion, he didn’t feel obliged to provide any evidence as to why the Iranians would suddenly abandon decades of nuclear restraint out of the blue. Nor did he deem it necessary to explain what had changed since US Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s testimony in March that “Iran is not building a nuclear weapon” and that the Ayatollah “has not authorised the nuclear weapons program he suspended in 2003”.
“We decided we couldn’t wait anymore. We are at midnight,” said Netanyahu.
It’s the same apocalyptic framing that has defined much of Netanyahu’s public advocacy over the years. These lacklustre justifications are usually enough for the Piers Morgans of the world, who suspend all logical scepticism to parrot whatever the latest eurocentric talking point of the day is. For the rest of us, however, Netanyahu’s stated strategic objective is as murky as it gets.
For one, the only nuclear site that Netanyahu mentioned in his speech was the large enrichment facility at Natanz. The Iranians have informed the IAEA that while Natanz was indeed targeted, other sites with nuclear material were operating normally. Later, Israel also attacked Fordow, where Iran is also suspected to be enriching material up to 60 per cent, but hasn’t been able to cause any observable damage. It looks like Israel attempted just enough of an attack on Iran’s nuclear infrastructure to be able to paint it as an act of preemptive self-defence. Since then, Netanyahu has stuck to his signature brand — bombing civilian areas, targeting journalists and trashing economic zones.

The consensus has long been that any meaningful attempt at the neutralisation of Iran’s nuclear program is a notch above Israel’s pay grade anyway. This is largely because the Iranians have safely buried their most advanced centrifuge cascades for enriching uranium hundreds of feet beneath the ground at sites like Natanz and Fordow. Potentially getting at those facilities would require the 15-ton bunker-buster bombs and a kind of military attrition that only the United States can provide. At most, Israel could perhaps delay a potential nuclear weapon by a matter of months, which is nearly not enough of a payoff to push the region into a war of uncertain consequences.
Most importantly, it doesn’t really take a four-star general to know that any meaningful threat to the Iranian regime is likely to force the Ayatollah’s hand into abandoning the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 and race toward a bomb. They certainly have the capability to do so. In a sit-down with CNN’s Christine Amanpour, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak admitted as much: “They have 400 kilograms of 60pc enriched uranium and it can be enriched to 90pc in a garage with the right equipment and they will have a crude bomb”. Considering the entire country of Israel is considered a “one bomb state”, coaxing the Ayatollah by bombarding his capital seems to be somewhat counterproductive.
Granted, missing out on an opportunity for a chaotic war has never quite been Bibi’s style, but bombarding the Islamic Republic mere days before another round of negotiations is particularly deranged for a country already on the brink of maxing out its political capital as far as the international community is concerned. The only plausible conclusion, therefore, is that the alarmism over WMDs is a smokescreen for something else. It’s a saga that traces back long before Netanyahu came onto the political scene, one that goes back to the very genesis of the American empire.
Empire, in its own words
When the USSR fell in the winters of ’91, the United States was left crippling with a national identity crisis. Without a grand antagonist to rally against, the US had lost its compass for global engagement. This was uncharted territory for any nation in the history of the world. Perhaps for the first time ever, the world was, in the truest sense of the word, unipolar.
Recognising the gaping ideological void left by what Charles Krauthammer dubbed ‘the unipolar moment’, an ambitious cadre of neoconservatives saw gold in the streets. Drawing from a deep well of hard theory, these thinkers began cooking up a revolutionary approach to international affairs that would go on to cement the United States as the undisputed world empire.

The intellectual vanguard of this movement coalesced around a handful of think tanks concentrated in and around the Beltway. The most notable, and perhaps most influential, of these was the Project for a New American Century (PNAC), a think tank established in 1992 around the core premise that “American leadership is good for both America and for the world.” Fully cognisant of the unrivalled military apparatus at its disposal, the PNAC’s leading lights penned what would go on to become the ideological blueprint for the new American empire.
Titled “Toward a Neo-Reaganite Foreign Policy”, the groundbreaking policy brief urged the United States to realise and embrace the moral obligations of its unprecedented power, and assume the mantle of a “benevolent global hegemon” — one that wouldn’t hesitate to flex its military muscle in order to advance, and when necessary enforce, liberal democratic principles across the world.
Over the next few years, the neoconservative doctrine gradually penetrated the highest echelons of government. The Clinton years, for instance, saw figures like Secretary of State Madeleine Albright articulate a kind of hubris that had become indicative of the American Century: “If we have to use force, it is because we are America; we are the indispensable nation. We stand tall and we see further than other countries into the future, and we see the danger here to all of us.”
If America were to assume the throne of global imperialism, it would need to tame the vast deserts (and the rich oil reserves that lay underneath) of the Middle East. In the summer of 1996, a constellation of neoconservative strategists — Richard Perle, Douglas Feith, David Wurmser, and others — drafted a policy blueprint for the then-newly elected Prime Minister of Israel: an up-and-coming hardliner who went by the name of Benjamin Netanyahu.
The document, titled “A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the Realm,” embodied the broader neoconservative vision for an American satellite state in the Middle East, and went on to become the foundational document guiding Netanyahu’s political vision for the region.
The Clean Break strategy rested on a three-pronged approach for Israel: A departure from the Oslo Accords and a rejection of the two-state solution, a regime change operation in adversarial states across the Middle East, and a politically-symbiotic alliance with the United States through preemptive military strength, market reforms, and opposition to Islamist regimes. When the Bush administration took the White House, Perle, Feith, and Wurmser, alongside fellow neoconservatives and PNAC alum Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, and Paul Wolfowitz, among others, found themselves occupying pivotal positions in the national security apparatus.
Around this time, the PNAC drafted a report titled “Rebuilding America’s Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources for a New Century.” It recognised that imperative though it may be, manufacturing consent for a regime change excursion into the Middle East wouldn’t exactly be a cakewalk without  “some catastrophic and catalysing event — like a new Pearl Harbour.” A year later, two Boeing 767 airliners rammed into the World Trade Centre and in the ashes and embers of unspeakable tragedy, the neocons had their opportunity. They’d be remiss not to cash in.
With American public opinion at its most malleable, the neocons packing the Bush cabinet rolled out the red carpet for Netanyahu, then enjoying a stint as a “regional expert” on the Middle East, to address Congress in 2002. It came as no surprise, then, that Netanyahu’s testimony was in perfect lockstep with the Clean Break papers.
“If you take out Saddam, Saddam’s regime, I guarantee you that it will have enormous positive reverberations on the region,” he predicted. “And I think that people sitting right next door in Iran, young people, and many others, will say the time of such regimes, of such despots is gone.” The monstrosity of the lies told, the millions of lives lost, and an entire region left in disarray was just another Tuesday for the Likud Party czar.

According to retired four-star general of the US Army and former NATO commander Wesley Clark, it was no coincidence that Netanyahu centred his 2002 testimony on a US-backed regime change operation in Iraq and Iran. In a bombshell exposé in 2007, Clark recounted heading to the Pentagon 10 days after the 9/11 attacks, where he was allegedly shown a plan that outlined US military action aimed at “taking out seven countries in five years”. The regimes staring down the gun’s barrel were: Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Iran.
Now, one could argue that Clark was lying, that he was fabricating the existence of these scandalous documents, and that the architecture of the so-called Terror Wars was not at all choreographed in the dark rooms of the Pentagon years in advance. Making such an argument, of course, would have to involve the colossal task of explaining away over 20 years of American military excursions in the Middle East.
For the next couple of decades, the American war machine ticked off nearly every country listed in the Pentagon memo like items off a grocery list. Wherever there was the slightest inkling of pretext, the wrath of Empire, ruthless and swift as it is, made sure to follow. Where there wasn’t, it was simply manufactured all the same. Twenty years on, almost every regime on Clark’s list — from Saddam’s Iraq to Assad’s Syria — has either fallen or has been rendered, for all intents and purposes, defunct. All, save for one.
And so for Bibi, Iran is the coup de grâce of a political strategy more than 25 years in the making. The early-morning strikes and the hawkish rhetoric that followed are not solely about Iran’s nuclear centrifuges. It’s about a near-perfect execution of the Empire’s nefarious design in the Middle East — one that has moulded and sculpted the contours of Netanyahu’s politics, and one he’s remained remarkably devoted to for much, if not all, of his public career.
With domestic and international patience for his crimes in Gaza wearing thin, Netanyahu knows his days at the Knesset are numbered. On top of that, the regime in Tehran is uniquely exposed, perhaps for the first time. Iranian air defences have been battered over the past year. So, too, has its axis of deterrence that it built up over decades by arming both Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, and a swath of smaller proxies across Syria and Yemen.
These shifts in the strategic environment have opened a window for action at much lower risk to both the Jewish state and its benefactor across the Atlantic than at any time since the Iran-Iraq war of the eighties. It’s a dwindling moment Netanyahu cannot afford to let by. And so after 30 painstaking years of waiting, the stars have finally aligned for the Israeli prime minister and the American foreign policy establishment. There’s just one Trump-sized problem.
The final play
Time and again, Trump has made it clear that a war with Iran is the furthest thing from his foreign policy agenda. Whether it be deploying his fixer Steve Witkoff to broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas before even kicking off his presidency, or explicitly warning the Israelis against a unilateral attack that would short-circuit his outreach for diplomacy, Trump appeared to be sticking to his guns (as ironic as the expression may be) on avoiding a catastrophic war in the Middle East at any cost. Sure, a baseline resistance to war is not too much to ask for, but in the high halls of Pennsylvania Avenue, it’s as good as it gets.
The streets were chirping with speculation of a potential rift between the American president and Bibi Netanyahu in the weeks leading up to the attack. When the President decided to play dealmaker in his most recent tour to the Middle East, and notably left out Israel from his travel list, the media took it as a telltale sign of a chasm between the Oval Office and the Knesset. More damaging still, US negotiations with Iran and Yemen’s Houthi rebels — two of Israel’s most bitter regional adversaries — proceeded without any visible Israeli involvement, despite Jerusalem’s long-standing insistence on being central to all Middle Eastern diplomacy. As international condemnation for the genocide in Gaza reached fever pitch, the diplomatic cold shoulder was made even more apparent when Vice President JD Vance abruptly cancelled his trip to Israel over supposed “logistical issues” — largely taken as diplomatic speak for ‘we’d rather not be seen with you right now.’

This presented Netanyahu with a glaring problem. Starting catastrophic wars may come as second nature to him, but without Uncle Sam’s military hardware and diplomatic cover, he risks bumbling Israel into an ill-advised war of attrition with Iran. And unlike Iraq and Libya, Iran is no pushover. The regime in Tehran has weathered four decades of crippling sanctions, international isolation, and constant saber-rattling and so far, has lived to tell the tale.
As the civilian death toll rises, the people of Iran will naturally rally around the flag, gutting any further hopes of an internal mobilisation against the Ayatollah. This matters as the play was never about Iran using a bomb to attack Israel — which would be suicidal — but rather that an Iranian bomb would limit Israel’s (and therefore the United States’) manoeuvrability to dominate the region with impunity. And so for Israel to assume the throne of regional hegemony, it would need to find a way to derail Trump’s push for diplomacy.
And herein lies the bard: Netanyahu’s appetite for regional conflagration consistently outpaces Israel’s actual capacity to deliver it. So in the face of a closing window, what could the Israeli premier do to not only spark the war he always wanted, but outplay the American president by blowing up his negotiations with Tehran and ensnare him into a conflict he clearly doesn’t seem to want? Once Netanyahu’s ordeal is framed in this light, his strategic math begins to add up. In finally striking Iran, Netanyahu has presented the White House with a fait accompli that would be politically impossible to reverse.
The elegance of the gambit, from Netanyahu’s perspective, lies in its simplicity. Each Iranian response to Israeli provocation creates a new crisis that demands American involvement. Once the conflict rises up the escalation ladder — and it will — Trump will be faced with an impossible choice: commit political suicide at home by abandoning America’s most reliable project in the Middle East, or betray his base of ‘America First’ conservatives by tossing the country into yet another foreign entanglement. Watching Israel go it alone while America stands on the sidelines would be tantamount to a political crucifixion at home for Trump.
Netanyahu understands this as well as anyone, and knows that once blood is spilt and the President’s credibility is perceived to be on the line, the original question of whether the war was wise becomes irrelevant. By lighting the fuse on a regional powder keg, Netanyahu has effectively cornered the leader of the Free World into becoming his partner in international war crimes. Hence, this is a war, not of necessity, but of calculated provocation — a masterclass in forcing the hand of a reluctant superpower and bending it to your will. After all, what’s the point of being America’s indispensable ally if you can’t occasionally make yourself truly indispensable?
Whether Trump really was blindsided by Netanyahu’s actions on Friday or whether he was using diplomatic leverage with the Iranians as a ruse to double-cross them while the Israelis took their shot will be a debate that will rage on long after the dust settles on Trump’s presidential stint. For the President today, it’s a zero-sum game. Either he admits to being blindsided by Netanyahu and runs the risk of appearing incompetent, or he admits to being in lockstep with the Israeli prime minister and alienates his most ardent supporters at a time he needs all the political capital he can muster. Regardless, the ball now firmly rests in Trump’s court. The Israelis have reportedly invited the administration to join the war effort, and in doing so, handed the President the single greatest test of his life — one that will go on to define his legacy for generations to come.
Tough choices
Where the buck falls in this conflict will now largely depend on what Trump decides to do from here on out. Initially, Secretary of State Marco Rubio was quick to dismiss Jerusalem’s onslaught as “unilateral action”. “We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region,” Rubio maintained. At first, the administration appeared to hold its ground, declining Netanyahu’s increasingly frantic invitations for kinetic collaboration and maintaining the pretence that America had nothing to do with Friday’s fireworks.
But cracks in the MAGA (Make America Great Again) camp are already beginning to show. As the two countries climb the escalation ladder and the legacy media work in overdrive to sell American involvement to the people, Trump seems to be capitulating to the oldest con in the Washington playbook: the manufactured crisis that demands American intervention. The pressure is mounting from all the usual suspects — defence contractors salivating over potential windfalls, congressional hawks encircling the Oval Office and dusting off their war drums, and keyboard warriors seeking to monetise a conflict they don’t fully understand.
It is enough pressure to crush the staunchest of pacifists, and Trump is the furthest thing from an ideologue. Buckling under domestic duress, he seems to be abandoning his initial position of non-involvement for a tone of reluctant endorsement, committing intelligence and logistical aid to the Israeli war effort.
“We knew everything, and I tried to save Iran from humiliation and death. I tried to save them very hard because I would have loved to have seen a deal worked out,” Trump has said. His shifting stance around the Israeli strikes, which he has called “excellent” and “very successful”, and his sheer inability to restrain Netanyahu, is a dark omen for what could come next. Playing right into Netanyahu’s hands in this manner is likely to further alienate the Iranians, making any prospect of a diplomatic solution politically impossible for Tehran, and boxing America into yet another foreign war.
It is said that President Kennedy also encountered a similar dilemma at the outset of his presidency in 1961. Shortly upon entering office, the young president found himself staring down the barrel of a half-baked CIA operation that had all the strategic sophistication of a college prank. The Bay of Pigs invasion was, by any reasonable assessment, a spectacularly misguided adventure — a ragtag group of Cuban exiles, armed with outdated weapons and deployed into the Bay of Pigs to topple a seasoned revolutionary in Castro who had already proven his mettle against far superior forces.

Yet the CIA’s game plan was to let the operation proceed as planned. When it inevitably collapsed into chaos, Kennedy would have no choice but to authorise full-scale American military intervention to save face and salvage what remained of American credibility.
It was political chess of the highest order — a deliberate failure designed to manufacture the very crisis that would justify a war the Agency had wanted all along. Once the new President’s fingerprints were on the operation, backing down would mean accepting humiliation on a global stage. The choice was binary — double down with American firepower, or watch the Free World’s credibility crumble in the Caribbean surf. Today, Netanyahu is taking a page out of the same playbook.
Ultimately, Kennedy called the CIA’s bluff, refusing to commit to a war with no strategic payoff for any stakeholder involved. It would bode well for America and the world at large for Trump to do the same.

When asked about the meeting between Qasier with Pervaiz Ashraf, he said it was the former NA speaker’s “personal choice” and not on the instructions of the party or Imran Khan.
“Nothing is official. There is no indication we are heading for an alliance,” he said during an appearance on Dawn News TV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’.
Former National Assembly speaker and PTI leader Asad Qaiser had told Dawn that PPP leader Abdul Qadir Patel, in his speech, said that his party will not support the money bill. He later contacted PPP leader and former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf and sought support to block the bill.
Zafar said Qaiser took an initiative but it is does mean talks were held on a party level but rather between two MNAs.
He said the budget is riddled with inaccuracies and several parties are considering to refrain from voting, saying that the PTI has decided that it will not vote for the budget.
“We have already decided not to vote for the budget. If the PPP doesn’t vote then the budget won’t pass and government will be compelled to rectify,” he said.
He said the PPP claims it won’t support the budget but changes their stance. “Our stance is clear. We think the budget is anti-people and we support the public.”
Zafar said the statements by PPP senators and lawmakers suggesting they have reservations and won’t support the budget. “If any party is not supporting the budget then it’s welcoming but we have no contact to make a decision together,”
Regarding the PTI decision on the postpone the protest against the government, he said there has been no delay as the date wasn’t announced and the party needs to form a strategy and present it before the party founder.
Dar trying to address coalition partner’s concerns, confirms PPP’s Shazia Marri
Amid a rift between the PPP and the ruling PML-N over the reservations regarding the federal budget, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has been making efforts to address the coalition partner’s concerns, PPP’s Shazia Marri has confirmed.
Lawmakers belonging to the PPP have criticised federal budget for the next fiscal year, lambasting the federal government over its alleged discriminatory policies towards the party-ruled Sindh province. This comes amid reports the PTI has reached out to PPP to block the passage of the budget.
Speaking on the show earlier, Marri confirmed that Dar is in contact and holding talks with the party to address reservations over the budget.
The PPP leader said Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah virtually participated in a parliamentary meeting and raised the provincial government’s concerns over the budget.
She maintained that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif desires to address the coalition partner’s concerns but the finance team is creating obstacles.
“The world is moving towards clean energy but the government is imposing sales tax on solar panels,” she said, welcoming the decision of the Senate and National Assembly standing committees to reject the proposed solar tax.
She said the Public Works Department (PWD) was abolished by the PM and schemes were transferred to the provinces. However, she expressed concerns the schemes for Sindh were not transferred but rather handed over to the Centre.
She further said objections were raised over the funds allocated for the Higher Education Commission (HEC), saying that Rs4.8 billion were initially earmarked for universities in Sindh but the amount was reduced to Rs2.8bn.
 


Marri expressed hope the prime minister whom she said they have a working relationship for the past year and half will divert attention to allay their concerns.
“He [Shehbaz] encouraged solar power but his team imposed an 18pc tax. Similarly, the issue of funds for universities approved by the National Economic Council but withdrawn. Another regarding the PWD, there are clear directives from the prime minister.
“We hope the chief executive will divert attention to these issues. We have raised our voice on the floor of the House regarding the injustices. There are three main demands which was completely justified.”
When asked if the PPP will speak to the PTI, he said the opposition party wants to instigate and the PPP will not be part of any propaganda but rather believes in constructive criticism and reforms.
Asked if the government is heading in a dangerous direction, “It is a dangerous direction if three provinces are treated differently. It’s dangerous if the Punjab’s cities are on one side and Sindh’s cities are handed over to the Centre.
“This is dangerous for Pakistan,” she said.</p><small>2025-06-18 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1813145719d1f36.jpg?r=131704' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917881/sherry-rehman-assails-centre-for-slashing-climate-funds-in-fy26-budget' target='_blank'><strong>Sherry Rehman assails Centre for slashing climate funds in FY26 budget</strong></a><br><p>Former climate change minister, PPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman, assailed the federal government on Wednesday for slashing funds for environment protection in the upcoming budget for fiscal year 2025-2026.
The federal government has earmarked a major chunk of next year’s budget for climate-resilient development, but its failure to set a clear course of action and policy contradictions weigh heavily on financial allocations that amount to hundreds of billions.
The budget under the head of ‘environment protection’ has also reduced from Rs7.2billion to Rs3.1bn, with funds for ‘pollution abatement’ going down from Rs6.29bn to Rs3.1bn.
“As far as climate is concerned, I am disappointed to share that in the environment protection budget, which used to be Rs7.2bn — which was already quite low — has now been slashed by more than half to Rs3.1bn.
What will we do with this money? We will start depending more and more on international money. There have already been aid cuts in climate funding internationally,“ Senator Rehman said.
She continued that the people are under severe hardship as temperatures continue to rise.
“Currently, [the temperature] stands at 49 degrees Celsius in parts of Balochistan and Sindh. In other countries, when the temperature nears 40°C, a national emergency is declared,” Rehman noted.
“Last year, Jacobabad in Sindh saw 50°C. It will only continue to rise from here onwards. Pakistan has recorded 53°C in the past three years in different cities in the south — in Balochistan and Sindh,” she added.
She said that this meant that Pakistan was becoming the hottest place on the planet, adding that she had been speaking about this issue for four to five years now.
She said that Pakistan in the past two weeks has ranked as the most climate-vulnerable country in the world.
The Climate Risk Index (CRI), published by Germanwatch, ranks countries by the human and economic toll of extreme weather. The latest edition highlights increasing losses and the urgent need for stronger climate resilience and action.
Pakistan was ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, followed by Belize and Italy, according to data in the 2025 CRI report released by Germanwatch in February.
Pakistan’s ranking was mainly due to the unprecedented floods in 2022, mainly caused by record-breaking monsoon rainfall, Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs), and other factors.
The report highlighted that over 33 million people were affected and over 1,700 lives were lost due to the floods. It also says that climate change made the severity of extreme monsoon rainfall increase by 50 per cent.
In March, the Paki­stan Meteorological Depar­tment (PMD) also issued a drought alert for Sindh, Balochistan and Punjab due to scant rainfall.</p><small>2025-06-18 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/18113402e680154.jpg?r=114926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917877/modi-maintains-there-was-no-us-mediation-in-ceasefire-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Modi maintains there was no US mediation in ceasefire with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained in a conversation with US President Donald Trump late on Tuesday that a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict in May was achieved through talks between the two militaries and not US mediation, India’s senior-most diplomat said.
Trump had said last month that the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours agreed to a ceasefire after talks mediated by the US, and that the hostilities ended after he urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.
“PM Modi told President Trump clearly that during this period, there was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-US trade deal or US mediation between India and Pakistan,” Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said in a press statement.
“Talks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted mediation in the past and will never do,” he said.
Misri claimed that the two leaders spoke over the phone at the insistence of Trump on the sidelines of the G7 summit in Canada, which Modi attended as a guest. The call lasted 35 minutes.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Modi-Trump call.
Pakistan has previously said that the ceasefire happened after its military returned a call the Indian military had initiated on May 7.
In the wake of last month’s ceasefire, President Trump had offered to resolve the Kashmir issue, calling it a “thousand-year-old” conflict. India maintains its long-standing position that the issue of Kashmir is a bilateral matter with no room for third-party involvement.
“As President Trump has stated, everyone has the right to define its own future. He offers his help, and it’s up to whoever he is offering it to, to whether or not they’ll accept it,” said State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, when asked about Ind­ia’s continued refusal to engage with Trump’s repeated mediation offers.</p><small>2025-06-18 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/181122244715906.jpg?r=121905' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917876/karachis-millennium-mall-fire-almost-doused-after-500-shops-damaged-rescue-official' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi’s Millennium Mall fire almost doused after 500 shops damaged: rescue official</strong></a><br><p>A massive blaze that erupted in Millennium Mall located on Karachi’s Rashid Minhas Road on Tuesday, destroying over 500 shops, is almost doused by firefighters after several hours of hectic efforts, a rescue official said.
In November of 2023, city planners, engineers and experts of building plans at a symposium were sure that some 90 per cent of all structures in Karachi — residential, commercial and industrial — did not have a fire prevention and firefighting system.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn.com that the rescue team arrived at the mall within 15 minutes of receiving information of the fire at 4:06am. There, a security guard informed them that the fire had erupted inside surveillance system of a control room due to a short circuit on the third floor.
The spokesperson was of the view that perhaps the mall management had initially overlooked the fire.
When the firemen arrived there, the fire had spread onto the roof of the mall, where chillers were being kept as it was centrally air conditioned. This intensified the fire and heavy flames emanating from it touched the windows of the nearby Saima Mall and Residency building, triggering fears of a fire there.
 
 

However, 12 fire tenders, with the help of two snorkels, managed to control the fire after hectic efforts lasting for several hours. Cooling work is still continuing.
Khan said it might take two more hours to completely extinguish the fire. He elaborated that the fire has been extinguished by up to 90 per cent, adding that it is taking a long time because of the presence of large objects inside shops. Firefighters are searching every shop to extinguish any flames there.
He said that the third floor of the three-storey building was completely destroyed, while the first and second floor were partially damaged. There were more than 150 shops on each floor.
He estimated that around 500-600 shops were badly destroyed, causing significant financial losses, but no injuries were reported.</p><small>2025-06-18 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/181207492675dea.jpg?r=121024' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1917783/pakistan-to-play-entire-womens-world-cup-campaign-in-colombo-confirms-icc' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to play entire Women’s World Cup campaign in Colombo, confirms ICC</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Tuesday unveiled the schedule for the ICC Women’s World Cup, to be jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka from September 30 to November 2.
Pakistan will commence their campaign on October 2 against Bangladesh at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, where all their group-stage matches are set to be played.
This arrangement is in line with the hybrid model announced by the ICC last year.
Led by all-rounder Fatima Sana, Pakistan qualified for the eight-team event after an unbeaten run in the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier, held in here earlier this year.
 
 

Pakistan’s highly anticipated clash with arch-rivals India is scheduled for October 5, followed by encounters against defending champions Australia on October 8 and 2017 champions England on October 15.
The national side will then face New Zealand (October 18), South Africa (October 21), and co-hosts Sri Lanka (October 24) to conclude their round-robin stage.
If Pakistan secure a semi-final berth, they will play the knockout fixture on October 29 in Colombo. The final, slated for November 2, will also be hosted in the Sri Lankan capital should Pakistan qualify.
However, if the team does not progress beyond the group stage, the semi-final and final will be held in Guwahati and Bengaluru, respectively.
As per the ICC, all participating teams will feature in two warm-up matches beginning September 24.

Well-placed sources said PTI had neither reversed the 50pc salary cuts imposed on Central Secretariat staff since October last year, nor had it cleared overdue dues despite repeated promises, leaving the employees in deep distress.
The affected staffers said the party leadership broke its promise by neither restoring reduced salaries nor releasing any of the withheld half-pay despite nine months having passed. They said the leadership’s callousness was evident in dismissing several loyal employees who endured detention and torture, instead of recognising their sacrifices.
 
 

Sources said that while the party leadership continued to enjoy all perks and privileges, they were unwilling to spend a single penny on the party, only doing so when their leader Imran Khan was present to witness it.
They lamented that PTI lawmakers, who once branded treasury legislators as oppressive, warmly embraced them to secure their own massive salary hikes exposing the leadership’s glaring double standards. The sources added that months ago a senior party leader admitted that the PTI had received Rs3 million to clear outstanding dues for its media team, but no action was taken yet to resolve the issue.
Another staffer remarked that while the party and its leadership often condemned government injustices, the PTI itself had failed to deliver justice to its own employees.
He stated that last year PTI Patron-in-Chief Imran Khan had directed all provincial and national assembly ticket holders, successful or not, to contribute Rs240,000 annually, either as a lump sum or in two installments, to support the party secretariat’s operations. Despite being told sufficient funds were collected, the staffer stated that nothing had been done to ease the employees’ hardships.
“We informed top leaders, including Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas, Raoof Hasan and Shibli Faraz, but to no avail, as each deflected responsibility, distanced themselves from the issue, and refused to act,” he said.
The staffers alleged that the party leadership used PTI Additional Secretary General Firdous Shamim Naqvi to fire employees, who did not have direct connection with the staffers, in an apparent attempt to deflect blame and avoid accountability.
A senior leader, wishing not to be named, said it was correct that a month ago Rs3 million were collected for the salaries of the media team and Secretariat staff.
“It is also a fact that the party has been facing severe financial crunch. People have even stopped or reduced funding to Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre fearing that it may trigger anger of unseen forces. However, it is a matter of embarrassment for the PTI that pending salaries, which is a small amount, could not be paid to staff,” he said.
 
 

When contacted, Head of PTI Think-Tank Raoof Hasan said he was looking into the issue to ensure that the pending salaries would be paid to the staff. “However, I am not in the loop at the moment,” he added.
Party’s Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram told Dawn that he had written to the party that pending salaries should be paid and the salary be restored.
“There is a gap of four months and I am trying my best to address the issue. I fully support the Secretariat staff which stood with us in thick and thin,” he said.

Taking part in the general debate on the federal budget in the National Assembly, almost every PPP member delivered a similar speech in which they highlighted the “injustices and excesses” being committed by the Centre with the Sindh province by denying its due share in the development plans.
Members of MQM-Pakistan, another key partner in the ruling coalition, also expressed their reservations on meagre allocations for various projects in Sindh, but at the same time they also targeted the PPP-led Sindh government, accusing it of ignoring Karachi.
PPP lawmakers mainly protested over “failure” of the federal government in handing over the projects which were being carried out by now-defunct Public Works Department (PWD) to the Sindh government.
 







PPP, MQM-P lawmakers clash over Sindh politics; ex-PM Gilani’s son seeks ‘liberation’ from ‘Takht-i-Lahore’ yoke

They recalled that it had already been decided that all projects handled by the PWD would be handed over to provinces, but unlike the three other provinces, the decision was not being applied in Sindh.
On the other hand, MQM-P lawmakers supported the federal government’s move of not handing over the projects to the Sindh government, fearing that the provincial government might not be able to complete them.
 
 

The house witnessed verbal skirmishes between the PPP and the MQM-P lawmakers over the issue during the debate as both the parties accused each other of playing a role in “Karachi’s destruction”.
The MQM-P members protested over Shazia Marri’s speech when she indirectly hit out at the party, stating that they would not allow anyone to separate Karachi from Sindh as “Karachi is not the personal property of anyone”.
Aasia Ishaque of the MQM-P was seen going towards the PPP benches to register her protest and a number of PPP leaders stood up in their seats to prevent any possibility of a physical clash as Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari was also sitting next to Ms Marri.
MQM’s Nikhat Shakil alleged that both the federal as well as the Sindh governments were ignoring Karachi. She was of the view that if the federal government was taking responsibility of completing some projects in Sindh, then the PPP should not make hue and cry.
However, Rai Hassan Nawaz of the PTI termed the PPP-MQM rift a drama, stating that at present the two parties were criticising the federal budget but at the end of the day, both of them would vote for the budget.
 






PPP’s Sadiq Memon said it was true that his party was a partner in the ruling coalition and holding some constitutional offices, but it also had the mandate of the people of Sindh.
PPP’s Abdul Qadir Gilani decried the Punjab government’s discriminatory policy towards south Punjab, stating that sense of deprivation is increasing among the people in the region.
He regretted that only three development schemes had been announced for south Punjab region whereas some 40 plans had been announced for Lahore and central Punjab.
“I don’t know when will we get rid of Takht-i- Lahore [Lahore Kingdom]? But we will continue our struggle,” said Mr Gilani, who is the son of Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, in an apparent reference to the demand for a separate South Punjab province.
The National Assembly will meet again today (Wednesday) at 11am.

• Omar Ayub insists tariff structure altered under IMF pressure
• Nafisa Shah slams ‘martial law-style’ FBR enforcement measures
ISLAMABAD: In a rare show of unity, parliamentary committees on Tues­day unanimously rejected the proposed 18 per cent sales tax on imported solar panels and recommended lowering tax rates on sma­ller cars to ease the burden on low-income groups.
The Senate and Natio­nal Assembly Standing Co­m­m­ittees on Finance and Revenue held parallel sessions at Parlia­ment House to conduct a clause-by-clause review of the Finance Bill 2025-26.
Both panels, chaired by Senator Saleem Mandvi­walla and MNA Naveed Qamar, respectively, proposed amendments and rejected several measures outright.
 






Federal Board of Rev­enue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Lan­grial defended the solar tax, arguing it would protect domestic manufacturers. However, lawmakers pointed out that solar panels are not produced locally and questioned the need for early protectionist measures.
Mr Qamar and other members warned that taxing solar imports now would limit access to aff­ordable renewable ene­rgy and increase electri­city costs. Mirza Ikhtiar Baig asked why the government would want to deprive the public of cheaper power solutions.
The National Assem­bly committee members also alleged that ahead of the budget, certain stakeholders had imp­orted and dumped solar equipment in anticipation of the tax hike.
Following deliberati­ons, members across party lines agreed to scrap the tax proposal, emphasising that solar panels remain vital for providing affordable electricity.
Pakistan is rapidly emerging as a key leader in solar power deployment. The country has boosted solar electricity generation by over three times the global average so far this year, fuelled by a more than fivefold rise in solar capacity imports since 2022, Reuters said, quoting data from the energy think tank Ember.
That combination of rapidly rising capacity and generation has propelled solar power from Pakistan’s fifth-largest electricity source in 2023 to its largest in 2025.
So far in 2025, solar power has accounted for 25pc of Pakistan’s utility-supplied electricity, which makes it one of fewer than 20 nations globally that have sourced a quarter or more of monthly electricity supplies from solar farms.
Small cars, big tax
The Senate committee also expressed serious concern over the increase in GST from 12pc to 18pc on small vehicles, including 850cc cars.
Mr Mandviwalla called the 18pc sales tax on a Rs3 million vehicle “unfair”, a sentiment echoed by several senators. Proposals were discussed to moderate the tax to 14pc or 15pc instead.
 
 

Senator Shibli Faraz criticised the inequity, noting that while tax relief is being extended to certain regions, small car owners continue to face high taxation.
However, the committee approved a sales tax exemption on aircraft imports as part of PIA privatisation.
The panels were briefed on proposed changes in the tax fraud definition, which has now been divided into two categories. If a suspect poses a flight risk, authorities will proceed to arrest them.
Additionally, individuals involved in record tampering or who fail to respond to three official notices will also face detention.
The FBR will establish a three-member board to review cases before approving arrests.
No arrests will be made for tax fraud cases involving amounts below Rs50 million.
‘IMF pressure’
During the session, MNA Omar Ayub rema­rked that the tariff structure had been altered under IMF pressure.
On the issue of curbing the sale of illegal cigarettes, the FBR proposed granting law enforcement agencies and the district administration the authority to act against the perpetrators.
However, committee members voiced concerns over potential corruption, arguing that delegating such powers could fuel bribery.
FBR Chairman Langrial insisted that enforcement powers must be given to police and local authorities to effectively tackle tax evasion in the tobacco sector.
The committee members pushed back, warning that such a move could open doors to extortion and suggesting that enforcement remain solely under FBR’s jurisdiction. In a sharp retort, Mr Langrial remarked, “Are our officials somehow incorruptible?”
A heated exchange unfolded during the meeting between MNA Nafisa Shah and the FBR chief. Ms Shah criticised the enforcement measures, likening them to “martial law-style regulations”, asserting such actions cannot be justified under any circumstances.
Mr Langrial defended his position, stating, “I serve a democratic government.” He expressed disapproval over Ms Shah’s remarks, noting that using terms associated with martial law was inappropriate.
In response, Ms Shah insisted on her right to free speech, emphasising that, as a member of the National Assembly, she holds the authority to voice her opinions. “You may defend your institution, but we will exercise our right to express ourselves,” she said.
While the federal government aims to levy sales tax on digital services, provincial authorities have expressed reservations, citing their existing 15pc service tax on such businesses. However, FBR officials argued that taxation on online sales falls outside provincial jurisdiction.
From the next fiscal year, iron scrap importers will be obligated to sell only to registered manufacturers. Officials said this measure aims to eliminate the misuse of “flying invoices” and commercial manipulation in scrap trade.

The Karandaaz Financial Inclu­sion Survey showed that 35pc of respondents had access to digital financial services (DFS) — a bank account, a mobile wallet account or a non-bank financial institution account — in 2024 compared to just 7pc in 2014.
The male financial inclusion stood at 56pc compared to just 14pc for women.
The data is based on a survey conducted in 6,624 households ac­­ross four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

Only 14pc women have access to financial services compared to 56pc men

The survey aimed to highlight access to and demand for financial services, especially DFS, among key underserved groups (females, poor, rural, etc.) and identify barriers to further adoption of DFS, Kaarandaz said. In terms of financial inclusion by region, Punjab has the highest level with 40pc, followed by Islamabad 38pc and GB 33pc.
Gender gap
The male financial inclusion re­­corded an increase of 45 percentage points from 11pc in 2014. However, for women, the increase was only 11 percentage points, up from 3pc in 2014.
The financial inclusion ratio for men and women in Punjab was 62pc and 17pc, respectively. In Sindh, it was 43pc and 9pc, in KP 49pc and 29pc, in Islamabad 64pc and 38pc, in GB 53pc and 33pc, in Balochistan 41pc and 4pc and in AJK 48pc and 1pc.
While 28pc men reported having a bank account in 2024, only 6pc of women had one.
Overall, the most significant increase was in the adoption of mobile wallets — from 0.3pc in 2014 to 30pc in 2014.
However, a stark gender gap persisted, with 48pc of men having registered mobile money wallet accounts in 2024, compared to only 11pc of women.
Several other social factors, inclu­ding literacy and access to technology, hinder women’s financial inclusion. As per the data, mobile phone ownership in Pakistan has increased from 54pc in 2014 to 64pc in 2024.
 
 

While women’s ownership rose from 29pc to 46pc, the gender gap remained stark as male ownership reached 82pc in 2024.
In terms of having a registered SIM card in their name, only 47pc of women reported having one, compared to 78pc of men.
SIM ownership is crucial for accessing financial services, as registered numbers are required to open accounts and receive transaction codes.

“As President Trump has stated, [everyone] has the right to define its own future. He offers his help, and it’s up to whoever he is offering it to, to whether or not they’ll accept it,” said State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce, when asked about Ind­ia’s continued refusal to engage with Trump’s repeated mediation offers.
This clarification indicates that while the Trump administration is open to playing a role in defusing South Asian tensions — especially in the wake of last month’s air combat bet­ween India and Pakistan that brought the region close to a nuclear crisis — it also recognises the limits of US influence.
 






President Trump has referred to Kashmir as a “thousand-year-old” conflict and has publicly offered to help resolve it on multiple occasions in recent weeks. India, however, maintains its long-standing position that Kashmir is a bilateral matter with no room for third-party involvement.
“I wouldn’t speak to the nature of another country’s decision-making. That’s up to them,” Ms Bruce added, suggesting a hands-off approach regarding India’s internal calculus.
 
 

“We live in a fascinating, exciting time where we got a man who can make the difference and he’s generous about making that difference. He could have chosen to have his term be about anything other than peace and making America great again, but he is stuck with that,” she said.
Ms Bruce’s comments confirm that the US views mediation as an available option — not a strategic imperative. Her enthusiastic endorsement of the president’s intentions suggests continued interest from the White House in remaining engaged with the issue.
“So, I wouldn’t speak to the nature of another country’s decision-making. That’s up to them, but, I think, all of us are grateful that we have a president who is willing to help, and wants to help,” Ms Bruce said.
The remarks fall short of putting pressure on either party, but they underscore a persistent US desire to help reduce tensions in the region — even if India remains unmoved by the US offer.

After a nod from the Trump administration, the Zionist state last Friday unleashed multiple strikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities and military installations.
With Iran fiercely responding to the unwarranted aggression, the conflict has escalated into a full-blown war between the two countries, which could spread to the entire region and beyond. The possibility of the US getting involved directly to help Israel has made the situation extremely volatile.
President Donald Trump’s statement on social media that “everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran” leaves little doubt of America’s direct participation in the war. A president who claims to be anti-war is now driving America into yet another catastrophic military adventure, plunging the world into further chaos. Trump has long made his position clear: he will not involve America in other countries’ wars. But America is now entering a conflict whose outcome it cannot determine.
 
 

According to some media reports, pressed by Israeli leaders Washington might decide to supply the Zionist state with the 13,600-kilogram ‘bunker-busting’ bombs. These may help Israel destroy the deep underground Iranian nuclear facilities but will not produce the desired objective of forcing Iran to surrender. To the contrary, such a move would imperil any remaining chance of a negotiated nuclear deal with Iran that the US president insists he is still interested in pursuing. “I think Iran basically is at the negotiating table, they want to make a deal,” Trump said in a post on social media on Monday.
As academic and former State Department member Vali Nasr said it is ‘war diplomacy’. There is no indication that Iran will accept any deal in the shadow of war. In fact, it was Israel’s attack that scuttled the ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the Trump administration. The two delegations were supposed to meet in Oman for the next round of talks; the previous rounds are believed to have made some progress.
But Israel’s attack on Iran just days before the scheduled meeting derailed the negotiations. It had been the first high-level engagement between the US and Iran since 2018. That year, Donald Trump, during his first presidency, had opted to withdraw his country from the 2015 nuclear agreement, promising to get a “better deal”. While the Iranian delegation was headed by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, America was being represented by Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff. The fact that the two sides had agreed to meet again ostensibly demonstrated serious intent on both sides.
But Israel was never in favour of a negotiated nuclear deal and had long been pressing the US for military action to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities which had been operating under the strict eye of the IAEA, the international nuclear watchdog. It was also the reason Israel opposed the 2015 agreement, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The accord was signed by Iran and six world powers, including the US, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany.
The annulment of the accord by the first Trump presidency was a serious setback to any peaceful solution to the complicated problem. Iran has repeatedly denied plans to acquire a nuclear weapon. It was a well-calculated move by Israel to attack Iran at a time when the Islamic Republic appeared to have weakened after the loss of its allies in Lebanon and Syria. Although Washington has distanced itself from Israel’s military action, the secretary of state conceded that the administration had prior knowledge of the attack.

The US is now entering a conflict whose outcome it cannot determine.

Western countries have endorsed the Israeli aggression as preventive action to end Iran’s nuclear weapons programme. Not surprisingly, an otherwise fractious Western alliance is united behind Israel’s illegal war. In a joint statement, the G7 leaders, who just met in Canada, reiterated their support “for the security of Israel” and described Iran as “the principal source of regional instability and terror”. This exposes the West’s hypocrisy and double standards. These countries are not only supporting Israel’s naked aggression against Iran, they are also condoning the Zionist state’s genocidal war in Gaza.
The Trump administration has now been drawn into the war. With American backing, Israel has expanded its attacks to the civilian population, leaving hundreds of Iranians dead. According to some reports, Israel plans to kill Iran’s supreme leader. The two countries have been locked in conflict for the past several decades but had not had a full-fledged war until now.
It is certainly the fiercest confrontation in the history of Israel-Iran conflict. Over the last few days of war, Iran has demonstrated its military prowess by firing hundreds of ballistic missiles deep inside Israel causing damage to infrastructure there as well as killing civilians. Israel has not seen such devastation at home in any war it has fought in the past. Israel’s air and cyber strikes may have crippled some of Iran’s military capacity but the latter country can still fight a prolonged war. Despite its massive military superiority, Israel still has not been able to achieve its main objective of knocking out Iran’s nuclear development programme.
Meanwhile, Israel’s strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities have sparked concerns about the risk of nuclear contamination. IAEA head Rafael Grossi has warned of possible radiological and chemical contamination from damaged nuclear facilities in Iran.
The war will change the political map of the Middle East but not in the way the US wants. It’s a lesson that America has failed to draw from its previous wars in the Middle East. Direct American involvement would mean boots on the ground that could enflame the entire region. Tehran has already warned against US participation in the conflict and has threatened to target American interests in the region. It’s the beginning of an unending war with far-reaching implications for global security.

• Worst death toll in a single day since aid resumed in May
CAIRO: Israeli tanks fired into a crowd trying to get aid from trucks in Gaza on Tuesday, killing at least 59 people, according to medics, in one of the bloodiest incidents yet as desperate residents struggle for food.
Medics said at least 14 other people were also killed by Israeli gunfire and air strikes elsewhere in the densely populated enclave, taking Tuesday’s overall death toll to at least 73.
Video shared on social media showed around a dozen mangled bodies lying in a street in Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza Strip. The Israeli military acknowledged firing in the area and said it was looking into the incident.
Witnesses interviewed by Reuters said Israeli tanks had launched at least two shells at a crowd of thousands who had gathered on the main eastern road through Khan Yunis in the hope of obtaining food from aid trucks that use the route.
Palestinian medics said at least 59 people were killed and 221 wounded in the incident, at least 20 of them in critical condition. Casualties were being rushed into the hospital in civilian cars, rickshaws and donkey carts. It was the worst death toll in a single day since aid resumed in Gaza in May.
In a statement, the Israeli military said: “Earlier today, a gathering was identified adjacent to an aid distribution truck that got stuck in the area of Khan Yunis, and in proximity to IDF troops operating in the area.
The health ministry said 397 Palestinians, among those trying to get food aid, had been killed and more than 3,000 were wounded since late May.

This was announced by Mr Khan’s sisters, Noreen Niazi and Uzma, after they met their brother in Adiala Jail on Tuesday.
Mr Khan’s third sister, Aleema, was not allowed to meet her brother.
 






Talking to the media, Ms Niazi said her brother was “well aware of the international situation” and said that Pakistan should remain united during Iran-Israel war.
Ms Uzma said the world already knew about Mr Khan’s stance against Israel.
Earlier, Mr Khan had called upon his supporters to start preparations for countrywide protests after Eidul Azha.
PTI Central Infor­mation Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram also confirmed that Mr Khan has delayed the protests for two weeks.
“We are passing through very sensitive time. So it has been decided that the party will not hold any protest for two weeks,” Mr Akram told Dawn.
Raoof Hasan, the head of PTI’s political think tank, stated the global situation, particularly in the Middle East, was rapidly changing.
“It is the need of time to stop all kinds of protests and give a message that the whole nation is united,” he added.

This funding will support humanitarian organisations working inside Afghanistan with over 141m euros, while also responding to the needs of Afghan citizens and refugees in Pakistan and Iran, with 10m euros allocated per country.
The announcement comes as senior representatives of the humanitarian community gathered in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss Afghanistan’s current situation, main challenges, and ways forward.
 
 

The EU Commissioner for Equality, Preparedness and Crisis Management, Hadja Lahbib, said: “As the Afghan people continue to face numerous hardships, both within Afghanistan and in Pakistan and Iran, the EU remains ready to help them.”
Particularly concerning are the needs of the thousands of Afghans that have been recently returned to Afghanistan from neighbouring countries, a situation that is only adding to the population’s suffering. This EU funding will provide much needed aid to the most vulnerable, so they can get food, healthcare, education and other essential services.
EU humanitarian aid is solely channelled through humanitarian partners working on the ground.

• TV, radio, newspapers losing ground to social networks, video-sharing platforms
PARIS: People are increasingly turning to generative artificial intelligence chatbots like ChatGPT to follow day-to-day news, a respected media report published on Tuesday found.
The yearly survey from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism found “for the first time” that significant numbers of people were using chatbots to get headlines and updates, director Mitali Mukherjee wrote.
Attached to Britain’s Oxford University, the Reuters Institute annual report is seen as unmissable for people following the evolution of media.
 
 

Text remains the most preferred way for people worldwide to consume news, although around a third say they prefer to watch the news online and 15 per cent say they prefer to listen.
Younger people are much more likely to prefer watching or listening to the news.
The trend is particularly acute among young Americans. Over half of people under age 35 in the US are relying on social media and video networks as their main source for news, the report found.
Across the countries that the report surveyed, 44pc of people aged 18 to 24 said these networks are their main source of news.
The biggest-name chatbot — OpenAI’s ChatGPT — is the most widely used, followed by Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama.
Respondents appreciated relevant, personalised news from chatbots.
Many more used AI to summarise (27pc), translate (24pc) or recommend (21pc) articles, while almost one in five asked questions about current events.
Distrust remains, with those polled on balance saying AI risked making the news less transparent, less accurate and less trustworthy.
In addition, the report found that prominent podcasters like Joe Rogan are playing a bigger role in news dissemination in the United States.
Traditional US news media increasingly risks being eclipsed by online personalities and creators.
One-fifth of a sampled group of Americans came across news or commentary from podcaster Rogan in the week following the presidential inauguration, the report found, while 14pc of respondents said they had come across former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson discussing or commenting on news during that period.
Despite their popularity, online influencers and personalities are seen as the biggest sources of false or misleading information worldwide, along with politicians, the report found. In the United States, politicians are considered the biggest sources of false or misleading information.
News still a draw for X
The Reuters Institute report also pointed to traditional media — TV, radio, newspapers and news sites — losing ground to social networks and video-sharing platforms.
The institute found that many are still using Elon Musk-owned social media platform X for news, despite a rightward shift since the world’s richest man took it over.
“Many more right-leaning people, notably young men, have flocked to the network, while some progressive audiences have left or are using it less frequently,” the authors wrote.
Some 23pc of people in the United States reported using X for news, up 8pc on 2024’s survey, with usage also rising in countries like Australia and Poland.

• Major initiatives include infrastructure projects, reforms, job creation and restoration of peace       • Minister Nausherwani claims entire development fund of Rs219bn fully utilised for first time in outgoing year
QUETTA: The PPP-led government in Balochistan on Tuesday presented its second budget of the current term, featuring a record outlay of Rs1.03 trillion and proposing a development expenditure of Rs349.5 billion.
The budget for the fiscal year of 2025-26 also commits to ‘austerity’ in its current expenditure, aiming to produce a provincial cash surplus of Rs36.5bn, according to budget documents.
The budget was presented by Finance Minis­ter Mir Shoaib Nausherwani in the Balochistan Assembly, who claimed it was “not a mere document”, but a “roadmap for sustainable economic progress” of the strife-ridden province.
He claimed the government fully utilised the development budget — Rs219bn — for the first time in history in the outgoing fiscal year.
In comparison, the average utilisation had been 60pc during the three previous years.
The budget projects most of its receipts — Rs801bn — in the shape of its share from the federal tax divisible pool and straight transfers.
 
 

Meanwhile, revenue generation from the pro­vince’s own-source is estimated to be Rs101bn, including Rs48bn from levy on services.
The federal and foreign assistance for development projects is estimated to be Rs104.5bn.
The current expenditure is projected to stay around Rs642bn while the development allocations of Rs349bn include provincial PSDP of Rs245bn, federal assisted schemes of Rs66.5bn and foreign assisted projects of Rs38bn.
Mr Nausherwani said the government would will extend the ban on the purchase of new cars except for law enforcement agencies as a part of its austerity drive.
He claimed the government had reduced its budgeted current expenditure during the outgoing fiscal year from Rs609bn to Rs544bn by cutting wasteful spe­n­ding and increased total allocations for development to Rs243bn.
Major initiatives
“The major initiatives of the government for the FY 2025-26 include improving the basic infrastructure in far-off and backward areas of the province, preemptive measures to deal with emergency situations, introduction of modern reforms, strengthening of social sector, steps for social protection, creation of job opportunities and restoration of complete peace,” said Mr Nausherwani in his budget speech.
He claimed the budget document proposed steps for the welfare of all segments of society, including public servants, women, pensioners, youth, fishermen and labourers.
The government has proposed an increase of 10pc increase in salaries and a 7pc in pensions of all public-sector employees, in line with the federal government’s decision.
The Disparity Reduction Allowance for the government employees from Grade 1 to 16 has been increased to 20pc.
The minister said the government had abolished 6,000 extra jobs as part of its downsizing drive in various provincial departments under advice of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to save Rs14bn for development schemes during the current fiscal year.
However, he also announced plans to create 4,188 new contract and 1,958 regular posts in government departments next year to accommodate the youth entering the job market.
He said the government would has proposed projects in the next fiscal year that would “change the fortune of the people”.
These projects include safe city authorities in eight more cities with an allocation of Rs18bn, Rs20bn for public welfare at the district level, Rs3bn for sanitation schemes and 1,000 water filtration plants at the union council level and Rs25bn for the construction of a dam in Mashkel.
Mr Nausherwani added that Rs16bn have been allocated for the skill development of youth and ext­e­n­ding interest-free loans to them.
Sustainable development
The minister claimed his government’s priority would be projects to meet Sustainable Development Goals in FY26.
Such projects would include the construction of new dams, roads, indu­s­trial zones, terminals, railways sche­mes, microfinance and agriculture.
He said for the first time, a Rs500m grant is being allocated to protect the environment under the Balochistan Climate Change Fund.
Rs8bn have been earmarked for all universities of Balochistan, while the Higher Education Commi­ssion has also allocated Rs3bn.
He said the government would spend Rs28bn on Early childhood education and primary education in the next fiscal, while it allocated Rs6.7bn for Global Partnership Education.
The provincial government has allocated Rs16.4bn for the health sector and Rs71bn for the non-development budget.

The government has proposed a new income tax structure in the federal budget. The revised rates offer tax cuts of up to 80 per cent for low-income salaried individuals, while limiting relief for higher earners to just 3pc. The tax exemption limit has remained unc­h­anged at Rs50,000 per month.
Speaking in the National Assembly on Tuesday during ongoing budget discussions, Gohar proposed that employees earning up to Rs2.2m annually should be exempted from income tax.
 
 

“In the income tax slabs, there is no tax on earnings up to Rs600,000 per year. This should be increased to Rs 2.2m or it will be an injustice,” the PTI leader asserted.
Taxpayers earning between Rs600,000 to Rs1.2m annually will now face a 1pc tax rate, down from 5pc, offering up to 80pc tax reduction. For annual incomes between Rs1.2m and Rs2.2m, the rate will drop to 11pc from 15pc (on the amount exceeding Rs1.2m).
For annual salaries bet­ween Rs2.2m and Rs3.2m, the rate drops from 25pc to 23pc (on the income exceeding Rs2.2m). No percentage change was made for the remaining two slabs, except reductions in the fixed sums.
A 1pc surcharge reduction has been proposed for individuals earning above Rs10m to discourage skilled professionals from emigrating. Meanwhile, pensioners drawing over Rs10m annually will now be taxed at 5pc.
 


During the NA session, Gohar also expressed concern over high budgetary allocations for several government departments.
He stated that the National Accountability Bureau had been allocated Rs7.5 billion despite “filing less than a hundred accountability cases last year”.
“The previous PDM government made amendments that there will be no accountability below Rs500m,” he said, referring to the changes to the country’s anti-graft laws that were upheld by the Supreme Court last year.
As a result, Gohar said, the accountability watchdog only filed 98 cases. He added that the National Assembly has been allocated a budget of Rs16bn despite being “one of the worst performing in the world”.
The PTI chairman further said that the “actual” inflation rate was much higher than projected.
“The government is claiming inflation has reduced to 3.7pc, but the policy rate is 11pc. The actual inflation rate is much higher. If it was 3.7pc, the policy rate would be 7-8pc,” he told the NA.
Stressing the need for “out-of-the-box solutions” to provide relief to the public, Gohar claimed Pakistan had the lowest growth rate among the least developed economies, and the highest level of people living below the poverty line.
A recent report by the World Bank, issued based on a survey conducted in 2018-19, stated that almost 45pc of Pakistan’s population lives below the poverty line. The findings came in the wake of World Bank’s update of global poverty lines.
 
 

Speaking on other budgetary measures, the PTI leader recommended abolishing the stamp duty on property sales.
He also criticised the government for failing to bring pension reforms or completing the privatisation process of the Pakistan International Airlines.
‘Inadequate health budget’
Gohar also expressed concerns over reducing the federal health budget from Rs 54bn to Rs46bn and allegedly axing several projects.
He expressed concern that over a third of the country’s children were out of school. A report issued last year by the Pak Alliance for Maths and Science (Pams) puts that figure at 25.3m, or 36pc of children in Pakistan.
Leaders of other political parties, including the ruling PML-N’s ally PPP, also voiced their concerns over the budget, according to remarks carried by state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.
PPP’s Shazia Marri called on the government to address employees’ problems and questioned not increasing the minimum wage.
 


Syed Hussain Tariq, another PPP lawmaker, said the agriculture sector should be supported to ensure food security.
Echoing Gohar’s remarks, Shahida Begum of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam — Fazl (JUI-F) termed the budget allocated for education and health inadequate, emphasising that this should be enhanced to 4pc of the GDP.
PPP MNA Sehar Kamran also said health and education have been “neglected” in the budget.
However, Syed Aminul Haque of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) alluded to the positive economic indicators, including the fall in inflation, as well as the increase in foreign exchange reserves and remittances.
 
 

He noted that international financial institutions were recognising the country’s economic recovery, Radio Pakistan added.
Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam highlighted relief planned for the people, including employees, in the budget.
PML-N’s Malik Ibrar Ahmed insisted the government has presented a “people-friendly budget”, saying it envisages a vision to take the country forward on the path of development.</p><small>2025-06-18 02:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609687-president-visits-air-headquarters-expresses-satisfaction-over-pafs-combat-readiness' target='_blank'><strong>President visits Air Headquarters, expresses satisfaction over PAF's combat readiness</strong></a><br><p>

The panel called “Science in Action and Fiscal Governance for Safe Food” was jointly organised by the Senate, Gallup Pakistan, Impact Research International, and Islamabad Food Authority in the federal capital, according to a press release.
“The event underscored the critical need for a science-led approach to food safety and called for urgent fiscal reforms, particularly in taxation policy to support the formal food sector,” the press release said.
Senator Syed Masroor Ahsan, Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on National Food Security and Research, presided over the panel. According to the release, he stressed the urgent need to design and implement evidence-based policies that ensure access to safe, traceable food in line with international standards.
“Food safety and security are not just issues of today, they are challenges for the future. Our systems must evolve to guarantee compliance, traceability, and public trust,” he was quoted as saying.
Another panellist Rida Qazi, Advisor to the Senate on Special Initiatives, reiterated the message, the press release said. She was quoted as saying, “Safe food deserves to be called food. Food safety must begin at the farm and extend all the way to our dining tables.”
Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) Secretary Jamil Ahmed Qureshi urged the need for alignment between fiscal policies and health priorities. “We must incentivise formalisation of the food sector,” he was quoted as saying.
“[The] public welfare should be the priority and taxing safe packaged milk is counterproductive. Instead, our policies should reflect our national commitment to providing safe, nutritious food for all,” he further added, per the release.
A food industry expert addressed fiscal hurdles, highlighting the disconnect between policy and public health goals. “Our taxation framework should enable, not obstruct, the availability of safe food. Taxing the formal sector only pushes consumers toward unsafe, unregulated options and undermines food security,” he was quoted as saying.
Gallup Pakistan CEO Bilal Gillani said that true food security can only be achieved through the commitment and collaboration of a strategic triad: science, economy, and culture, the press release said.
“He explained that scientists must lead with data-driven research, economists must design budgets that support both providers and consumers of safe food, and a cultural shift must be fostered where the consumption of safe, nutritious food becomes a natural part of daily life.”
Hana Mehmood, another panellist, emphasised the role of science in policymaking, according to the press release.
She was quoted as saying, “Public health protection and consumer empowerment start with food safety and transparent nutritional information. Our decisions must be grounded in scientific evidence, not assumptions.”
The press release said that the consensus of the panel was that the formal food sector ensures “traceability, transparent nutritional labelling, and regular monitoring for microbial and chemical safety”.
Zubair Faisal Abbasi from Impact Research International said, “These products adhere to Codex Alimentarius standards and are regulated by national and provincial food safety authorities. Therefore, our fiscal governance must be structured to actively incentivise the formal and documented sector,” according to the press release.
It added, “One of the strongest messages of the day resonated clearly: ‘It’s not food if it’s not safe.’
“… Unfair taxation policies make this safer option less accessible to consumers. Experts from government, academia, and industry stressed that adopting equitable taxation aligned with global best practices will ensure fair access to safe nutrition and foster a healthier, more resilient nation.”</p><small>2025-06-17 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609678-gb-orders-probe-as-sewage-dumping-claim-in-attabad-lake-sparks-outrage' target='_blank'><strong>GB orders probe as sewage dumping claim in Attabad Lake sparks outrage</strong></a><br><p>

A week earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb presented the proposed budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 on the floor of the NA, revealing that an 18pc tax would be applied on imported solar panels, while online businesses and digital marketplaces would also come under the tax net.
During today’s meeting of the NA standing committee,  Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said that there was no sales tax on photovoltaic cells or solar panels.
“There is no tax on solar panels which are imported as complete products. If parts of solar panels are imported and manufactured here, there is a tax on it,” he said.
“Solar panels used to be very expensive, but now they have become quite cheap,” he added.
 






Committee chairman Syed Naveed Qamar said, “All political parties opposed the tax on solar [panels] in the House. There are other ways of collecting money and our position regarding tax on solar panels is clear.”
According to committee member Mohammad Mobeen, solar panels became more expensive after the tax decision was announced.
“Check the market to see how much solar prices have increased within two weeks,” he said, adding that the sales tax was “unbearable for the poor”.
The FBR chairman said that 18pc GST will bring in Rs20 billion to the national kitty.
“If technology is to be brought into the country, the government should provide relief to the people,” committee member Shahram Tarakai said. He added that taxes were being imposed when the cost of doing business in Pakistan was already high.
“Solar is a source of alternative energy,” MNA Shahida Akhtar Ali said. “A tax should be imposed on sugary drinks, while tax relief should be given on solar panels.”
According to the FBR chairman, 32,000 MW of solar power was imported in the last five years, and 6,271 MW was used in net metering. He said that 13,000 MW of solar panels were not installed anywhere at that time, adding that 6,506 MW was used in non-net metering, and 5,521 MW of solar panels were used off-grid.
“There has also been over-invoicing in the import of solar panels,” he said, adding that the matter had come up in the Senate Standing Committee on Finance.
A press release issued by the Senate standing committee said that it held its fifth session today.
 






It said the committee discussed a range of critical recommendations and policy matters.
“The committee strongly recommended withdrawing the proposed 18pc GST on solar panels. Members observed that ahead of the budget, certain stakeholders had imported and dumped solar equipment in anticipation of the tax hike. The chairman emphasised the discriminatory nature of the move, saying, ‘The committee rejects the sudden imposition of GST on solar imports and urges immediate withdrawal.’”
Finance bill 2025
The NA panel also discussed the Finance Bill 2025, which proposed provisions granting arrest and money laundering notice powers to tax commissioners.
According to the FBR chairman, the law gave the impression that it was introduced to arrest traders. “The law on [such] arrest already exists which has seen some changes.
“There is an amendment related to tampering or forgery while the second clause is about tampering and fraud on a large scale.”
 
 

He further said that arrests would be made if there was a risk that the suspect of tax fraud was fleeing. “If the tax is not paid despite three notices, then an arrest is made,” he said, adding that the arrest decision was taken by the FBR committee.
MNA Mobeen said that any FBR officer can say that tax fraud has occurred with the amendment and the suspected person will have to prove that they did not commit tax fraud. He questioned, “Is there a timeline set for the arrest and inquiry process?”
“The inquiry will be completed within six months,” the FBR chairman remarked.
On Saturday, a parliamentary panel pressed senior tax officials to drop proposed provisions in the bill, warning the move would create unnecessary obstacles for businesses.
Lawmakers debated the implications of enhanced powers for the FBR and discussed measures to curb tampered vehicles.
Senator Mandviwalla warned that there is a grave risk of misuse of the power to arrest or issue a notice. Even a junior FBR officer sending a notice could create chaos, he warned. He also emphasised that receiving a money laundering notice often leads to business shutdowns.</p><small>2025-06-17 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609661-president-urges-effective-relief-measures-for-salaried-class-underprivileged-segments' target='_blank'><strong>President urges effective relief measures for salaried class, underprivileged segments</strong></a><br><p>

The directorate general of civil aviation also asked all flying schools to conduct training compliance checks, according to the confidential memos, seen by Reuters.
The DGCA said the requests were part of a “regulatory” review of the accident, and also sought details of action taken following the watchdog’s audits of Air India in the last few months. It asked for the details to be provided by Monday. It was not clear whether Air India had complied with the directive.
The Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner bound for London with 242 people on board began losing height seconds after take-off in Ahmedabad on Thursday before crashing into nearby buildings. Everyone on board was killed, bar a single passenger, along with about 30 on the ground.
Sumeet Sabharwal, who the Indian government has said had 8,200 flying hours of experience and was also an Air India instructor, was the commanding pilot of flight AI171. His co-pilot was Clive Kunder who had 1,100 hours of experience. Sabharwal’s funeral took place in Mumbai on Tuesday.

The watchdog requested for training details and supporting documents for the pilots, as well as for the flight dispatcher. The memo did not elaborate on the type of documents required, but accident investigations commonly look at a crew’s training and qualifications, flight history, medical records and any actions previously taken against them.
The memo did not raise any concerns with Air India’s operations and some of the requests are standard in the aftermath of a major incident.
Dispatchers are DGCA-certified ground-based airline employees whose role includes flight planning, assessing weather and airspace conditions, and coordination with the pilots.
While the request for pilot training data was sent by the DGCA, the accident investigation is being led by another wing of the aviation ministry, the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.
Air India’s Chairman N. Chandrasekaran told staff on Monday the incident should be a catalyst to build a safer airline.
The DGCA, through a separate memo dated June 16, also asked flying schools across the country to “strictly follow additional safety and operational measures.”
The regulator said instructors must check for compliance with procedures concerning training, maintenance and licensing, and coordinate flight plans with nearby airports in advance to ensure any emergencies are dealt with swiftly.
“Compliance will be assessed during audits/surveillance,” said the memo by the Directorate of Flying Training, reviewed by Reuters.
Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, visited Air India’s headquarters near New Delhi and met the airline’s chairman to discuss the crash, Reuters reported on Monday.
The crash poses a new challenge for Air India, which the Tata Group bought in 2022 and has been trying to revamp, and Boeing, which is trying to rebuild public trust following a series of safety and production crises.
In a June 13 memo headed “updating airport emergency plan”, seen by Reuters, government-managed airports have also been asked to conduct a full-scale training exercise — typically an emergency drill — on June 30.</p><small>2025-06-17 13:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/609624-karachi-remains-among-worlds-least-liveable-cities-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi remains among world's least liveable cities in 2025: survey</strong></a><br><p>
