The 26th Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence.
The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the CJP’s term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Thus far, Zuberi, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA)’s counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioner Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed have presented their arguments. They have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed.
 
 

Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
The bench will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB, before deciding on the legality of the 26th Amendment.
The case was initially taken up in January, and after the CB’s approval of petitioners’ request for it, the proceedings were being live-streamed on the SC’s YouTube channel since October 8.
The hearing
Zuberi, also a former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president, continued his arguments in the case today. The hearing was later adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.
 


The live-stream for the hearing began with a delay of about 40 minutes due to internet issues. The Pakistan Telecommunications Limited (PTCL) has said users would experience degraded internet services today as a submarine cable is being repaired.
“There are internet issues today. The live stream will not be possible,” Justice Aminuddin said at the outset of the hearing. Justice Mazhar also said the livestream YouTube link was down and asked staff to check this.
Zuberi then cited various past court verdicts to support his arguments.
“A party cannot raise an objection on the judge. The judge has the authority [to decide] whether to hear a case or not,” the former SCBA president said.
Upon Zuberi reiterating his request for a “full court”, Justice Mandokhail remarked, “Do not say a full court; say ‘those judges who were present from before the Amendment’.
“On the one hand, you are saying 16 judges and on the other, you also talk about ‘collective knowledge’,” he added.
The petitions
The 26th Amendment had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.
The petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.
In the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.
 
 

These included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the JCP being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.
The petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.
They also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.

The election was held amid uncertainty about the status of Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation from the provincial chief executive’s position.
 
 

Rehman was one of the four people in the race fot the KP CM office, along with Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP and PTI’s Sohail Afridi — who won the election after the opposition staged a boycott.
In a petition filed today, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Rehman named six respondents, including the KP government, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, the KP Assembly through its Speaker Babar Saleem Swati, the secretary of the provincial assembly, outgoing KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, and CM-elect Sohail Afridi.
In his petition, he requested the court to set aside the election and declare it “ab initio void” as the it was “wholly unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, without jurisdiction, coram non judice.”
Rehman questioned how an election could be held if Gandapur’s resignation had not yet been accepted. Citing Article 130(8) of the Constitution, he stressed that elections for the post can not be held unless it was vacant.
Article 130(8) states that “the Chief Minister may, by writing under his hand
addressed to the governor, resign his office”, and is the same clause that the PTI has been citing to contend that the CM’s resignation does not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
Rehman’s petition further asked the court to declare decisions taken by the assembly and the speaker with regard to the CM appointment as “without lawful authority, void, and of no legal effect.”
 


The petition further urged the court to “declare all consequential notifications and actions, including the impugned notification, as illegal, arbitrary, capricious, without jurisdiction and having no legal effect.”
Rehman requested the court to halt any further proceedings in the matter until the governor had “lawfully received and verified” the resignation of Gandapur.
The petition called for a fresh election “in accordance with the Constitution and the assembly rules, after lawful confirmation of vacancy.”
It concluded by requesting the PHC to suspend the election result in order to “prevent chaos and ensure preservation of the rule of law.”
Speaking to the media outside the court, Rehman reiterated the opposition’s stance over the validity of the elections.
“We said this yesterday as well that the former chief minister’s resignation has not been accepted yet, and he has been summoned by the governor on Oct 15.
“Until the seat becomes vacant, the election can not be held,” he said.
Responding to a question that why the opposition chose to field candidates for the CM election if it believed the election was not in line with the law, he said, “At first, we were under the impression that the resignation had been finalised, but then the governor’s letter came to light, detailing that the resignation had not yet been finalised.”
Oath-taking hearing scheduled for 1pm today
Meanwhile, PTI’s Salman Akram Raja and the provincial AAG appeared in front of the court today, concerning the matter of the CM-elect’s oath-taking application.
On Monday, in a pre-emptive move, the PTI had approached the PHC to request that KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati be nominated to administer Afridi’s oath, rather than the KP governor.
PHC Chief Justice  S. M. Attique Shah, who will be presiding over the hearing, told them that the hearing regarding the oath-taking will be held at 1pm today.
He had also heard the case yesterday and directed the AAG to confirm whether the KP governor had received the summary related to the oath from the assembly secretariat.
From resignation to election
The barely two-year-old KP Assembly presently seems to be facing a constitutional crisis, which originates from incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s decision on October 8 to change the command at the helm in the province.
 
 

In line with his directive, Gandapur resigned from his role the same day as the provincial chief executive while the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja, confirmed that the party had picked Sohail Afridi.
The resignation letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s House initially denying ever receiving it.
But, a copy of the letter seen by Dawn showed that it was received by the governor’s staff.
Subsequently, Gandapur sent another handwritten resignation to the governor, which was acknowledged by Kundi on Oct 11. He said in a post on X that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he added.
The controversy around the resignation took another turn late night the next day when Governor Kundi returned two separate letters submitted by the former over “disparate signatures” and summoned him on October 15 (tomorrow) to settle the matter.
In a post on social media platform X, Kundi said that the chief minister’s resignation had been “returned with observation”.
He also shared a letter addressed to Gandapur, wherein he stated that two resignation letters had been received by the Governor House on October 8 and October 11, both of which had “disparate and unalike signatures”.
For his part, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X, stating: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.”
He further said that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”.
By that time, KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati had already convened an assembly session to elect a new leader of the house. And the PTI maintained that under Article 130(8) of the Constitution, a chief minister’s resignation did not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
The opposition, however, disagreed and walked out of the session held for the CM election yesterday. Following its boycott, candidates fielded by the JUI-F, the PPP and the PML-N recieved zero votes while Afridi won the race with 90.</p><small>2025-10-14 08:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1411560473a1160.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948849/shares-at-psx-rebound-gain-4600-points-in-intraday-trade' target='_blank'><strong>Shares at PSX rebound, gain 4,600 points in intraday trade</strong></a><br><p>A day after experiencing a significant downturn, the Pakistan Stock Exchange’s (PSX) benchmark KSE-100 index rebounded during intraday trade on Tuesday, gaining over 4,600 points and recouping the previous day’s losses.
Bearish sentiment had taken hold of the market on Monday, with the 100-Index plummeting 4,600 points, wiping out Rs534 billion from market capitalisation, amid rising tensions with Afghanistan, political instability in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and violent protests in Punjab. The market had closed at 158,443 points, lower by 4,654 points, or 2.85 per cent.
Today, the KSE-100 index surged 4,652.13 points, or 2.94pc, to 163,351.38 by 12:51pm.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, told Dawn.com that the market had rebounded today as “tensions with Afghanistan and domestic unrest following the breakup of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) protests had eased overnight”.
“After entering a corrective phase following the trade data released on October 2, participants are now focused on next week’s current account print and progress toward a staff-level agreement with the International Monetary Fund,” he said.
Stating that 12,334 new investor accounts were opened in the month of September, Farooq suggested that retail investors take a “long-term approach, build positions gradually, and consider exchange-traded funds or mutual funds if inexperienced”.
“While valuations are reasonable, potential slippage on the current account and fiscal side could pose near-term headwinds, and a repeat of the last two years’ returns over the next two years appears unlikely,” he added.
 
 

Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, said the market had “rebounded after correction”.
He also said the “easing of geopolitical conditions” had supported the market.
Intense border fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan that started late on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning cast a shadow over the bourse yesterday. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said 23 troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Separately, a crackdown against protesters of the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) in multiple cities and political uncertainty in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had added more pressure.</p><small>2025-10-14 07:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14123406f75daae.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948848/when-flattery-becomes-foreign-policy' target='_blank'><strong>When flattery becomes foreign policy</strong></a><br><p>Ceasefire, reconstruction plans and the weary diplomacy of war’s aftermath — this is what the summit hall in Egypt’s Sharm el-Sheikh was meant for. Yet when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif took the microphone, the air shifted — solemnity gave way to spectacle. Before a room of world leaders convened to discuss the future of Gaza, the Pakistani premier delivered not a statement of statecraft, but a volley of high praise … for US President Donald Trump.
He called Trump a “man of peace”, spoke of nominating him for the Nobel Prize, and credited him with averting a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. And as Trump looked on with a grin of self-satisfaction, the rest of the hall seemed to freeze between disbelief and bemusement. The applause was hesitant; the headlines were instant.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

By conventional diplomatic standards, PM Shehbaz’s remarks were absurd. No leader in that room — not Sisi, not Macron, not Erdoğan — matched that tone of unrestrained flattery. In a forum built for multilateral gravity, the premier’s effusive praise seemed theatrically misplaced, bordering on parody. Yet, paradoxically, it worked — at least for the one audience that mattered most: Donald Trump himself.
Humiliating or rare?
For Trump, whose politics feeds on validation, Shehbaz’s words were not embarrassing — they were energising. In the transactional theatre of Trumpian diplomacy, flattery is not deception; it is currency. A line of exaggerated praise buys more goodwill than a paragraph of policy. To a narcissist’s ear, devotion sounds like diplomacy.
Political psychologists call this the ‘narcissistic reward loop’ — a psychological feedback cycle through which praise reinforces cooperation, regardless of substance. In that moment, the prime minister may not have advanced Pakistan’s strategic interests, but he accomplished something equally potent: he made himself, and by extension Pakistan, relevant in Trump’s narrative of peace. The absurdity of the speech became its mechanism of success.
 
 

What unfolded in Egypt was, in rhetorical theory, a perlocutionary misfire — a statement that produces an effect different from the speaker’s intent, yet still yields a positive outcome. Sharif likely sought to flatter his host and secure visibility in a crowded summit. Instead, he became the viral centrepiece of a geopolitical sideshow — mocked by commentators, but noticed by Trump.
While the rest of the world saw a gaffe, Trump saw a loyal echo. And in the asymmetric world of ego-driven diplomacy, that distinction is everything.

This dynamic — when meaning misfires but outcomes succeed — is known in public relations as beneficial misinterpretation. The speaker’s intention and the audience’s perception diverge, yet the misunderstanding amplifies the speaker’s visibility or favour. It is the strange success of miscommunication in an age of media saturation.
PM Shehbaz’s performance may not have persuaded policy circles, but it dominated headlines, especially in neighbouring India, and secured a rare moment of Pakistani relevance in a summit largely overshadowed by US and Egyptian choreography.
To many observers, the moment seemed humiliating: a prime minister of a nuclear-armed state reduced to flattery before a reality-TV-styled president.
Optics > outcomes
But politics, especially in the 21st-century media arena, rarely obeys the old hierarchies of decorum. What matters now is not intent but impression. Trump, a man whose self-image eclipses ideology, responded not as a statesman but as a celebrity basking in praise. He smiled, joked, and gestured that nothing more needed to be said. The world laughed — but he listened.
And therein lies the paradox. The very absurdity that alienated PM Shehbaz from traditional diplomats aligned him, if only briefly, with the emotional logic of Trump’s world: a stage where applause substitutes for alignment and validation stands in for vision. What appeared as a diplomatic faux pas was, in psychological terms, a strategic hit — an appeal tailored perfectly to a narcissist’s need for affirmation.
 
 

The episode also exposes something larger about our age of performative diplomacy. The modern summit is as much about optics as outcomes. Leaders speak less to each other than to their publics — and sometimes, to a single man’s ego. Flattery, once a soft art of persuasion, has become a broadcast tool. In this environment, even a speech that shocks the world can achieve its purpose if it captures attention and secures a headline. Substance has ceded ground to spectacle; diplomacy has turned theatrical.
The PM’s words in Sharm el-Sheikh will not change the course of Gaza’s reconstruction, nor will they rewrite Pakistan’s foreign policy. But they reveal the shifting grammar of international politics — where absurdity can be effective, and missteps can become media strategy. In the classical sense, his performance was not diplomacy; it was a case study in how flattery, when amplified through a narcissist’s lens, morphs from weakness into leverage.
The hall buzzed with disbelief. Diplomats whispered; social media mocked. Yet the only man who mattered in that room smiled. And in geopolitics, sometimes one man’s applause outweighs a world’s laughter.</p><small>2025-10-14 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14123927c4a52ea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948857/oscar-winner-sharmeen-obaid-chinoy-joins-short-film-dont-be-late-myra-as-executive-producer' target='_blank'><strong>Oscar winner Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy joins short film Don’t Be Late, Myra as executive producer</strong></a><br><p></p><small>2025-10-14 07:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/141224353b99a56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948852/google-to-invest-15-bn-in-india-build-largest-ai-hub-outside-us' target='_blank'><strong>Google to invest $15 bn in India, build largest AI hub outside US</strong></a><br><p>Google on Tuesday said it would invest $15 billion in India over the next five years as it announced a giant data centre and artificial intelligence base in the country’s south.
“It is the largest AI hub that we are investing in anywhere outside of the US,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud, at a ceremony in New Delhi.
He announced “capital investment of $15bn” over the five years and a “gigawatt-scale AI hub in Visakhapatnam”, a city in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh.
Google has plans for the centre to eventually “scale to multiple gigawatts”, Kurian added.
Demand for AI tools and solutions has surged in India — projected to have more than 900 million internet users by year’s end — driven by growing adoption by businesses and individuals.
India’s Information Technology Minister, Ashwini Vaishnaw, thanked Google for the investment.
“This digital infrastructure will go a long way in meeting the goals of our India AI vision,” he said.
Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu called it a “very happy day”.
Andhra Pradesh state Technology Minister Nara Lokesh said the deal was a “game-changing investment” that came after “a year of intense discussions and relentless effort”.
“It is a massive leap for our state’s digital future, innovation, and global standing,” Lokesh wrote on X. “This is just the beginning.”
 






This month, US startup Anthropic said it plans to open an office in India next year, with its chief executive, Dario Amodei, meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Modi, in a post on X, told Amodei that “India’s vibrant tech ecosystem and talented youth are driving AI innovation”, adding that he wanted to “harness AI for growth”.
 






Anthropic’s move follows a flurry of announcements by other top AI firms looking to court Indian users.
OpenAI has said it will open an India office later this year, with its chief, Sam Altman, noting that ChatGPT usage in the country had grown fourfold over the past year.
AI firm Perplexity also announced a major partnership in July with Indian telecom giant Airtel, offering the company’s 360m customers a free one-year Perplexity Pro subscription.</p><small>2025-10-14 07:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14105954077152b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948844/aurangzeb-imf-official-discuss-pakistans-reform-agenda-in-washington-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb, IMF official discuss Pakistan’s reform agenda in Washington meeting</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, who is currently in Washington, met with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Middle East and Central Asia Department Director Jihad Azour and the two exchanged views on Pakistan’s reform agenda, a press release issued on Tuesday said.
A press release by the Finance Division said that the finance minister had a “busy first day” of his official visit to the United States, attending high-level meetings on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank (WB) in Washington, DC.
“The finance minister and his delegation had a key meeting with Azour. Both sides exchanged views on Pakistan’s reform agenda and reaffirmed their shared commitment to sustaining the current momentum of reforms,” the press release said.
 






It added that the meeting also reviewed progress under the
second review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and acknowledged the “importance of maintaining macroeconomic discipline”.
In a separate meeting, Aurangzeb had “extensive engagement” with WB Senior Managing Director Axel van Trotsenburg, where he appreciated the Bank’s continued commitment to Pakistan’s national development agenda.
“The minister reiterated that the climate crisis remains an existential challenge for Pakistan, referencing the devastation caused by recent floods and their severe impact on the agriculture sector and GDP growth,” the statement said.
“He emphasised the need for enhanced investment in climate adaptation and mitigation measures and agreed on the importance of mobilising additional resources to manage future natural calamities,” it said.
 






The minister is visiting the US capital for the IMF and WB plenary meetings from October 13 to 18. The meetings bring together global finance ministers, central bankers and development leaders, offering Pakistan a crucial platform to secure the next IMF tranche, advance economic reforms, and engage international partners on growth, investment, and resilience.
Aurangzeb’s visit comes after a IMF mission concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on reviews of two lending programmes totalling $8.4 billion without announcing a staff-level agreement (SLA).
Before leaving for the US, the finance minister had expressed optimism that the SLA with the IMF would be finalised during his visit to Washington.
More meetings in Washington
According to the press release issued by the Finance Division, Aurangzeb also attended the Commonwealth Finance Ministers’ Meeting and underscored the importance of “prioritising concrete actions to advance a resilient and prosperous Commonwealth”.
He voiced support for the operationalisation of the Commonwealth Infrastructure and Financial Resilience Hub, as well as the Technical Assistance Fund for peer review and capacity building.
He reiterated the central importance of climate financing for developing countries like Pakistan and emphasised the urgent need to operationalise mechanisms such as the Loss and Damage Fund, the statement said.
Aurangzeb was also hosted by the leadership and members of the US-Pakistan Business Council (USPBC). He briefed participants on the positive trajectory of Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators, calling private sector growth “vital to sustaining economic momentum”.
According to the press release, he reaffirmed the government’s commitment to addressing business challenges and providing maximum relief, highlighting the recent trade deal with the US authorities and “expressing optimism for enhanced government-to-government and business-to-business engagements in key sectors, including mining, agriculture, information technology, and pharmaceuticals”.
The statement added that earlier, Aurangzeb also met with Robert Kaproth, US assistant treasury secretary for international finance, and Counselor Jonathan Greenstein. During the discussion, he highlighted the “strong economic fundamentals” of Pakistan, underpinned by the ongoing IMF programme.
He welcomed the successful conclusion of negotiations with the US administration leading to a tariff deal and apprised the officials about Pakistan’s recent legislation to regulate virtual assets. He further invited US companies to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan’s oil and gas, mineral, agriculture, and information technology sectors, the release said.
The finance minister also met with Riccardo Puliti, Regional Vice President of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) for the Middle East, Central Asia, Türkiye, Afghanistan, and Pakistan; as well as the Islamic Development Bank’s (IsDB) President Muhammad Sulaiman Al-Jasser.
Aurangzeb also met with representatives of Citi Bank, where he “acknowledged Citi’s longstanding partnership with Pakistan and appreciated its continued engagement”.
“The minister shared an overview of Pakistan’s stabilising macroeconomic outlook, driven by ongoing structural reforms and validated by international credit rating agencies. He also highlighted Pakistan’s growing role as a regional hub for digital innovation and financial services, assuring that the government would give due consideration to Citi’s proposals,” the statement said.
The statement added that the minister also interacted with US and international media, including interviews with the Associated Press and Reuters, and attended a dinner in the honour of the Pakistan delegation by Pakistan’s US ambassador, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh.
“The finance minister’s engagements in Washington, DC reflect the government’s resolve to deepen economic cooperation, strengthen partnerships with international financial institutions, and accelerate Pakistan’s transition from stabilisation to sustainable, inclusive growth,” the statement said.
“The visit aims to further strengthen Pakistan’s engagement with key international financial institutions, development partners, and private sector stakeholders,” it added.</p><small>2025-10-14 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1411402065ee6af.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948847/after-gaza-summit-pm-says-pakistan-will-continue-to-express-admiration-for-trumps-unique-contribution-to-peace' target='_blank'><strong>After Gaza summit, PM says Pakistan will continue to express admiration for Trump’s ‘unique contribution’ to peace</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reiterated his praise for United States President Donald Trump, stating that Pakistan would continue to “express admiration” for the American leader’s “unique contribution” to peace.
The statement comes a day after Trump and the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye had signed a declaration meant to cement a ceasefire in Gaza, hours after Israel and Hamas exchanged hostages and prisoners.
PM Shehbaz had also attended the ceremony held at the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. At a later press conference, the US president had especially mentioned the premier and the army chief.
In a post on X, the premier said: “As I board the plane to return home after the Gaza peace summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, I want to share some reflections on the potentially transformational nature of what took place and why Pakistan has been so deeply involved.”
 
 

He stated that Pakistan’s biggest priority was the “immediate cessation of the genocidal campaign imposed on Gaza”, which he said he had “stated and reinforced consistently” alongside other nations.
“Our gratitude to President Trump is anchored in him promising that he would make it stop, and delivering on that promise,” he said.
“We will continue to express our admiration for President Trump’s unique contribution to peace,” the premier said.
“The Palestinian people’s freedom, dignity and prosperity remain a primary concern for Pakistan,” Shehbaz said, adding that the establishment of a “strong and viable” Palestinian state, with pre-1967 borders and Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital, would remain the “bedrock of Pakistan’s Middle East policy”.
 






Addressing the ceremony after the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas, Trump had thanked PM Shehbaz and his “favourite” Field Marshal Asim Munir for their efforts in achieving peace in Gaza, among many other world leaders.
Invited to give his own address, PM Shehbaz had thanked Trump and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal.
“Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity,“ he had said.
In his speech, he had again expressed his desire to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded on Friday to Venezuela’s opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.
’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team,“ the premier said.
“And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East,” he said.</p><small>2025-10-14 07:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/141052341898de6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948843/make-the-country-better-nepals-gen-z-rush-to-register-to-vote-after-uprising' target='_blank'><strong>‘Make the country better’: Nepal’s Gen Z rush to register to vote after uprising</strong></a><br><p>In Nepal’s capital, young would-be voters line up enthusiastically to register for the first elections since deadly anti-corruption protests toppled the government, the worst unrest in decades.
For many, it will be their first time participating in an election, and they see it as a chance to shape the future of their country of 30 million people, burdened by deep economic woes.
At least 73 people were killed in the September 8-9 protests that left parliament, courts and government buildings in flames.
The unrest was triggered by a brief ban on social media but was fuelled by long-standing frustration over economic hardship and corruption.
 
 

Within days of the government’s collapse, 73-year-old former chief justice Sushila Karki was appointed interim prime minister to steer the Himalayan nation until elections on March 5, 2026.
“The pillar of this new government is built on the dead bodies of students,” said student Niranjan Bhandari, 21, as he waited to provide biometric data to complete his registration.
“That’s why, in the upcoming election, we want to uproot the old faces who have been clinging to power for too long,” he added.
“I’m here to register for my new voter identity card for that very reason.”
‘Growth to decline’
Nepal’s political future hangs in the balance.
The challenges ahead to ensure elections pass off smoothly are huge — including deep public distrust in Nepal’s established parties.
It remains unclear whether protesters and youth will try to form their own party, or if old politicians will seek to return.
The government has imposed a travel ban on KP Sharma Oli, the 73-year-old Marxist who served as prime minister four times before he was forced from power, as a commission investigates the unrest.
 
 

But Oli remains outspoken, calling for the reinstatement of the parliament “that was unconstitutionally dissolved”, in an address to supporters earlier this month.
The unrest also battered Nepal’s already fragile economy, where the World Bank estimates a “staggering” 82 per cent of the workforce is in informal employment, with GDP per capita at just $1,447 in 2024.
The bank this month updated its economic assessment for Nepal, warning that “recent unrest and heightened political and economic uncertainty are expected to cause growth to decline” to 2.1pc.
But at a district Election Commission office in Kathmandu, the excitement among the younger generation is clear.
“I’m really excited,” 20-year-old student Sambriddhi Gautam told AFP. “This will be my first time participating in an election.”
Gautam, who is studying to be a chartered accountant in neighbouring India, said she had returned to register to make sure she can take part.

‘Good of the nation’
Samiksha Adhikari, aged 32, a business consultant, waited to apply for her voter identity card.
“We need to bring in new faces who can stop corruption and make the country better,” she said.
“That’s why I’m here. I want to cast my vote for those who truly work for the good of the nation.”
In Nepal’s last general elections in 2022, nearly 18m people were registered to vote.
All Nepalis aged 18 and above are eligible to vote, with the deadline to register ending in November.
 
 

Sirjana Rayamajhi, 38, spokesperson at the district election office in Kathmandu, said she had not seen such enthusiasm before.
In her office, an average of nearly 400 people had been registering every day — four times higher than in past elections. “The turnout is very high,” she said.
“Gen Z have come here to register their names with a lot of excitement. They want a new generation to bring change to the country. These days, the queue is only them.“</p><small>2025-10-14 06:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628501-phc-orders-aag-to-confirm-governors-availability-for-oath-taking-of-kp-cm-elect' target='_blank'><strong>PHC orders AAG to confirm governor's availability for oath-taking of KP CM-elect</strong></a><br><p>

At a summit hosted at the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm el-Sheikh and attended by more than two dozen world leaders, Trump and the leaders of Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye signed the declaration as guarantors to the ceasefire deal. The deal came days after the world marked the two-year anniversary of Israel’s military campaign in the Palestinian enclave which has claimed more than 67,000 lives.
At the opening of the summit, Trump signed a document with Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye’s leaders welcoming the agreements on Gaza and pledging to “work collectively to implement and sustain this legacy”.
Here are five noteworthy moments from the press conference held after the signing of the peace declaration.
Display of Pak-US camaraderie and the ‘favourite’
In his remarks, the US president especially mentioned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
Thanking several world leaders, Trump also did the same for Pakistan, saying: “Prime Minister Sharif of Pakistan, and also I have to say my favourite Field Marshal from Pakistan, who is not here, but the prime minister is here and you are gonna give him his regards.
“Where are you?” he asked as he turned around to look at the world leaders gathered in the back. Noticing PM Shehbaz in the back, Trump then called him forward and asked him to say a few words.
Trump, Egypt President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi and PM Shehbaz were the only three leaders who spoke at the presser. For his part, the premier took the opportunity to again nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.

“I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East,” he said as the US president loomed over his shoulder.
Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.”
Later, the US president also talked about India, saying it was a “great country with a very good friend of mine at the top”.
“He’s just done a fantastic job and I think Pakistan and India are going to live very nicely together. Right?” he asked, turning around to look at PM Shehbaz, who then proceeded to laugh with the US president.
‘Beautiful’ Italian PM Meloni
The Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal he helped broker had put Trump in a notably good mood, as he joked with presidents and prime ministers in his usual close-to-the-bone style.
“They have very little crime,” he said admiringly as he met co-host President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi of Egypt, whose country is regularly criticised for its rights record.
“A lot of cash. Unlimited cash,” Trump said with a smile as he met United Arab Emirates Vice President and Manchester City football club owner Sheikh Mansour.
“Tough cookie,” he added of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has cracked down on critics.
 






But during the the press conference, he was even more forthright.
“She’s beautiful,“ he said about Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. The three-times-married 79-year-old admitted that he risked being accused of sexism with the comments about hard-right leader Meloni, who was standing behind him on the podium during the press conference.
“I’m not allowed to say it because usually it’s the end of your political career if you say it — she’s a beautiful young woman,” Trump said in the middle of a speech about his peace efforts for the Middle East.
“If you use the word ‘beautiful’ in the United States about a woman, that’s the end of your political career, but I’ll take my chances.”
Turning round to address the 48-year-old, Trump said: “You don’t mind being called beautiful, right? Because you are.”
 






Meloni’s immediate reaction could not be seen, as Trump’s back was between her and the cameras. Trump went on to call Meloni, an ideological ally when it comes to immigration and cultural issues, “incredible”.
“And they really respect her in Italy. She’s a very successful politician,” he added. Meloni was the only woman among around 30 leaders gathered on the stage behind Trump for the summit.
Apparent awkwardness with UK’s Starmer
Running down a list of countries he wanted to thank during the press conference, Trump also talked about the United Kingdom.
“United Kingdom. Where’s the United Kingdom?” he asked, turning around to look at the leaders gathered behind him. Britain Prime Minister Keir Starmer then raised his hand, to which Trump told him to “come here”.
“Is everything going good?” Trump asked Starmer, who had stepped forward to shake his hand. But the US president did not ask Starmer to speak, like he had asked PM Shehbaz, and turned back to the podium to continue his remarks while Starmer shuffled back into line.
 






Israel PM Netanyahu’s absence
The summit itself was attended by more than two dozen world leaders, including Palestinian Authority president Mahmud Abbas and UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and representatives of Hamas were absent.
But there appears to be some controversy surrounding the absence of Israel’s leader. Netanyahu’s office had stated he would not attend the summit after Cairo had earlier announced he would take part, a prospect that could have been awkward for some confirmed guests.
In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said he had been invited by Trump to participate but declined “due to the timing’s proximity to the beginning of (a Jewish) holiday”.
“The prime minister thanked President Trump for his invitation and for his efforts to expand the circle of peace peace through strength,” the statement said.
A Turkish official told Reuters that Turkiye President Tayyip Erdogan, with the support of some other unspecified leaders, pushed back diplomatically against the idea of Netanyahu attending. Netanyahu’s office did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the issue.
FIFA’s presence
Meanwhile, in a strange turn of events, it emerged that FIFA President Gianni Infantino was also a part of the summit in Egypt and was standing alongside world leaders during the press conference held after the signing of the document.
 






Trump also mentioned Infantino in his remarks. While thanking Norway and looking for its leader behind him, Trump spotted Infantino standing at the far end and said: “Well we have Gianni. We’re going to the World Cup, I can tell you that.”
Inside FIFA, the official site of the international governing body, reported that Infantino stressed the significance of the day in remarks after the document was signed.
“Well, when you speak about a historic day, this definitely was and is a historic day,” Infantino was quoted as saying.
“A historic day for the Middle East, a historic day for the world, a historic day for peace. A new beginning, as President Trump said, a new dawn for the whole region, for the entire world. It’s something that is really important for FIFA to be here to support, to help, to assist, to put ourselves at disposal for whatever we can do to make sure that this peace process comes to fruition and to the best possible end,“ he said.

The slow-cooked but warm reception accorded to the Afghan foreign minister in New Delhi — which officially still doesn’t recognise the Taliban government — and the ensuing unsubtle statements from both sides set off an angry reaction from Islamabad. It was followed by military action on the Afghan border that’s said to have been linked to the events in Delhi.
The pact, however, also coincided with an auspicious event for the Hindu right, the celebration of the hundredth year of the Hindu revivalist RSS in 2025. Marxists used a phrase that has since gone out of fashion, for the meeting of minds like that of the Taliban and the RSS. They called it unity in obscurantism.
In hindsight, there’s nothing terribly remarkable about this rapport. Possibly the warmest ties India ever had with Pakistan flourished when Gen Ziaul Haq was leading his country into a dark abyss masked in controversial laws and ordinances. And the man to sanctify Zia’s murder of democracy in Pakistan was an RSS veteran dressed as India’s foreign minister.
Atal Bihari Vajpayee, visiting Pakistan in 1978 after evicting Indira Gandhi from power over her brief suspension of democracy, lauded Zia’s ties with the Janata Party government, in which the RSS for the first time was a key player. Vajpayee studiously avoided petitioning Zia during the visit to spare Z.A. Bhutto’s life that world leaders were doing and Indira Gandhi had pleaded for despite her being out of power after a resounding defeat in the 1977 elections. In the event, Vajpayee’s prime minister in the 26-month long government, Morarji Desai, was honoured by the military dictator with Pakistan’s highest civilian award. No Indian government has equalled the bonhomie.
In another time zone, in his decade-old cultivation of leaders abroad, one such encounter was missed for its irony: Prime Minister Modi’s happy mingling with leaders of Uzbekistan. As it turned out, Uzbekistan is where historical characters like Zaheeruddin Babar and Taimur are celebrated as national heroes, even as they are reviled as villains by Hindu nationalists in India. In India, the preferred invective RSS followers carry for Indian Muslims is to call them ‘Babar ki aulaad’, progeny of the first Mughal emperor. (There, too, the RSS and Pakhtun leaders readily make common cause given their collective animus towards the Mughal rulers, particularly Babar.)

Much has been said about women journalists not being invited to the Afghan press conference by the Taliban foreign minister.

Yet, the leaders in Tashkent, on their part, could scarcely be distracted by the sectarian events the memory of one of their heroes had spawned in India. In a similarly contrarian context, the RSS, rightly or wrongly, accuses Indian Muslims of greater loyalty to Makkah and Madinah than to their own country. However, the crown princes, emirs and sheikhs from that part of the Arab world never seem to tire of visiting India or receiving Modi in their bear hugs. Another facet of ‘unity in obscurantism’ needs to be seen from a historical lens. It was not a coincidence that India’s Hindu and Muslim revivalist groups were both in jail during Indira Gandhi’s 1975-77 emergency.
Their bonhomie continued outside the prisons, across the borders. When Modi stopped over for an unannounced eyebrows-raising visit to Nawaz Sharif in Lahore, he was interestingly returning from Kabul. However, when another fellow RSS leader went soft on Pakistan, appreciating the liberalism and secularism he saw in Jinnah, and when L.K. Advani scribed a kindly message at the Quaid’s mausoleum in Karachi, all hell broke loose at the RSS headquarters. Advani was denounced and denied his bid to become prime minister. For the RSS, it was the case of Zia good, Jinnah bad.
Much has been said about women journalists not being invited to the Afghan press conference by Amir Khan Muttaqi, the Taliban foreign minister. Muttaqi changed the stance quickly, and there were reportedly more women than male journalists in his next press conference. What was overlooked in the bargain was a more curious fact, that the current prime minister of the world’s most populous democracy had neither invited a woman nor a man or any other to a press conference he hasn’t ever held. This is not to make light of the barbaric treatment the Taliban regime reserves for its women, however.
Kabul used to be a fashion hub in South Asia, materially and spiritually in harmony with itself. When middle-class women in northern India or Pakistan were struggling with dress codes, and movie heroines danced around trees to song sequences draped in dupattas, women in Kabul were going to the university dressed in smart skirts they often brought from the latest collections of Parisian stylists. India’s classical music wizard Vilayat Khan would play the sitar at the court of King Zahir Shah. Likewise, Afghanistan’s Mohammed Sarhang was feted in India as a masterly singer of Persian poetry and Indian ragas.
Be that as it may, the treatment of women in India by religious puritans is not something the Taliban would frown on. The madressahs of Deoband that inspire the Taliban worldview could exchange notes with Hindutva groups come Valentine’s Day or some such. Their shared disapproval of women carrying cellphones, wearing jeans or mixing with men to celebrate an event targeted them equally.
Consider how Madhav Sadashiv Golwalkar, regarded as the most consequential head of the RSS, believed women were misled by modernity. The Caravan magazine carried an in-depth report on the RSS to assess Modi’s three years in power in 2017. Citing a couplet that states that “a virtuous lady covers her body”, Golwalkar, according to Caravan, lamented that “‘modern’ women think that ‘modernism’ lies in exposing their body more and more to the public gaze. What a fall!” Take your pick.

And perhaps, Imran Khan is aware of this as is the ‘other side’. The decision to change the chief minister did not come out of the blue. It had been evident for some time that the PTI and Khan were growing disillusioned with Ali Amin Gandapur. And the reasons were many — his ‘failure’ to get any concessions for Khan; allegations of corruption and misgovernance; and unhappiness of the party (leadership as well as workers) with him. The rumours about what he was getting wrong kept growing.
 
 

That Khan was aware of this was obvious. More than once he had sent messages for Gandapur to visit him, to discuss governance matters, such as the budget or increasing terrorism within the province. But for some time now, the chief minister had been a no-show at Adiala. He wasn’t getting the permission was the reply from Peshawar.
But it seems that matters came to a head at the recent jalsa in Peshawar. It was a lacklustre affair by some accounts, lending credence to reports of the growing unpopularity of the party in the province and the disillusionment of the workers with the provincial government. Social media footage of participants expressing their anger when Gandapur took to the stage was widely shared. The incident rattled Gandapur who hot-footed it to Adiala, where the doors opened smoothly for him. That he left as abruptly as he had turned up confirmed the rumours that his visit had not gone well. Gandapur left it to Barrister Saif to tell the press how he was still Khan’s blue-eyed boy, though his blistering attack on Aleema Khan later told a different story.
 


When the announcement came from Adiala about the change of guard, however, the focus was on the growing militancy and the chief minister’s inability to separate his government from the centre’s policy. That this may not be the entire story is also possible. The trial in jail of Khan in the case called Toshakhana 2 continues at breakneck speed and there are few doubts which way it is headed. There are very little chances of relief from the higher courts. It is assumed that after all the convictions have been secured, access to him will become even more limited. In these circumstances, there is little incentive for Khan to let KP cooperate with the centre, especially as the PTI’s rank and file is also unhappy. It could be a case of using one arrow for two targets.

If the new CM chooses the path of resistance it will further complicate KP’s security situation.

But more than Gandapur’s ‘sacking’, it was the nomination of his successor that upped the temperatures. The party in KP welcomed Sohail Afridi but the rest of the political system reacted differently. The information minister at the centre did a press talk condemning the decision, adding that it would not be allowed. Others from the ruling party gave similar statements, as hushed whispers of governor’s rule or a splintering of the PTI in KP did the rounds. Overnight, the nominee was accused of being an associate of Murad Saeed (one of the few PTI stalwarts still on the run), a Taliban sympathiser, involved in smuggling or worse. The least of his sins and perhaps the only relevant one was his lack of experience. But the criticism against him grew more ludicrous.
The governor continued to throw up legal herrings from not having received the resignation to expressing fears about the authenticity of Gandapur’s signatures. For good measure, he also went and met Maulana Fazl; that they probably did a high five over their local rival’s exit is an image one can only conjure up mentally. The official images were serious and without any outcome.
All of this was also seen in conjunction with the press conference by the DG ISPR in Peshawar. While the talk was about the security situation, politics crept in. It seemed to some that it was aimed at the PTI and its governance in the province and how that was linked to the deteriorating security situation. In this environment, it’s hard to raise questions about the need for such press conferences so let’s just move on to politics.
By Monday morning, the election for the new chief minister went ahead far more smoothly than expected. The opposition boycotted the exercise; the number of votes cast for the new chief minister showed the PTI remained intact in the provincial assembly. But none of this indicates a smooth ride from hereon.
As mentioned, Khan, and by extension the PTI, has little incentive to allow smooth cooperation with the centre; this provides no relief to the PTI people behind bars and neither does it help with the growing discontent among KP residents vis-à-vis militancy and military operations.
On the other hand, the establishment is also in a bind. It has not been able to dent Khan’s popularity, especially in KP. But more importantly, it seems for the second time, it has toyed with and abandoned the idea of installing a non-PTI chief minister (for now). This is not simply because of the numbers game; it is more due to the concern over the reaction there.
Unlike Balochistan, the powers that be still worry about the people’s sentiment in KP. While the former can be given a completely puppet government with no legitimate voice, there is less willingness to be this indifferent to public sentiment in KP. This was probably at play in 2024 and might just have been at play in recent days.
But if the new chief minister follows a path of resistance, as he is expected to, it will make the security situation in KP complicated. And if he goes the way of Gandapur, the PTI and Khan will be under pressure again to stir things up. Indeed, short of rapprochement between Khan and the centre, the multiple crises in KP will not witness any change for the better. The province, and by extension the rest of the country, is in for a rough ride.

• Six others still await government clearance in Lahore
• Returnees say beatings, burn injuries and forced labour became routine after Pakistan-India conflict
KARACHI: Some 42 of the 48 Pakistani fishermen released from Indian jails and handed over to Pakistani authorities through the Wagah Border reached Karachi on Monday after a long wait of over a month because of the uncertain situation in Lahore. There are still six of them awaiting government clearance in Lahore.
The expected time of arrival of the fishermen reaching the city by road from Lahore, thanks to the Edhi Foundation, was 12 noon, though they reached the Edhi Centre at Kharadar after 2:30pm. Still, the media gathered there already felt like they knew each and every one of them, as they had heard so much about them from their family members waiting for them there since morning.
What’s common is the story of the horrible torture they endured in custody after the May conflict between Pakistan and India. They were routinely subjected to physical abuse just for being Pakistani citizens.
There was Shamsa from Malir waiting for her elder brother Habibullah with his 10-year-old son Faizan. Every now and then her eyes would pool up with tears.
Hanif Katiyar was waiting for his son Sattar and brothers Ahmed, Hassan and Ghulam Hussain. “My brothers’ families cannot wait to see them, just like I cannot wait to see my son,” he said.
Noor-ul-Amin from Machhar Colony was waiting for his brother Noor Hussain with his five-year-old daughter Areeba Noor, wearing pink goggles and a shimmery blue dress. “My brother has been languishing in an Indian jail since 2013. He has several new family members to meet now, starting with my little girl who can’t wait to meet her uncle,” he said.
There was also Mohammed Hussain from Keamari Town waiting for his son-in-law Akhtar Ali, father of four. “His two older sons are already working at Karachi Fisheries. He can find work there too. He doesn’t need to go out to sea again,” the father-in-law said.
The wait was finally over. Very moving scenes were witnessed all around as the fishermen were reunited with their families.
The returning fishermen also had horrible stories to share. They said they were beaten up and burned with iron plates and rods in Indian jails.
Abdul Rehman’s entire left side was paralysed. He was on a stretcher and could not speak very well as he gestured with his right hand.
Abdul Rasheed said that he was made to do hard labour in the Indian jail. “They made me lift huge rocks. If I faltered, they beat me badly. If I asked for food, they beat me more and only gave me stale food to eat,” he said while picking up his young son Asim, whom he held close to his heart. The rose garland that others had put around his neck, he put around his son’s neck and kissed his cheeks.
Ghulam Hussain also said that he had to lift heavy construction material. “I only lifted heavy rocks and bricks and took heavy beatings and abuses,” he said.
“I was arrested three years ago, and things were not as bad as they got this year. The jail staff told me that I deserved all the beatings I got because I belonged to the enemy country, Pakistan,” he added.
Mujeebur Rehman and Akhtar Ali pointed to their burnt feet and legs. “They had hot iron rods and plates to hit us with if they thought we were being lazy,” said Rehman.
“I was arrested by the Indian coastguards four years ago. Earlier, things were normal, but this year I was told by the jail staff that I deserved a fate worse than death because I was Pakistani,” he shared.
Showing charcoal-coloured scars on his legs, Akhtar Ali said that he will carry the scars he received on his body and his heart in India all his life. “Are they not human beings? They treated us worse than animals. Hurling abuses at us, they would tell us that Pakistanis are worse than animals,” he wept at the memory.
Fishermen’s Cooperative Society chairperson Fatima Majeed Motani, who was also there to receive the fishermen and present them with some cash, said that fishermen on both sides, Pakistan and India, are innocent.
“They unknowingly cross the invisible boundaries at sea in search of livelihood,” she said.
“It is sad that India treats Pakistani fishermen harshly, while Pakistani authorities behave politely with Indian fishermen caught on this side for unknowingly crossing over to our side,” she added.
“I urge the United Nations to come up with some kind of international law for the release of these innocent people,” she said.
According to Ahmed Edhi, the maternal grandson of the late Abdul Sattar Edhi, the Edhi Foundation has always taken the responsibility of facilitating Pakistani as well as Indian fishermen.
“We transport Indian fishermen released from jails in Sindh to the Wagah Border with gifts from Pakistan, and we bring Pakistani fishermen handed over to Pakistani authorities at Wagah to their cities of residence.
In the process, we take good care of their needs and requirements such as food and stay,” he said, adding that there are still some 64 Pakistani fishermen languishing in Indian jails who should also be returned soon.

At least for now, it has succeeded in having its man installed in the office of the provincial chief executive in KP.
There had been warnings aplenty following Sohail Afridi’s nomination. Almost as soon as his name was announced, a stream of regime-aligned personalities from both politics and the media had levelled a series of allegations against him, ranging from corruption to outright facilitation of terrorists. Some had gone so far as to claim he would never be elected.
This level of confidence appeared at odds with the fact that the PTI enjoys an overwhelming majority in the KP Assembly, even with its lawmakers technically rendered ‘independents’ by the Election Commission. There were also questions why a politician considered dangerous had been operating unchallenged by the state so far and why his alleged misdoings came to light only after Mr Afridi was named as a replacement for the chief minister preceding him. In other words, why did the centre appear keen on preventing him from taking office?
Even now, though some 90 members of the KP Assembly have voted him in, Mr Afridi’s future hangs in the balance. The PPP-appointed governor of the province, Faisal Karim Kundi, had ‘returned’ the resignation of the erstwhile chief minister, Ali Amin Gandapur, seeking confirmation from him in person on Wednesday evening. This was criticised as an undemocratic attempt to block the KP legislature from appointing a new chief executive. And though the voting went ahead anyway, Mr Kundi is still required to administer the oath to Mr Afridi. As they say, there is many a slip ’twixt the cup and the lip.
Regardless of how the KP Assembly has voted, there are some important people who seem to feel differently about Mr Afridi. In fact, the pattern has been seen in other instances as well: laws, rules and procedures can be set aside very swiftly once a decision has been made. On its part, the PTI could have shown greater maturity by not rushing the matter.
Mr Afridi is known for his confrontational rhetoric against what he sees as state excesses. The party seems to have been sending a deliberate message by installing him in the most important office that it controls. The message has been received. One wonders how it will be responded to.

The controversy this time around is about who is actually at the helm of the province?
The saga began with the resignation of Ali Amin Gandapur as the chief minister, which is yet to be ‘formally accepted’ by Governor Faisal Karim Kundi. Despite this unresolved status, the provincial assembly went ahead to pick his replacement, a young lawmaker from Khyber, Sohail Afridi.
So, are there currently two chief ministers in the province, or not even one? Disparate legal opinions and the politics surrounding the CM’s election compound the matter, especially as the province is reeling from a significant rise in terrorist activities.
At the heart of the crisis is Governor Kundi, who has refused to consider Mr Gandapur’s two resignation letters delivered to him on October 8 and 11. Having sat on the letters for days, Mr Kundi has now summoned Mr Gandapur for a personal hearing to ascertain the “authenticity of alleged resignation” on October 15.

Some legal experts say Gandapur still chief executive, others insist province ‘has no chief minister’

As Mr Kundi was in Karachi, Ali Amin Gandapur responded to him on the assembly’s floor on Monday and reiterated his resignation. Subsequently, KP Speaker Babar Saleem Swati ruled that the governor was not the appointing authority, nor did he have the authority to force an unwilling chief minister to remain in office.
“I rule that pursuant to the resignation by Mr Gandapur, and election for the post of KP chief minister is being lawfully conducted on this day, October 13, 2025 in accordance with the Constitution and rules of the KP Assembly,” Mr Swati stated. This followed the election of Mr Afridi as the new chief executive of the province.
 
 

It is likely that Mr Kundi will not administer the oath to the new CM, evident by his decision to ‘approve’ the resignation tendered by Mr Gandapur. And without the oath, Mr Afridi remains a CM-elect and out of office. However, the PTI has already approached the PHC chief justice to appoint someone to administer the oath to the CM-elect under Article 255 of the Constitution. This move is similar to the one by the opposition in KP when it had sought the PHC intervention for the oath to its lawmakers on reserved seats.
Speaking to Dawn, Shumail Ahmed Butt, a lawyer and former KP advocate general, told Dawn that there was no chief minister in KP at present. He said Mr Gandapur has resigned while his successor has not taken oath, adding that the constitutional posts cannot be assumed without taking oath.
Mr Butt said that Mr Afridi’s election was legitimate. Besides, the assembly proceedings cannot be challenged in court, he said. However, according to Mr Butt, the governor does have the power to verify the resignation. He said the PTI could approach the PHC if the governor refused to administer the oath.
Ali Gohar Durrani, a PHC lawyer, however, disagreed with his colleague. He said Mr Gandapur was still the KP CM. “As long as Mr Afridi does not take the oath of his office, Mr Gandapur will remain the chief minister,” he said. He said the CM’s election was legal and valid, as the governor did not have the power to decline the CM’s resignation. “Mr Kundi’s actions are illegal and in violation of the Constitution,” he said.
About the PTI’s move to approach the PHC, he said the ruling party had jumped the gun. “Unless the governor declines to administer the oath, the PTI cannot approach the PHC,” he said.
Amir Javed, ex-advocate general of KP, claimed that Mr Afridi’s election was illegal. “When the province has a sitting CM and his cabinet, then how can another person be elected as the CM?” Mr Javed questioned.
Zainab Shahid, however, said there was no legal provision to seek the governor’s assent for the resignation.
The lawyer told Dawn.com: “There is no legal or constitutional provision requiring the governor of KP’s assent for the former CM resignation to become effective.”  “As per Article 130(8), the only requirement is that the CM resigns ‘by writing under his hand addressed to the governor’. The former CM has done so twice,” she added.

The discussions focused on accelerating the IFC’s investment plans, including the Reko Diq project, expediting IsDB-funded initiatives such as the M-6 Motorway, and advancing a new framework to deepen economic collaboration with both institutions.
During his meeting with Riccardo Puliti, the minister highlighted Pakistan’s improving macroeconomic indicators and the importance of strengthening IFC’s partnership with the country. “We value IFC’s role in scaling up private sector investment, particularly through multi-billion-dollar commitments under the 10-year Country Partnership Framework.”
Both sides agreed to work toward early financial closure of IFC’s flagship Reko Diq project, and the minister welcomed IFC’s new regional set-up, including a regional office in Islamabad, describing it as a “significant step to deepen collaboration and support sustainable investment in Pakistan.”
In his meeting with Dr Muhammad Sulaiman Al-Jasser, the finance minister thanked IsDB for its long-standing support to Pakistan and reviewed the current project portfolio. He emphasised the need for faster implementation of ongoing initiatives and welcomed the IsDB Board’s approval of financing for two sections of the M-6 Motorway.
Mr Aurangzeb also discussed continued cooperation in Pakistan’s polio eradication efforts and the oil financing facility, noting that both sides had agreed to develop a new Country Engagement Framework to guide future collaboration.

The decision aims to prevent anti-competitive practices and ensure transparency in the post-merger landscape.
The CCP’s detailed order, posted on its website, outlines strict conditions separating the new merged entity — comprising Ufone and Telenor Pakistan (MergeCo) — from PTCL and its other businesses. PTCL has committed in writing to comply with the order.
The merged entity is expected to become the second-largest cellular mobile operator (CMO) after Jazz, surpassing Zong. Currently, Ufone is the only loss-making CMO among the four, while the rest are profitable. As part of the conditions, the MergeCo must demonstrate profitability, and a third-party evaluator will be required to submit biannual performance reports to the CCP.
To enforce operational independence, the CCP has directed PTCL and MergeCo to maintain separate financial accounts for all service segments. They must also operate with entirely separate boards and management teams. Currently, some individuals hold overlapping roles in both PTCL and Ufone, including the CEO.
“No individual may simultaneously serve on the board or hold senior management roles in both PTCL and MergeCo,” the order states. Former board members or executives are prohibited from joining the other entity for at least three years after leaving their post.
Palwasha Khan, Chairperson of the Senate Standing Committee on IT and Telecom, welcomed the CCP’s decision. “As PTCL is a state-owned entity, it is our duty to safeguard public interest. The committee will seek quarterly accounts of MergeCo to ensure it remains profitable,” she said. The order also bars the exchange of commercially sensitive information between PTCL and MergeCo. Any reduction in interconnection circuits allocated to other telecom operators, including local loop, long-distance international, and cellular licensees, must be approved in advance by the PTA. Interconnect pricing or capacity must not be used to limit other operators’ access to MergeCo customers.
A senior CCP official stated that non-compliance could result in severe measures, including the possible divestment of PTCL’s telecom infrastructure or parts of its business, as permitted under Clause 13.19 of the order. Analysts believe the separation will improve transparency, limit cross-subsidisation, and support competitive offerings in the telecom sector.

The PTI said the gover­n­­ment could not carry out a transparent probe into the massacre, hence independent observers and hu­­man rights organisations must be included to ensu­­re a fair investigation.
In a statement, PTI Central Information Sec­r­etary Sheikh Waqqas Akram condemned the alleged killings of TLP marchers and demanded that all those responsible for the carnage be held accountable and brought to justice without delay.
Had the perpetrators of the Model Town massacre been punished, he said, the Muridke tragedy would never have occurred.
Where is the prime minister of the country, the chief minister of Punjab, and the information minister who, under normal circumstances, holds press conferences every few hours against opponents, he asked, saying that they had now gone completely silent. He lamented that the TLP leadership repeatedly sought dialogue until the very last moment.
“Had meaningful dialogue been initiated before the protests began, a peaceful solution could certainly have been found.”
Mr Akram called for immediate medical assistance for the injured, along with compensation for the families of those who lost their lives. He also called for an independent, tra­nsparent, and judicial inquiry into the incident to en­­sure that all those responsible are identified and face exemplary punishment.
He demanded that the State cannot do transparent probe into the massacre, hence independent observers and human rights organisations must be included in the investigation process to ensure fair investigation of the incident.

The police produced Falak before the court and sought her physical remand for investigation. The investigating officer told the court that they needed to interrogate the accused, and therefore sought physical remand.
Falak Javed’s counsel opposed the remand request, saying that the police had previously informed the Lahore High Court that his client was not required in any case. He said the arrest of the activist in the case showed mala fide of the police.
The lawyer asked the court to discharge the activist from the case.
After hearing arguments from both sides, ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill allowed a 14-day physical remand of the suspect to the police. The judge also directed the police to submit an investigation report at the next hearing on Oct 27.
A judicial magistrate last week sent Falak on judicial remand in two separate cases of alleged misuse of social media platforms against state institutions and a woman provincial minister. The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had arrested her from Islamabad.

Blair met Hussein al-Sheikh, the deputy president of the Palestinian Authority (PA) and head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation executive committee, in the Jordanian capital on Sunday.
Hamas, which has said it will not have a future role in the government of Gaza, has opposed Blair’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as foreign guardian for Palestine state.
In a statement, al-Sheikh said: “Today, I met Mr Tony Blair to discuss the day after the war and making President Trump’s efforts, which aim at stopping the war and establishing lasting peace in the region, a success. We have confirmed our readiness to work with President Trump, Mr Blair and the partners to consolidate the ceasefire, the entry of aid, the release of hostages and prisoners, and then start with the recovery and reconstruction.”

Hamas has opposed ex-UK PM’s involvement and the idea that any board should act as guardian for Palestinian state

“We stressed the importance of stopping the undermining of the PA, and especially the return of withheld Palestinian revenues, and preventing the undermining of the two-state solution in preparation for a comprehensive and lasting peace in accordance with international legitimacy,” he was quoted as saying by The Guardian.
The PA is keen that tax revenues withheld by the Israeli government are released, since this is preventing salary payments and undermining its liquidity, in violation of the Oslo accords.
Israel has also threatened not to renew next month the annual waiver of terrorist financing laws, which allows Israeli banks to process transactions with Palestinian banks.
Sharhabeel al-Zaeem, the PA’s justice minister, last week criticised Blair’s involvement, saying: “Is this the independent Palest­in­ian state we are aiming for? All these struggles for all these years in order to have Mr Blair, who failed in London, who failed in Bri­tain, who failed in Iraq, come and — with all due respect at a personal level to Mr Blair — be our guardian as if we were minors?”
Talking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he travelled to Israel on Monday, Trump questioned whether Blair would be popular enough with other leaders to serve on the board that the US president envisages overseeing the governance of Gaza.

Trump reignited his trade war with China on Friday, accusing Beijing of imposing “extraordinarily aggressive” new export curbs relating to rare earths. He announced extra levies — plus export controls on “critical software” — due to take effect from Nov 1, and threatened to cancel a meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Trump claims US wants to help China, not hurt it

On Sunday, China’s Ministry of Commerce called Trump’s tariff threat a “typical example of ‘double standards’”. The ministry said Washington had ratcheted up economic measures against Beijing since September.
“Threatening high tariffs at every turn is not the right approach to engaging with China,” it said in an online statement.
 
 

Chinese goods currently face US tariffs of 30pc under levies that Trump brought in while accusing Beijing of aiding in the fentanyl trade, and over alleged unfair practices.
China’s retaliatory tariffs are currently at 10pc.
China dominates global production and processing of these materials, and on Thursday announced new controls on the export of technologies used for the mining and processing of critical minerals.
 
 

Rare earths have been a major sticking point in recent trade negotiations between the two superpowers. They are critical to manufacturing everything from smartphones and electric vehicles to military hardware and renewable energy technology.
Later, in his post on Truth Social, President Trump said, “The USA wants to help China, not hurt it!!!”, adding that President Xi Jinping “… doesn’t want Depression for his country”.

• UN terms Afghan restrictions on women ‘gender apartheid’
• India’s Ministry of External Affairs denies any role in Friday’s press interaction at Afghan embassy
A PICTURE is worth a thousand words — and the image splashed across Indian newspapers on Monday, showing female journalists seated prominently in the front row at the Taliban foreign minister’s press conference in Delhi, perfectly embodies that sentiment.
The conference — Amir Khan Muttaqi’s second press event at the Afghan embassy within 48 hours — was convened following widespread outrage over the exclusion of female journalists from his initial briefing on Friday, BBC News reported.
Mr Muttaqi said at Sunday’s conference that the exclusion was unintentional and not “deliberate”.
“With regard to the [Friday’s] press conference, it was on short notice and a short list of journalists was decided, and the participation list that was presented was very specific.
“It was more a technical issue… Our colleagues had decided to send an invitation to a specific list of journalists and there was no other intention apart from this,” he added.
The UN has described the situation in Afghanistan as a form of “gender apartheid,” where women and girls are barred from secondary and higher education, prohibited from visiting parks and gyms, and face growing restrictions on employment. The Taliban government also enforces strict dress codes and limits their freedom of movement.
The Taliban, who regained power in 2021, maintain that they uphold women’s rights in line with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law. However, Western diplomats say the severe restrictions on women have hindered the group’s efforts to gain international recognition. The curbs on women’s freedoms are widely regarded as the harshest in the world.
 
 

Mr Muttaqi had arrived in India on Thursday for a week of high-level talks with the government from Russia, the only country so far to fully recognise their government.
New Delhi has not officially recognised Afghanistan’s de facto rulers but, like several other countries, continues to maintain limited diplomatic engagement — operating a small mission in Kabul and providing humanitarian assistance to the country.
The visit is viewed as a significant step in strengthening ties between the two sides — offering the Taliban a boost in their pursuit of international recognition, while allowing India to advance its strategic and security objectives.
On Friday, Mr Muttaqi met Foreign Minister S Jaishankar who announced that India would reopen its embassy in Kabul which was shut after the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
The press event later in the day was attended by around 16 male reporters while female journalists were turned away from the embassy gates.
India’s Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) clarified that it “had no role” in organising the press interaction, noting that it took place at the Afghan embassy.
However, the exclusion of female journalists on Indian soil sparked strong criticism from politicians and media circles, who faulted the government for allowing it.  Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi said that by permitting the event, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was “sending a message to every woman in India that she is too weak to be defended.”

• Conflicting reports emerge about fate of TLP chief; IGP says Saad Rizvi ‘not in custody’
• Second-tier leaders call on TLP supporters to converge on Lahore for protest on 17th
LAHORE: The fate of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) chief Saad Rizvi remained shrouded in mystery after law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religious party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests.
The operation, which began around 3:30am, quickly spiralled into one of the most serious confrontations between police and TLP in recent months, continuing for nearly six hours.
According to officials, some 1,500 police personnel in full anti-riot gear, supported by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons, surrounded the protest camp along the GT Road.
By morning, authorities said they had detained hundreds of demonstrators, though exact figures remained unclear.
There was, however, a significant discrepancy in casualty reports, with local media reporting a few deaths and dozens of injuries, while social media was rife with exaggerated claims.
Nevertheless, Punjab Police confirmed the death of Inspector Shehzad Nawaz, who they said was shot during the operation. Local media reports said that at least four people, including the police officer, had been killed and 56 others injured.
Unverified social media posts, however, claimed the toll among TLP supporters was far higher, with some alleging “dozens if not hundreds” of deaths — claims dismissed by Punjab’s police chief, Dr Usman Anwar, as “baseless rumours” and “a conspiracy to evoke public sympathy”.
Adding to the uncertainty were unverified reports about the fate of Saad Rizvi, which spread rapidly across social media and WhatsApp groups on Monday. Several posts alleged that Mr Rizvi had been shot and was in critical condition, while other accounts claimed that he had been taken into custody.
Interestingly, despite its active online presence, the TLP’s official accounts and spokespersons remained conspicuously silent on the matter, neither confirming nor denying rumours about their leader’s condition or whereabouts.
Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar confirmed to Dawn.com that TLP chief Saad Rizvi had not been arrested, nor injured in Monday morning’s clashes.
Ripples across the country
By mid-morning, the unrest had spread to several other parts of the country. In Lahore, hundreds of TLP supporters took to the streets, blocking key intersections and damaging vehicles in protest at what they called a “brutal crackdown”.
In Burewala, five police officers, including a deputy superintendent, were injured when TLP activists clashed with local law enforcers.
In Faisalabad, demonstrators blocked the Chenab Chowk for nearly two hours, forcing the Government College University Faisalabad to postpone its scheduled examinations.
 
 

Further south, dozens of protesters obstructed the national highway at Mian Channu for half an hour, while in Bahawalnagar, TLP members blocked the Bahawalnagar–Head Sulemanki Road near Minchinabad, prompting another round of arrests and the registration of criminal cases under multiple charges.
In Karachi, similar scenes played out as TLP activists organised protests in North Karachi and New Karachi to denounce the police action in Punjab. Fear and uncertainty gripped the city as demonstrators blocked major thoroughfares and clashed with police.
West Zone deputy inspector general Irfan Ali Baloch said protesters had set up sit-ins at 4-K Chowrangi and Sindhi Hotel, where they blocked roads and attacked police with stones, injuring two constables.
“The police responded with tear gas and arrested five of them,” he told Dawn. “The situation was brought under control and traffic resumed.”
Late on Monday night, Mufti Wazeer Ahmad Rizvi, a member of the TLP’s Majlis-e-Shura (executive committee), released a video message urging party supporters to end their agitation, clear all roads, and await further instructions. “We will announce our next strategy soon,” he said.
Wazir Ahmad Rizvi, the group’s Balochistan emir, also called on protesters to disperse and converge on Lahore’s Data Darbar shrine on Oct 17.
Stalled negotiations
Explaining why an operation was launched against TLP workers, senior police officials said the crackdown had initially been halted after reports of renewed negotiations between the government and the TLP leadership. However, the talks quickly broke down.
“The TLP’s demands were completely unreasonable,” said a senior Punjab police officer involved in the operation. “They wanted security forces withdrawn from the entire route to Islamabad and insisted that all arrested workers be released unconditionally.”
According to the official, two rounds of talks were held between the early hours of Tuesday and Saturday night, but no progress was made.
When the protesters began to march towards Islamabad despite repeated warnings, police deployed anti-riot units to block their advance. The situation escalated when “armed men among the protesters opened fire on police”, critically injuring Inspector Nawaz.
‘State brutality’
Following the heavy-handed government response, JUI-F’s leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman condemned the government’s use of force against Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) activists.
Describing the operation as “state brutality”, Maulana asserted that the right to peaceful protest is fundamental for every citizen, criticising the government’s violent crackdown on TLP demonstrators as unacceptable. Maulana suggested that the government could have resolved the issue through dialogue rather than resorting to force.
However, Pakistan’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif expressed a different perspective on the events, calling the protests “an insult to religion”.
“Forming armed groups in the name of religion, blocking roads and holding the public hostage is an insult to religion. For two years, tyranny and a festival of blood were played out in Gaza, yet no one remembers any protests. When the ceasefire happened there, the protests began. The time has come to stop holding our society hostage… through violence in the name of religion,” he wrote on X.

ISLAMABAD: US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Pakistan’s defence minister termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism.
On Monday, troops stood on high alert, with border crossings closed for trade and travel after deadly clashes over the weekend.
 
 

Fighting between the two sides erupted after Pakistan supposedly undertook an operation against militant hideouts along the  Afghan border.
Speaking on Geo News, Defence Min­ister Khawaja Asif said that as of today, there are ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.”
Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained.
At least 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed in border clashes following an attack from the Afghan side late on Saturday night.
Mediation offers
For his part, US President Donald Trump appeared eager to ease tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan, saying he was ‘good at making peace’.
“I hear there’s a war now going on between Pakistan and Afghanistan,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Washington to Israel.
“I said, I’ll have to wait till I get back. You know, I’m doing another one, because I’m good at solving wars, I’m good at making peace,” he said.
China, which shares borders with both Pakistan and Afghanistan, also expressed willingness to play a constructive role in improving relations between the two neighbours.
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian on Monday voiced deep concern over the latest clashes, and similar sentiments were also shared by Russia.
The Russian Foreign Ministry on Monday called on Kabul and Islamabad to exercise restraint. “According to the incoming information, the situation is stabilising. We welcome this process,” it stated.
‘Mind your own business’
On the other hand, Afghan Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, who is on a visit to New Delhi, said Afghanistan did not wish to fight with anyone and all its other neighbours were happy with Kabul.
“War is not a solution to problems. There is a need for dialogue. This has been our policy,” Muttaqi told reporters in the Indian capital.
But in an uncharacteristic comment about domestic politics, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid criticised Pakistan’s use of force against Tehreek-i-Labbaik protesters.
Reacting sharply, the Foreign Office asked the Afghan spokesperson “to prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside [your] jurisdiction”.
“The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters.”
While the exchange of fire between the two countries ceased on Monday, all entry points have been “closed since Saturday following the unprovoked attacks by the Afghan Taliban forces,” a senior Pakistani security official told Reuters.
Another official said there were a few incidents of exchange of small arms fire on Sunday night, but the overall situation was calm. This view was echoed by Afghan defence ministry spokesperson Enayat­ullah Khowarazmi, who said the “current situation” on the border was normal.
However, cross-border trade remained suspended on Monday.
Loaded vehicles, including containers and trucks, are stuck on both sides of the border. Besides fresh fruit and vegetables, they are carrying imports and exports and transit trade goods and causing millions of rupees of losses to the two countries as well as traders,” said Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, senior vice president of the Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry.—Agencies / with input from Baqir Sajjad Syed

• Phenomenon likely to disrupt Kharif crop harvesting, raise Glof risk
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is likely to face one of its coldest winter this year in decades due to the La Nina climate pattern.
According to the latest situation report on Pakistan’s monsoon floods, compiled by the Intersector Coordination Group in collaboration with other partners, this could lead to colder-than-usual winter conditions, further stretching coping  mechanisms of households affected by the floods, particularly in the mountainous regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit Baltistan.
A La Nina occurs when sea surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean cool abnormally, triggering extreme weather shifts worldwide.
 
 

In its forecast for October, the report published by UN-OCHA says that the continued marginally negative phases of both the El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean Dipole will drive rainfall across Pakistan.
Northern Punjab, KP, AJK, and GB are likely to witness below-normal rainfall, while southern areas like Sindh, Balochistan, and southern Punjab may receive near-normal precipitation, it noted.
According to the report, the expected impacts of this phenomenon include possible disruptions to Kharif crop harvesting due to isolated storms, increased risk of dengue outbreaks in stagnant water conditions, higher chances of glacial lake outburst floods in upper areas, reduced river inflows affecting irrigation, elevated smog and air pollution in plains, and adverse effects on livestock health and fodder availability due to above-normal temperatures.
The report also takes stock of the deteriorating post-flood situation, especially in the context of “a diminishing response capacity both by government and humanitarian partners”.
“Despite robust response by local and international actors at the onset of the crisis, three months since, the presence of humanitarian partners and response capacity on the ground decreased.  Pre-positioned stocks and initial emergency funds were used, with humanitarian partners now seeking additional funding for sustained interventions to ensure provision of basic services during the transition period from a humanitarian response to that of early recovery,” the OCHA report says.
Of particular concern is the long-term damage to livelihoods, which threatens recovery and self-sustainability. Crop fields were flooded, devastating harvests, livestock and fodder were swept away, and farm machinery and agricultural tools were damaged or destroyed, wreaking havoc on livelihoods and chances of restarting income generating activities in the near future.
 
 

According to a recent geo-spatial impact assessment conducted by FAO in flood affected areas, flood waters inundated around 1.2 million hectares in Punjab, the country’s food basket, damaging major rice, cotton, and sugarcane fields. The disaster coincided with the critical window for Rabi crop planting, further threatening food security and livelihoods and the ability to bounce back.
Remaining stagnant water in some flood-affected areas is also of concern as it causes significant health risks, including outbreaks of waterborne diseases like cholera, diarrhea, and typhoid, as well as vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, which thrive in these conditions.
 
 

With over 229,760 damaged or destroyed homes, many families continue to sleep outside, with little protection from the elements or vector-borne diseases carried by mosquitoes.
Schools and health facilities have lost essential supplies and damaged or covered in thick mud preventing the resumption of classes or provision of health services. Food and fodder stocks were either washed away or now lay waterlogged and rotten, increasing food insecurity and reliance on humanitarian food rations.

The FO was responding to a statement by Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid slamming the police crackdown on the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).
The TLP, which began its protest march in Lahore on Friday, was planning to reach Islamabad and stage a demonstration in support of Gaza and Palestine outside the US embassy. On Monday, police and law enforcement agencies launched an early-morning operation to disperse the protesters, who were encamped in Muridke. The clashes left a police officer and four civilians dead, including three TLP workers.
Mujahid issued a statement earlier today in which Kabul expressed its condolences and said it was “profoundly saddened” by the violence and deaths and noted that the demonstrations were carried out “in accordance with the country’s legal framework”.
“We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and to the entire nation of Pakistan, and we wish a swift recovery to those who have been wounded,” Mujahid’s statement read.
“We urge the Pakistani government and its ruling authorities to cease any further acts of violence against their people and to pursue resolution through dialogue and mutual understanding.”
 






In response, the FO took to X and acknowledged the statement, urging Kabul to “prioritise issues pertinent to Afghanistan and refrain from commenting on matters outside their jurisdiction”.
“The principle of non-interference in matters of other countries should be adhered to as per international diplomatic norms. Pakistan does not require outside advice on its internal matters,” the FO wrote.
It also urged Kabul to abide by its obligations to the international community under the Doha Process and to “not allow its land to be used for terrorism against other countries”.
“Besides, the regime should focus on [the] formation of an inclusive and truly representative government, instead of engaging in baseless propaganda,” the FO concluded.

Trump was addressing a ceremony following the signing of a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas at the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit in Egypt. He also invited PM Shehbaz to deliver a special address at the ceremony.
Taking the podium, PM Shehbaz thanked Trump and the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi for their efforts in securing the peace deal.
“Today is one of the greatest days in contemporary history because peace has been achieved after untiring efforts led by President Trump, who is genuinely a man of peace [and] who has relentlessly and untiringly worked throughout these months, day in and day out, to make this world a place to live with peace and prosperity.”
’’I would say that Pakistan had nominated President Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his outstanding and extraordinary contributions to first stop the war between India and Pakistan and then achieve a ceasefire along with his very wonderful team. And today again, I would like to nominate this great president for the Nobel Peace Prize because I genuinely feel he is the most genuine and the most wonderful candidate for the peace prize because he has not only brought peace in South Asia, saved millions of people, their lives, and today, here in Sharm el-Sheikh, achieved peace in Gaza and saved millions of lives in the Middle East.“
PM Shehbaz said he wanted to salute Trump for his “exemplary [and] visionary leadership”.

“You are the man this world needed the most at this point in time. The world will always remember you as a man who did everything [and] went out of the way to stop seven and today eight wars,” he added.
The premier also thanked the Qatari emir for his efforts in securing peace in Gaza and the wider region, along with the efforts of the Turkish, Saudi and Emirati leadership.
 


“Suffice to say, had it not been for this gentleman, who knows, India and Pakistan are both nuclear powers, had he not intervened with his wonderful team during those four days, the war could’ve escalated to a level and who would’ve lived to tell what happened.”
“Similarly, here in this part of the world in the Middle East, Mr president, your valuable contribution along with President Sisi, I think history will remember in golden words.”
Retaking the podium, Trump quipped: “Wow! I didn’t expect that. Let’s go home, there’s nothing more I have to say. Goodbye everybody. That was really beautiful and beautifully delivered, thank you very much.”
PM meets other leaders
PM Shehbaz earlier reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for peace in the region and solidarity with the people of Palestine as he met world leaders in Egypt.
Two years of Israeli bombardment in the Palestinian enclave have claimed more than 67,000 lives, with the continuing to rise as more bodies are recovered. Last month, US President Trump had mediated a truce with the help of eight Muslim nations between Hamas and Israel and paved the way for the end of genocide in Gaza through a 20-point plan.
Last week, Hamas and Israel had signed an agreement to cease fire and free Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, in the first phase of Trump’s initiative to end the conflict. Yesterday, a statement by the Foreign Office (FO) said that the summit was the result of the diplomatic efforts that began on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly’s 80th Session in New York last month.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Egypt earlier today to participate in the Sharm el-Sheikh Peace Summit and attend the signing ceremony of a peace agreement aimed at ending the Gaza conflict. The premier arrived at the Congress Centre to participate in the summit and was received upon arrival by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.
 






The prime minister met with President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan and Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan of Armenia, where all three leaders expressed satisfaction over the recent ceasefire in Gaza. The meeting marked a rare moment of convergence between the two Caucasus nations and underscored the broader international commitment to de-escalation in the Middle East.
 






The prime minister also held bilateral discussions with prominent global leaders, including King Abdullah II of Jordan, King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain, UN Secretary General Antnio Guterres, President Prabowo Subianto of Indonesia, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Snchez, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud.
The premier also met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who thanked Pakistan for its “unwavering political and diplomatic support’’.
Both leaders expressed satisfaction over the Gaza ceasefire, and PM Shehbaz lauded the courage and steadfastness of the Palestinian people.
 






During these meetings, PM Shehbaz emphasised the urgent need for coordinated international efforts to restore peace in the region. He highlighted Pakistans consistent stance on the Palestinian issue, reaffirming Islamabads unwavering diplomatic and moral support for the Palestinian people.
“Our position is rooted in justice and humanity,” he said.
“Pakistan will continue to stand by the Palestinian cause and support all peaceful initiatives aimed at ending violence and ensuring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.”
The meetings also included discussions on broader regional stability, strengthening multilateral cooperation, and promoting dialogue to resolve long-standing conflicts.
He later met Trump, who also arrived in Egypt to attend the signing ceremony and met world leaders as he welcomed them.

Earlier, PM Shehbaz hailed the peace plan a “crucial step towards lasting peace in the Middle East”.
“Grateful to our co-hosts, President El Sisi and President Trump. We would not have seen this moment without President Trump’s outstanding leadership and unwavering commitment,” PM Shehbaz said on X.
“It took his single-minded pursuit of peace to end the needless killing and destruction,” he said.
 






PM Shehbaz added that the ceremony marked the “closing of a genocidal chapter, one that the international community must ensure is never repeated anywhere again”.
He said the “brave and resilient” Palestinian people deserve to live in a free Palestine, “with pre 1967 borders, with Al Quds Al Sharif as their capital city”.
Trump, along with Sisi, will chair the summit set to be attended by world leaders, including the head of the United Nations.
The gathering in the Red Sea resort town will bring together “leaders from more than 20 countries”, Sisi’s office had said. It will seek “to end the war in the Gaza Strip, enhance efforts to achieve peace and stability in the Middle East, and usher in a new era of regional security”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni and Pedro Sanchez of Spain will also attend the summit. French President Emmanuel Macron and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will also travel to Sharm el-Sheikh, according to their offices.
The European Council will be represented by its president, Antonio Costa, a spokesperson said. Jordan’s King Abdullah II is also expected to attend, according to state media.
Israel and Hamas, however, will not attend the summit.
“No Israeli official will attend,” Shosh Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told AFP yesterday.
Similarly, Hamas confirmed it will not participate directly. Hossam Badran, a member of the Hamas political bureau, told AFP that the Palestinian group “will not be involved.” He noted that Hamas “acted principally through … Qatari and Egyptian mediators” during previous negotiations.</p><small>2025-10-13 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628432-pm-shehbaz-praises-trump-as-man-of-peace-for-role-in-gaza-ceasefire-deal' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz praises 'man of peace' Trump for securing historic Gaza ceasefire deal</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X, PTCL said that maintenance work on the submarine cable will be carried out to repair a faulty repeater.
“The activity will start on October 14 … around 11am PST, which can last for up to 18 hours,” the telecom giant said. “During this period, customers will face Internet service degradation. We regret the inconvenience, please.”
 






Meanwhile, internet monitoring service Downdetector showed users reporting issues accessing social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram in Pakistan.

Last month, PTCL warned that cuts to submarine internet cables in Saudi waters would likely impact internet services in the country during peak hours.
This is not the first time that damage to undersea internet cables has affected services in Pakistan.
Internet users across Pakistan complained of slow internet and hindered access to services throughout 2024.
On January 3 this year, PTCL said teams were “diligently” working to resolve the matter of disruptions faced by users after a fault in the AAE-1 subsea internet cable connecting Pakistan slowed down the network speed in the country. Full connectivity was later restored on January 16.</p><small>2025-10-13 16:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628421-pm-engages-trump-world-leaders-on-sidelines-of-sharm-el-sheikh-peace-summit' target='_blank'><strong>PM engages Trump, world leaders on sidelines of Sharm El-Sheikh Peace Summit</strong></a><br><p>
