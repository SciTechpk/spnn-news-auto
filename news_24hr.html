In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
Responding to the DG ISPR’s accusations in a press conference today at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “Do not drive away the people of Pakistan, they stand with Imran Khan and the PTI. Imran Khan is not a national security threat. He has kept the people united.”







Raja said there were many narratives in the country, including along ethnic and sectarian lines, yet Imran had rejected all of them to stand with the narrative of Pakistan, along with PTI’s supporters and voters.
“For God’s sake, don’t do this. You will not be able to minus Imran Khan, but God forbid if you do, it will be very difficult to keep this country’s interests united. If you attack KP and remove its elected government to install an unelected setup, then you yourselves will be responsible for the conditions that follow.”
Raja termed the DG ISPR’s press conference “unfortunate” and added that the party will not answer the accusation and charges levelled against the PTI founder.







“Today we are being told that the country’s most popular leader is a national security threat, which is ridiculous, but this has not been said for the first time.”
Referring to the establishment’s manoeuvring against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s, Raja said: “The institutions decided again and again that any popular leader of the people is a national security threat and it is necessary to remove them from the scene, but this did not happen. You cannot remove them from the hearts of the people through your decisions. The nation has always been aware and there is a reason it is standing behind Imran Khan. We are not mad, we know who has always been in control in this country.”
Raja elaborated that he wanted to set the context for everyone, noting that there have been countless times in the country’s history when it was pushed from democracy toward force and authoritarianism.
Referring to previous military dictatorships in the country, he said prosperity was always promised, and yet, they all ultimately failed.
The general secretary of the party said it was claimed multiple times during the past that democracy, law and the Constitution does not suit the country, and needs a stick, but the “ruler always left it weaker than before”.
Raja lamented that the party was frequently criticised as a ragtag group without understanding of affairs and what heights the country was being taken towards.
However, the PTI secretary general questioned whether the country needed to be forcibly developed through the use of power, noting that if this were the case, it would have already happened during previous periods of military rule.
Raja said there was a need for a “grand dialogue”, given the country’s current situation, and that the nation needed to be involved lest the past repeat itself.
“There will be no change, and we will go backwards.”
Referring to the constitutional amendments and the subjugation of the judiciary, he said the development was not even comparable to anything under previous eras of military rule.
Slamming censorship in the country, the senior PTI leader said that anyone speaking freely could be subject to the Peca law, inquiries, and more, referring to the trial proceedings of husband-and-wife lawyer duo Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha.
Raja said the PTI was ready to talk, but the people of KP and their chief minister should never be mocked or denigrated.
“Don’t put the future of the country or KP at stake in this battle of narratives. This is a very sensitive area, take the people along in the conditions that are there at the moment and the state of terrorism. The PTI is the biggest force in the country that can take it towards betterment.”
The PTI secretary general also seemingly criticised the party’s social media wing and supporters, who he said called the party out to respond or answer why it was not taking action. “We are sitting because the country is dear to us and we don’t want discord in the country,” Raja added.
He said the party and Imran would take every step required for the benefit of the country.
“It is very easy to respond to the brick with a stone but we will not do it because the country’s benefit is not in this.”
Former National Assembly speaker and PTI MNA Asad Qaiser also voiced a complaint with the DG ISPR’s remarks.
“There is great anger and heightened emotions in our province. Your words should have been appropriate. We think such words should be desisted from and will also demand that they are retracted because a whole society and province think it has been disrespected.”
Barrister Gohar calls for easing of ‘tone’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali criticised the DG ISPR’s remarks, calling them “inappropriate and wrong” and saying it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister.







Gohar said that “there is an enemy of ours” who would be pleased by press conferences against each other, adding that this was why he had earlier said today’s would not be a confrontational press conference.
PTI Chairman said the party wanted to clarify that “some people are trying to incite fighting between the workers of a major party and members of a major institution”.
Gohar said such incidents should never occur, warning that “the beginning of any great destruction is always due to a few inappropriate words”. He added that ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction.
The PTI leader said there was still time for “tone to be eased” and for steps to improve the current situation. He called for Tuesday’s meeting with Imran to be allowed without restriction and urged that no politics be made over the ex-premier’s meetings with his sisters.
He maintained that the country deserved to prosper and grow, but if the current tense atmosphere and attitude continued, “then it won’t be minus-one, but minus-everyone, which should not happen”.
At the start of the press conference, Gohar welcomed everyone to what he said would be an “unusual” press briefing in response to the military spokesperson’s remarks against the PTI founder, saying it would have a “different tone”.
“We are not going to do a confrontational press conference or to respond to a brick with a stone, but it is very important to tell some facts to the people as charges have been levelled at us.”
He claimed that the PTI was the country’s largest political party and its leader was Imran, with the support of 70 per cent of the nation.
“It is necessary to tell the people what has happened to us in the recent past. From 180 seats, we were reduced to 91 seats, and now we are left with 76. Reserved seats were taken and there was violence against women and children. The injustices against us are a tale of their own.”
Barrister Gohar said the party had continued to endure in order to uphold democracy, adding that the PTI’s stance was rooted in democracy, peace and the rule of law, and that Imran Khan had always maintained that both Pakistan and its army belong to the people.
The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role.
The PTI chairman added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but yesterday’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”.
Referring to Imran’s pending cases and delayed proceedings, he said the party began with a position of calling for his release and was now reduced to asking for meetings to be permitted with the PTI founder.
“All that we endured was for the sake of democracy and the country, but we say, if such conditions continue and such treatment with each other continues, then democracy will be the one to face the biggest loss.”</p><small>2025-12-06 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/061215276378c48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959542/14-terrorists-killed-in-kp-balochistan-intelligence-based-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>14 terrorists killed in KP, Balochistan intelligence-based operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday that 14 terrorists were killed in three separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan..
In a statement, the military’s media wing said nine khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij were killed on Friday.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It said an IBO was conducted in Tank on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
In a separate IBO conducted in Lakki Marwat, “two more khawarij were effectively neutralised by security forces”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area,” the statement said.
Later in the day, the ISPR said security forces conducted an IBO in Balochistan’s Dera Bugti district and killed five terrorists belonging to the Fitna al Hindustan. The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists in all three instances.
According to the military’s media wing, the eliminated terrorists “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians”.
It added that a counter-terrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of “foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the operations. According to a statement posted by state broadcaster PTV on X, he said that security forces were making big gains against terrorism under Azm-i-Istehkam.
“The nation stands with security forces against terrorism. We are determined to root out terrorism from the country,” he said.







President Asif Ali Zardari commended the “courage and timely action” of the security forces in “thwarting the heinous intentions of the terrorists,” PTV reported.
He stressed that “the nation’s resolve to eliminate terrorists will continue to stay intact until the menace is rooted out”.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the efforts of the security forces, stating that “security forces neutralised the militants with remarkable efficiency,” the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
He also praised their professionalism, courage, and the swift action taken. He noted that the “timely operations thwarted major threats and demonstrated the exceptional skill and commitment of Pakistan’s security personnel”.
“The nation takes pride in the bravery and professionalism of its soldiers,” he was quoted as saying. “Security forces remain fully determined to restore and maintain lasting peace in KP,” the minister added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier this week, security forces killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district.</p><small>2025-12-06 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/06190842fe4a449.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959575/pakistan-us-agree-to-intensify-cooperation-on-security-immigration' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US agree to intensify cooperation on security, immigration</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the United States agreed to intensify cooperation on security and immigration during a meeting in Islamabad on Saturday between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Acting US Ambassador Natalie Baker.
Naqvi and Baker discussed ways to enhance bilateral cooperation in counter-narcotics, security, and the prevention of illegal immigration.
The meeting also focused on strengthening collaboration in intelligence sharing, curbing drug trafficking, and expanding joint measures to stop illegal migration. The US envoy offered full technical assistance to Pakistan in combating narcotics and preventing unauthorised cross-border movement.
He said the identification of drug trafficking cases at airports remains a top priority, adding that state-of-the-art scanning machines were being installed at all major airports across the country.
Naqvi reaffirmed that Pakistan is strictly implementing a zero-tolerance policy against narcotics. Even today, drugs originating from Afghanistan are reaching dozens of countries and destroying young generations, he noted, welcoming US technical support to bolster Pakistan’s counter-narcotics capabilities.
On the prime minister’s directive, the National Narcotics Coordination Centre would be established soon, the interior minister informed the envoy.
Earlier in November, the two sides reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties, with Islamabad’s envoy describing it as an effort to build an “economically entrenched strategic partnership”.
After years of uneven engagement and recurring mistrust, both sides are now emphasising economic cooperation alongside traditional security ties.
In recent months, US officials have pointed to Pakistan’s potential role in regional stability and its capacity to contribute to economic and energy initiatives in South and Central Asia. The Trump administration has also encouraged American firms to explore investment opportunities in Pakistan’s infrastructure, minerals, and technology sectors.
For Islamabad, the new tone in Washington offers an opportunity to diversify its partnership with the US, while the Trump administration appears keen to reduce Pakistan’s overreliance on China. Officials in both capitals say they want to anchor the relationship in trade, investment, and long-term development — not merely in aid or counterterrorism cooperation.
In October, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the US sees an opportunity to expand its strategic relationship with Pakistan, but added that the recent strengthening of ties between the two countries did not come at the expense of Wash­i­ngton’s relationship with New Delhi.
In September, PM Sheh­baz Sharif also met with Mr Trump in the Oval Off­ice, where they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism.</p><small>2025-12-06 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0618141763a2489.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959573/pm-shehbaz-holds-groundbreaking-for-gujranwala-mass-transit-system' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz holds groundbreaking for Gujranwala Mass Transit System</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif held the groundbreaking ceremony for the Gujranwala Mass Transit System on Saturday.
Addressing the project’s groundbreaking ceremony, the prime minister termed it a major initiative to provide public relief and improve residents’ lives.
He said the project was a gift from the Punjab government that would transform the entire district, providing relief to commuters, including students, patients, labourers, lawyers and others.







The premier appreciated Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for the successful launch of diverse public-oriented mega projects across the province and said the recent by-election results reflected public trust in the leadership.
“In the next three years, the incumbent government of PML-N has the mandate to serve the people,” he said.
“The journey of progress and prosperity has just commenced, and we will move on the path of development rapidly,” he added.
The prime minister predicted a successful turnout in the PML-N’s favour in the next general elections.
In Punjab, he further said, his journey of progress was moving at a rapid speed under dynamic and young leadership.
He lauded the government of Punjab’s initiatives, such as the construction of a cancer hospital, the launch of metro buses, pollution reduction, the provision of houses for the homeless, helping flood-affected people, the provision of missing facilities in schools, etc.







The ceremony was attended by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, federal and provincial ministers, parliamentarians, lawmakers, relevant authorities and a large number of people.
PM Shehbaz and CM Maryam had laid the foundation stone of the project on Friday.
As per the project design and plan, a Rs62.7-billion Yellow Line Corridor will be built and completed within a year.
The Yellow Line will run entirely on green energy, benefitting at least 51,000 passengers daily.
As per the Punjab CM transport vision 2030, the 31-kilometre-long mass transit system of Gujranwala is being built between Aimenabad to Gakhar Mandi towns along the GT road.
At least 25 bus stations, including an underground bus station, will be established along the main route, whereas at least 36 electric buses will ply the route.</p><small>2025-12-06 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/06161431975f13f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959554/woman-daughter-stabbed-to-death-over-honour-in-karachis-gizri' target='_blank'><strong>Woman, daughter stabbed to death over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Gizri</strong></a><br><p>A woman and her teenage daughter were stabbed to death over “honour” in the Gizri area of Karachi on Friday night, police said.
Police said Kulsoom, 43, and her daughter Maryam, 11, were stabbed and killed by her husband, Samiullah. South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the double murder appeared to be an “honour” killing.
The suspect was arrested, and the knife used in the double homicide was also recovered and seized.
Police registered a case against the suspect on the complaint of the victim’s brother Faisal Khan.
Raza said the suspect stabbed and injured his wife and daughter in their home located near Noorani Masjid. The victims were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where they were pronounced dead.
DIG Raza said the suspect had “confessed” to the crime. He said the initial probe showed that the suspect was arrested around two and a half months ago in another case and was released on bail around three days ago.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
Man shot dead, other hurt
A man was shot dead while another was wounded in Lyari on Friday.
Chakiwara SHO Sajid Dharejo said two men were shot at and wounded in Bihar Colony. They were taken to the trauma centre of Civil Hospital Karachi, where Ahmed Wali, 40, expired during treatment, while Kamran Husain, 28, was admitted for treatment. He sustained a bullet wound on his leg, and his condition was out of danger.
The police suspected a personal enmity behind the incident.
However, Dharejo said the police would register a First Information Report (FIR) of the incident once the relatives approach it, to initiate formal proceedings and ascertain the motive and identity of the killers.</p><small>2025-12-06 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/06183004d610e1d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959570/victims-families-pardon-ihc-judges-son-in-hit-and-run-case' target='_blank'><strong>Victims’ families pardon IHC judge’s son in hit-and-run case</strong></a><br><p>A judicial magistrate on Saturday ordered the release on bail of the son of Islamabad High Court (IHC) Justice Mohammed Asif, after the victims’ families forgave him in the fatal accident case that claimed the lives of two young women.
The tragic incident occurred late at night on Monday near the Pakistan National Council of Arts in Islamabad when a black speeding sports utility vehicle (SUV) allegedly driven by Abuzar struck two girls who worked part-time for an event management company. The victims were travelling on a scooter when the speeding vehicle hit them, killing both on the spot due to severe injuries.
The accused, Abuzar, was remanded into police custody on Tuesday in the case.
He was produced before Judicial Magistrate Shaista Kundi upon completion of his four-day physical remand today. During the proceedings, the court recorded statements of the victims’ families.
The brother of one victim appeared in person, while her mother submitted her statement online. The father of the other girl also confirmed before the court that he had pardoned the accused.
After the statements were recorded, the court accepted the accused’s bail and ordered his immediate release.
According to the First Information Report (FIR) registered at the Secretariat Police Station on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Muhammad Asghar, the vehicle fled immediately after the collision.
Police traced the SUV through its registration number and located the suspect at a private hospital where he had reportedly gone for medical treatment. He was taken into custody, medical and forensic samples were collected, and the vehicle was impounded for examination.
On Tuesday, Judicial Magistrate Kundi had initially granted police physical remand of the accused after investigators requested more time to verify the medical report, conduct a vehicle inspection, and record eyewitness statements.
Sections 322 (manslaughter), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code were invoked in the case.
With both families pardoning the accused before the court, the magistrate granted bail and directed that Abuzar be released.
In Islamabad in 2022, an SUV allegedly driven by the daughter of a Lahore High Court (LHC) judge ran over two persons near the Sohan bridge on the Expressway and the investigation into the case had remained stalled.
As per the details available in the judicial record, on June 8, Shakeel Tanoli and his colleague, Hasnain Ali, were going home at midnight when they were hit by an SUV allegedly driven by a woman.
In July, 2024, Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi informed the IHC that the vehicle involved in the hit and run case was driven by a woman and was in the use of Supreme Court Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed.
In February this year, a local court in Islamabad acquitted Shanzay Malik, the daughter of the Supreme Court judge. The verdict was announced by Judicial Magistrate Adnan Yousuf, who accepted the acquittal application filed by Malik’s legal team.</p><small>2025-12-06 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637783-seven-year-old-dies-after-falling-into-open-manhole-in-lodhran' target='_blank'><strong>Seven-year-old dies after falling into open manhole in Lodhran</strong></a><br><p>

Netflix announced on Friday it had reached a deal to buy Warner Bros Discovery for $72 billion.
Although Netflix had publicly downplayed speculation about buying a major Hollywood studio as recently as October, the streaming pioneer threw its hat in the ring when Warner Bros Discovery kicked off an auction on October 21, after rejecting a trio of unsolicited offers from Paramount Skydance.
Details of Netflix’s plan and the Warner Bros board’s deliberations, based on interviews with seven advisers and executives, are reported here for the first time.
Initially motivated by curiosity about its business, Netflix executives quickly recognised the opportunity presented by Warner Bros, beyond the ability to offer the century-old studio’s deep catalogue of movies and television shows to Netflix subscribers. Library titles are valuable to streaming services as these movies and shows can account for 80 per cent of viewing, according to one person familiar with the business.
Warner Bros’ business units — particularly its theatrical distribution and promotion unit and its studio — were complementary to Netflix. The HBO Max streaming service also would benefit from insights learned years ago by streaming leader Netflix that would accelerate HBO’s growth, according to one person familiar with the situation.
Netflix began flirting with the idea of acquiring the studio and streaming assets, another source familiar with the process told Reuters, after WBD announced plans in June to split into two publicly traded companies, separating its fading but cash-generating cable television networks from the legendary Warner Bros studios, HBO and the HBO Max streaming service.
Netflix and Warner Bros did not reply to requests for comment.
The work intensified this autumn, as Netflix began vying for the assets against Paramount and NBCUniversal’s parent company, Comcast.
‘Strategic flexibility’
Warner Bros kicked off the public auction in October, after Paramount submitted the first of three escalating offers for the media company in September. Sources familiar with the offer said Paramount aimed to pre-empt the planned separation because the split would undercut its ability to combine the traditional television networks’ businesses and increase the risk of being outbid for the studio by the likes of Netflix.
Around that time, banker JPMorgan Chase & Co was advising Warner Bros Discovery CEO David Zaslav to consider reversing the order of the planned spin, shedding the Discovery Global unit comprising the company’s cable television assets first. This would give the company more flexibility, including the option to sell the studio, streaming and content assets, which advisers believed would draw strong interest, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Executives for the streaming service and its advisory team, which included the investment banks Moelis & Company , Wells Fargo and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, had been holding daily morning calls for the past two months, sources said. The group worked throughout Thanksgiving week, including multiple calls on Thanksgiving Day, to prepare a bid by the December 1 deadline.
Warner Bros’ board similarly convened every day for the last eight days leading up to the decision on Thursday, when Netflix presented the final offer that sources described as the only offer they considered binding and complete, sources familiar with the deliberations said.
The board favoured Netflix’s deal, which would yield more immediate benefits over one by Comcast. The NBCUniversal parent proposed merging its entertainment division with Warner Bros Discovery, creating a much larger unit that would rival Walt Disney. But it would have taken years to execute, the sources said.
Comcast declined to comment.
Although Paramount raised its offer to $30 per share on Thursday for the entire company, for an equity value of $78bn, according to sources familiar with the deal, the Warner Bros board had concerns about the financing, other sources said.
Paramount declined to comment.
To reassure the seller over what is expected to be a significant regulatory review, Netflix put forward one of the largest breakup fees in M&A history of $5.8bn, a sign of its belief it would win regulatory approval, the sources said. “No one lights $6bn on fire without that conviction,“ one of the sources said.
Until the moment late on Thursday night when Netflix learned its offer had been accepted — news that was greeted by clapping and cheering on a group call — one Netflix executive confided that they thought they had only a 50-50 chance.</p><small>2025-12-06 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637775-families-pardon-suspect-with-links-to-judiciary-in-islamabad-hit-and-run-case' target='_blank'><strong>Families pardon suspect with 'links to judiciary' in Islamabad hit-and-run case</strong></a><br><p>

A chain of tropical storms and monsoonal rains has pummelled Southeast and South Asia, triggering landslides and flash floods from the Sumatran rainforest to the highland plantations of Sri Lanka.
More than 1,790 people have been killed in natural disasters unfolding across Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam over the past week.
In Indonesia’s provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra, floods have swept away roads, smothered houses in silt, and cut off supplies.
Aceh Governor Muzakir Manaf said response teams were still searching for bodies in “waist-deep” mud.

 

However, starvation was one of the gravest threats now hanging over remote and inaccessible villages.
“Many people need basic necessities. Many areas remain untouched in the remote areas of Aceh,” he told reporters.
“People are not dying from the flood, but from starvation. That’s how it is.”
Entire villages had been washed away in the rainforest-cloaked Aceh Tamiang region, Muzakir said.
“The Aceh Tamiang region is completely destroyed, from the top to the bottom, down to the roads and down to the sea.
“Many villages and sub-districts are now just names,” he said.
Aceh Tamiang flood victim Fachrul Rozi said he had spent the past week crammed into an old shop building with others who had fled the rising waters.
“We ate whatever was available, helping each other with the little supplies each resident had brought,” he told AFP.
“We slept crammed together.”
Aceh resident Munawar Liza Zainal said he felt “betrayed” by the Indonesian government, which has so far shrugged off pressure to declare a national disaster.
“This is an extraordinary disaster that must be faced with extraordinary measures,” he told AFP, echoing frustrations voiced by other flood victims.
“If national disaster status is only declared later, what’s the point?”
Declaring a national disaster would free up resources and help government agencies coordinate their response.
Analysts have suggested Indonesia could be reluctant to declare a disaster — and seek additional foreign aid — because it would show it was not up to the task.
Indonesia’s government this week insisted it could handle the fallout.
Climate calamity
The scale of devastation has only just become clear in other parts of Sumatra as engorged rivers shrink and floodwaters recede.
AFP photos showed muddy villagers salvaging silt-encrusted furniture from flooded houses in Aek Ngadol, North Sumatra.
Humanitarian groups worry that the scale of the calamity could be unprecedented, even for a nation prone to natural disasters.
Indonesia’s death toll rose to 908 today, according to the disaster management agency, with 410 people missing.
Sri Lanka’s death toll jumped on Friday to 607, as the government warned that fresh rains raised the risk of new landslides.
Thailand has reported 276 deaths and Malaysia two, while at least two people were killed in Vietnam after heavy rains triggered a series of landslides.
Seasonal monsoon rains are a feature of life in Southeast Asia, flooding rice fields and nourishing the growth of other key crops.

At least three civilians were injured in the clashes last night and were shifted to the district hospital in Chaman. On the Afghan side, five people were injured, according to Afghan government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat.
According to officials, Afghan forces fired mortar shells on the Badani area, prompting security forces to retaliate. However, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding.
Prime Minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, Mosharraf Zaidi, however, confirmed the clashes.
In a post on X early Saturday morning, he said, “A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the Chaman border. An immediate, befitting & intense response has been given by our armed forces.”
“Pakistan remains fully alert & committed to ensuring its territorial integrity & the safety [of] our citizens,” he added.
A senior official in Quetta also confirmed on the condition of anonymity that the exchange of fire started at around 10pm and continued till late at night.
The clash comes amid stalled negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan after three rounds of talks in Istanbul could not yield any results.
Border clashes first broke out between the two nations on October 11. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism.
A day earlier, the spokesperson Foreign Office (FO) had reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to engage in talks with Afghanistan.
Pakistan-Afghanistan talks
Soon after the clashes on Oct 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha.
Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
But on November 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the clashes.</p><small>2025-12-06 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/06161130c36f6f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959553/qatar-pm-says-gaza-truce-incomplete-without-full-withdrawal-by-israel' target='_blank'><strong>Qatar PM says Gaza truce incomplete without ‘full withdrawal’ by Israel</strong></a><br><p>The nearly two-month-old ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will not be complete until Israeli troops withdraw from the Palestinian territory under a peace plan backed by Washington and the United Nations, mediator Qatar’s prime minister said on Saturday.
“Now we are at the critical moment … A ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of the Israeli forces, [and] there is stability back in Gaza,” Qatari premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told the Doha Forum, an annual diplomatic conference in the Gulf state’s capital.

 

Qatar, alongside the United States and Egypt, helped secure the long-elusive truce in Gaza, which came into effect on October 10 and has mostly halted two years of fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Under a second phase of the deal, which has yet to begin, Israel is to withdraw from its positions in the territory, an interim authority is to take over governance, and an international stabilisation force (ISF) is to be deployed.
Arab and Muslim nations have been hesitant to participate in the new stabilisation force, which could end up fighting Palestinians.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, also speaking at the forum, said talks on the force were ongoing and critical questions remained as to its command structure and which countries would contribute.
But its first goal, Fidan said, “should be to separate Palestinians from the Israelis”.
“This should be our main objective. Then we can address the other remaining issues,” he added.
Hamas is also supposed to disarm under the 20-point plan first outlined by US President Donald Trump, with members who decommission their weapons allowed to leave Gaza. The group has repeatedly rejected the proposition.
‘Lasting solution’
Turkiye has indicated it wants to take part in the stabilisation force, but its efforts are viewed unfavourably in Israel, which considers Ankara too close to Hamas.
“I think the only viable way to finish this war is to engage faithfully and forcefully in peace talks,” Fidan said.
Sheikh Mohammed said Qatar and fellow truce guarantors Turkiye, Egypt and the US were “getting together in order to force the way forward for the next phase” of the deal.
“And this next phase is just also temporary from our perspective,” he said.
“If we are … just resolving what happened in the last two years, it’s not enough,” he continued, calling for a “lasting solution that provides justice for both people”.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty met with the Qatari prime minister on the sidelines of the forum to discuss the ceasefire, Cairo said on Saturday.
“The meeting addressed developments on the ground in the Gaza Strip, with both officials stressing the importance of continuing efforts to implement the Sharm El-Sheikh peace agreement,” the foreign ministry statement said, referring to the Red Sea resort town where the October deal was inked.
Egypt has announced plans to train 5,000 police officers for Gaza and is among the countries considered possible contributors of troops to the stabilisation force.</p><small>2025-12-06 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637760-ministers-back-ispr-dgs-fiery-presser-amid-ptis-criticism' target='_blank'><strong>'Free to respond with full force': Ministers defend ISPR DG's 'guarded' language</strong></a><br><p>

IndiGo has cancelled thousands of flights this week due to a shortage of pilots after it failed to plan adequately for new rules limiting pilots’ work hours.
The government responded on Friday, announcing special relief for the carrier and the operation of additional trains to help clear the backlog.
The Delhi airport posted on X on Saturday that flight operations were steadily resuming, but cancellations remained rife elsewhere.







‘Waiting for my luggage’
With IndiGo’s spate of cancellations, fares rose on flights operated by other airlines on popular routes. The government said it was capping fares to maintain pricing discipline, without disclosing details of the caps.
The Civil Aviation Ministry said it would “continue to closely monitor fare levels through real-time data and active coordination with airlines”.
Fares were last capped during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
The flight cancellations are the biggest crisis ever for 20-year-old IndiGo, which has an over 60 per cent market share in the world’s most-populous country and has prided itself on on-time performance while luring passengers with lower fares.
IndiGo acknowledges failing to plan properly for the November 1 deadline to implement the stricter rules on night flying and weekly rest for pilots.
On Friday, more than 1,000 IndiGo flights were cancelled. After the government announced the exemptions to the rules for IndiGo, the airline said it could return to normal operations between December 10 and 15.
On Saturday, IndiGo cancelled 124 flights in Bengaluru, 109 in Mumbai, 86 in New Delhi and 66 in Hyderabad, airport sources told Reuters.
The disruptions have upended weddings in India as many families and guests were stranded at airports.
Hundreds of passengers gathered outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports on Saturday, some unaware of the cancellations, according to Reuters witnesses.
Satish Konde had to catch a connecting flight from Mumbai to the western city of Nagpur and had checked in before being told it was cancelled.
“I am waiting for my luggage to be returned,” he said.
Pilots call exemption ‘selective dispensation’
The new pilot rest and duty rules capped the number of night landings to two from six and restricted the maximum number of hours a pilot can fly in the night to 10 hours.
For now, IndiGo has been exempted from both measures until February 10.
The new rules also said that if a pilot takes a personal leave that cannot be not counted in calculating his weekly rest period of 48 hours.
That restriction too has been put on hold for all airlines, given the IndiGo crisis.
That has upset pilot labour groups, who told the government that safety must not be compromised to make up for IndiGo’s poor planning, the head of the Federation of Indian Pilots, C.S. Randhawa, told Reuters.
The Airline Pilots Association of India objected on Friday, calling the relief for IndiGo “selective dispensation”.
The norms “exist solely to safeguard human life,” the association said in a letter to the government.
Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules.</p><small>2025-12-06 10:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637746-nawaz-buried-slogan-driven-politics-with-development-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz 'buried slogan-driven politics' with development: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

On Friday, Lt Gen Chaudhry — without once naming Imran — called the former premier “a mentally ill person”, “a narcissist” and “a security risk”, while stressing it was for the government to decide how to deal with him. He had accused him and his party of pushing a narrative designed to undermine the armed forces and destabilise the state.
In response, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali had expressed “disappointment” over the comments, stating that “PTI’s narrative has never been, nor will it ever be, anti-state”.
Speaking to the media in Sialkot, Asif recalled that Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition, insisting that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman.
“When they were in power, I remember, he (Imran) would engage in theatrics and sometimes don a dupatta to mimic leaders. He did that for Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who is with him today. He would also use derogatory language for women,” Asif said, adding that the incarcerated leader continued to do the same via statements made on his X account.
“If DG ISPR has given a reaction, I believe it is a guarded reaction,” he said.
The minister assailed the PTI for engaging in activities that were reflective of an “anti-state” narrative. He lamented that the party leadership did not “acknowledge” the sacrifices of the armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
“I have attended the funerals of many martyrs … I have never seen someone from the PTI there,” the defence minister said, urging the party to “speak in favour of martyrs and not terrorists”.
“Do not attempt to hold dialogue with terrorists or take a soft stance with them,” Asif warned, telling the PTI that “when you continue to adopt such an approach, this is exactly the kind of language that will be used against you”.
Asif was of the view that while the military’s spokesman was “still careful with his words, I, however, have the liberty to give you a hard-hitting answer”.
Referring to interviews given by Imran’s sisters to Indian media, Asif assailed the party for “engaging with the enemy”.
“How can they call themselves Pakistanis and patriots?” he questioned.
The defence minister further said that the PTI’s “sole ideology was to gain power”, alleging that they had no “allegiance to Pakistan”.
Referring to the May conflict with India, Asif pointed said, “All our neighbours expressed their sympathies on the martyrdom of our soldiers … they stood with us shoulder to shoulder during the war, but internally this one party here did not play any role in confronting the enemy.”
“The PTI leader has something to say about everything; why did he not say anything during the conflict for our soldiers and armed forces?” he asked.
“Even during times of war, they continued to criticise the armed forces leadership … how can such people now say that the DG ISPR should not have said this or that.
“He has every right to say it,” Asif emphasised.
In a warning to the party, the defence minister said: “Do your politics, hold protests, but do not threaten the sovereignty and honour of Pakistan.”
In his response to the military spokesperson’s comments yesterday, Barrister Gohar had said, “It is regrettable when state institutions and political figures label each other as mentally ill or perceive each other as threats.”
He had also reaffirmed the party’s commitment to the country in his remarks, dismissing allegations of PTI spreading an “anti-state” narrative.
“Pakistan belongs to us, and so does the army; we have demonstrated this in practice and will continue to do so.”
He had urged that the conduct of “certain non-stakeholders”, without specifying who he was referring to, should not become a cause of tension between PTI and the institutions.
Barrister Gohar had said Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were incarcerated, and the overall situation would improve if permission were granted for meetings with them.
“The country cannot afford tension and chaos,” Gohar had said.</p><small>2025-12-06 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637738-justice-zafar-ahmed-rajput-sworn-in-as-shc-cj' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput sworn in as SHC CJ</strong></a><br><p>

Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah had resigned from the Supreme Court on November 13, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari. Shah had assailed the amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan” while Minallah said he had sworn to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”.
Meanwhile, Lahore High Court’s Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza had tendered his resignation two days later, saying: “After the 27th Amendment in the Constitution, I am not inclined as a matter of principle and in good conscience to continue as a judge.”
In a statement printed in Dawn on Saturday, 60 citizens and lawyers issued a statement saying: “We mourn presently, not at the resignations of Justices Shah, Minallah and Mirza — they have permanently etched their names on the short list of national heroes who prized principles over expediency — but at the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the high courts of Pakistan, and the entinguishment of the last embers of an independent judiciary.”
The statement included the names of lawyers Abid S. Zuberi, Jibran Nasir, Imaan Mazari, Asad Rahim, Sardar Latif Khosa, Salman Akram Raja, Zainab Janjua, Faisal Siddiqui and Salahuddin Ahmed.
Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar was also included in the list.
The statement said that Mansoor “undisputedly ranks among the finest jurists ever produced by Pakistan”.
“He stood entirely peerless in his zeal for judicial reform and his vision to drag the creaking edifice of the Pakistan judiciary into the 21st century and transform it into an instrument for speedy justice for the common litigant,” it said.
“It is our judiciary’s and our nation’s misfortune that we have chosen to sacrifice him at the altar of short-term political expediency and the desire for personal advancement of others,” the statement said.
It went on to say that Minallah had been a consistent voice for the weak and disempowered, for the families of missing persons, for journalists muzzled by the state, for the opposition “tormented by the government of the day and for judges hounded by intelligence agencies”.
“He was one of the few judges possessed with sufficient self-awareness to be able to cast a critical eye on the judicial history of Pakistan,” it said.
“To be lauded by those on the receiving end of power and criticised by those wielding it, is a distinction for the conscientious constitutional judge,” the statement said.
It also noted his contribution to transforming the Islamabad High Court as a “citadel of judicial independence”.
Talking about Mirza, the statement said that he left behind an enduring example of a judge who “refused to let fundamental rights become casualties of turbulent times and became an anchor of constitutional steadiness”.
“In his decisiveness and integrity, he neither courted controversy nor shied away from difficult decisions,” it said.
“By choosing judicial defiance over judicial silence, he ensured that when history is written, his name will stand firmly on the side of constitutional courage as the only high court judge who resigned in protest against the pseudo 27th Constitutional Amendment,” it said.
The statement said that it was ironic that the judges were castigated by the “wielders of power, not for their own sin but for earlier sins of those whom they resisted”.
“Their fault lay in the steadfastness of their ‘no’ when others were willing to say ‘yes’,” it said.
“Their decision to preserve their constitutional oath and honour over office and privilege: to speak out instead of silently acquiescing to regression masquerading as reform; to stand instead of kneeling — is a spark to the conscience of a nation,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-06 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/061356129bdca66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959548/adb-approves-381m-for-3-projects-concerning-agriculture-education-and-health-services-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>ADB approves $381m for 3 projects concerning agriculture, education and health services in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>The Asian Development Bank on Saturday approved three projects totalling $381 million concerning agriculture, education and health services in Punjab.
According to a press release, the development projects are aimed at fostering economic growth in the province.
“Investing in education, health, and agricultural mechanisation will play a transformative role in driving the growth of Punjab, a vital pillar of Pakistan’s economy,“ ADB Country Director for Pakistan Emma Fan was quoted as saying.
“These strategic investments will modernise agriculture, enhance human capital, and significantly improve livelihoods for millions of people across Punjab,” she said.
According to the handout, a $120m concessional loan and $4m grant have been allocated for the Punjab Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Agriculture Mechanisation Project to accelerate the province’s transition to modern, disaster-resilient, and low-carbon agriculture practices, benefiting 220,000 rural farm households.
“The project will help mechanise farming and provide alternative livelihoods for agricultural workers, including through boosting the knowledge and skills of 15,000 women. It will introduce a new financing model for farm mechanisation service providers to equip small-scale farmers with advanced machinery,” the ADB said.
The Bank also approved $107m for the Responsive, Ready, and Resilient Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Secondary Education in Punjab Programme.
“This includes a $7m grant from ADB’s Asian Development Fund and a $100m loan from ADB’s ordinary concessional capital resources. The results-based programme aims to modernise secondary education by enhancing inclusive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education across Punjab. The project, implemented by the Punjab School Education Department, will improve access to quality education for students across the province,” it said.
Further, the ADB approved a $150m concessional loan for the Punjab Nursing and Health Workforce Reform Programme to enhance nursing education, develop disaster-resilient training facilities, and strengthen health workforce governance in Punjab.
It noted that Pakistan faced a shortage of qualified nurses while the global demand for trained nurses was growing.
“Modernising the nursing sector will meet national and international demands. The results-based programme will focus on upgrading nursing curricula, expanding faculty development initiatives, and implementing a digital human resource management information system to align workforce planning with healthcare service needs. By expanding the pool of qualified nurses, predominantly women, the program will improve health service delivery across the province,” it said.
It said that key components of the nursing programme included the establishment of three centres of excellence in Lahore, Multan, and Rawalpindi.
“These centres will feature state-of-the-art simulation laboratories, digital learning platforms, and gender-responsive hostels, addressing Punjab’s demand for skilled healthcare workforce capable of meeting growing local needs and employment opportunities abroad,” it said.
Last month, the ADB had approved loans totalling $330m to Pakistan for the country’s Second Power Transmission Strengthening Project.</p><small>2025-12-06 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/060913020520918.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959529/imfs-executive-board-to-meet-on-dec-8-to-approve-disbursement-of-12bn-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>IMF’s Executive Board to meet on Dec 8 to approve disbursement of $1.2bn to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) Executive Board will meet on December 8 (Monday) to approve $1.2 billion in loans to Pakistan.
The IMF had reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan on its loan programmes in October after extensive talks were held in Karachi, Islamabad and Washington from September 24 to October 8.
The agreement still requires approval from IMF’s Executive Board before funds can be released.
If approved, it would unlock about $1.2bn in fresh financing for the country; roughly $1 billion under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and another $200 million under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
The IMF confirmed the date of the meeting in a brief announcement on Friday. The official calendar posted on the IMF website also showed the Executive Board would review Pakistan’s loan programmes.
Negotiations between Islamabad and the lending agency, led by IMF mission chief Iva Petrova, had focused on Pakistan’s fiscal performance, monetary stance, structural reforms and progress on climate-related commitments.
In its earlier assessment, the IMF noted that Pakistan had made “strong progress” in fiscal consolidation, reducing inflation and strengthening external buffers. It also acknowledged the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) continued tight monetary policy, which has played a key role in anchoring inflation expectations.
Structural reforms — especially those related to state-owned enterprises, energy-sector viability, competition and public-service delivery — were cited as areas where the authorities had demonstrated continued commitment.
The Fund also pointed to advances under the RSF-supported climate agenda, including efforts to enhance resilience to natural disasters, strengthen water-resource management and improve the country’s climate-information systems.
These reforms have taken on greater urgency following recent floods that caused widespread damage to agriculture, infrastructure and livelihoods.
Approval of the reviews is widely expected to bolster investor confidence at a critical moment, as Pakistan continues to stabilise its economy amid external pressures and the lingering effects of flood damage.
Islamabad has been under sustained pressure to maintain fiscal discipline, accelerate energy-sector reforms and continue revenue-mobilisation measures to ensure longer-term stability.
The IMF has warned, however, that risks remain elevated. The economic outlook has been tempered by flood-related losses, and the Fund has emphasised that monetary policy must remain “appropriately tight and data-dependent” to keep inflation within the SBP’s target range.
It has also stressed the need for steady implementation of reforms to strengthen competition, enhance productivity, improve public services and reduce persistent vulnerabilities in the energy sector.
If the Board grants its approval on December 8, Pakistan could receive the disbursement as early as the following day.
Officials in Islamabad hope the inflow will reinforce external buffers, support economic recovery and signal continued international confidence in the government’s reform agenda.
Key report released ahead of meeting
Ahead of the meeting, the IMF had released its long-awaited Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), in which it highlighted persistent corruption challenges in Pakistan driven by systemic weaknesses across state institutions and demanded immediate initiation of a 15-point reform agenda to improve transparency, fairness and integrity.
The report, publication of which is a precondition for the IMF Executive Board’s approval of the loan programmes, estimated that Pakistan could boost economic growth by about 5 to 6.5 per cent over five years if it implements a package of governance reforms beginning within the next three to six months.
The report led to criticism of the government, and opposition parties called for a probe into the “worst financial scandal of Pakistan’s history”.
However, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb stated last week that the report was “not criticism” but a “catalyst for accelerating long-overdue reforms”.
He maintained that the report acknowledged significant progress in sectors including taxation and governance, and that many of its priority recommendations were “already work in progress”.
The finance minister further said the government was committed to implementing the remaining recommendations as part of broader institutional reforms essential to sustaining Pakistan’s economic turnaround.</p><small>2025-12-06 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637747-karachi-court-sentences-man-to-39-years-for-raping-12-year-old-girl' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi court sentences man to 39 years for raping 12-year-old girl</strong></a><br><p>

The government has confirmed 607 deaths, with another 214 people missing and feared dead, in what President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has called the country’s most challenging natural disaster.
More than two million people — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected.
Survivors will be offered up to 10 million rupees ($33,000) to buy land in a safer location and build a new house, the finance ministry said in a statement late on Friday.
The government is also offering one million rupees as compensation for each person killed or permanently disabled.

 

The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said more than 71,000 homes were damaged, including nearly 5,000 that were completely destroyed by last week’s floods and landslides.
Around 150,000 people remain in state-run shelters, down from a peak of 225,000.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said it was considering Sri Lanka’s request for an additional $200 million, on top of the $347 million tranche the country was already due to receive this month.
“The IMF remains closely engaged with the Sri Lankan authorities during this challenging period, and is committed to supporting the country as it undertakes urgent efforts to recover, rebuild and promote resilience for the future,” the Washington-based lender said late on Friday.
Cyclone Ditwah devastated swathes of Sri Lanka as it was emerging from its worst economic crisis in 2022, following a four-year, $2.9 billion bailout loan from the IMF agreed in early 2023.
Dissanayake told parliament on Friday that Sri Lanka’s economy had made a significant recovery, but was not strong enough to withstand the latest shock alone.
Meanwhile, the DMC said more rain was expected in many parts of the country, including the worst-affected central region, triggering fears of more landslides.
That has hampered clean-up operations.
However, residents evacuated from the landslide-prone central hills have been told not to return immediately to their homes, even if they were unaffected by the slips.
A fresh landslide alert was issued on Friday for areas not covered by previous warnings.</p><small>2025-12-06 06:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/061047390d3d7f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959533/us-vaccine-panel-upends-hepatitis-b-advice-in-latest-trump-era-shift' target='_blank'><strong>US vaccine panel upends hepatitis B advice in latest Trump-era shift</strong></a><br><p>An advisory panel appointed by President Donald Trump’s vaccine-sceptic health secretary voted on Friday to stop recommending that all newborns in the United States receive a hepatitis B vaccine.
The move to end the decades-old recommendation is the panel’s latest contentious about-face on vaccine policy since its overhaul by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. earlier this year.
US health authorities previously recommended that all babies, not just those born to mothers believed to have hepatitis B, receive the first of three vaccine doses just after birth.
The approach aimed, in part, to prevent transfers from mothers who unknowingly had hepatitis B or had falsely tested negative, and had virtually eradicated infections of the potentially deadly liver disease among young people in the country.
After delaying the vote by a day, the panel on Friday passed its new recommendation for “individual-based decision-making,” in consultation with a health care provider, when children are born to mothers testing negatively for the disease.
The decision to vaccinate at birth should “consider vaccine benefits, vaccine risks, and infection risks”.
Trump hailed the move as “a very good decision” on his Truth Social platform.







But the new recommendation was immediately condemned by several medical groups, who noted widespread shortcomings in US maternal health screening as well as the possibility of infections from others.
“This irresponsible and purposely misleading guidance will lead to more hepatitis B infections in infants and children,” American Academy of Pediatrics President Susan J. Kressly said in a statement.
The vote was 8–3.
Trump-appointed officials at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are expected to formally adopt the recommendations at a later date.
The panel also voted to recommend that babies who are not vaccinated at birth wait at least two months to get the initial dose, and that blood tests be done to measure antibodies before a second dose.
Panel overhaul
After becoming health secretary, Kennedy sacked every member of the once-staid Advisory Committee on Immunisation Practices (ACIP), replacing them with figures whose vaccine-sceptic views track more closely with his own.
It has since set to work on reviewing prior recommendations — already tweaking advice on Covid-19 and measles jabs.
Medical experts fear the push could further contribute to declining vaccination rates in the United States.
The panel on Friday also began a broader review of the childhood vaccination schedule, and sparked further controversy by allowing testimony from lawyer Aaron Siri, a close Kennedy associate known for spreading unfounded theories on the subject.
While Trump vocally supports Kennedy’s policies, some in the Republican Party have pushed back, notably Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy.
Cassidy, a medical doctor, condemned the ACIP decision, noting the original recommendation was never “a mandate” to get the jab.
CDC officials “should not sign these new recommendations and instead retain the current, evidence-based approach,” he said on X.







Cassidy’s expression of alarm, like his prior statements against Kennedy, provoked criticism after he provided the key vote to confirm the health secretary in February.
‘Do no harm’
The United States had urged universal vaccination at birth against hepatitis B since 1991, advice also recommended by China, Australia and the World Health Organisation.
But several ACIP members argued that Friday’s decision would align the United States with other economically developed countries such as France and Britain.
The repercussions of the ACIP’s vaccine recommendations are broad because federal guidelines often dictate whether vaccines are paid for by health insurance companies in the United States, where a vaccine can cost hundreds of dollars.
But the committee’s influence is waning amid withering criticism from the US scientific and medical community, with Democratic-led states announcing they will no longer follow its recommendations.
Ahead of the vote, Cody Meissner, one of the few dissenting voices on the advisory committee, urged his colleagues not to change the current recommendations.
“Do no harm is a moral imperative. We are doing harm by changing this wording,” he warned.</p><small>2025-12-06 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0609541207b54e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959410/kp-cabinet-decides-to-withdraw-politically-motivated-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>KP cabinet decides to withdraw ‘politically motivated’ May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet on Friday decided to withdraw what it called “politically motivated violence cases registered on May 9 and 10 without credible evidence.”
The cabinet met with Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in the chair and ministers, chief secretary and administrative secretaries in attendance, according to an official statement.
It added that the participants took key decisions regarding the distribution formula for reserved seats in medical and dental colleges for students from merged tribal districts, the new proposed posting and transfer policy, the committee report on action in aid of civil powers law, matters related to wheat stock and procurement, the May 9 and 10 violence cases, the formation of the KP Sugarcane and Sugar Beet Board, additional funding for development schemes and other public welfare initiatives.
The cabinet decided that “politically-motivated” May 9 and 10 cases registered without credible evidence would be withdrawn. However, it offered no details.

Sends new posting, transfer policy to its panel for review

It referred the matter regarding the award of medical and dental colleges reserved seats after the bifurcation of South Waziristan district to its relevant committee for deliberation and recommendations to be laid in the next meeting.
Similarly, the new proposed posting and transfer policy was sent to the relevant cabinet panel for review.
The cabinet approved the nomination of mill representatives for the KP Sugarcane and Sugar Beet Control Board for 2025-26.
A detailed briefing was also given on wheat stocks, inter-provincial movement and future strategy. The previously notified committee was authorised to take necessary steps for additional wheat procurement as and when required.
The cabinet also approved financial assistance for the treatment of two patients undergoing kidney and bone marrow transplants. Approval was granted for the release of funds under the District Development Plan and District Development Initiatives to ensure timely completion of projects.
Besides, a special grant of Rs150 million was also approved for the counter-terrorism department.
The forum endorsed the implementation of the recommendations of the committee tasked with proposing measures following the repeal of the action in aid of civil powers law.
It also decided to refer the inquiry into the Radio Pakistan Peshawar attack case to a special committee of the provincial assembly for deliberation and recommendations.
Mr Afridi, who chaired the meeting via video link, issued policy guidelines for strengthening good governance, transparency and the use of modern technology in official affairs.
He said that the provincial government had already provided a clear roadmap for good governance and was actively promoting transparency and digitalisation across all departments.
Directing officials to prioritise online participation in official meetings, Mr Afridi said the approach would not only save time but would also result in significant reduction in government expenditure.
He condemned the recent press conference by federal ministers and declared it an inhuman, immoral and unconstitutional act.
The chief minister said that such behaviour was equivalent to deliberately provoking people and destabilising the situation.
He complained that leader of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Imran Khan and his wife were being subjected to solitary confinement in jail.
“Imran Khan is a leader of the entire nation, while his wife is an apolitical and modest woman, so their mistreatment is unacceptable,” he said.
The chief minister said to ensure institutional transparency and merit, all recruitment in provincial government departments, autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies would be strictly conducted through the Educational Testing and Evaluation Agency.
He said that no recruitment would be made through any private testing agency.
Referring to the recent meeting of the National Finance Commission, Mr Afridi said that his government vehemently presented Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s case about constitutional right to resources and received support from all participants.
He pointed out that the continued denial of the due Rs1.375 trillion share of the merged tribal districts in the NFC Award over the last several years was a grave injustice to residents.
The chief minister expressed concern over the 55-day closure of the Torkham border and said truck drivers as well as the travellers, especially women, children and the elderly, were severely affected.
He directed the administration of Khyber district to immediately ensure provision of food, shelter and all essential facilities to those people.
Mr Afridi also ordered the provision of bulletproof vehicles on a priority basis to civil officers, especially the district administration, and said all hurdles to the procurement process should be removed without delay.

Israel announced on Wednesday it would unilaterally open the Rafah crossing to allow residents to flee the Gaza Strip, a move swiftly rejected by Egypt as Cairo insisted on lifting the blockade in both directions to relieve the besieged Palestinian territory.
Egypt refused to facilitate what critics fear is the forced displacement of Palestinians, insisting on adherence to the terms of the United States-brokered peace plan, which mandates full humanitarian access.
The Rafah crossing, the only vital artery to the outside world for the residents of Gaza not controlled directly by Israel, has been shuttered for months, strangling the flow of life-saving aid.
The foreign ministers of Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Indonesia, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar expressed concern over the use of the Rafah crossing to expel Palestinians.
“The Ministers underscore their absolute rejection of any attempts to expel the Palestinian people from their land and stress the necessity of the full adherence to the plan proposed by US President Donald Trump, including its provisions on keeping the Rafah Crossing open in both directions, ensuring the freedom of movement for the population, and refraining from compelling any resident of the Gaza Strip to leave, rather to create the right conditions for them to stay on their land and participate in building their homeland, within a comprehensive vision aimed at restoring stability and improving their humanitarian conditions,” the statement read.







The FMs also underscored the need to fully sustain the ceasefire and ensure the unrestricted entry of humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip. They urged early recovery and reconstruction efforts and to create the conditions necessary for the Palestinian Authority to resume its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip.
The top diplomats of the Muslim countries also emphasised the importance of fully implementing the “Trump Plan” without delay or obstruction, “in order to achieve security and peace, and to consolidate the foundations of regional stability”.
“In this regard, the Ministers underscore the need to fully sustain the ceasefire, alleviate civilian suffering, ensure the unrestricted entry of humanitarian assistance into the Gaza Strip, initiate early recovery and reconstruction efforts, and create the conditions necessary for the Palestinian Authority to resume its responsibilities in the Gaza Strip thereby laying the groundwork for a new phase of security and stability in the region,” added the statement.
The ministers also reaffirmed their countries’ commitment to working closely with the United States and all relevant regional and international parties to ensure the full implementation of UNSCR 2803 and other UN Security Council resolutions. They emphasised the importance of creating conducive conditions for a just, comprehensive, and lasting peace based on international legitimacy and the two-state solution.
The ministers underscored that this should lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state along the lines of June 4, 1967, including the occupied territories of Gaza and the West Bank, with East Jerusalem as its capital.
Dar speaks with Saudi counterpart
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar slammed Israel’s restriction on the Rafah border crossing to allow only the exit of Gaza residents, calling it a “clear violation” of the peace plan that finally brought an end to the fighting.
The Foreign Office (FO) said FM Dar held a phone call with Saudi counterpart Prince Faisal bin Farhan today and discussed regional developments, particularly Gaza.
“FM strongly condemned Israel’s unilateral plan to restrict the Rafah crossing for the exit only of Gaza residents, a clear violation of the peace plan and a move that undermines humanitarian access.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring unfettered aid to Gaza and advancing coordinated efforts toward lasting peace,” the FO said.







Negotiations on the next stage of the Gaza ceasefire continue without significant progress at a moment when the truce appears particularly fragile, AFP reported on Thursday.
The first phase included a withdrawal of Israeli forces on October 10 to a line that still gave them military control of over half of Gaza, the release of all prisoners, living or dead, held by Hamas or its allies, and an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.
Though all living prisoners were released on October 13, one body is still said to be in Gaza.
For now, the Israeli government demands that the last hostage’s remains are returned before any talks begin on the second phase via mediating countries: US, Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye.
Egypt will also host a conference on Gaza’s reconstruction that will focus on the territory’s humanitarian needs, but no date has yet been set.
The process seems to be stuck mainly due to the Trump plan’s grey areas.</p><small>2025-12-06 04:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/060836399f67bec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959480/fcc-preparing-to-move-into-shariat-court-building' target='_blank'><strong>FCC preparing to move into Shariat Court building</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The planned relocation of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to its old premises in the congested Sector G-10 has been put on hold, as the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) — which earlier sought to retain the IHC building on Constitution Avenue as its principal seat — is now preparing to move to the Federal Shariat Court (FSC).
Sources confirmed that shifting of FCC record to the FSC building will begin today (Saturday), though it may take several days to fully transfer files, systems and administrative units.
IHC Bar President Syed Wajid Ali Gillani and Secretary Manzoor Ahmed Jajja held multiple meetings with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar to convey their concerns.
The law minister had recently said that a decision regarding relocation would be made only after consulting lawyers’ bodies.

Once keen on retaining the prized Constitution Avenue premises of the Islamabad High Court, the newly formed court will begin the process of shifting its record today

Initially, the FCC was supposed to establish its offices at the FSC. However, stiff resistance from the Shariat Court judges forced the newly-formed court to commence operations from the IHC building instead. Following the oath-taking ceremony of the FCC judges at the IHC earlier last month, the new court was temporarily allotted several courtrooms. The FCC administration then began seriously considering keeping the same building permanently — a move that caused unease within the high court.
Amid speculations about a possible relocation, IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar visited the old G-10 building last week to evaluate its suitability.
Justice Dogar inspected various sections of the renovated facility, including the Chief Justice Block, and reviewed the pace and quality of repair work. The district judiciary briefed him on administrative matters, ongoing upgrades, and the heavy workload of the family courts operating there.
Officials said the chief justice’s visit was aimed at determining whether the old structure — surrounded by workshops, car washes, low-cost eateries and shops — could feasibly accommodate the daily traffic, staff and litigants of a constitutional court.
Plans to shift the IHC back to its old pre­mises have created a clear divide among lawyers. While the District Bar Association supports the proposal, the IHC Bar Association strongly opposes it, arguing that the G-10 building — which currently handles a heavy docket of family matters — lacks the infrastructure needed for the high court’s expanded operations.
Before the IHC’s shift to Constitution Avenue a few years ago, the record room held around 65,000 files. Today, that number has swelled to over 200,000, with pending cases rising from around 10,000 to 18,000. Lawyers maintain that relocating to a smaller, outdated facility would cripple judicial efficiency.
The ongoing tug-of-war over the Const­itution Avenue premises resembles “a joint family squeezed into an ancestral home,” with each side citing space shortages and competing needs.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had reportedly finalised the FSC building as the FCC’s permanent home days before the 27th Amendment was tabled in parliament. Under the plan, the four FSC judges — who have a relatively small backlog of 56 petitions — were to be shifted to the IHC’s third floor, where four new courtrooms were being prepared by the CDA.
To facilitate temporary operations, the IHC administration allotted seven courtrooms to the FCC. However, after senior staff — many drawn from the SC — assumed duties, space shortages became more evident. The FCC chief justice was accommodated in Courtroom No. 2, previously used by Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, a move that reportedly caused discomfort within the high court.

ISLAMABAD: The government said on Friday it was considering a “time-bound amn­esty” for cryptocurrency traders, as local banks raised risk and compliance concerns amid more than $250 billion in annual crypto trading reportedly conducted by Pakistani users.
Officials floated the idea at a high-level consultative meeting after a top global cryptocurrency exchange argued that virtual assets could boost Pakistan’s GDP.
“These virtual assets should be considered as part of liquid money supply (M-1) … virtual assets collateralisation will help increase M-1” because these are highly visible and dependable, a Binance team member told the meeting, co-chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Pakistan Virtual Assets Regu­latory Authority (PVARA) Chairman Bilal Bin Saqib.







The meeting had been arranged to discuss and advance work on Pakistan’s National Digital Asset Framework, an official statement said, adding that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor also attended, along with presidents and executives of the country’s leading commercial banks and senior leaders from Binance, including Global CEO Richard Teng.
The meeting examined sovereign debt tokenisation to enhance liquidity, widen investor access and position Pakistan as a regional frontrunner in compliant blockchain-based financial instruments.
The meeting also “outlined principles for a practical taxation and compliance framework, including shifting primary oversight to licensed exchanges, designing a gradual capital gains structure to promote stability and considering a time-bound amnesty to encourage users to move assets onto regulated platforms”, the statement said.

 

Sources told Dawn that the Binance team reported that about 17.5 million Pakistanis were currently registered traders of Binance, including 4m active traders. They jointly hold around $5bn in virtual assets with Binance alone, with annual trading turnover of around $250bn.
Pakistani users with other crypto companies are not part of this. Binance had more than 300m active users, mostly in 22 countries.
“This unlocks $5bn of assets that Pakistani users are now able to invest back into economy in Pakistani rupees,” a Binance official said, adding that “banks could also make withdrawals of stablecoins”.
Binance will determine maximum existing loan liability to the bank through Application Programming Interface (API) used for automated trading, “vastly reducing Pakistani users’ default rates”, the official claimed.
Banks raise concerns
The local banks raised questions about security risks and global experiences to safeguard stakeholders’ — banks and customers — interest, including in terms of money laundering issues.
They were told that Binance could help address those concerns through its experiences in other countries as real-time reporting of any individual users’ virtual assets and balances was traceable and visible.
In addition, the SBP’s participation would allow Pakistani banks to determine borrowing capacity and to hold recognised US dollar assets on the Binance platform, hence increasing Pakistan’s asset base and overall volumes to the Pakistan economy.
“Banks can lend confidently based on visible and verified assets,” a Binance official was quoted as assuring local bank representatives.
The banks were told that SDCs — a term used for “shadow cash” — were usable assets for bank credits and loans, and Pakistan would be able to attract billions of US dollars by providing a new avenue for remittances on top of roughly $38bn sent annually through conventional routes by overseas Pakistanis.
The officials said US infrastructure development funds, USAID and US Treasury-linked credits could further drive dollar flows into Pakistan and “boost GDP and economic growth”, despite inherent challenges.
PVARA Chairman Bilal Bin Saqib, who recently stepped down as special assistant to the prime minister on blockchain and cryptocurrency because of a conflict of interest with his regulatory role, declined to comment on the meeting.
An official statement, however, said he stressed the “importance of viewing digital assets as critical financial infrastructure with significant potential to support financial inclusion, expand access to services for the unbanked and create new opportunities for banks through innovative products, expanded deposits and new customer segments”.
The statement said the meeting reviewed Pakistan’s next steps towards building a secure, well-regulated and innovation-driven digital asset ecosystem, with a particular emphasis on responsible operationalisation of on-and-off-ramp infrastructure, enhanced compliance standards, improved market transparency and stronger integration of regulated financial institutions.
Finance Minister Aurangzeb reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to establishing a robust and forward-looking regulatory environment that supports technological innovation while safeguarding national economic interests.
He called for close coordination between government agencies, licensed global exchanges and domestic banks for modernising the payments landscape, improving financial inclusion and aligning national systems with international standards.
The statement said the participants reviewed opportunities to modernise Pakistan’s digital payments landscape, noting that blockchain-based systems could significantly reduce costs from the country’s $38bn annual remittance flows.
They emphasised the need to build local talent pipelines to meet rising global demand for blockchain and Web3 skills, creating high-value employment opportunities for Pakistani youth.

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s role in arranging a peace deal between India and Pakistan received a mention in the White House’s National Security Strategy (NSS) released on Friday, even as the document largely focuses on China.
The mention carries particular significance because the NSS is a formal statement of the administration’s policy priorities and global assessment. Highlighting Trump’s diplomacy in South Asia underscores Washington’s intention to boost its influence in the region and lends credibility to his intervention claims.
“President Trump has cemented his legacy as the President of Peace. In addition to the remarkable success achieved during his first term with the historic Abraham Accords, President Trump has leveraged his deal-making ability to secure unprecedented peace in eight conflicts throughout the world over the course of just eight months of his second term,” the strategy states.
“He negotiated peace between Cambodia and Thailand, Kosovo and Serbia, the DRC and Rwanda, Pakistan and India, Israel and Iran, Egypt and Ethiopia, Armenia and Azerbaijan, and ended the war in Gaza with all living hostages returned to their families.”

 

Trump has repeatedly cited claims that five to seven “brand new, beautiful” planes were shot down during the May conflict between Pakistan and India. In recent comments, he said that eight planes were “essentially” shot down.
While the actual number of losses remains disputed, his remarks have bolstered Pakistan’s version of events and strengthened its diplomatic position. India, however, rejects Trump’s claims, maintaining that it ended the brief air war independently and disputing reports of any Pakistani shoot-downs.
The document also pledges to end “the cynical manipulation of our immigration system to build up voting blocs loyal to foreign interests within our country” and highlights the administration’s recent steps to curb immigration, measures announced this week.
To counter China’s growing influence, the strategy stresses closer engagement with India and other allies. Washington is urged to strengthen commercial and security ties with New Delhi, including through quadrilateral cooperation with Australia and Japan. India is also included among the global partners with whom the US needs to coordinate on strategic priorities, including critical minerals in Africa.
On security, the NSS warns that control of the South China Sea by a hostile power could allow tolls or arbitrary closure of vital shipping lanes. Addressing this challenge will require greater cooperation with affected nations, including India and Japan.
The strategy acknowledged that “conflict continues to shape the Middle East,” but suggested the situation is “less severe than headlines suggest”. It noted that Iran has been weakened by Israeli actions and by President Trump’s June 2025 Operation Midnight Hammer, which curtailed Iran’s nuclear programme.
The document said the Israeli-Palestinian conflict “remains thorny”, but added that thanks to the ceasefire and release of prisoners President Trump negotiated, “progress toward a more permanent peace has been made”. It also recognised that “Syria remains a potential challenge, but with American, Arab, Israeli, and Turkish support, it may stabilise and reassume its rightful place as an integral and positive player in the region”.
Turning to Europe, the strategy expressed strong support for the “growing influence of patriotic European parties”, emphasising that a strong Europe is needed to work with the United States to prevent any adversary from dominating the continent. It linked unchecked migration to Europe’s economic challenges, warning of “the real and more stark prospect of civilisational erasure”.
The paper cautioned that within a few decades, some Nato members could become majority non-European and called for “cultivating resistance” to address this potential demographic shift.
The Trump administration also reaffirmed that there would be no expansion of Nato, the transatlantic alliance in which the United States plays a central role, a stance that undercuts Ukraine’s hopes as it continues to face the Russian invasion.

ISLAMABAD: After a fiery speech in the Senate by a PTI-backed lawmaker, deploring the absence of rule of law and an unannounced ban on meetings with incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, the ruling party once again held out an olive branch to the PTI, reassuring it that all issues could be resolved through dialogue.
Speaking in the upper house of parliament on Friday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Poli­tical and Public Affairs Rana Sana­ullah said the PTI had always rejected the path of negotiations, even though all issues could be reso­lved through dialogue rather than deadlock.
He said the government was ready to hold a dialogue with the opposition to take the country forward, but the PTI leadership remained unwilling.
The remarks came after PTI Senator Mashal Yousafzai chided two ministers over the claim that VVIP facilities were available to Imran Khan in jail. She demanded that a committee of the House along with local and foreign media visit Adiala jail to see the facilities for themselves.

 

Without naming the military establishment, the adviser to the premier said, “Those who they want [to have] dialogue [with] are not ready for talks with them.”
According to prison rules, the PML-N leader said, jail meetings meant to incite violence could not be allowed.
“The law and jail rules do not permit a convict or under-trial prisoner to create law and order situation in the country while sitting behind bars.”
Referring to repeated offers made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for talks with the opposition and his desire for a charter of Pakistan’s stability, the PML-N leader said both sides should sit together, confront each other’s viewpoint and reach a consensus. “We are ready to discuss all issues to find out a solution. You can start talks from wherever you want,” he remarked.

 

Earlier, Senator Yousafzai alleged that her party supremo and his spouse were illegally put behind bars and being subjected to inhumane treatment.
She rejected the government claim that VVIP facilities were provided to Mr Khan in Adiala jail. She asked the chair to form a house committee, headed by Rana Sanaullah, so that they visit the jail along with media persons to witness what kind of facilities were being available to the incarcerated leader.
“Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were being denied meetings with their family members,” she said while deploring the public announcement by a minister about “banning all meetings” with him. She wondered how such a decision could be taken about the country’s most popular leader whereas jail meetings with an Indian spy were facilitated. She said the Constitution, law and human rights had become a joke. Referring to the allegations levelled against her by PML-N member Khalil Tahir Sandhu in a talk show, the senator maintained that there was no practice of selling party tickets to contest elections in PTI.
FBR messages
A highlight of the day’s proceedings was an alarm raised by Senator Asad Qasim over the issue of text messages being sent to filers by the FBR containing bank balance and transacted amounts that he noted was a clear breach of the financial privacy and data protection.
Speaking on a calling attention notice, the PTI senator said the SMS were a breach of Section 216 of the Income Tax Ordinance, which prohibits sharing or exposing taxpayer’s data besides violation of the right to privacy guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution. In response, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry confirmed that the FBR had sent messages to filers seeking them to match their bank accounts with their income tax returns. He, however, said messages had been sent to the particular individuals on “detection of discrepancies”. He insisted that the move was not a breach of trust and privacy, and in line with Sections 165-A and 175-A of the ordinance.
However, Mr Qasim insisted that the FBR could only collect data but not broadcast it without taxpayer’s consent. He said due process involving issuance of notice must be followed.
PPP Senator Shahadat Awan, who was chairing the session, said a similar matter was pending before Senate’s standing committee on interior and proposed that the matter be referred to the panel. He noted that Senator Qasim could also raise his point there to which Mr Chaudhry agreed.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar also defended the FBR’s powers under tax regulation framework. He said the mechanism to track suspicious transactions under anti-money laundering was similar to this. He initially expressed reservations over the practice of referring every matter to the committees and insisted there was no need to send the matter for further probe, but later agreed that it be referred to the finance committee, headed by Saleem Mandviwala, which the chair did.
The Senate also passed the “The National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Bill, 2025”. The bill, moved by the law minister, is aimed at establishing the National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority.

Industry representatives warn that the ongoing blockade at Torkham and Chaman is crippling pharmaceutical supplies to Afg­hanistan, spoiling temperature-sensitive drugs, and exposing Pakistan to massive commercial losses at a time when exporters cannot afford another shock.
They argue that Afg­h­anistan remains Pakistan’s largest overland trading partner and the main transit route for onward access to Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Kaz­a­khstan. Each shutdown cuts Pakistan off from these landlocked economies, disrupts regional connectivity projects, and undermines multilateral investments tied to the Pakistan-Uzbekistan-Afghanistan railway and other corridor initiatives.
“The closures are now so frequent that they have become a structural threat, forcing countries investing in this route to consider more predictable alternatives. For Pakistan’s pharmaceutical sector, the impact is already severe,” said Tauqeer ul Haq of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA).
“Almost all exports to Afghanistan have stopped, and containers carrying antibiotics, insulin, vacci­nes, cardiovascular dru­gs, and other essential medicines are stuck at border crossings, dry ports, and warehouses. The delays have pushed local manufacturers toward irreversible financial losses. In one case, a single firm has products worth Rs850 million stranded at Torkham and Chaman, while more than fifty companies face similar setbacks.”
