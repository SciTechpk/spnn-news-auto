The main accused, Qari Umar and his son, Ihsanullah, were apprehended following a determined search operation launched by Swat police. The two had been on the run since the incident, which occurred on July 21 and sparked widespread outrage across the region.
According to the police, the child was brutally tortured to death at the madressah, allegedly by multiple individuals, including teachers.
The disturbing incident led to the immediate arrest of 10 suspects from the site. However, the principal accused managed to flee, prompting an intensive manhunt.
 
 

DPO Umar said the arrest of Qari Umar and his son was the result of “tireless efforts” by the Swat police. “Justice will be ensured, and all individuals involved in this heinous act will be brought to justice,” he stated.
The murder triggered strong public reaction, with citizens and rights activists demanding accountability and stricter oversight of unregistered seminaries in the region. Authorities have since reiterated their commitment to safeguarding children’s rights and preventing future abuse in religious institutions.

The land is where Buddha attained Enlightenment and preached the message of harmony in 600 BC. That may not be the reason behind the Hindu right’s frustrations in the populous Hindi-speaking state. But it does indicate a higher intellectual grasp by its people of the challenges they confront in life and politics.
The BJP’s desperation to win the state elections could be gleaned from the several high-profile visits Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made to the state. The recent one was also dramatic. When the Pahalgam terror attack happened on April 22, Modi was visiting a Gulf state. He shortened the trip but didn’t say a word about Pahalgam in Delhi. He flew instead to Bihar the next day where he announced in a vitriolic speech the decision to “hunt down the terrorists and punish their backers”. He usually speaks to his foreign interlocutors in Hindi, but to a Hindi-speaking audience in Bihar Modi spoke in English.
“Today from the soil of Bihar I say to the whole world. India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers. We will pursue them to the ends of the earth.” Operation Sindoor ensued, and according to Modi, isn’t over yet. However, so far, neither of the two promises he made have been redeemed. The terrorists are said to be roaming free, and have neither been identified or named. As for Pakistan, their implied alleged backers, its army chief was feted by Donald Trump over a lunch at the White House. Modi’s captive media has declared India victorious but the evidence suggests an embarrassing Indian miscalculation about Pakistan’s ability to respond to its attack.
The desperation to win Bihar may now have to rely on the capable hands of Modi’s hand-picked election commission. There is fear among opposition parties and potential voters that the SIR (special intensive review) of the voters’ list underway in Bihar is aimed at ensuring the ruling party’s victory by weeding out hundreds and thousands of opposition voters from the electoral rolls. The exclusion of officially trusted Aadhaar and voter ID cards from the list of valid documents for SIR is said to expose large sections of the Muslim, backward and Dalit communities to the risk of being disenfranchised. These communities by and large vote for non-BJP parties, and use Aadhaar and voter ID cards as their basic identity documents. Few would possess birth certificates or land ownership or government identity papers that are on the list of 11 documents that the election commission is asking for.

Delivering a theocratic revamping of India’s constitution would need at least a pretence of popular support.

In his widely quoted poem, The Solution, Bertolt Brecht, the celebrated playwright, acidly describes the disenchantment setting in among the people with their increasingly autocratic democracy. The secretary of the Writers Union suggests that they could be won back with redoubled efforts, but the government offers a counter solution: “Would it not be easier/In that case for the government/To dissolve the people/And elect another?” By most accounts, India’s election commission seems to be doing just that.
The Modi government has evidently missed the mocking tone of Brecht’s poem and appears, instead, to have taken it to heart as an exciting prospect. Why Bihar? The state stands as a major obstacle to Project Hindu Rashtra. The BJP lacks a vital endorsement from a majority of Hindus in the state and across the country. A mandate needs to be conjured but heavy odds are stacked against the quest. At the height of Modi’s popularity in the 2019 elections, there were around 960 million Indian voters registered for the right to vote. In the elections that year, however, the BJP and its allies got just about 221m votes, which delivered them an emphatic victory.
Most of the votes came from the majority community of Hindus. It’s estimated that out of the 37.36 per cent voters who voted for BJP in 2019, almost 90pc came from Hindus, or approximately 210m. That’s pretty much the support Hindutva may have in a currently estimated population of around 1.46 billion Indians, including 80pc Hindus.
A remedy that has worked elsewhere for closet autocrats is to suspend democracy. It has also happened in India although for a relatively brief duration of 21 months when Indira Gandhi imposed Emergency in June 1975. Mrs Gandhi used the Emergency to fortify the constitution by adding two crucial words that described Indian democracy as envisioned by the founding fathers, but which were missing in the preamble — secular, and socialist. Supporters of Hindu Rashtra have openly canvassed to dispense with the words. The fly in the ointment is that the BJP lost its majority in 2024 and runs a minority government with supporters who are wary of a Hindu Rashtra.
Thus, a slow creeping hollowing out of democracy’s main pillars — parliament, judiciary and the media, seems to be doing the trick for now. But delivering a theocratic revamping of the constitution would need at least a pretence of popular support. Tweaking the people’s mandate looks closer to Brecht’s faux prescription. Changing the voters’ list, banning parties, or their leaders, has occurred in almost every South Asian democracy, replicating the Brechtian nightmare.
Finally, West Bengal too is in Modi’s crosshairs. The sudden rise in the tracking and deportation of alleged Bangladeshi Muslims in BJP-ruled states is said to signal disenfranchising of a substantial chunk of West Bengal’s Muslim voters in elections next year. The Bangladeshi gambit could recoil on the BJP in West Bengal. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has turned the issue into one of Bengali honour. Braving monsoon rains on Kolkata’s streets, she roared: “I have decided to speak louder in Bengali, arrest me if you can.” Electing ‘a new people’ is no cakewalk. Or so it seems.

The 22-year-old is one of many Afghan volunteers rallying to help their compatriots, despite having little themselves.
Since the beginning of the year, more than 1.6 million Afghans, including many children, have returned after being deported or driven out of Iran, which accuses them of pushing up unemployment and crime.
“It doesn’t matter whether you have a lot of money or not. I don’t have much, but with the help of Afghans here and abroad, we manage,” said Rezaei.
The number of crossings at the Islam Qala border has reached 30,000 on several days, peaking at 50,000 on July 4, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
In response, residents of the western region have mobilised, partly thanks to donations sent by Afghans living in Europe or North America.
A journalist for a local television channel, Rezaei travels over 100 kilometres (62 miles) to reach the border from her hometown of Herat.
From a stack of cardboard boxes, she distributes baby wipes and sanitary towels to women gathered under a tent and surrounded by around a dozen children.
“It is our responsibility to stand by their side,” she said.
“The government tries to help, but it’s not enough.”
International organisations are helping to register migrants but face massive budget cuts.
Meanwhile, Taliban authorities struggle to support the influx of Afghans who have often left everything behind and returned to a country mired in poverty.
‘We have a duty’
Unemployed Hosna Salehi volunteers with her parents’ charitable organisation, Khan-e-Meher, to distribute aid, such as infant formula.
“Some women with young children tried to breastfeed but didn’t have enough milk due to stress,” she told AFP.
“Our fellow Afghans need our support right now. We have a duty to give what we can, no matter if it is a little or a lot.”
The show of solidarity “makes us proud”, said Ahmadullah Wassiq, director of Afghanistan’s High Commission for Refugees.
“The government cannot solve these problems alone,” he acknowledged, “and the efforts of citizens must be applauded”.
The Taliban government says it provides money upon arrival and is establishing towns dedicated to returning Afghans, though it does not specify when they will be ready.
In Herat, the nearest major city to the border, some in the most precarious circumstances have been living in parks in tents donated by residents.
‘Extended a hand’
Some said they were having to rebuild their lives after returning home.
“The only thing we’re worried about is finding work,” said Hussein, 33, who spent more than 10 years in Iran.
“There, they told us our papers were no longer valid. We had good jobs, now we need to find work and start from scratch,” said the father-of-two, who was moved by the support he encountered on the Afghan side of the border.
“They really helped us and extended a hand,” he said as he waited for a free bus to take him the nearly 1,000 kilometres to the capital Kabul.
In Afghanistan, where half the population of around 48 million lives below the poverty line according to the World Bank, “there isn’t much of a culture of volunteering”, said 27-year-old Omid Haqjoo, as he prepared food in vast cooking pots.
“But we are trying to promote it… to provide the support that is missing,” he added.
After a day of heat in the humanitarian tents at Islam Qala, Salehi felt strengthened by a “life lesson”.
“If I was able to help volunteer, I think everyone can,” she said.
“And when I go home and think of all the fellow Afghans who smiled at me and prayed for me, that’s enough for me.”</p><small>2025-07-29 05:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/6887fde46f812.gif?r=100926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927296/four-killed-eight-missing-as-heavy-rain-soaks-northern-china' target='_blank'><strong>Four killed, eight missing as heavy rain soaks northern China</strong></a><br><p>HONG KONG: Heavy rain intensified around Beijing and nearby provinces on Monday, with four people killed in a landslide in northern Hebei and eight people missing, as authorities warned of intensifying conditions and heightened disaster risks in the coming days.
Authorities relocated more than 4,400 people as colossal rain continued to pound the suburban area of Miyun in Beijing causing flash floods and landslides, impacting many villages, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Images circulated on China’s Wechat app showed areas of Miyun where cars and trucks were floating on a flooded road where water levels had risen so high that it had submerged part of a residential building. Electricity cuts are also affecting more than 10,000 people, in the area, CCTV said.
Northern China has seen record precipitation in recent years, exposing densely populated cities, including Beijing, to flood risks. Some scientists link the increased rainfall in China’s usually arid north to global warming.
China’s Central Meteorological Observatory said that heavy rainfall would continue to drench northern China over the next three days. Beijing issued its highest level flood alert on Monday, the official Xinhua news agency said.
The storms are part of the broader pattern of extreme weather across China due to the East Asian monsoon, which has caused disruptions in the world’s second-largest economy.
Xiwanzi Village in Shicheng Town, near Miyun Reservoir, was severely affected, CCTV said on Monday with an additional 100 villagers transferred to a primary school for shelter. It comes after the maximum flood peak flow into the Miyun reservoir reached a record high of 6550 cubic meters per second, Beijing authorities said.
In neighbouring Shanxi province, videos from state media showed roads inundated by strong gushing currents and submerged vegetation including crops and trees.
Shaanxi province, home to China’s historic city of Xian, also issued flash flood disaster risk warnings on Monday. In Beijing’s Pinggu District, two high-risk road sections have been sealed, authorities said.
Authorities are carrying out search and rescue work across cities including Datong, where a driver in a Ford car has lost contact while driving in the floods, the People’s Daily reported.
China’s Water Resources Ministry has issued targeted flood warnings to 11 provinces and regions, including Beijing and neighbouring Hebei, for floods from small and midsize rivers and mountain torrents.

They don’t seem to have received much attention this time, but that is hardly surprising. At a time when states everywhere are redefining their relationships with their own people, especially those who think the right to protest is a legitimate one, these women visitors are being treated not just with indifference but resentment.
They have not been allowed to protest in front of the Press Club and are forced to sit on the road. The traders, who have a great sense of timing, are also most upset at the inconvenience caused to them. After all, they already have to deal with so many disruptions in this city, such as dharnas by the TLP, PTI and even Tahirul Qadri in the past. Why should women from Balochistan assume they can behave as do men from Punjab?
When they came in the winter of 2023-24, the caretaker government didn’t bother to talk to them. The current government is no less preoccupied. But it is kinder for it didn’t try to bus them away in the middle of the night, and neither did it encourage other protesters to put up air-conditioned tents right next to them, just to make the women realise that they are not the only victims around.
Among the protesters is the sister of BYC leader Mahrang Baloch. She has come to Islamabad because Mahrang is behind bars in Quetta. In recent days, there have been many allegations against Mahrang and others in the BYC: links with militant groups; acts proving their unpatriotic credentials; the decision to forcibly enter a hospital in Quetta and steal bodies in the mortuary. Which of these allegations have made it to the formal charges under which she is in prison is unclear to me because little of it is reported by a press focused on political parties operating in Islamabad or Lahore or Peshawar.

The lived experiences of the rest of us are very different from those in Balochistan.

But even if I were better informed, I wonder if it is possible to remain a little sceptical of the accusations levelled against those who have been arrested. As a society, we press on with allegations excitedly, which dissipates when evidence makes its way from the TV studios to the courts. Apparently, most of it is due to lazy prosecution, though in many cases hardworking judges don’t let shoddy work get in their way. Cases nearer to Islamabad have unfolded this way, time and again, and yet when the allegations first surface and people are arrested, the belief in their guilt is complete. Could one venture to wonder if the BYC leader’s journey follows a similar path?
It might be an irrelevant question because in many ways, Balochistan is far away from what the rest of us see. The lived experiences of the rest of us are very different from those in that province. For the Baloch, she is a young woman in jail with few chances of relief or justice, a citizen who deserves compassion and her rights. Some senior lawyers express anguish at the idea of the ‘child’ in jail with little hope of relief, as the new-look judiciary as well as amendments to other laws have made bail or a release harder for those who have been arrested.
The government claims the new laws will put an end to enforced disappearances, as now the authorities have the right to detain people for three months without any charge. And with this power, the ones held will also be allowed to meet their loved ones. Each will know of the other’s well-being.
But if this was so, why would the hapless women be in Islamabad in this heat, sitting quietly on concrete, waiting for just a little attention from our elected politicos? Even if they do realise that the air in Islamabad inflicts amnesia on those in power, they tend to forget all the issues they had expressed empathy for when in opposition. But I digress. I was explaining the benefits of the changes in law.
Indeed, those in power are quite confident of how things will be better going forward. But I wonder how it will help those who have been waiting for their missing relatives, for years, if not decades, holding on to a picture and some memories? How are they supposed to heal? After all, Mahrang or Sammi Baloch would not be household names if they had not gone through the experiences they have — of losing a loved one and then protesting at a time the rest of us were playing and studying in schools.
One can ask why Mahrang has so much appeal in a part of Pakistan, far from Islamabad. It might be because her story strikes a chord, because her lived experience is shared by many others. This grievance has to be addressed, if Pakistan is to make progress in Balochistan.
Connected with this is the question about whether or not it is possible to view the political crisis in Balochistan as one which can only be handled through force. This is an approach, some argue, which has not worked in parts of KP. Beyond our own borders, there has also been a change of attitude towards Kabul, where too, engagement has replaced an earlier policy. Within, it might also be time to consider some tweaks to this approach in Balochistan.
This will neither be easy nor quick. But it might not be too late to start a conversation, about engaging the mainstream political parties and politicians who have remained part of the electoral process. This can be the first step, which might then help create the environment to reach out to other more unpalatable stakeholders. And beyond the mainstream politicians, people such as Mahrang, will have to be engaged. After all, the British government eventually did talk to Sinn Fein.

The incident took place during Sunday-Monday night in the house of Bilawal Bhatti, who lives next to the residence of Sindh Minister for Energy and Planning Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, in Rizwan Colony of Rohri taluka in Sukkur district.
The robbers comfortably collected cash and valuables and fled the house leaving the businessman’s wife in trauma.
It was stated that the robbers had overpowered the couple and were busy collecting cash and valuables but when Mr Bhatti tried to put up resistance. The robbers turned aggressive and started beating up the couple. They then dragged Mr Bhatti to an open area on the rooftop and threw him down. 
The businessman suffered serious injuries and died a little later. 
Residents of the neighbourhood had come out of their houses upon hearing Mr Bhatti’s screams and rushed to his rescue but the robbers managed to flee the house. 
Mr Bhatti was taken to a nearby hospital but he succumbed to his injuries.
‘One of the robbers shot dead’
A strong contingent of police proceeded to the house to collect details of the incident. A police team was sent after the robbers.
The team claimed that the robbers were spotted in the Jaara Mah area and challenged. 
The suspects responded with firing which led to an encounter, the police said, adding that one of the suspects was shot dead but his associates managed to flee.
They identified the killed suspect as Hubdar Shaikh.
A TT pistol was seized from the dead suspect, they said.
Sukkur SSP Azhar Khan Mughal, meanwhile, formed a team comprising the DSPs of Rohri and Mundo Dero and in-charge of the local CIA office to launch a hunt for the fugitive suspects. 
The team conducted raids at suspected hideouts of the outlaws and picked up several persons for interrogation.
However, the robbers could not be arrested till late Monday evening.

The demand was made by HRCP leaders and other speakers at a programme held here on Monday. It also featured screening of a documentary on ‘The right to a living wage’.
The programme was part of a mobilisation campaign launched by the HRCP. It was attended by labour rights activists.
In their speeches, HRCP representatives termed the existing minimum wage ‘inadequate’ for a worker to make both ends meet. They stressed that it should be revised upwards to Rs75,000, arguing that a five-member family could hardly meet its monthly expenses of food, education and healthcare with a fewer amount.
HRCP’s Hyderabad coordinator Ghufrana Arain said that a notification fixing the minimum wage at Rs75,000 should be applicable to all sectors.
She said that inflation was increasing on a daily basis while salaried class was bearing the brunt of the conditions “being imposed under dictates of financial institutions”.

Leaders, activists demand effective enforcement of all labour laws

She lamented that the rulers had already increased their salaries and perks by 600pc but labourers were denied even the right to a living wage. Capitalists and elites were being granted huge incentives as well, she noted.
She said that lower cadre employees were told that their salaries could not be increased because of the conditions attached by international financial institutions.
Advocate Mir Ahmed Mangrio observed that federal government’s policies were aimed at undermining rights of provinces. He said that labourers from other provinces were hired by the private sector in Sindh while local people were denied employment opportunities. He added that price hike remained unchecked as government was least bothered about its impact on low-income group.
He said government was not interested in implementing the minimum wage notification. He said that Rs40,000 minimum wages were inadequate in the prevailing situation.
Kashif Bajeer, a development sector activist, said that children were still subjected to forced labour despite existence of laws that curb it. He said that forced labour issues were increasing but these laws were not being invoked. He said that over 60pc of labourers in the country were working under contract system. He stressed that labour rights could only be protected when their unions were strengthened.
Jamila Latif, a home-based workers’ union leader, said that women of this segment also needed a strong union, and called for the formation of such union without further delay.
She flayed that when she and her colleagues were forming a union for bangle workers, they were threatened by the contractors concerned. Still, this union was formed and was now struggling for women workers’ rights.
HRCP council member Saleem Jarwar said that all the laws that ensured labour rights must be given effect. He said that formation of a union was essential to protect these rights. Otherwise, he added, workers’ problems would remain unresolved.
Imdad Chandio, Pushpa Kumari, Boota Imtiaz and others were among the prominent activists who attended the programme.
Later, the participants held a demonstration calling for the acceptance of their demands.

The report, ‘Cut Us Open and See That We Bleed Like Them’: Discrimination And Stigmatization Of Sanitation Workers In Pakistan, is based on data collected by Amnesty and the Centre for Law & Justice (CLJ) from six districts: Lahore, Bahawalpur, Karachi, Umerkot, Islamabad and Peshawar.
The researchers spoke to Christian, Hindu and Muslim workers to understand the impact of caste-based discrimination on sanitation workers, and their report highlights stigmatisation of the work because of its association with caste-designated occupations.
A majority of Christians in Pakistan today are converts from a caste historically assigned the task of cleaning, the report notes. Caste-based occupations such as scavenging and sweeping are associated with religious minorities in Pakistan, including “lower-caste” Christians and Hindus.

Amnesty report says hiring policies perpetuate caste distinctions; most workers earn below minimum wage, not protected by labour laws

This, in turn, has resulted in the designation of sanitation work, considered undesirable by wider Pakistani society, to non-Muslims from so-called “lower castes.”
 
 

The report quotes the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) that found in its 2022 report that 80pc of non-Muslim religious minorities are employed in the lowest grades for government jobs.
Women sanitation workers face “triple discrimination” at the intersection of religion, caste and gender. About half of the women included in the report reported workplace harassment.
Stigmatisation of work
Amnesty found that many workers who were part of the study experienced stigmatization, and they reported being called derogatory and insulting names. Many reported that they were not allowed to use the same dishes or eat in the same places as Muslims. Some participants stated that they regularly faced discrimination in public places.
The report pointed out that stigmatisation has also resulted in violence, particularly in the context of blasphemy allegations. The report notes that there have been several prominent cases of sanitation workers being accused of blasphemy, including Aasia Bibi.
 
 

In August 2023, a blasphemy accusation against two sanitation workers led to an arson and mob attack on more than 20 churches and 80 Christian neighbourhoods in Jaranwala.
Precarious work and no rights
The report mentions data collected by CLJ on nearly 300 government job advertisements from 2010 to March 2025, showing that the ads explicitly required applicants to be non-Muslim or so-called “lower castes” or gave preference to them as part of the job criteria.
This reinforces existing caste-based patterns of employment within sanitation work and ensures that so-called “lower caste” non-Muslims are pushed towards sanitation work.
In the analysis of data collected from five government agencies, Amnesty found Chr­istians were disproportionately employed, not only in lower grades, but also specifically in sanitation positions.
The study also found that sanitation workers in Pakistan can be categorised into three main employment groups: permanent, contractual and daily wage and the government bodies across Pakistan avoided regularizing sanitation workers, denying them job security, benefits and legal protections.
Sanitation workers do not fall into the definition of worker under many laws, and if they do, these laws fail to cover temporary and daily-wage workers.
The study notes several practices by employers to maintain a non-permanent workforce. First, some employers hire sanitation workers on 89-day contracts to avoid legal obligations under the Industrial and Commercial Employment (Standing Orders) Ordinance that defines a permanent worker as someone who has completed a probationary period of three consecutive months.
Sanitation workers participating in the research were also found to be inadequately protected by social security and welfare schemes and they lacked awareness regarding social service and worker welfare schemes.
Minimum wage and laws
The minimum wage in 2024 was set at Rs37,000 per month in most of the country and at the time of the field research, it was Rs32,000 per month. Almost half of those workers who were part of the research received salaries below the minimum wage, while a majority of those who received minimum wage were men.
 
 

“Workers across all districts reported that their salaries were insufficient to cover their basic needs.” Besides the sanitation workers were found regularly subject to unsafe, and sometimes hazardous, working conditions. Sanitation workers participating in the study seldom received personal protective equipment or training in occupational safety and health.
In its recommendations, Amnesty International calls for action to address the issues of caste-based discrimination faced by the sanitation workers.
It asks the government and relevant authorities to eliminate the manual cleaning of drains and gutters and instead use machinery; amend the Constitution to include protection against caste-based discrimination as a part of the fundamental rights chapter; pass law recognising caste-based discrimination as per Pakistan’s international human rights obligations to address; define caste in the laws; end discriminatory recruitment practices, including discriminatory job advertisements, for sanitation work; amend labour laws to ensure safety; and end discrimination that sanitation workers face and regularise sanitation workers.

Sharing their findings, social activist, author and poet Attiya Dawood said that they first visited Shanti’s home in Lyari when they heard about what had happened to her while she was still alive, though barely.
“Her sisters were crying and her mother was shell-shocked,” she said, adding that they could not believe what had happened to Shanti who, according to them, seemed happy when she came home the day after her wedding.
“But her happiness was short-lived. Her husband turned into an animal within only two days of their marriage. She needed help, but her in-laws were more interested in helping their son. By the time her own family found out what had happened and sought to help her, she was 99 per cent dead,” Attiya informed.

Fact-finding report by WAF reveals harrowing details of 19-year-old Shanti’s ordeal

Anita Pingani said that they met doctors at the Civil Hospital Karachi’s Trauma Centre after Shanti’s family had gotten her admitted there. “She was in a terrible condition by then,” she said. “And the [private] hospital where her in-laws had initially taken her had washed away all the evidence. But we learned that she was raped by her husband on June 17 and brought to the Trauma Centre on July 4. What happened in the days in between?
“Well, we found out that on the first night, when she was crying out in pain, her father-in-law took her to Civil Hospital, where the doctors said that her condition indicated it was a police case. From Civil Hospital, the father-in-law took her to a private clinic in Mithadar, where a doctor demanded Rs500,000 while claiming he could fix her if they brought her to his private clinic. She was admitted there for eight to 10 days, while her own family were told to stay away as she was susceptible to infection.
“Later, when she was finally handed over to her family, a social worker, Najma Maheshwari, heard about her plight and urged them to take her to Trauma Centre. Had she been given the right medical care at the start, maybe her life could have been saved. She was only 19,” said Anita.
Lawyer Faiza Haswary said that when the father-in-law initially took poor Shanti to Civil Hospital, they should have treated her. “Because the Sindh Injured Persons Compulsory Medical Treatment [Amal Umer] Act of 2019 was passed by the Sindh Assembly for this purpose,” she pointed out. “Why was this Act not implemented in Shanti’s case?”
Speaking on the occasion, Ms Maheshwari said: “She was in a very bad shape by the time I got to know about her, and the doctors were afraid to admit her,” she said. “The doctors at the Trauma Centre said that it was a miracle that her heart was still beating, though she was brain-dead.
The doctor who had operated on her after taking Rs500,000 from her in-laws had only filled her with cotton wool. And when she was discharged, she was in no condition to be discharged. We will hold a protest there [at the private hospital],“ she announced.
Shanti’s sister-in-law Sonya was also present on the occasion. She spoke in Sindhi and said that she recorded a video of Shanti telling what had happened to her. “She has named her husband in the video,” she said.
Human rights defender Uzma Noorani and minority rights activist Seema Maheshwari also spoke.

A fifth victim was also in critical condition after being shot, while the gunman apparently took his own life, Mayor Eric Adams told a late-night briefing at a hospital near the scene of the shooting.
The gunman was caught on camera exiting a black BMW carrying an M-4 rifle, then entering the building, immediately opening fire on a police officer before “spraying the lobby” with bullets, police commissioner Jessica Tisch told the press conference.
 
 

He then took an elevator to the 33rd floor of Rudin Management, which owns the building, where the man continued his spree before apparently shooting himself. He was later discovered by officers next to his weapon.
The office tower block at 345 Park Avenue is also home to hedge fund giant Blackstone, auditor KPMG and the National Football League.
Tisch told the briefing that the suspect was believed to have acted alone, but inquiries were ongoing, with the FBI assisting in the investigation.
She identified the shooter as Shane Tamura of Las Vegas and said a revolver, ammunition and magazines were found in his vehicle along with medication bearing his name.
The man had a history of mental health issues, according to Las Vegas law enforcement — but did appear to possess a valid firearms permit for Nevada, Tisch said.
He drove cross-country from the southwestern state in recent days and arrived in New York on Monday, she said.
The incident began around 6pm (3am PKT) when reports of gunfire prompted hundreds of police to swarm a busy office district on the storied Park Avenue, an area popular with tourists and visiting businesspeople.
A worker from a nearby office building wept as she left the area after a local lockdown was lifted, while another described a gunman going floor to floor as staff prepared to leave for the day.
Adams said the fallen police officer, an immigrant from Bangladesh who was 36 years old, was among the dead.
Two other males and a female died, and another man remained in a critical condition, officials said without giving any preliminary motive for the shootings.
Rush hour
Office worker Shad Sakib told AFP that he was packing his things to leave work when a public address announcement warned him and his colleagues to shelter in place.
“Everyone was confused with like, ‘wait, what’s going on?’ And then someone finally realised that it’s online, that someone walked in with a machine gun,” said the witness who wore a grey suit jacket.
 
 

“He walked right into a building right next door. We saw the photo of him walking through the same area that I walked through to get lunch here.
“You would think it won’t happen to you, and then it does.” Mass shootings are common in the United States, where a constitutional right to bear arms outweighs demands for stricter rules.
There have been 254 mass shootings in the United States this year, including Monday’s incident in New York, according to the Gun Violence Archive, which defines a mass shooting as four or more people shot.
Police officers deployed a drone near Park Avenue at the height of the evening rush hour as dozens of officers swarmed the area, some carrying long guns and others wearing ballistic vests.
The area is home to several five-star business hotels, as well as a number of corporate headquarters. The United Nations headquarters is nearby.
New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she has been briefed on the shooting.
The frontrunner in the race for mayor, Zohran Mamdani, wrote on X that he was “heartbroken to learn of the horrific shooting in midtown and I am holding the victims, their families, and the NYPD officer… in my thoughts.”

• French, Saudi FMs seek concrete road map
• Pakistan, Egypt, Turkiye call for immediate ceasefire, unimpeded humanitarian aid
• Death toll nears 60,000-mark
WASHINGTON: As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza deepens, UN Secretary-General António Guterres on Monday warned “nothing can justify the obliteration of Gaza that has unfolded before the eyes of the world”, calling for bold international action to end the war and rescue the long-stalled two-state solution.
Speaking at the United Nations International Conference on the Israeli-Pale­stinian conflict, held at UN Head­quarters in New York, Mr Guterres said the decades-old conflict had “reached a breaking point” and urged world leaders to halt what he described as the “systemic dismantling of peace efforts.”
“The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has endured for generations — defying hopes, defying diplomacy, defying countless resolutions, defying international law,” he said. “But we also know its persistence is not inevitable. It can be resolved. That demands political will and courageous leadership. And it demands truth. The truth is: we are at a breaking point. The two-state solution is farther than ever before.”
 
 

Mr Guterres deplored the “wholesale destruction” of Gaza and described Israel’s “creeping annexation” of the occupied West Bank as illegal. He condemned the killing of civilians, the starvation of children, settler violence, and the mass displacement of Palestinians.
“Unilateral actions that would forever undermine the two-state solution are unacceptable and they must stop,” the UN chief said, reaffirming the long-standing UN position that peace can only be achieved through the creation of two states — Israel and Palestine — living side by side within secure and recognized borders based on pre-1967 lines, with Jerusalem as the capital of both.
Co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, the high-level conference was convened following the adoption of a UN General Assembly resolution earlier this year.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot, who formally opened the event, echoed President Emmanuel Macron’s recent statement that France intends to officially recognize the State of Palestine in September. “We must move from the end of the war in Gaza to the end of the entire conflict, which threatens regional stability,” Mr Barrot said.
“Only the two-state solution will meet the legitimate aspirations of both peoples. There is no alternative.”
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Mustafa, representing the Palestinian Authority that exercises limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, called on countries around the world to “recognize the state of Palestine without delay”.
“The path to peace starts with recognizing the state of Palestine and preserving it from destruction,” he said.
Concrete road map
Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud urged participants to support a concrete road map towards Palestinian statehood that also ensures Israeli security.
“We must ensure that it does not become another exercise in well-meaning rhetoric,” Mr Guterres remarked. “It can and must serve as a decisive turning point — one that catalyzes irreversible progress towards ending the occupation and realizing our shared aspiration for a viable two-state solution.”
A concept note circulated ahead of the meeting by the French and Saudi governments stated that the two-state solution still enjoys “near-universal support” and remains “the only way to satisfy the legitimate aspirations of both Israelis and Palestinians… and create the conditions for regional peace and stability”.
Immediate ceasefire
On the sidelines of the international conference on the two-state solution, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar met Egypt’s Foreign Minister Dr Badr Abdelatty as well as Adviser for Foreign Affairs of Bangladesh Touhid Hossain besides holding a telephonic discussion with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.
In a joint statement issued in New York, Pakistan and Egypt reiterated their unwavering support for the Palestinian people and their just cause, underscored the urgent need for unimpaired humanitarian access, an immediate cessation of Israeli hostilities.
Death toll near 60,000
Meanwhile, the humanitarian toll continues to rise. Reports from Gaza said Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians waiting for food aid, killing at least 26 and injuring many more. More than 60 have reportedly died in attacks since dawn. At least 14 more, including a baby, died of malnutrition.
According to the Gaza health ministry, Israel’s ongoing military campaign has killed at least 59,921 Palestinians and wounded more than 144,000, besides since October 2023.

Large numbers of pilgrims, who arrived in Quetta on Sunday night in five passenger coaches, staged a protest demanding the government immediately lift the ban.
Demonstrators gathered at Shuhada Chowk on Alamdar road, home to most of the city’s Imambar­gahs, and blocked the main road.
The protesters, joined by leaders of the Balochistan Shia Conference, chanted slogans against the government. “We have reached Quetta to travel to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage which will start in the evening of Aug 14 and will continue till Aug 15, in Karbala,” said a pilgrim without giving his name.
We will go to Karbala and the ban on travelling through land routes is not accepted, protestors chanted.
They said the government’s alternative to travel by air is unaffordable for most people. “Air tickets are very expensive and such large numbers of people cannot afford travelling by-air,” a protester said.
A spokesman for the Balochistan government, Shahid Rind, confirmed the federal ban on road travel to Iran and Iraq, admitting that the provincial government was taken into confidence regarding the decision.

One passenger, Aurangzeb Pathan hailing from Quetta, was injured as he fell from the berth due to the the derailment of the three coaches of the Jaffar Express near Shikarpur.
Media reports, including the state-run APP news agency, cited officials as saying that the accident was caused by an explosion.
However, in a statement late on Monday evening, the railways ministry said locals living around the station perceived the sound of the derailing train as that of an explosion and panicked, assuming it an act of terror.
The ministry ruled out explosion as the cause of accident. It said an unfamiliar terrorist outfit “took advantage of the incident” and falsely labelled it as an “armed attack” and claimed responsibility. “This claim is not only baseless, but also tantamount to an example of opportunism and irrelevance.”
The train was heading from Peshawar to Quetta when it met with the accident on Monday, Divisional Superintendent Railways Sukkur Jamshaid Alam said.
As initial reports claimed an explosion, a number of senior officials, including the Shikarpur DC Shakeel Abro, SSP Shahzaib Chachar, railway authorities and bomb disposal unit arrived at the site and after a thorough sweep cleared the site.

The committee, headed by Senator Pervaiz Rashid, was briefed by NHA regarding the flood-affected portion of the Indus Highway, damaged during the Manchar Lake Floods of 2022. It was informed that the segment has been restored as two-lane road.
The committee’s members also referred to the recent Babusar Top incident, questioning why the NHA did not take preventive measures to stop tourists from entering the area despite being aware of the risks.
Members pointed out that on the Motorways, if a vehicle is found over-speeding, the driver is detained immediately, his family is left behind, and in some cases, rude behaviour is adopted by Motorway Police officials.

Torrential rains, flash floods recently claimed life of several tourists

“Why similar strict actions were not taken to stop tourists from heading towards hazardous areas like Babusar Top,” a committee member asked.
The committee directed that Motor­way Police officials should be instructed to avoid misconduct with the public. In response, the chairman of the committee recommended summoning the Inspector General of Motorway Police for a detailed briefing on the matter.
The meeting was attended by Senators Zamir Hussain Ghumro, Jam Saifullah Khan, Saifullah Abro, Dost Ali Jessar, Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan, Kamil Ali Agha, Abdul Wasay and other officials from Ministry of Communications and relevant departments.
Deputations in NHA
The committee sought a comprehensive list of 43 officials of (BS-16 & above) serving with the NHA on deputation with details such as names, designations, qualifications, parent departments, duration of deputation, and number of extensions granted.
The NHA chairman informed the committee that out of 20,900 employees, 43 were initially on deputation in the authority, but now the number has been reduced to 39.
A member of the committee termed the situation alarming and said that as per court directives, deputation should not exceed three years, but several officers in NHA have exceeded this limit.
Hyderabad-Sukkar Motorway
A comprehensive briefing was given to committee meeting on the current status of Hyderabad-Sukkar Motorway (M-6) by the NHA chairman.
The NHA chairman told the committee that Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) has indicated to give $475 million for two sections of M-6 (4 & 5) while sections 1 & 2 will be built under PPP mode.
CAREC project
The committee was apprised of the possibility of funds availability for the construction of the Sehwan Bypass under the CAREC Tranche-1 project.
The committee was informed that Sehwan Bypass could not be included in the ADB-funded CAREC Tranche-1 project, which was at the closing stage.
Meanwhile, the chairman of Senate standing committee on economic affairs, Saifullah Abro, called its meeting on Aug 1 for deliberations on the communications sector, with a particular focus on the CAREC-Tranche III project.
The committee questioned how all four lots of tranche-III were being given to the same joint venture of — NXCC, Rustam Associates and Dynamic Constructors.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Abro, who is also a member of the Senate committee on communications, said that serious concern was expressed over repeated absence of the secretary of communications from the meeting. He said the committee felt that secretary should have attended the meetings and briefed members on actions taken by the ministry so far on alleged irregularities in the biding process of CAREC-Tranche III project.
Mr Abro said that despite repeated directives, the NHA has failed to provide relevant documents to the committee that could prove innocence of the authority.

France’s announcement that it will formally recognise the State of Palestine at the UN General Assembly in September marks a historic shift. It challenges the long-standing diplomatic inertia of Western powers, and sets a precedent that other influential nations can no longer ignore.
As the first G7 nation to make such a commitment, France has signalled that the two-state solution is no longer just a talking point. Pakistan, too, has reiterated its long-standing position — that peace in the Middle East is not possible without the recognition of an independent, viable Palestinian state, existing side by side with Israel within pre-1967 borders.
This week’s three-day conference at the UN headquarters in New York, co-hosted by France and Saudi Arabia, brings together 123 countries and international organisations determined to revive the two-state framework. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has rightly described the initiative as “very appreciable” and called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, the free flow of humanitarian aid, and substantive movement towards statehood for Palestine. The conference, organised around eight working groups, aims to move beyond symbolic support and chart a roadmap for concrete progress. It is an effort to inject structure, accountability and diplomatic urgency into a process that has for too long been stalled.
Pakistan has remained steadfast in its support for the Palestinian cause, grounded in international law and historical justice. As current president of the UN Security Council, it also chaired a recent debate on the situation in Gaza, where it again stressed that occupation, bombardment and displacement are no substitutes for diplomacy and dialogue. As Mr Dar noted “the real path forward is through dialogue and diplomacy” — a message that must resonate globally.
Opposition to the conference from Israel and the US — including attempts to dissuade others from attending — only underscores how isolated these actors are becoming. The world must no longer allow a veto or political pressure to derail a peace process grounded in justice. More than 140 UN member states already recognise Palestine. France’s recognition is expected to trigger further acknowledgements from European and Western countries. The momentum is real, and it must be sustained — not just in diplomatic halls but through tangible shifts in international policy and pressure.
For decades, Pakistan has backed frameworks such as the Oslo Accords, the Arab Peace Initiative, and relevant UN resolutions. All point to the same conclusion: the path to peace runs through statehood. And the recognition of Palestine is a right, owed to a people who have endured generations of occupation, blockade and statelessness. The time has come for the global community to act decisively, collectively and with moral clarity. The two-state solution must become a reality.

The negotiations in Sweden concluded shortly before 8pm, with neither side offering details on their progress, although a US Treasury department spokesman said they were expected to resume on Tuesday.
The United States and China earlier this year imposed triple-digit tariffs on each other in a tit-for-tat escalation, but then walked them back under a temporary agreement reached in May.
The expiry of that 90-day truce falls on August 12, but there are indications they could use the Stockholm talks to push it back further.

Both sides tight-lipped about outcome as negotiations to resume today

The negotiating teams in Stockholm were being led by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng in Sweden.
They were meeting in the Rosenbad building, home to the Swedish government.
Before Monday’s talks, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said he did not expect “some kind of enormous breakthrough today” at the talks in Stockholm that he was attending.
“What I expect is continued monitoring and checking in on the implementation of our agreement thus far, making sure that key critical minerals are flowing between the parties and setting the groundwork for enhanced trade and balanced trade going forward,” he told CNBC.
Trade analysts said another 90-day extension of a tariff and export control truce struck in mid-May between China and the US was likely.
An extension would facilitate planning for a potential meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in late October or early November.
The Financial Times reported on Monday that the US had paused curbs on tech exports to China to avoid disrupting trade talks with Beijing and support Trump’s efforts to secure a meeting with Xi this year.
‘Shift’ seen in US approach
The previous round of China-US talks was held in London.
“There seems to have been a fairly significant shift in (US) administration thinking on China since particularly the London talks,” said Emily Benson, head of strategy at Minerva Technology Futures.
“The mood now is much more focused on what’s possible to achieve, on warming relations where possible and restraining any factors that could increase tensions,” she told AFP.
Talks with China have not produced a deal but Benson said both countries have made progress, with certain rare earth and semiconductor flows restarting.
“Secretary Bessent has also signalled that he thinks a concrete outcome will be to delay the 90-day tariff pause,” she said. “That’s also promising, because it indicates that something potentially more substantive is on the horizon.” US-China Business Council president Sean Stein said the most important thing from Stockholm “is the atmosphere coming out”.

Trump has threatened both sanctions on Russia and buyers of its exports unless progress is made. “I’m going to make a new deadline of about … 10 or 12 days from today,” Trump told reporters during a meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer in Scotland.
“There’s no reason in waiting… We just don’t see any progress being made.”
Trump said he was disappointed in Putin and shortening the 50-day deadline he had set on the issue earlier this month. There was no immediate comment from the Kremlin.

Threatens Russia, buyers of its exports with sanctions if progress not made within 12 days

Trump, who has expressed anno­yance also with Ukrainian Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelensky, has not always followed up on his tough talk about Putin with action, citing what he deems a good relationship that the two men have had previously.
On Monday, Trump indicated he was not interested in more talks with Putin. He said sanctions and tariffs would be used as penalties for Moscow if it did not meet Trump’s demands.
“There’s no reason to wait. If you know what the answer is going to be, why wait? And it would be sanctions and maybe tariffs, secondary tariffs,” Trump said.
“I don’t want to do that to Russia. I love the Russian people.”
Expressing disappointment in President Putin, Trump said, “I’m going to reduce that 50 days that I gave him to a lesser number because I think I already know the answer what’s going to happen.”
The US president has repeatedly voiced exasperation with Putin for continuing attacks on Ukraine despite US efforts to end the war. Trump has played up successes in other parts of the world where the United States has helped to broker peace agreements and has been flattered by some leaders who suggest he should be given the Nobel Peace Prize.
 
 

Before returning to the White House in January, Trump had promised to end the conflict “within 24 hours”.
“We thought we had that settled numerous times, and then President Putin goes out and starts launching rockets into some city like Kyiv and kills a lot of people in a nursing home or whatever,” Trump said. “And I say that’s not the way to do it.”

• BJP govt claims success, opposition accuses it of hiding fact as Indian parliament debates Operation Sindoor
• New Delhi claims killing Kashmiri fighters under new ‘Operation Mahadev’
KARACHI: As the Indian parliament kicked off an animated discussion on Monday on the recent military standoff with Pakistan, a former home minister has challenged New Delhi’s narrative on the Pahalgam incident, questioning the claim that the attackers came from Pakistan.
The remarks from veteran Indian National Congress leader P Chidambaram came during an interview with The Quint, where he questioned the authorities handling of the April 22 attack and pointed out a lack of evidence to support New Delhi’s claim regarding Pakistan’s role.
“Where are the terrorist attackers? Why have you not apprehended them, or even identified them? A news item had emerged about the arrest of a few people who gave the attackers shelter. What happened to them?” Times of India quoted him as saying.
He also questioned the role of the investigating agencies. “They are unwilling to disclose what the [National Investig­ation Agency] has done all these weeks. Have they identified the terrorists or where they came from? For all we know, they could be homegrown terrorists. Why do you assume they came from Pakistan? There is no evidence of that,” The Statesman quoted Mr Chidambaram as saying during the interview.
According to Times of India, he also pointed out what he called the lack of a clear official information.
“We get snatches and bits of information from different officers. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) goes to Singapore and makes a statement that gives you bits of information. The deputy army chief makes a statement in Mumbai. In Indonesia, a junior officer of the Navy makes a statement. But why is the PM or the defence minister, or the foreign minister not making a comprehensive statement?” he said.
Asked what he believed the government was trying to hide, Mr Chidambaram responded, “I think, and this is speculation, I think they are hiding the fact that we made tactical mistakes (during Operation Sindoor), and we re-strategised… The CDS hinted at that. What tactical mistakes were made? What was the re-strategising? Either the BJP government is incompetent to answer these questions, or it is unwilling to do so.”
Mr Chidambaram further added, “They are also hiding the losses. I said it in a column that in a war, losses will occur on both sides. I understand that India would have suffered losses. Be upfront.”
The remarks prompted criticism from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which accused the Congress leader of defending Pakistan.
Union minister Pralhad Joshi accused Mr Chidambaram of giving a “clean chit to Pakistan”, while BJP spokesperson Amit Malviya alleged that Congress “always bend over backwards to protect the enemy”.
‘No pressure to end fighting’
In parliament, members from the treasury benches accused the Congress party of speaking the language of Pakistan and took exception to Mr Chidambaram’s remarks.
Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh began the discussion by skipping mention of any follow up on the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack, and avoided answering a question about India losing warplanes to Pakistan by saying that the opposition was asking the wrong question.
“If a child gets good marks in the exam, the question whether he had broken a pencil or lost one was not correct.”
“We should not focus on whether (an examinee’s) pencil was broken or the pen was lost during the exam. Ultimately, the result matters, and the result is that our forces achieved fully the goals of Operation Sindoor.”
Mr Singh continued to make his claims though: “The opposition sometimes asks about planes shot down. Their question does not represent India’s sentiments. They have not yet asked how many Pakistani planes were shot down.
He also reiterated the Indian claim that Operation Sindoor was halted because India had fulfilled its political and military objectives. “To say it was done under any pressure is totally baseless and wrong,” he claimed, adding: “The aim was not to go to war but to compel the adversary to bend.”
External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also claimed that President Donald Trump had played no role in bringing about the ceasefire. He said US Vice President J.D. Vance had spoken to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and told him that Pakistan was preparing to launch a major attack, adding that PM Modi told him that the attack would be responded to appropriately.
‘Operation Mahadev’
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s state broadcaster warned that India has once again begun “fake encounters” under the guise of countering terrorism, with an alleged plan to “use” detained Pakistanis in them.
The statement came after the Indian Army’s Chinar Corps said they killed three alleged terrorists as part of the so-called ‘Operation Mahadev’ in occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar, Radio Pakistan reported.
While Indian media, citing sources, has been linking one of the dead to the Pahalgam attack, there has been no official word in this regard.
The Radio Pakistan report recalled statements made by military spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry in press briefings held in April, where he had revealed details of 723 Pakistani nationals illegally detained in various Indian jails… [and] 56 Pakistanis are said to be held in secret custody by Indian intelligence agencies.

THIS screengrab shows Khalid Nisar Dogar (centre) striking Ehsaan Riaz during Monday’s proceedings.

• PTI’s Khalid Dogar suspended for slapping treasury MPA; Sheikh Imtiaz punished for ‘pointing out quorum’
• Opposition lawmakers ‘accosted’ by two unidentified men on assembly premises after addressing presser
• ECP disqualifies three PTI lawmakers following their conviction in May 9 cases
LAHORE: The Punjab Assembly on Monday desc­e­nded into chaos, mar­ked by physical altercations, walkouts by the opposition, and heated exchanges between the treasury and opposition lawmakers over alleged political victimisation as well as the arrest of PTI opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar following his conviction in a May 9 case.
The session was abruptly disrupted when oppo­sition member Kha­l­id Nisar Dogar slapped treasury MPA Ehsaan Riaz during a discussion bet­ween Deputy Opp­osition Leader Moin Qur­eshi and Acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar.
At this, Law Minister Sohaib Bherth, Ashiq Kirmani, and Moin Qureshi attempted to intervene. The scuffle reportedly began due to an exchange of harsh words between Mr Riaz and Mr Dogar, with provincial minister Zeeshan Rafiq also getting involved. The MPAs from both sides were seen slapping each other, leading to a “flurry of slaps”. The acting spea­ker adjou­rned the session for five minutes to de-escalate the situation, but it took more than an hour to finally resu­me proceedings.
Following the altercation, opposition members staged their first walkout and protested in the asse­mbly compound, chanting anti-government slogans and demanding the rele­ase of the PTI founder and the opposition leader.
‘Heated exchange of words’
Earlier, a heated exch­ange of words took place when opposition member Rana Shahbaz held a copy of the Holy Quran in his hand while speaking about alleged false cases filed against him. The speaker rebuked Mr Shahbaz for the act, as the PTI leader claimed he had been falsely implicated in terrorism cases registered at five police stations in three cities.
Law Minister Sohaib Bherth later expre­ssed reg­ret over the use of the Holy Quran in such a manner, urging the need for dialogue to resolve such issues.
The session also witnessed a fiery debate regarding the arrest of Oppos­ition Leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar.
Opposition members, including Tayyab Rashid, strongly condemned the arrest, calling it a violation of law and an attack on democracy, while claiming that the punishment was meted out for ‘exposing corruption’.
In response, Minister for Parlia­m­entary Affairs Mujtaba Shujaur Reh­man asserted that the opposition leader’s conviction was a court decision and not a political vendetta, as he alluded to the role of Mr Bhachar in the May 9 violence.
He also highlighted the government’s efforts to control inflation and accused the opposition of destabilising the country.
Ali Imtiaz Warraich from the opposition decried the labelling of political opponents, including those with health issues, as terrorists.
The atmosphere in the provincial assembly remained tense due to escalating political tension, with the op­­p­osition continuing its protest.
The ac­­ting speaker held two meetings with the senior members of the treasury and the opposition before resuming the proceedings after over an hour.
The chair suspended Mr Dogar for 15 sittings and later also Sheikh Imtiaz, who pointed out the quorum during the proceedings, as the opposition walked out of the house again.
The second walkout was prompted by the suspension of Mr Imtiaz.
Later, some MPAs came face to face again after two unknown persons clashed with opposition members as they were leaving the press hall after a press conference.
Following the clash, the two men also hurled abuses at opposition members. Assembly security staff arrived on time and separated the two sides.
It was alleged that the two unknown persons, who escaped after abusing the opposition MPAs, were the staff of some treasury members.
PTI MPA Ijaz Shafi said that as the deputy speaker has left, the issue would be raised before him tomorrow to ban the entry of the accused.
ECP disqualifies lawmakers
Separately, the Election Commis­sion of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday disqualified three PTI lawmakers, days after their convictions by anti-terrorism courts in Lahore and Sargodha.
Those disqualified and de-notified by the election watchdog included Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chattha, and MPA Ahmad Khan Bhachar, leader of the opposition in the Punjab Assembly.
Last week, the Lahore court had sentenced Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, while the Sargodha court had convicted MNA Mohammad Ahmed Chattha from Wazirabad and Punjab opposition leader Ahmad Khan from Mianwali.
All three were jailed for 10 years for their involvement in the May 9 violence and subsequently disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution.

Seven people were fired at after a demonstration outside the Brigade Headquarters in Bagh-Maidan Markaz on Sunday against the death of a minor girl in a mortar strike.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — the state’s terminology for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Paki­stan (TTP).
However, sources and eyewitnesses said security personnel guarding the installation had reportedly opened fire to control the crowd after the demonstration took a violent turn.

Bar Qambarkhel tribesmen march against militant presence in restive valley

A number of those who lost their lives on Sunday were laid to rest in the Bagh Markaz and Peer Mela localities of Tirah.
Besides the seven deaths, at least 16 people sustained gunshot wounds. There has been no official statement from the local administration or the military about the mortar strike or Sunday’s killings.
“The chief minister is in constant contact with the relevant admi­n­istration,” Dawn.com quo­ted CM Gandapur’s adviser, Barri­ster Mohammad Ali Saif, as saying on Monday. He said the KP chief minister was “monitoring” the Tirah incident himself.
Local sources claimed that security officials had accepted the tribesmen’s demand for compensation to the families of the deceased and injured tribesmen. However, no FIR has been lodged.
Separately, the PTI has called for an immediate and impartial inquiry into the Tirah incident, and asked for those responsible to be held accountable.
In a statement, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said that the use of live ammunition against unarmed civilians was not only unjustifiable but also a blatant violation of basic human rights and democratic principles.
TTP ‘withdrawal’ demanded
Meanwhile, the Bar Qambarkhel tribe in the restive Tirah valley temporarily suspended its week-long protest against the presence of militants in Tirah after representatives of the banned TTP reportedly asked for some time to hold talks with their leadership in Afgh­a­nistan on the demand for their withdrawal from the valley.
Sources told Dawn that the decision to suspend the sit-in was announced during a jirga in Lar Bagh, after ‘successful negotiations’ between the Bar Qambar­khel elders and TTP representatives in the region.
Sources said the jirga was told that militant commanders had sought time till Aug 5.
Earlier, Malak Zahir Shah had led a protest of hundreds of tribesmen, carrying the Holy Quran in their hands, and demanded the TTP men leave their area.
They staged a sit-in in Bhutan Shareef, saying they would only end their protest when given assurances that the militants would exit the area.

Khawaja on Monday moved a request to initiate contempt of court proceedings against Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif for not obeying May 7 Sup­reme Court directions to set up an independent appellate forum within 45 days over decisions rendered by court martial in the May 9, 2023 riots.
The direction has not been complied with and the federal government has disobeyed the order of the Supreme Court, plea­ded a petition moved before the apex court thro­ugh senior counsel Khw­aja Ahmad Hosain. The former CJP was also a petit­ioner in the Intra-Court Appeal (ICA), which the five-judge const­itutional bench had taken up and decided on May 7.
The petition has been filed under Article 204 of the Constitution read with sections 3 to 6 of the Conte­mpt of Court Ordinance, 2003 and Order XXVII of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980.
Earlier on May 7, a  five-judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court had asked the federal government and the Parliament to consider bringing necessary amendments/legislation in the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) and allied rules within a period of 45 days to provide an independent right of appeal in the High Court against convictions awarded to civilians by the military courts.
The petition argued that the prime minister was liable for failure on part of the federal government to comply with orders of the Supreme Court.
The failure on part of the federal government to legislate and provide a civilian appellate forum renders all court martial proceedings against civilians as unlawful and unconstitutional, the petition argued, adding the appeal in the Intra-Court Appeal (ICA) and related appeals were conditionally allowed by the Supreme Court through the short order.
As no appellate forum had been provided within the given timeframe, the petition contended that the appeals now stand dismissed, and any subsequent proceedings under the legal provisions struck down by the Court in its original judgment dated October 23, 2023, are unlawful and unconstitutional.
The lapse of the 45-day period for enacting the legislation amounts to willful disobedience of the Supreme Court’s order, the petition stated, adding that no system of governance can function if the federation fails to comply with time-bound judicial directions.
Under Article 90 of the Constitution, read with the Rules of Business and past Supreme Court precedents, the prime minister—as the chief executive of the federation—is responsible for implementing court directives issued to the federal government.
Therefore, the petition argued, the prime minister is personally liable for contempt of court due to the government’s failure to act upon the court’s decision.
The petition further maintained that the case pertained to the protection and enforcement of fundamental rights—at its core, it was about the right to a fair trial and due process.
The petition reminded that the May 7, short order had held, the Constitutional Bench in unison, sensitise the need of legislative changes, which will also be compliant to the requirements laid down under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) for maintaining and preserving the constitutional and societal norms in the existing legal framework.
The Constitutional Bench had expressly stated that it recognises the need for legislative changes which would be compliant with Pakistan’s international human rights obligations, and preserve the constitutional norms in the existing legal framework.
To uphold the Constitution and protect fundamental rights, the Supreme Court had directed the government to “consider and make” a law allowing civilians convicted by military courts to appeal in High Courts.
The petition concluded by stressing that the language of the short order was mandatory, leaving no discretion for the government. The government must legislate, and the legislation must provide a right of appeal to civilian courts for civilians tried by military courts.

• Authorities asked to prepare for another monsoon spell starting today
• Babusar Road ‘partially reopened’ as search continues for tourists swept away by torrents
LAHORE: Floods in the Indus and Chenab rivers have inundated over a dozen villages in several districts of Punjab, prompting the authorities to evacuate thousands of people to safer locations, while the government has asked rescue departments to brace for urban and riverine floods as well as landslides in light of the new monsoon spell starting today.
In the southern districts of Punjab, district administrations issued emergency alerts across different villages as floods in the Indus and Chenab destroyed houses and crops. In Rajanpur, standing crops were destroyed by the Indus, which also impacted Taunsa and D.G. Khan districts.
 
 

In Layyah and Taunsa, panic spread after a crack emerged in a ‘guide embankment’ built by the National Highway Authority (NHA) to protect the Layyah-Taunsa bridge. Though the bridge remained intact, the breach submerged Taunsa’s several villages, including Basti Kumharan, Basti Mangotha, and Basti Sohbewala, forcing the residents to flee. The floods in Taunsa also left entire settl­e­ments and agricultural zones submerged, with the rescue and relief operations underway to save lives and property.
Hundreds of people from Bait Ashraf and Jarh Leghari villages in Taunsa displaced by floods, meanwhile, awaited the government’s help, as their houses and the roads came under water, which forced them to relocate to higher grounds.
In Jhang, the raging Chenab River inundated more than 10 villages and destroyed crops and residential areas, besides destroying key road networks.
In central Punjab’s Hafizabad district, rapid erosion along the Chenab’s banks washed away hundreds of acres of farmland. Hafizabad and Sukheke were also affected by stagnant rainwater, which has not been drained for more than 10 days.
According to the PMD, low to medium-level flows are expected in the rivers Jhelum and Chenab due to the expected rainfall from July 29 to 31. It also said flash flooding was expected in the tributaries of the River Kabul and hill torrents of DG Khan from July 29 to 31. The PMD also forecasted a medium-level flood at Taunsa and Guddu in the Indus, while Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma and Sukkur are experiencing low floods.
A report by the Punjab Disaster Management Authority on Monday said that 152 citizens have been killed and 539 have been injured in accidents during the monsoon rains this year. 210 houses were affected, and 121 livestock were killed. The deaths were due to lightning, collapse of damaged buildings, drowning while bathing in rivers and electrocution, the report added.
Another rain spell
Meanwhile, the Nati­onal Disaster Manag­ement Authority (NDMA) stated that widespread rainfall was anticipated in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), with heightened risks of flooding, landslides, and urban flooding in vulnerable districts. The spell, which will start today, will end on July 31.
The NDMA instructed all relevant departments to remain on high alert, pre-deploy flood response teams and equipment, and ensure the immediate clearance of drainage systems.
In Punjab, significant rainfall is anticipated in Sargodha, Hafizabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Lahore, Narowal, and adjoining areas. Southern districts, including Dera Ghazi Khan, Rajanpur, and Rahim Yar Khan may receive moderate rainfall.
Torrents in D.G. Khan and Rajanpur could be reactivated with medium flows, while nullahs originating from the Pir Panjal range may also see a rise in water levels.
In KP, moderate rainfall and localised thunderstorms are expected to affect central and lower districts, such as Kohistan, Swat, Malakand, Dir and Buner.
Tributaries like River Swat, Panjkora, Bara, and Kalpani Nullah may swell and contribute to rising flows in River Kabul at Nowshera.
River Chitral and its tributaries may also surge due to a combination of glacial melting and rainfall in Booni, Reshun, and adjacent parts of Chitral Valley. Urban flooding is also anticipated in Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera, and Abbottabad.
The authority has also issued flood alerts for various areas of GB and AJK, as rainfall is expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, and Shigar, as well as in AJK’s Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, and Bagh.
Babusar Road partially reopened
In GB, the Babusar Road was partially reop­ened on Monday as a search operation to locate the people swept away by torrents after heavy rains continued.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the Babusar-Naran Highway had “been reopened for one-way traffic”.
He further said, “Several families…have contacted the government about the missing people and appealed for help in their search.” The TV anchor, who was reported to be among those swept away by floods, could not be traced on Monday, but her wrecked vehicle was found by the rescuers.
The Ghanche district administration also made arrangements for the displaced villagers from Kundus valley and Haldi, and provided them tents, food packs, and installed kitchens for them. The government also mobilised machinery to clear roads to the Kundus and Saltoro valleys.
Officials said a tent village with running water and electricity had been set up for the displaced people and damage assessments were underway which would be submitted for compensation. A mobile veterinary dispensary has been set up at the flood site, and a temporary power supply has been restored and all roads in the affected areas are currently open.
The Baltistan Division commissioner arranged 4,500 feet of pipe for the permanent restoration of the drinking water supply to the Kundus affectees and work on the same was in progress, which would be completed in two to three days.
GB Disaster Mana­gement Authority DG Zakir Hussain told Dawn that teams of GBDMA provide relief to affected areas round the clock and machinery had been mobilised to restore roads, irrigation and water channels.

Auran­gzeb and US Trade Representative Jami­eson Greer launched the negotiations through a telephonic conference call on reciprocal tariffs in May, agreeing to get into technical discussions in the coming weeks. The talks began after the US proposed a 29 per cent duty on Pakistani exports and later temporarily suspended the decision.
By July, talks in Washington had entered their final phase. Aurangzeb described the dialogue as “very constructive,” emphasising a shared commitment to resolving outstanding issues and moving toward finalising a broad economic framework.
During this visit, the finance minister will lead concluding discussions with senior US officials including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Greer.
“The aim is to formalise a comprehensive trade agreement expected to yield mutual economic benefits for both nations,” the statement read.
The finance ministry highlighted that robust trade and economic ties remained the backbone of Pak-US ties.
It noted that the US is still Pakistan’s largest trading partner.
“Pakistan is eager to expand cooperation into non-traditional sectors such as information technology, agriculture, and minerals — all offering significant growth potential,” it added.
It concluded that Pakistan seeks to boost bilateral trade beyond traditional goods by encouraging US investment in critical sectors, including energy and mining.</p><small>2025-07-28 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/282119258100811.jpg?r=214249' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927202/ecp-disqualifies-3-pti-lawmakers-following-their-convictions' target='_blank'><strong>ECP disqualifies 3 PTI lawmakers following their convictions</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday notified the disqualification of three PTI lawmakers over their convictions in various cases, according to documents available with Dawn.com.
Last week, a Lahore anti-terrorism court acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.
According to the notifications, Chaudhry, member of the National Assembly (MNA) Mohammad Ahmed Chatta and member of the Provincial Assembly  (MPA) of Punjab Ahmad Khan were disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution (a person shall be disqualified from being elected [if] … he has been, on conviction for any offence involving moral turpitude, senteced to imprisonment for a term of not less than two years).
The first notification acknowledged Chaudhry’s conviction in the case ‘The State vs Dr Yasmin Rashid, etc’, reading: “As a consequence, Senator Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhry, has become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan for being member of [the] Senate.
“Resultantly, Notification No.F.3(2)/2021-Cord. dated 10th March, 2021 to the extent of Ejaz Ahmad Chaudhary, as Senator, is hereby recalled with immediate effect,” the notice added, referring to the document notifying Chaudhry’s seat.
The second notice also acknowledged Chatta and Khan’s 10-year sentences on July 22, but in the case ‘The State vs Zafarullah Khan and others’.
“As a consequence, Mohammad Ahmed Chattha, MNA from NA-66 Wazirabad and Ahmad Khan, MPA, Provincial Assembly Punjab from PP-87 Mianwali-Ill have become disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution … for being members of National Assembly and Provincial Assembly of Punjab respectively,” the ECP notification read.
“Resultantly, notification No.F.2(5)/2024-Cord(1) dated 16th February 2024 to the extent of Mohammad Ahmed Chattha and notification No. F.2(6)/2024-Cord dated 17th February, 2024 to the extent of Ahmad Khan as returned candidates, are hereby recalled with immediate effect.”
Earlier this month, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ah­­med Khan filed a reference with the ECP against 26 PTI legislators over ‘unparliamentary conduct’ during the assembly’s session on June 27.
The disqualification reference was moved against the same lawmakers who were suspended for disrupting Chief Mi­­nister Maryam Nawaz’s speech and causing chaos in the house.
However, the speaker formally rejected the petitions following successful negotiations between the government and the opposition.
In 2023, PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan was disqualified for five years following his conviction in the Toshakhana case.
In a notification, the ECP cited a court order and declared Imran disqualified under Article 63(1)(h) of the Constitution read with Section 232 of the Elections Act, 2017.</p><small>2025-07-28 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616195-germanys-karachi-consulate-suspends-services-for-non-eu-nationals' target='_blank'><strong>Germany's Karachi consulate suspends services for non-EU nationals</strong></a><br><p>

Pilgrims visit Iraq to attend the chehlum commemoration — also known as Arbaeen (40 in Arabic) — to mark the 40th day of mourning for the martyrdom of Imam Husain, the grandson of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
A day earlier, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that zaireen (pilgrims) will be barred from travelling by road to Iran and Iraq for the Arbaeen pilgrimage due to public and national security.
PPP leader Hassan Murtaza issued a statement today, saying: “The federal and provincial governments should ensure the safety of pilgrims with the help of security agencies.”
The state was responsible for the security of travellers, he added.
He criticised the ban, stating that it will severely affect the common man. “Why can’t a common man, who pays taxes to the state, travel by land?” he said.
The PPP leader said that pilgrimages were being removed from the reach of the poor.
“The Arbaeen pilgrims save up each penny to go on pilgrimage with their family. Visitors prefer travelling by road because it costs less money,” he added.
Iraq’s Karbala, where Imam Hussein and his brother Abbas are buried in two enormous mausoleums facing each other, is the centre of the Shia world during this time. More than 21 million devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.
 
 

Pakistan is set to introduce a new travel management system from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.
Under the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.
After the PM-interior minister’s meeting a day earlier, Pakistan International Airlines announced that it will start special flights for Iraq to accommodate zaireen from Aug 8 to 11.
Reacting sharply to the move, the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) rejec­ted the ban on Sunday, calling it unacceptable, unjustified and unconstitutional.</p><small>2025-07-28 15:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/281923185fa10a4.jpg?r=192752' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927192/countrys-july-inflation-likely-to-remain-at-35-45pc-as-price-pressures-ease-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s July inflation likely to remain at 3.5-4.5pc as price pressures ease: finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>The finance ministry on Monday projected consumer inflation for July to remain in a range of 3.5-4.5 per cent, citing stable prices and improved supply conditions, as price pressures ease further after the previous fiscal year’s sharp decline.
Inflation stood at 3.2pc in June, the ministry said in its monthly economic report, while average inflation for the fiscal year ending June 30 dropped to 4.49pc, a nine-year low, from 23.4pc the year before. The country’s fiscal year begins on July 1.
The ministry said the economy is expected to sustain its recovery in the early months of fiscal year 2026, underpinned by an improved macroeconomic backdrop and growing investor confidence.
Large-scale manufacturing likely maintained momentum in June, supported by rising private sector credit offtake and expanding production activity, the report said. The rebound is expected to lift imports of raw materials and intermediate goods, while aiding value-added exports, it added.
Strengthening domestic demand, a stable exchange rate, and steady global commodity prices were also likely to boost exports, remittances and imports in July, reinforcing external sector stability, the ministry said.
According to the report, the automobile sector exhibited strong performance during Jul-Jun FY2025, supported by substantial increases in the production of cars (40pc), trucks & buses (96.8pc), and sports utility vehicles & pick-ups (74.6pc).
Cement dispatches stood at 46.2 million tonnes during FY2025, marking a 2.1pc increase over the previous year; however, domestic cement sales declined by 3.1pc to 37 million tonnes, while exports rose significantly by 29.5pc to 9.2 million tonnes.
However, it warned that recent heavy rains could pose risks to agricultural output and supply chains, potentially impacting the inflation outlook in the coming months.
Since June  26, rain‑ and flood‑related incidents have killed at least 266 people and injured more than 630 nationwide, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, adding that 1,557 houses had been destroyed.
