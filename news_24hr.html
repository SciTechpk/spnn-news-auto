PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, his sister Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gillani, and members of the federal cabinet were also in attendance.
The ceremony began with the recitation of the Holy Quran, following which President Zardari administered the oath to Justice Aminuddin in English.
In his oath, Justice Aminuddin vowed to discharge his duties in accordance with the Constitution and the law, while also abiding by the code of conduct issued by the Supreme Judicial Council.
“That I will not allow my personal interest to influence my official conduct or my official decisions. That I will preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and that in all circumstances, I will do right to all manner of people according to law, without fear or favour, affection or ill will,” he said in his oath, after which he shook hands with the president.
His appointment was made by President Asif Ali Zardari a day earlier under Clause 3 of Article 175A, read with Article 175C, of the Constitution, adding that it would come into effect from the date of Justice Aminuddin’s oath-taking.
The proposal to establish the FCC has been revived as part of the judicial reforms incorporated in the 27th Constitutional Amendment. According to government officials, the FCC’s creation aims to reduce the SC’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases and strengthen judicial independence and credibility.
6 judges appointed to FCC
Meanwhile, President Zardari appointed six judges to the FCC. A notification issued by the law ministry, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said that the president made the appointments under Clause 3 of Article 175-A read with Article 175-C of the Constitution.
Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi of the Supreme Court, Justice K.K. Agha of the Sindh High Court and Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech.
Justice (retd) Arshad Hussain Shah has also been appointed.
The initial strength of the FCC has been determined through a presidential order, while any fu­­ture increase in the number of judges will require parliamentary approval through an act of Parliament. According to the sources, the oath-taking ceremony for the FCC judges will be held in the IHC auditorium, as judges of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) have resisted an immediate relocation to the third floor of the IHC building.
Initially, the oath-taking of Justice Aminud­din was scheduled for Thursday at 10am. However, following a minor revision to the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill, the legislation had to be returned to the Senate for approval. After the Senate cleared the bill on Thursday, the ceremony was first rescheduled for 6pm and was later moved to Friday morning.
Interestingly, the ceremony was not held in the FSC as originally planned. The FCC was intended to be established in the FSC building in Islamabad, while the Shariat Court was to be shifted to the IHC premises. However, sources within the FSC revealed that its judges expressed dissatisfaction over their abrupt relocation and raised the matter with Chief Justice Afridi.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633565-global-media-reviews-pakistans-constitutional-defence-reforms' target='_blank'><strong>Global media reviews Pakistan's constitutional defence reforms</strong></a><br><p>

As explained by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in the National Assembly (NA) yesterday, this means that the five-year tenure of the chief of the defence forces would commence from the date of his notification of the appointment.
The four bills were passed by the Senate today — a day after their hurried passage in the National Assembly — without debate and with little resistance from the opposition.
Apart from the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill 2025, the bills also included the Pakistan Air Force Amendment Bill 2025, the Pakistan Navy Amendment Bill 2025, and the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Amendment Bill 2025.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar tabled the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill 2025 and the Pakistan Air Force Amendment Bill 2025 on behalf of Defence Minister Khawaja Asif until he joined the session.
Asif presented the Pakistan Navy Amendment Bill 2025 when he arrived in the house. After him, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry tabled the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Amendment Bill 2025 on behalf of Law Minister Tarar.
As Dar began presenting the bills, he explained that the bill sought changes to the relevant laws in line with the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which was enacted into law yesterday.
The passage of the Amendment, which has paved the way for the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and changes to the military leadership structure, has been heavily criticised by the opposition.
Former and sitting judges, as well as lawyers, have also voiced opposition to the Amendment, particularly citing its implications for the Supreme Court.
But, little resistance by the opposition to the passage of the four bills in the Senate was witnessed today.
What are the changes?
The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill seeks to replace the expression “chief of the army staff” with “chief of the defence forces” as per the 27th Amendment. Similarly, it suggests replacing the “Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee” (CJCSC) with the “commander of the Natio­nal Strategic Command”.
Another important amendment to Section 8A of the Pakistan Army Act 1952 says that “provided that for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces under paragraph (a) of Clause 4 of the Article 243 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
Another amendment regarding the appointment of commander of the National Strategic Command says, “The prime minister may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces, appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command, from amongst generals in the Pakistan Army, for a tenure of three years.”
The proposed amendment also authorises the prime minister to “reappoint the commander…for additional tenure of three years and/or extend the tenure(s)…up to three years” on the recommendations of the chief of the defence forces.
It further says that “the appointment, reappointment or extension of the commander of the National Strategic Command, or the exercise of discretion by the appointing authority in this regard, shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.
Another amendment reads that “the federal government may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces and by order in writing, authorise the officer appointed as vice chief of the army staff or deputy chief of the army staff to exercise and perform such of the powers and functions vested in the chief of the army staff under any law, rules, regulations, orders or instructions for the time being in force as may be so specified”.
Meanwhile, amendments to the air force and navy laws include the elimination of the post of CJCSC from their documents.
The amendment to the Supreme Court law paves the way for the elimination of the Constitutional Bench, which was formed under the 26th Amendment.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14115840811abb3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955015/who-is-justice-aminuddin-the-first-chief-justice-of-the-newly-established-federal-constitutional-court' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Justice Aminuddin, the first chief justice of the newly established Federal Constitutional Court?</strong></a><br><p>The enactment of the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law paved the way for the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), with the Supreme Court’s Justice Aminuddin Khan being appointed its first chief justice.
Today, Justice Aminuddin was sworn in by President Zardari at a ceremony held at the Aiwan-i-Sadr, with Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi sat beside him.
With the FCC set to adjudicate on constitutional cases, here is a summary of Justice Aminuddin’s life and career thus far.
From advocate to judge
According to the Supreme Court’s website, Justice Aminuddin — a second-generation lawyer — was born on December 1, 1960 in Multan. He was awarded a bachelor’s degree in Philosophy in 1981 and completed his LLB from University Law College in Multan in 1984.
He then started practicing with his father, late Khan Sadiq Muhammad Ahsan. Justice Aminuddin became an advocate of the Lahore High Court (LHC) in 1987 and of the Supreme Court in 2001. That same year, he joined Zafar Law Chambers in Multan and worked with the legal firm until he was elevated to the position of a judge of the LHC bench in 2011.
In 2019, Justice Aminuddin was elevated to the Supreme Court, taking his oath of office from then-chief justice Asif Saeed Khosa.
In September last year, he was chosen by then-chief justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa to replace Supreme Court’s Justice Munib Akhtar on the three-judge Practice and Procedure Committee.
The development had come moments after the federal government promulgated an ordinance to amend the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2023, empowering the chief justice to pick any judge of the Supreme Court to be the third member of the body.
Justice Aminuddin was also appointed to head the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench in November 2024 following the passage of the 26th Constitutional Amendment while ranking fourth in seniority among Supreme Court judges.
During his career, Justice Aminuddin also assisted renowned lawyers like Mian Nisar Ahmed and Umar Ata Bandial. According to the SC’s website, Justice Aminuddin also worked as an examiner and lecturer at University Law College in Multan, his alma mater.
Notable judgements and cases
Article 63-A case: Justice Aminuddin was part of a five-member bench, headed by then-chief justice Isa, that unanimously accepted in October last year a review petition against the Supreme Court’s 2022 verdict related to the defection clause under Article 63-A of the Constitution.
Through its May 17, 2022 verdict, the court had declared that votes cast contrary to the parliamentary party lines in four instances outlined in Article 63-A should not be counted.
However, the October ruling by the five-member bench meant that in any future legislation, the ballots of lawmakers who vote against party policy would be counted in four instances, namely the election of the prime minister and the chief minister; a vote of confidence or no-confidence; a Constitution amendment bill; and a money bill.
Military trials of civilians case:  In May, the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin, restored key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA), allowing for the trial of civilians in military courts and overturning the Supreme Court’s earlier decision. Justice Aminuddin had announced the 10-page short order of the majority ruling.
The majority judgment explained that Sections 2(1d)(i) and (ii) — which pertain to trying individuals not subject to the Army Act — could not be declared ultra vires on the anvil or bedrock of Article 8(5) of the Constitution, which states that the fundamental rights will not be suspended except as expressly provided by the Constitution.
“Thus, it does not control the rigors of Article 8(3),” the majority judgement explained, adding that no question with regard to the suspension of any fundamental rights was involved within the sphere of influence or realm of Article 233 of the Constitution.

Reserved seats case: In June, the Constit­utional Bench, again headed by Justice Aminuddin, overturned an earlier judgement in the reserved seats case, which stripped the embattled PTI of its reserved seats and handed them over to rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures.
In its detailed verdict, the Constitutional Bench had ruled that the earlier judgment in the case was not justified in granting relief to the PTI by invoking Article 187 of the Constitution, which empowers the court to do ‘complete justice’, when no issue regarding the grant of reserved seats to the party was pending before it.
Read the full judgment here.
26 Amendment case: Prior to the 27th Amendment, the Constitutional Bench headed by Justice Aminuddin had also taken up pleas filed against the 26th Constitutional Amendment —  the very legislation that led to the establishment of the bench.
The Amendment, which was approved by both houses of Parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and was a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy, as has been the case with the 27th Amendment.
The last hearing of the case was held on October 23. It was scheduled to be taken up November 10 but was delisted for hearing. It is not yet clear where the case will now land up in, considering the establishment of the FCC.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1411350117098db.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955039/fresh-us-draft-on-gaza-mentions-path-to-palestinian-statehood-while-russia-submits-counter-proposal' target='_blank'><strong>Fresh US draft on Gaza mentions path to Palestinian statehood while Russia submits counter proposal</strong></a><br><p>The United States circulated a second revision of its draft resolution on Gaza at the UN Security Council (UNSC) on Thursday, even as Russia countered with its own text calling for the preservation of the current ceasefire and a renewed commitment to a two-state solution.
Senior UN diplomats told Dawn that Washington placed “Revision 2” of its draft under a silence procedure until 6:30pm New York time on November 13, a step intended to indicate that the negotiation phase was nearly complete. Under this procedure, the absence of objections signifies consent.
“But China and Russia broke the silence,” one diplomat said, noting that both delegations submitted formal objections shortly before the deadline. “Once silence is broken, other member states may also submit comments — and some did — although Pakistan did not,“ the diplomat added.
Following the break, Russia swiftly distributed its own draft resolution to UNSC members.
Breaking silence means, the US may now be forced to resume negotiations. Washington may still put its draft “in blue”, the final pre-vote format, but doing so without addressing the concerns of permanent members would almost certainly trigger a veto.
Diplomats said another negotiation round is now expected before any vote is scheduled.
The latest US revision builds on Trump’s broader post-conflict Gaza plan, which includes the creation of a foreign-administered “Board of Peace” to manage Gaza during a transitional period. The plan also proposes the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to disarm armed groups and secure the territory.
The plan places Gaza under a multilateral but foreign-led body while Palestinian institutions undergo reforms. Several countries have expressed reservations about this model, prompting Washington to refine the language in its second revision.
One of the most significant additions in the revised draft is the explicit call to maintain the Gaza ceasefire, a concession made after weeks of discussions with Arab, Muslim and European delegations.
The US also expanded the section on Palestinian statehood. The new language in Operative Paragraph 2 (OP2) states: “After the Palestinian Authority reform programme is faithfully carried out and Gaza redevelopment has advanced, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.”
The paragraph then commits Washington to political engagement, saying: “The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous coexistence.”
This wording aims to reassure delegates that Palestinian statehood will not be indefinitely delayed, but will depend on concrete progress in governance and reconstruction.
Another change specifically clarifies that the Board of Peace’s authority is strictly “transitional”, addressing concerns from several UNSC members that the board might evolve into a long-term trusteeship.
Crucially, diplomats noted that the revised draft also specifies the conditions for Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The revised language states that Israel will withdraw “as the ISF establishes control and stability”.
By linking withdrawal to ISF deployment and consolidation, the US draft outlines a phased exit rather than an immediate pullout, something that has drawn objections from Moscow and Beijing.
Russia’s counter-resolution
In response to the US initiative, Russia circulated its own draft resolution on Thursday evening. Moscow’s proposal centres on preserving the ceasefire, guaranteeing humanitarian access, and reaffirming the two-state solution without introducing foreign transitional authorities or an externally imposed governance structure.
The Russian draft cites the UN Charter and recalls “all its relevant resolutions on the situation in the Middle East, including the Palestinian question”, as well as a UN General Assembly resolution on the peaceful settlement of the conflict.
It “welcomes the initiative that led to the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip”, referring to the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict of September 29, and calls on all parties — with UN facilitation — to determine practical steps to implement it.
The resolution also “stresses the need to maintain the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip that should lead to a comprehensive and permanent cessation of hostilities”, urging all sides to comply with international humanitarian and human rights law.
On humanitarian issues, Moscow’s draft “demands full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access” for UN agencies and partners, both to expand relief operations and to support reconstruction.
The Russian text also takes a firm position against changes to Gaza’s geography, saying: “The Security Council rejects any attempt at demographic or territorial change in the Gaza Strip, including any actions that reduce the territory of the Gaza Strip.”
On the political framework, the resolution “reiterates its unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution”, and stresses the importance of “the unity and the territorial contiguity of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority”.
It concludes with the standard clause that the UNSC “decides to remain actively seized of the matter”.
With silence broken on the US draft, Washington is now preparing for another round of consultations. Senior diplomats say the two competing drafts reflect “a deeper divide over who should shape Gaza’s post-war administration — and on what timeline Palestinian statehood should become actionable”.
Both texts emphasise the ceasefire and humanitarian access, but differ sharply on governance, security arrangements, and the nature of international involvement. The US plan proposes transitional foreign supervision and conditional political progress, while the Russian draft anchors itself in existing UN frameworks and rejects foreign administrative bodies.
Diplomats in New York expect “intense, possibly prolonged” negotiations before the Security Council takes action on either draft.</p><small>2025-11-14 08:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1412243913983fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955041/govt-says-4-ttp-members-arrested-for-involvement-in-islamabad-suicide-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Govt says 4 TTP members arrested for involvement in Islamabad suicide attack</strong></a><br><p>Four members of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have been arrested for their involvement in the suicide blast in Islamabad earlier this week, the government said on Friday.
“In a joint operation conducted by the Intelligence Bureau Division and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), four members of the TTP/Fitna al-Khawarij terrorist cell involved in the suicide attack at the Judicial Complex G-11, Islamabad have been apprehended,” the government said in a post on social media platform X.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the TTP.
 






The government said that during the investigation, the handler of the suicide bomber, identified as Sajidullah alias Sheena, confessed that TTP Commander Saeedur Rehman alias Daadullah contacted him through the Telegram app to carry out a suicide attack in Islamabad to cause maximum casualties of law enforcement agencies.
The government said that the TTP commander sent pictures of the suicide bomber, identified as Usman alias Qari, for Sheena to recieve him. It further said that on the directives of the TTP commander, Sheena collected a suicide jacket from a graveyard in Peshawar and brought it to Islamabad.
On the day of the blast, the handler “set the suicide jacket” on the suicide bomber, the government added.
“The network was handled and guided at every step by the Fitna al-Khawarij/TTP high command based in Afghanistan. The entire cell involved in the incident, including its commander and three other members, has been arrested,” the government said.
“Investigations are continuing, and more revelations and arrests are expected,” it added.
At least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured as a bomb blast ripped through the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area on Tuesday. The blast occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the sixth Margalla Dialogue.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had said earlier that the bomber was “not a Pakistani national”, while Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that the blast was “related to Afghanistan”.
The incident in Islamabad had come the same week as an attack on the Cadet College in Wana that was successfully thwarted.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accused Afghanistan and India of being involved in recent terrorist activity, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies.</p><small>2025-11-14 07:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/69167a93ec759.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954920/focus-back-on-cricket-as-pakistan-eye-series-triumph-over-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Focus back on cricket as Pakistan eye series triumph over Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: After a day and a night of chaos, focus will finally shift back to cricket when Pakistan take on Sri Lanka in the second One-day International at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Friday.
The encounter — Pakistan’s opportunity to wrap up their second successive ODI series — comes after a turbulent 48 hours that threatened to overshadow the cricket itself. The match was originally slated for Thursday, but the schedule was thrown into disarray after a terror attack in Islamabad on Tuesday sparked understandable concern within the Sri Lankan camp.
Reports soon emerged that several visiting players were contemplating abandoning the tour altogether. The uncertainty prompted urgent intervention from Pakistan’s interior minister and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who, along with the country’s top security officials, held lengthy discussions with the Sri Lankan delegation to assure them of their safety.
By late Wednesday night, the situation had stabilised. Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) reaffirmed its commitment to completing the series, a gesture that was met with appreciation across Pakistan.
“Thank you Sri Lanka and the Sri Lankan cricket board,” Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi said in a video released by the PCB. “You have supported us in difficult times. We are grateful.”
 






Speculation that a few Sri Lankan players would fly home and be replaced by fresh faces was swiftly denied by the team’s manager, who confirmed there would be no changes to the touring party. That assurance means the visitors will field a full-strength line-up in Rawalpindi as they attempt to level the three-match series following a narrow defeat in the opener.
In the first ODI, Pakistan’s six-run victory owed much to a remarkable century by Salman Ali Agha and a fiery spell of fast bowling from Haris Rauf. The two combined to restrict Sri Lankan dominance at crucial junctures before the match went Pakistan’s way.
Salman, coming in with his side struggling at 76-3, stitched together a crucial 138-run partnership with Hussain Talat to lift Pakistan to a defendable total. Haris then ripped through Sri Lanka’s top order with four wickets, halting their chase just when it appeared they were cruising.
Shaheen’s men, however, will be aware that they cannot rely on individual brilliance alone. Their top order faltered once again, scoring just 76 in the first 20 overs, a familiar pattern that has left Pakistan’s middle order under constant pressure in recent months. The bowling, too, lacked discipline early on, as Sri Lanka raced to 85 in 12 overs before Haris’ intervention.
Sri Lanka captain Charith Asalanka, meanwhile, will take heart from his side’s aggressive start in the first match but lamented the lack of composure during key phases. The visitors also found themselves on the wrong side of fortune, having burned both their reviews early before one tight lbw shout against Hussain that replays later suggested could have gone either way.
“It was phenomenal, the way our bowlers started,” Asalanka said afterwards. “But one decision went against us, and that was unlucky. We couldn’t capitalise after that.”
With the series on the line, both teams will look to regroup mentally after the off-field turbulence. Pakistan will want to build on their momentum and seal the contest, while Sri Lanka will hope to draw inspiration from their composure in adversity.

Over the January-October period, Pakistan’s edible oil imports stood at 3.07m tonnes, surpassing the 3m tonnes imported in 2024.
“This is a huge increase going on … and this is primarily because of the surge in the population growth and also certain economic development,” Jan Mohammed told an industry conference on Indonesia’s resort island of Bali.
 
 

The country imported around 2.9m tonnes to 3m tonnes per year from 2022 to 2024. Over the January-October period, it imported 2.2m tonnes of oilseeds.
During a recent consultative meeting on edible oil regularisation, it was highlighted that approximately 30 per cent of edible oil consumed in Pakistan annually — more than 4.5m tonnes — comprises unbranded, loose oil, primarily found in semi-urban and rural areas.
Experts said that the loose oil, typically sold in bulk without proper packaging or labelling, often contains harmful chemicals, impurities, and biological contaminants. These pose serious health threats, including cardiovascular diseases, strokes, and brain disorders, they warned.</p><small>2025-11-14 05:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633538-senate-takes-up-armed-forces-sc-bills-today-to-align-laws-with-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Senate approves armed forces, SC bills to align laws with 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>

Justices Mohsin Akhtar Ka­­­yani and Saman Rafat Imtiaz made these remarks while hearing separate cases on Thursday and Wednesday, respectively.
During the hearing of a case related to a private company before Justice Kayani on Thursday, a lawyer requested that the final arguments be scheduled for the first week of December.
However, Justice Kayani responded: “In the first week of December, another judge will be sitting here to hear this case.”
The lawyer expressed his concern, saying, “Sir, don’t say things like this that make us uncomfortable.”
Justice Kayani replied with a smile, “No problem. I am happy about it.”
When the lawyer said, “Sir, you will leave… we have a lot to learn from you”, Justice Kayani reiterated, “No problem, I am happy.”
A day earlier, Justice Imtiaz had made similar remarks during the hearing of another case, saying that her bench might not be available from December, when a counsel sought an adjournment for the following week.
 
 

It may be recalled that five IHC judges, including Justi­ces Kayani and Imtiaz, had strongly challenged the tra­n­s­fer of incumbent Chief Jus­ti­­ce Sardar Mohammad Sarf­raz Dogar to the Islamabad High Court earlier this year.
The recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment empowers the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan to transfer high court judges without their consent — a provision that has raised concerns with­­in sections of the judiciary.
According to sources, the transfers of high court judges are exp­ected to take place in phases, with the IHC likely to be affected first.

“Today, I’m announcing Operation SOUTHERN SPEAR,” Hegseth posted on social media platform X.
“This mission defends our Homeland, removes narco-terrorists from our Hemisphere, and secures our Homeland from the drugs that are killing our people,” he said.
 






The post gave no details of what the operation would entail or how it might differ from military actions already being undertaken.
President Donald Trump’s administration is conducting a military campaign in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific, deploying naval and air forces for what it calls an anti-drugs offensive.
US forces have carried out strikes on about 20 vessels in international waters in the region since early September, killing at least 76 people, according to US figures.
Asked for clarification on the precise nature of Operation Southern Spear, a Pentagon spokesperson simply referred inquiries back to Hegseth’s post on X.
CBS News on Wednesday cited multiple sources as saying senior military officials had presented Trump with updated options for potential operations in Venezuela, including strikes on land.
Venezuela announced on Tuesday what it called a major, nationwide military deployment to counter the growing US naval presence off its coast — including a newly arrived US aircraft carrier strike group in the region.
Caracas fears the deployment, which also includes F-35 stealth warplanes sent to Puerto Rico and six US Navy ships in the Caribbean, is a regime change plot in disguise.</p><small>2025-11-14 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633528-justice-aminuddin-khan-set-to-be-sworn-in-as-first-cj-of-newly-formed-federal-constitutional-court' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Aminuddin sworn in as first CJ of newly formed Constitutional Court</strong></a><br><p>

Last year, the ICJ similarly derided the 26th Constitutional Amendment being signed into law as a “blow to judicial independence”.
ICJ Secretary General Santiago Canton was quoted as saying: “The changes made to the judicial system in the 27th Amendment are alarming …They will significantly impair the judiciary’s ability to hold the executive accountable and protect the fundamental human rights of the people of Pakistan.”
The jurists’ body expressed concern over several main points, namely the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), the appointment of judges and chief justices to the Supreme Court and the FCC, the composition of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), the transfer of high court judges and the immunities granted to the president and the military leadership.
“The FCC will have exclusive jurisdiction to decide disputes between any of Pakistan’s governments, provincial and federal and to adjudicate matters of public interest involving the enforcement of ‘fundamental rights’,” the statement read, adding that it can call for the record of any case and hear appeals if they deal with interpreting the Constitution.
“Before the amendment, the Supreme Court of Pakistan exercised the functions that have now been given to the FCC,” the statement read. “Following the amendment, the Supreme Court will now effectively be an appellate court only in matters that do not involve the interpretation of the Constitution of Pakistan.”
The ICJ further noted that the first batch of FCC judges would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, with future judges being appointed on the recommendation of the JCP, while the chief justice would be appointed by a “special parliamentary committee”.
 
 

“The amendment does not provide any criteria on which the appointments will be made and does not require reasons to [be] given for the appointments, apart from general qualifications necessary to be considered a judge of the FCC,” the statement read.
“The appointments are also of concern as the [chief justice] of the FCC and the senior-most judge of the FCC will also be members of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan … and the Supreme Judicial Council,” it highlighted.
The ICJ noted that amendments to Article 200 (transfer of high court judges) allow the JCP to recommend that the president transfer a judge from one high court to another, with the judge in question forced to accept the transfer within 30 days, lest they be barred from judicial duties.
“Article 200 fails to provide for any basis on which the JCP will decide when judges should be transferred and there is no requirement to establish a mechanism with clearly defined criteria and objectives to guide recommendations for transfer,” the ICJ said.
“This arbitrary system makes it impossible to determine whether transfer might actually be intended to be punitive or retaliatory, rather than for the legitimate purpose of better administration of justice and public interest.”
With regards to lifetime immunity granted to the president, the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the fleet under Articles 243 and 248, the ICJ said the amendments are “contrary to core rule of law principles, including accountability, access to justice, and equality before the law”.
“No public official should ever be entirely unaccountable, as this effectively allows for the possibility of unlawful or arbitrary exercise of power without consequence,” the statement read.
Senate’s approval
The president signed the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.</p><small>2025-11-14 04:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/140932293cebecd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955030/afghan-regimes-move-to-suspend-trade-sends-shock-waves-through-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan regime’s move to suspend trade sends shock waves through KP</strong></a><br><p>KHYBER: The sudden announcement of the Afghan Taliban regime about abrupt suspension of trade ties with Pakistan on Thursday sent shock waves through the trading, industrial and transportation circles in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with the reopening of Pak-Afghan border points out of sight.
Traders and customs clearing agents expressed serious apprehensions about grave economic implications of Kabul’s move for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in particular and the country in general.
In a video message on Thursday, Afghan Taliban regime First Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Mulla Abdul Ghani Baradar warned all Afghan traders and industrialists against maintaining any trading relationship with Pakistan and warned that his government would not be responsible for any trouble or losses faced by Afghan exporters and importers.
Announcing an end to the country’s all trading contracts with Pakistanis in three months’ time, he asked Afghan traders to explore “new avenues” and approach other countries for trading items needed by the people of Afghanistan.

Business leader fears country will lose big market in both Afghanistan, Central Asia

Reacting to the Afghan Taliban regime’s announcement regarding abrupt suspension of trade with Pakistan, Ziaul Haq Sarhadi, senior vice-president of Pak-Afghan Joint Chamber of Commerce and Industry, feared that Pakistan would lose a big market in both Afghanistan and Central Asian States, with whom Pakistan just recently signed trade agreements worth millions of dollars.
He said that Afghanistan had the option to sign business deals with almost all Central Asian States along with Iran and Turkiye on easier terms than Pakistan’s, with Pakistan permanently losing the Afghan market, much to the displeasure of the local trading community and colossal financial losses to the country’s industry.
Mr Sarhadi said that Pakistan was exporting fresh fruits, cement, medicines, surgical items, agricultural tools, fabrics, shoes, plastic pipes and sanitary items, cosmetics and a number of locally manufactured items valuing around $100-200 million per month.
“We are the ultimate losers due to the closure of our border with Afghanistan as Kabul has more choices than us,” he argued.
 
 

Zahidullah Shinwari, a former president of Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said that besides losing the Afghan and Central Asian States markets, the suspension of trade with Afghanistan would also seriously affect the tax collection of Federal Bureau of Revenue, which was collecting millions of rupees on a daily basis from both exports and imports at all border points.
He said that industry in KP would be particularly hit hard by the trade suspension with Afghanistan as the KP industry was heavily reliant on its products to Afghanistan, while they couldn’t compete with industry in Punjab and Sindh due to several reasons.
“Much of our big industry, especially cement factories, are run by coal imported from Afghanistan, so suspension of coal import from Afghanistan will adversely affect the production capacity of our big industries,” he said.
He warned if the trade with Afghanistan ended permanently, it would result in the closure of a majority of industrial units in KP with hundreds of industrial labour becoming jobless, while the owners would go bankrupt.
The SCCI leader said that the continued border disturbance and subsequent closure was ‘a losing bargain’ for Pakistan as it would do away with its grip and monopoly over the Afghan and Central Asian States markets.
“We need to rethink our security policies as our financial losses are much bigger than any political point scoring on the diplomatic front over the security issues against Afghanistan,” he said.
Mujeebullah Shinwari, president of Torkham Clearing Agents’ Association, argued that the border closure and subsequent trade suspension had confronted local traders and transporters with huge financial losses.
He said that local transporters were heavily rallied on trade with Afghanistan and therefore, the trade suspension would render thousands of tribesmen jobless in the acute financial crises facing the country.
Mr Shinwari said that around 500 vehicles loaded with a variety of export goods were stranded on the Pakistan side of the border as they had no choice but to wait for a reopening of the border.
He said that neither the exporter nor the industrials were now willing to take back the merchandise they had sold to Afghanistan while the transporters too had received their fare up to Kabul and were now under contractual obligation to deliver the consignment to the designated firm in Afghanistan.
“This is a very uncertain situation and also very unfortunate for the local traders and transporters as they are now caught between the devil and deep sea”, he said.

Environmental rebuilding takes no less. It took us decades to poison our skies with unmanaged dust, unchecked exhaust, adulterated fuels, and unplanned sprawl. However, corrective measures have begun, not with promises, but with systems. This shift has been possible under the political direction of the Punjab chief minister, whose government has placed environment at the centre of the province’s development agenda, and the ad­­m­­inistrative follow-through of chief secretary Pun­­jab who ensured coordination across departments.
The first principle of any reform is simple: you cannot manage what you cannot measure. The province, which had just three functional air quality monitoring stations donated in 2007, today operates 75 with 10 mobile units roaming hotspot districts. Twenty-five more will be live by the end of 2025, creating the most extensive environmental monitoring network ever attempted in Pakistan.
Measurement has also enabled precision forecasting. An artificial intelligence model, developed with satellite support, now predicts seven-day smog patterns, allowing the authorities to prepare before the crisis peaks. This is complemented by a central monitoring room — the Smog War Room — linking divisional weather rooms, enforcement units, and dashboards that track real-time operations, from fog cannon deployment to vehicle testing and industrial compliance.
It is pertinent to mention here that smog is not a single-source problem. Punjab’s source apportionment study, being conducted through Suparco, has indicated fugitive dust as one of the largest contributors to particulate matter during winter. It emanates from unpaved roads, dry construction sites, and neglected public works. To respond, the province has deployed 15 high-capacity mist cannons mounted on trucks with water bowsers. These are not ceremonial gadgets but engineered systems capable of suppressing dust over 120 metres. Furthermore, Pakistan’s first dust-control SOPs now require mist sprinkling and site fencing at all construction sites.

An AI model predicts seven-day smog patterns, allowing the authorities to prepare.

Parallel to dust suppression runs a quieter but equally significant reform: fuel quality control. In a province of millions of motorcycles and vehicles, there was not a single fuel testing lab until recently. Now, three state-of-the-art labs in Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Multan, along with three mobile units, test samples daily. Punjab’s new emission testing system, with 100 analysers and 22 fixed stations in Lahore alone, has screened more than 260,000 vehicles this year.
The Environmental Protection Force — 250 new officers on electric bikes equipped with body cameras — has given enforcement a human face backed by digital proof. Through five newly built divisional offices and four more under construction, this force is operational in hotspot districts and supported by the Smog War Room, 67 quick response centres and AI-linked CCTV feeds. A bilingual helpline, WhatsApp Chatbot, and Green Punjab App have given citizens 24/7 access to file complaints, check case status, and receive health advisories. The system now closes 96 per cent of complaints.
 
 

Under the supervision of senior minister for environment, these enforcement and digital-governance reforms have evolved into a province-wide Clean Air Framework that links industry, transport, and agriculture into one chain of accountability. She provided the strategic continuity that turned environmental intent into institutional reform. Punjab launched and implemented the Climate Resilient Punjab Vision and Action Plan 2024 — the province’s first-ever climate policy that introduced a whole-of-government approach to tackling air, water, land and waste challenges. The policy did not end at approval; it evolved into coordinated action across governance, enforcement and citizen engagement.
The shift from reaction to planning extends to agriculture as well. Stubble burning, long seen as an intractable cultural habit, is being addressed through a combination of technology, incentives, and surveillance. Satellite-based fire anomaly alerts trigger ground responses from the Environment Protection Force and district teams. The government has subsidised 5,000 super seeders and plans another 5,000 under the Punjab Clean Air Programme, while interest-free loans of Rs30 billion have been opened for modern harvesters and balers. Farmers in treated zones report significant reductions in open burning, with over half a million acres now harvested through mechanised, low-emission means.
Industrial reform has been equally systemic. More than 13,500 industries have been mapped with drone-assisted verification and given digital IDs. The Resource Efficient and Cleaner Production Programme has disbursed Rs1.18bn in soft loans to small industries to retrofit emission control systems. What once depended on surprise visits now runs on e-compliance, drone monitoring and traceable reopening after verified compliance. A parallel greening drive — 25 million trees, 2.1m along the Green Ring around Lahore alone — has begun to form a living buffer between concrete and air.
Financing mechanisms have been modernised to keep the green agenda solvent. The Environment Endowment Fund, backed by $50 million from the World Bank, anchor long-term projects in research, innovation, and industrial adaptation. The Punjab Green Credit Programme converts eco-friendly behaviour into tangible incentives, each verified environmental action earns citizens up to Rs10,000 in green credits.
Lahore did not descend into smog overnight; it will not emerge from it overnight either. What distinguishes the current phase is continuity all converging to institutionalise what was once episodic firefighting. The deterrence being built today in labs, in legislation, in enforcement, and in citizen trust, will take years to mature, but it is the only path that works. Environmental recovery is not dramatic; it is procedural. It grows with every tree, every clean litre of fuel, every enforced emission standard, and every citizen who decides that clean air is worth the wait. The question now is whether we can sustain the patience and discipline that true reform demands.

“We didn’t know where TLP chief Saad Rizvi and his brother Anas Rizvi have gone,” a senior officer in Central Police Office (CPO) Lahore told this reporter on Thursday.
According to him, both of them were marked as high-profile targets by the Punjab police for being wanted in more than 100 FIRs lodged against them.
Quoting the intelligence reports, the police official said the TLP chief and his brother were not using any kind of electronic gadget or device and that was the leading factor that helped them to stay away from the radars/gadgets of the law enforcers.

Officials claim arrest of 1,250 key members, financiers; say duo not using gadgets; reject allegations about harassing female family members of ‘wanted’ TLP men

“We used many modern gadgets and technologies to trace them but failed to find out their whereabouts in the country,” the official claimed.
 
 

He said the ‘mysterious disappearance’ of Saad and Anas has baffled the Punjab police and other law-enforcement agencies.
“I can only make sure that they are not in Punjab’s territory,” the official said, adding that the provincial police experts, who were assigned tasks to trace and arrest them, could only obtain four possible locations when they managed to flee from Muridke city soon after the operation.
Their locations were identified in a remote area of Muridke, then in Lahore and Azad Jammu & Kashmir.
As per the later reports, the Punjab police were informed that the TLP chief and his brother may have gone underground in Karachi, he said.
About the crackdown in Lahore, the official said the provincial capital has been the hub of activities of the TLP’s top leadership and other workers for housing the headquarters of the party.
So, the major focus of the police remained arrests of the hardcore members of the TLP from Lahore.
“We have prepared two lists of the TLP members for carrying out violent agitation and attacks on the police,” he said.
A list of the targeted TLP members was prepared on the basis of the geofencing carried out in Lahore’s route that they had used to launch the march on Islamabad and in Muridke where they had encountered with the LEAs.
The second list provided to all the 85 police stations of Lahore was of the financiers, the police official said adding that in the crackdowns continued on a daily basis, the city police have arrested a total of 1,250 hardcore TLP members and the financiers so far.
Sources said sufferings of the families of the ‘wanted’ TLP members increased manifold due to the frequent police raids at their homes.
A majority of the families have locked their houses and gone into hiding to avoid police crackdown.
According to the sources, they had no option other than to abandon the educational activities of their children as they were frequently changing locations amid reports that the police teams were vigorously pursuing them to complete the ‘targeted’ arrests.
The police officers, however, claimed that they were not harassing or arresting the female members of the TLP members wanted in the cases lodged against them under heinous offences.
Talking to Dawn on the condition of anonymity, a station house officer (SHO) posted in Lahore confirmed that they were under immense pressure to complete the task of arresting the ‘wanted’ TLP men.
In order to trace them, they had no option other than to take into custody the close relatives of the ‘targets’ including father, brothers, young sons and their immediate cousins.
“After taking them into custody, we used to get the call record data of the close male relatives of the wanted TLP men to find out whether they were in contact with them or not,” the SHO said.
Though this practice could not be justified, it was employed to reach the ‘targeted’ TLP men and in many cases it worked and helped them to arrest the suspects.
He, however, rejected the allegations that they were harassing the female family members of the ‘wanted’ TLP men.

An implication of this is that Pakistan has one of the world’s lowest investment-to-GDP ratios, even within the South Asian region, with repercussions for the entire economy.
In hindsight, this predicament is a tad surprising given certain attributes like Pakistan being a market of 250 million (and increasing) people. Yet we find that even local investors prefer destinations like Dubai. How does one unravel this puzzle?
Let’s turn to John Maynard Keynes — perhaps the most well-known figure in 20th-century economics. In chapter 22 of his magnum opus The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936), he states: “But I suggest that the essential character of the trade cycle … is mainly due to the way in which the marginal efficiency of capital fluctuates. … [T]he marginal efficiency of capital depends, not only on the existing abundance or scarcity of capital-goods and the current cost of production of capital-goods, but also on current expectations as to the future yield of capital-goods. … But, as we have seen, the basis for such expectations is very precarious.”
Keynes introduces the reader to three important attributes of investment which give rise to fluctuations (sometimes sudden and violent) in economic activity — the investor is interested in what his/ her invested capital is bringing forth (‘marginal efficiency’), investment is affected by relative abundance or scarcity of capital (capital is just not credit, something Pakistan’s seths have historically been fixated on in their clamour for subsidised credit), and most importantly, the ‘precarious’ basis of their expectations.

Without a system that addresses the causes of uncertainty, there will be little investment.

From a public policy and economic growth point of view, the most important question, then, is how to make the overall business environment less precarious? The other way of asking this is — what can a government do to induce a certain modicum of certainty? It is an important question to dwell on because the direction of causality usually runs from this attribute to the other two, ie, less risk leads to higher investment, higher capital formation and higher capital efficiency.
So how risky is Pakistan?
We begin with two recent instances. The first one relates to a person who bought about 137 kanals of land in the early 2000s to build his farmhouse. For some time, he was reportedly under pressure to sell his farmhouse but kept refusing. A few months ago, on returning from a short trip abroad, he was astonished to find that his property had been occupied by strangers, who claimed that it had been legally sold to them by him, with sale deeds containing his signature.
The second instance is also a recent one. A journalist on YouTube, who is often critical of the security state, found his bank account frozen like hundreds of others. But here is the astounding part. The journalist in question apparently has a penchant for parrots. One fine day, the poor chap who sold him parrots, and who had nothing to do with the journalist’s views or politics, found that his bank account has been frozen too.
In the first instance, the fraudulent property confiscation did not take place in some remote part of Pakistan. It happened in Islamabad, the capital of a nuclear-armed country and on which trillions are spent to govern hardly 906 square kilometres of land. A committee was formed by the highest administrative authority as news of this daylight robbery spread. Yet there were concerns when a member did not find anything wrong in the transaction. If property rights, one of the main tenets of economic growth and investment, cannot be protected even in the capital, what of the rest of the country?
 
 

In the second instance, the unmistakable feeling that an observer gets is that the country is being run by some sadistic, petty and insecure minds. When a person opens a bank account, it is not just a vault where his earnings rest; rather, it’s an agreement based on trust that his earnings are secure from arbitrary confiscations and theft, guaranteed by the state. The message in this instance is that nothing is secure; the government can breach the trust anytime it wants under a flimsy pretext. It does not respect any rights or agreements and can confiscate a person’s earnings whenever it deems fit.
These two instances are basically a microcosm of what has been happening in Pakistan for decades. Take the issue of property rights. A major portion of the millions of pending cases in courts across the country relate to disputes over property because there really is no mechanism for ensuring its sanctity. That these remain pending in courts for long also reflects the poor quality of the justice system, something that investors around the globe value.
When combined with other factors, such as the security situation, the quality of service provision and infrastructure, frequent political turbulence, excessive regulations, etc, and while keeping Keynes’ quote in perspective, one cannot but conclude that in aggregate, Pakistan is a highly risky country where it is precarious to form expectations of a future that would make life easy for investors. Turmoil is frequent, and continuity missing.
We can dangle the $6 trillion mineral riches or showcase samples in a suitcase, and hold a ton more of ‘road shows’, but without a system that addresses the issues giving rise to aggregate uncertainty, there would be no considerable investment in Pakistan (especially long-term investment). When major investments like Karkey and Reko Diq land in arbitration courts, everyone takes note. Investors will always be wary of the long haul in such circumstances and prefer less risky options such as buying our debt in domestic and global financial markets. Simply put, prioritise substance over form.

“On average, refugee households have more members than host community households and the national average,” the report ‘Forced Displacement Survey — Pakistan, 2024’ says, adding that the national average is 6.3, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
The survey highlights a significant dependency burden, with the age dependency ratio at 137 among refugees and 105 in the host community.
This indicates more than one dependent for every working-age individual in both groups, a figure higher than the world average of 55. The data also showed 54 per cent of children in refugee households are under age 4, compared to 31 per cent in the host community.

Says the typical refugee family has 8.9 people, exceeding the national average of 6.3.

Also, the refugee population is predominantly young, with half of all refugees, nearly 620,000 children, under the age of 15.
Child marriage rates were also found to be alarmingly high. Approximately 5pc of refugee girls are married before the age of 15 and 25pc before 18.
This means one in every four girls in the refugee community is married before adulthood. The rates are lower but still significant in the host community, where 2pc of girls are married before 15 and 12pc before 18.
According to Unicef and the World Bank, child marriage is closely linked to poor health outcomes, reduced educational attainment, and economic hardship — particularly among vulnerable populations such as refugees.
The survey also sheds light on the origins of the refugee population, revealing that the majority were born in Pakistan. Around three-quarters of refugees aged 18 and above were born in the host country.
Only 24pc, or approximately 160,000 individuals, were born in Afghanistan. Nine in ten refugees have at least one parent who is or was also a refugee.
Marriage rates among household heads are high in both communities. Among refugees, 96 percent of males and 60 percent of females are married. In the host community, 95 per cent of male household heads and 40pc of female household heads are married.
This potentially indicates that among both refugees and host communities, most female-headed households are single-parent households.
For over four decades, Pakistan has hosted more than three million Afghan refugees, making it one of the world’s leading refugee-hosting nations. The survey focused on Afghan refugees holding Proof of Registration (PoR) cards, the majority of whom live in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
 
 

In addition to registered refugees, UNHCR has recorded data on approximately 190,000 Afghan asylum-seekers and refugees who arrived after the Taliban takeover in 2021.
Of these, an estimated 110,000 are considered to have “extreme vulnerabilities and would be at risk of imminent harm if returned to Afghanistan”.

Though the American president’s scheme may have halted the immediate Israeli genocide — although Tel Aviv continues to target Palestinians in both Gaza and the West Bank — the follow-up to the ceasefire, specifically the deployment of the so-called international stabilisation force in the occupied territory, is proving trickier. Many of the Muslim states that were initially part of the plan are reportedly having second thoughts about deploying their troops in Gaza. Moreover, the Arab states and Pakistan, which is among the countries that could send troops, have apparently demanded that any UN resolution authorising the deployment of troops must reaffirm the Palestinians’ legitimate demands, namely their right to statehood. UNSC permanent members Russia and China have similarly called for any foreign force in Gaza to be under UN oversight.
The fact is that demands for UN supervision of the Gaza force, as well as a clear roadmap for Palestinian statehood, should be unambiguous parts of any resolution aimed at addressing the Gaza question. As previously mentioned in this space, unless there is UN control over the Gaza peacekeeping force, the deployment may be seen as a front for the US and Israel to enforce their writ over Palestinian territory, rather than as a genuine peacekeeping force.
Moreover, the Trumpian plan envisages the disarming of Hamas. It is a dangerous proposition to use Muslim troops to disarm the Palestinian group in order to succeed where Israel has failed. American officials have also spoken of the force overseeing ‘security’ in Gaza. There needs to be clarification of this term; does it mean security only for Israel? Or will the foreign troops protect Gaza’s civilians from Israeli assaults? Since the ceasefire took effect, Israel has killed at least 240 Palestinians. If this is what a ‘truce’ looks like, we can imagine what the Zionist state will unleash again unless strong curbs are put in place to check its genocidal nature.
 
 

Pakistan and all other Muslim states considering participation in the force must therefore discuss and demand the details of this mission. Going in without a clear UN mandate that protects the Palestinian people and commits to a two-state solution, would be inadvisable. In fact, it would be better to stay away from such a scheme. The aim must be to rebuild Gaza, and create the conditions for the liberation of the occupied Palestinian territories and for Palestinian statehood. Anything less than this would be a mirage to further Israeli criminal aims.

• Naqvi says COAS played key role in talks with Sri Lankan officials
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly (NA) and the Senate on Thursday passed resolutions expressing gratitude to the government of Sri Lanka and the country’s cricket board for not recalling its cricket team, which is currently in Pakistan to play a cricket series and a tri-nation tournament.
Parliamentary Affairs Minis­ter Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry presented the resolution in the NA hours after Law Minister Azam Nazeer presented a similar resolution in the Senate.
 






Through the resolution, the NA expressed gratitude for the personal efforts of the president of Sri Lanka, the country’s defence minister, and the entire government of Sri Lanka for their decision to continue the cricket tour of Pakistan.
“The House appreciates the Sri Lanka Cricket Board’s decision to proceed with the tour despite all threats,” the resolution stated.
The resolution also acknowledged the zeal and dedication of Interior Minister and PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, for their all-out efforts in ensuring the successful continuation of the tour.
Earlier in the day, while speaking in the Senate Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir facilitated talks with Sri Lanka, which led to the visiting team’s decision to stay in Pakistan for the ongoing matches.
According to media reports, Sri Lan­kan players on Wednesday wanted to ret­urn to their homeland due to security concerns following a suicide attack at the Islamabad Judicial Complex that clai­med 12 lives and injured many others.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said they were thankful to the Sri Lankan government “which assured us that it stands by Pakistan in the war on terror and did not recall its team.”
Mr Tarar read out the resolution, which recognised the historic and brotherly relations be­­tween Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and appreciated the spirit of spo­­rtsmanship and mutual trust that continues to stren­gthen ties between the two nations.
Mr Naqvi said Sri Lanka’s cricket board confirmed late last night that its team’s ongoing tour of Pakistan would proceed.
“Our field marshal himself spoke to their defence minister and secretary, convincing them and assuring them fully of [providing] security,” Mr Naqvi, who also serves as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman, said while speaking on the Senate floor.
He recalled that the Sri Lankan team had initially “decided to return after the bomb blast occurred”.
“Our interaction with them began, and their board, players, and everyone decided with great bravery to stay here,” the PCB chairman added.
“They had many concerns, but we tried to allay all of those,” Mr Naqvi said, highlighting that Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake had spoken to his country’s team to convince them.
Mr Naqvi revealed that Field Marshal Munir had played a key role in the visiting team’s decision to continue the tour.
“Now, the Pakistan Army, Rangers, and Islamabad Police are jointly managing their security, and we are providing them the same kind of protocol and protection as our state guests,” the interior minister said.
Naqvi meets SL team
Later, Interior Minister Moh­sin Naqvi met Sri Lankan players and termed their act of continuing with series — a victory of peace and defeat of terrorists, as Zimbabwe’s squad also reached in Islamabad to participate in the triangular series.
Mr Naqvi, along with State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Sri Lankan High Commissioner retired Rear Admiral Fred Siriweera, visited Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, where hosts Pakistan and Sri Lankan team were practicing ahead of second ODI, which will be played on Friday (today).

The company is likely to establish technical collaborations, knowledge-sharing, and feasibility studies to assess specific investment projects in partnership with local entities.
Nova Minerals is a dual Nasdaq and ASX-listed gold, antimony and critical minerals mining exploration and development company, and its delegation, led by Chief Executive Officer, Christopher Gerteisen, held a meeting with Minister for Board of Investment, Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, on Thursday, and showed interest particularly in antimony and rare earth minerals.
The leader of the delegation stated that Pakistan’s geological diversity, coupled with government facilitation and policy reforms, offers ample opportunities and makes it an attractive destination for long-term investment.
Lauding Nova Minerals’ interest in Pakistan’s mineral exploration sector, Minister Qaiser Sheikh informed the delegation that the government encourages responsible, technology-driven ventures that ensure sustainability and local value addition. Such initiatives would help create an ecosystem conducive to further foreign investment in Pakistan’s mining sector.
 
 

The investment minister noted that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly supports foreign investments and joint ventures, recognising them as key drivers of economic growth and modernisation. He also lauded the efforts of the business community and international partners who continue to build confidence in Pakistan’s investment climate.
During the meeting, Mr Qaiser Sheikh highlighted Pakistan’s vast and largely untapped potential in the minerals and mining sector, emphasising that the country offers promising investment opportunities across multiple areas, particularly in the exploration and processing of high-value minerals.
He underscored that foreign investment in mining will not only unlock Pakistan’s natural resources but also strengthen bilateral economic relations, promote technology transfer, and create opportunities for skill development and higher education exchanges, enabling Pakistani professionals and students to return with advanced expertise.

The latest meeting, held at the company’s head office in Karachi on Thursday, was convened with the same agenda put forward earlier this month, i.e. the removal of CEO Moonis Alvi.
However, the effort faltered as the meeting witnessed serious differences among the government board members and those from the private sector. A majority of board members walked out, effectively blocking the motion.
 
 

Company sources told Dawn that, unlike the previous meeting on Nov 5, Thursday’s session met all legal requirements and began with a quorum. Nine of the 10 directors were present, though the federal finance secretary was unable to attend. Proceedings were recorded in line with the procedure.

Motion blocked as majority of board members leave six-minute meeting

However, the meeting lasted only six minutes. As the agenda centred on the CEO’s removal, Mr Alvi did not attend.
After the meeting opened, five directors — Adeeb Ahmad, Mubasher H. Sheikh, Muhammad Kamran Kamal, Saad Amanullah Khan and Shan A. Ashary — excused themselves and left the venue.
This left only the two government nominees — the Secretary of Power and director Javed Kureishi, who had called the meeting — in the room. Board Chairman Mark Gerard Skelton also remained on the premises.
The walkout rendered the meeting unworkable and the attempt to unseat the CEO collapsed for a second time.
Later, K-Electric forwarded its report to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) titled ‘Board Meeting Other Than Financial Results’.
“In continuation of our intimation dated Nov 7, this is to inform you that the Board of Directors of the Company, at its meeting held on Thursday, 13 November 2025, considered matters other than the financial results of the Company. Please inform the TRE Certificate Holders of the Exchange accordingly,” the company’s statement said.

• Achakzai wants  demos on Fridays
• KP CM stopped from meeting Imran for sixth time
ISLAMABAD: Appre­ciating the resignations of the judges of the top court and urging the judiciary to stand on its feet, the PTI’s Parlia­mentary Commi­ttee has suggested holding countrywide protests against the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
However, the suggestions will be discussed in a meeting of the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday (today), followed by a press conference.
 






The parliamentary party’s meeting was chaired by Mahmood Khan Achakzai, the Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief and TTAP chairman, and attended by PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Asad Qaiser and other members of the National Assembly.
Former NA speaker Qaiser, while talking to Dawn, said during the meeting, proposals were sought to devise a strategy after the passage of the 27th Amendment.
“The participants [of the meeting] unanimously agreed that the incumbent government is not capable to run the country. At the same time there is an economic crisis, miserable law and order situation and the country is at the verge of a civil war,” he said.
Mr Qaiser said Mr Achakzai was of the view that the countries, which lac­ked respect for the law and Constitution, were destined to fall apart.
 
 

“[Mr] Achakzai suggested involving the religious segment of the society and holding a countrywide protest on Fridays.”
Replying to a question, the former NA speaker said the resignation of the two judges was a commendable act and marked the first drop of rain against the government.
“We urge the judiciary to stand on its feet because the whole nation will stand along with it over the issue,” he continued.
He said that a meeting of the TTAP to be held on Friday would chalk out and announce the collective strategy of the joint opposition.
KP CM denied meeting again
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was stopped from meeting PTI founder Imran Khan for the sixth time on Thursday.
Mr Afridi, along with other leaders of the opposition, including Raja Nasir Abbas and Junaid Akbar, reached Adiala jail, but were not allowed to enter its premises.
Later, they returned to their vehicles as the time for the meeting had expired.
The KP chief minister, while talking to reporters, said that it was unfortunate that the orders of Islamabad High Court were not being implemented.
It is worth mentioning that the apex court has directed to allow the KP chief minister’s meeting with the PTI founder.
Mr Afridi wondered as to why there was a fear if he held a meeting with his party’s patron-in-chief.
“Am I going to discuss nuclear secrets with him?” he remarked.
He urged the security establishment to “focus on the borders of the country” and allow the politicians to address their issues through politics.

Earlier, senior puisne Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah had written separate letters to the CJP asking for a full court meeting or the convening of the judicial conference. However, the two justices resigned on Thursday evening in protest against the 27th Constitutional Amendment
Justice Panwhar, in a two-page letter, requested the CJP to call the full court to examine the amendment clause by clause and study its implications against Articles 175, 175A, 189, 190, 191 and 209 of the Constitution — provisions which deal with the judiciary.
Headed by the CJP, the full court meeting will be held at the Supreme Court building before the Friday prayers.
Justice Panwhar stated he was writing the letter “not in protest but in … the duty that binds every judge who has sworn to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution”.
“There comes a time when silence is not caution but abdication. I believe such a time may now be upon us,” the letter read.
“From what has been foreshadowed, this amendment may unsettle the careful balance that the framers intended,” Justice Panwhar wrote, warning that the amendment may “touch upon the security of tenure, the composition of benches, the appointment and removal of judges, or even the financial and administrative autonomy of courts”.
“Let us test each provision of the amendment by a single question: does it strengthen the independence of the judiciary, or diminish it?” Justice Panwhar’s letter suggested, stating that if the independence of the judiciary is diminished, then judges must say so, “not in anger but in truth”.
Justice Panwhar also suggested commissioning a technical brief through the Pakistan Secretariat’s Law and Justice Commission and, if necessary, engaging the National Judicial Policy Making Committee.
He also suggested that the Supreme Court confer with the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) and provincial bar councils, since the “bar and the bench are twin guardians of justice”.
The SC judge also asked to prepare to preserve their capacity under Article 190 of the Constitution, should litigation ensue, to ensure that the “judicial commands were not rendered hollow”.
“Let our response be principled yet temperate and firm in defence of constitutional boundaries, but respectful of the comity due among organs of the State,” the judge wrote.
“For Parliament’s power to amend is plenary, but it is not without limit, even if it does not say so,” the letter said, adding that the “Constitution was not clay to be moulded at will, it was a covenant between the state and citizen”.
Justice Panwhar wrote that his request was not born of discord, but conscience. He emphasised that the judiciary is a servant of the Constitution, not its master, but it would not stand if its independence is diminished.
“History will not remember the ease of our days but the courage of decisions,” Justice Panwhar added. He requested the meeting so that “we may together preserve the trust reposed in this court and ensure that the rule of law remains the law of the land, not in word alone, but in living truth”.
“It is the very condition upon which liberty itself depends. If the judiciary is not free; free from fear, free from influence, free from control, then the rule of law becomes but a phrase, hollow and without breath,” the letter cautioned.
Even the appearance of interference is enough to erode public confidence and “confidence” is the very soul of justice. Once lost, it cannot be summoned by decree or proclamation, the letter said.
Meanwhile, prominent lawyer Asad Rahim Khan also moved a petition before the Supreme Court seeking a declaration that, in the presence of Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, as provided in the original Constitution of 1973, cannot be abridged or abolished through an act of parliament.
The petition also pleaded before the Supreme Court to take measures for securing the independence of the judiciary, and such further or better relief as may be appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case may also be granted.
Earlier today, President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, enacting it into law.
The summary signed by the president, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states: “The Constitution (Twenty-Seventh Amendment) Bill, 2025, is assented to, as advised by the prime minister, at para 5 of the summary.”
Meanwhile, sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court — the establishment of which would now be realised after the enactment of the 27th Amendment bill — tomorrow at the Presidency.</p><small>2025-11-14 02:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/14073614e91d30e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954930/pakistan-revives-offshore-exploration-with-23-block-award-round' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan revives offshore exploration with 23-block award round</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government has awarded 23 new offshore exploration blocks to three public sector oil and gas producers led by Mari Energies on a provisional basis for three years with investment commitments of about $80 million.
Mari Energies — a joint venture of Fauji Foundation and the federal government and its other entities — has emerged as the leader by securing stakes in all 23 blocks in the bidding round, in which a total of 40 offshore blocks were offered by the government.
The Islamabad-based Mari Energies said that it secured all the 23 blocks, as operator in 18 and as joint venture partner in the remaining five blocks. Mari has 100pc ownership and operatorship in 10 offshore blocks and majority shares along with operatorship of eight others.
Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL) — the country’s oldest producer and Karachi-based state-owned enterprise — secured six blocks as operator and partnership in two others, while the largest producer — Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL), based in Islamabad — was awarded two blocks as operator and six others as joint venture partner.

Mari Energies and partners secure new stakes as govt eyes global investors for next exploration phase

Prime Global Energies — a private firm — also secured operatorship in one block with 31pc stakes, with the remaining 23pc each by Mari, PPL and OGDCL.
These awards are subject to the execution of production sharing agreements (PSAs), the grant of exploration licences, the signing of joint operating agreements (JOAs) among the respective partners, and the completion of other legal and procedural formalities.
The government had received on Oct 31 a total of 23 bids for 40 offshore blocks on offer for exploration. The provisional awards for 23 blocks covered a total area of about 53,510 square kilometres.
Earlier last month, the government had received only one bid for 23 onshore exploration blocks on offer from Mari Energies and that too from Mari Energies. International and local private-sector partners, like Turkish Petroleum, United Energy, Orient Petroleum, and Fatima Petroleum, are also part of these joint venture partners, underscoring growing international interest in Pakistan’s offshore potential, according to the Petroleum Division.
The exploration attempts by leading international firms like Shell and ExxonMobil in Pakistan’s offshore blocks remained unsuccessful, the latest by a consortium led by ExxonMobil about five years ago in Kekra-1, despite the availability of promising hydrocarbon data.
 
 

Before initiating the process, the Petroleum Division developed a model production sharing agreement (MPSA), a key document integrated into the bid package, to ensure transparency, competitiveness, and investor confidence. In parallel, the Offshore Petroleum Rules were promulgated to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework, paving the way for renewed offshore exploration in Pakistan’s waters.
A recent basin study conducted by the US firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) has indicated a significant yet-to-find potential of hydrocarbons in Pakistan’s offshore basins. Building on this encouraging assessment, the Offshore Bid Round 2025 was launched with a view to offering blocks that allow companies to undertake systematic exploration efforts to test various geological plays across both the Indus and Makran basins.
The Offshore Bid Round 2025 was launched in January this year after a gap of 18 years for the grant of petroleum exploration licenses in 40 Indus and Makan offshore blocks near the jurisdictions of Sindh and Balochistan.
The Petroleum Division said a total of 4,427 work units have been committed for these 23 blocks during Phase-1 of the initial three-year license period, representing an investment of approximately $80 million. The companies have submitted work programmes designed to progressively mitigate the geological risks, and in the event of exploration drilling, investments could reach up to $750m to $1bn, it said.
During Phase-1, the companies will undertake comprehensive geophysical and geological (G&G) studies, including seismic data acquisition, processing, and interpretation, to better define the hydrocarbon potential of Pakistan’s offshore basins. Upon completion of these studies, the Phase-II work programme will be finalised, which will include drilling of exploratory wells in the prospective areas.
The statement said the government strategy to initiate exploration in both the Indus and Makran basins simultaneously paid off, as reflected in the participation and outcome of the bid round. After the completion of G&G work and drilling planning, the ministry will invite global oil majors to join the next phase of offshore exploration, several of whom are already in contact with the government and local companies and are currently evaluating the available data.

The incident occurred when the CTD’s SWAT team was conducting a “targeted operation” in the Kanda Pul area of Mardan district and tried to stop two men on a motorcycle, a statement by the department said.  
The suspects opened fire on the officers, who “narrowly escaped” harm, prompting the team to return fire, killing both assailants. 
The deceased were later identified as Noman, known by the aliases Murad and Ghaznavi, and Sohail, also called Charsi.  
According to the Coun­ter Terrorism Department, they were implicated in the murders of Head Constable Amjad, Cons­table Iqrar Syed, and a bystander named Ehtesham.  
Additional charges of murder and attempted murder were also filed against them. 
Following the exchange of fire, authorities recovered a motorcycle, two pistols with ammunition, and a mobile phone from the scene, the statement said.

The amendments were tabled soon after President Asif Ali Zardari gave his assent to the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment, enacting it into law.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif introduced the Pakistan Army Act (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill 2025, which were passed with a majority vote.
Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar introduced the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2025, which was also passed with a majority vote.
Tarar said the four bills, which were passed in nine minutes without any debate, were meant to harmonise the existing laws with the recently signed 27th Constitutional Amendment Act. “These are not new laws. These are amendments to the present laws,” he said.
 
 

The law minister said the change in the army act was to make the COAS the CDF and to eliminate the post of the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), adding that the CDF’s term would be five years from the date of appointment.
The amendment further said that the tenure of the incumbent army chief would recommence from the date of his notification as the CDF.
The changes also included replacing the position of the CJCSC with the commander of the National Strategic Command (CNSC). They outlined that the prime minister would appoint the CNSC on the recommendation of the army chief from the generals of the army for a three-year tenure.
It added that the prime minister could also reappoint the CNSC or extend his tenure by three years on the army chief’s recommendation.
The changes further said that the prime minister could, on the army chief’s recommendation, authorise an officer appointed as the vice or deputy chief of army staff to exercise and perform the powers and functions vested in the army chief.
The amendments to the air force and navy laws included the elimination of the post of CJCSC from their documents.
Meanwhile, the amendment to the Supreme Court law paved the way for the elimination of the constitutional bench.
The president’s assent to the 27th Constitutional Amendment came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was underway, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar again tabled the bill in the upper house of Parliament today.
COAS Munir’s extension
Field Marshal Munir was appointed the army chief on November 29, 2022. He is the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
In November 2024, the government passed six bills, including three related to the extension of the terms of armed services chiefs, amid deafening protests by the opposition. The three bills were The Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill, 2024, The Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill, 2024 and The Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, 2024.
The salient features of the bills stated that the tenure of all three services chiefs (chief of army staff, chief of air staff and chief of naval staff) will be five years, instead of three. The retirement age bar of 64 years (for generals, air chief marshals and admirals) won’t apply to these three functionaries and extensions, re-appointments for these posts (if any) will also be for five years. However, the tenure of the CJCSC had remained unchanged, at three years.
The government promoted the COAS to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his ‘strategic leadership and decisive role’ in defeating India during the war in May this year.
In September, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah Khan had said that the tenure of the army chief would end in 2027 and a decision whether to extend it or not would be taken at that time.
Earlier this month, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said that there was no need for a notification to specify the army chief’s five-year term, as it was established in Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act.
He had said no new notification was required for the COAS’s five-year term and the section was always a part of legislation.
Section 8C of the Pakistan Army Act outlines the “retirement age and service limits prescribed for a general, under the rules and regulations made under this Act, shall not be applicable to the chief of the army staff, during his tenure of appointment, reappointment or extension, subject to a maximum age of sixty-four (64) years. Throughout such tenure, the chief of the army staff shall continue to serve as general in the Pakistan Army”.</p><small>2025-11-13 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13230719cadba1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954869/all-terrorists-in-wana-attack-afghan-nationals-orchestrated-by-ttp-from-afghanistan-information-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>All terrorists in Wana attack Afghan nationals; orchestrated by TTP from Afghanistan: information ministry</strong></a><br><p>The information ministry on Thursday said that all terrorists involved in the attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan were Afghan citizens.
Security forces confirmed a day ago that they had successfully foiled a terrorist attack on Cadet College Wana, killing all the attackers after an intense clearance operation.
The attackers had targeted the main gate of the college on Monday evening and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy.
Government ministers had linked the attack to Afghanistan and said it was orchestrated from there.
“The attack on Cadet College Wana was planned and controlled from Afghanistan. The attack was planned in Afghanistan by kharji Zahid and the final approval was given by kharji Noorwali Mehsud. All the khwarij who attacked Cadet College Wana were Afghan citizens. The equipment for this attack was provided from Afghanistan, which included American-made weapons,” said the information ministry in a statement today.
The ministry further said that the identities of the “Afghan terrorists” killed in the attack “firmly establish the links of terrorists in their bases in Afghanistan”.
It added that the responsibility for the attack was accepted by an unknown terrorist group, “Jaishul Hind”, on Mehsud’s orders.
Mehsud is the chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorist group.
The information ministry added he wanted to shift the responsibility from the TTP, adding that this was why the “Afghan terrorist” kept mentioning ‘Jaishul Hind’ in the video made during the attack.
“The Afghan Taliban pressurise Fitna al-Khawarij not to accept responsibility of attacks as that leads to pressure from Pakistan and friendly countries.
“The attack on Cadet College Wana was aimed at increasing security concerns in Pakistan, on demand of the Indian agency RAW (Research and Analysis Wing).”
 






‘Clear Afghan involvement’
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had said on Tuesday that it was “clear” that Afghanistan was directly involved in the attack.
Noting that the terrorists had been identified as Afghan, the interior minister said the attackers’ “communication with their people in Afghanistan also continued the entire night”.
Referring to multiple visits carried out by top Pakistani leadership to Afghanistan, Naqvi said: “The foreign minister, deputy prime minister, defence minister — we all have gone numerous times and presented them with evidence and details on how they (terrorists) are being trained in Afghanistan, how they plan and then come here to carry out attacks.”
“We are very clear in this that Afghanistan must stop them under all circumstances. In case of not stopping them, we will have no other option but to deal with the terrorists who are attacking our country,“ he asserted.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had also said that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-11-13 18:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633488-who-is-justice-aminuddin-khan-first-cj-of-newly-formed-fcc' target='_blank'><strong>Who is Justice Aminuddin Khan, first CJ of newly-formed FCC?</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes hours after the 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari and shortly after Supreme Court Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resigned from their offices in protest.
A notification from the law ministry said President Zardari made the appointment under clause (3) of Article 175A read with Article 175C of the Constitution, adding that it would come into effect from the date that Justice Khan took his oath.
The judge will take the oath at the Presidency tomorrow at 10am. The chief justices and judges of superior courts, high-ranking officials have been invited to participate in the oath-taking ceremony
Justice Khan was born in Multan in 1960. A second-generation lawyer, he earned his LL.B from University Law College, Multan, in 1984 and began practice under his father, Khan Sadiq Muhammad Ahsan.
He became an advocate of the Lahore High Court (LHC) in 1987 and of the Supreme Court in 2001. He joined Zafar Law Chambers in Multan in 2001 and worked with the legal firm until he was elevated to the position of a judge in 2011, where he decided civil cases on the Multan and Bahawalpur benches.
He was sworn in as a Supreme Court justice in 2019, taking his oath of office from then-chief justice Asif Saeed Khosa.
He was made the head of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench in November 2024, while ranking fourth in seniority among Supreme Court judges.
Justice Khan has decided thousands of cases pertaining to civil matters and most of his judgments have been upheld by the Supreme Court. During his career, he assisted renowned lawyers like Mian Nisar Ahmed and Umar Ata Bandial.
Sources had told Dawn the FCC would initially comprise six other judges — four from the Supreme Court and two from the high courts — besides the chief justice. The names being discussed for the inaugural composition incl­uded Just­ice Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Musa­rrat Hilali, Justice Aamer Far­ooq, and Justice Baqar Najafi from the SC, while Justice KK Agha of the Sindh High Court and Justice Rozi Khan Bar­rech, the incumbent Chief Justice of Balochistan Hi­gh Court, were being considered from the high courts.
The sources had also said that the initial strength of the FCC would be determined through a Presidential Order, while any subsequent increase in the number of judges would require approval through an Act of Parliament.
Officials at the law ministry confirmed that the President, acting on the advice of the prime minister, would issue the formal appointment orders. They added that under the provisions of the amendment, the President would be constitutionally empowered to make such appointments to the newly-constituted court.
The proposal to establish the Federal Constitutional Court was revived as part of the judicial reforms package incorporated in the 27th Constitutional Amendment Act.
The amendment aimed to rationalise the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and introduce greater efficiency in the adjudication of constitutional questions.
 
 

According to government officials, the creation of the FCC is intended to reduce the Supreme Court’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases, and strengthen the independence and credibility of the judicial system. The concept of a separate constitutional court is not new.
It was first introduced in the Charter of Democracy (CoD) signed by the PPP and the PML-N in 2006.
The CoD envisaged the establishment of a specialised court dedicated solely to constitutional matters, allowing the Supreme Court to focus primarily on its appellate jurisdiction.
The idea resurfaced during discussions on the 26th Const­it­utional Amendment, but was shelved at the time following resistance from the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl and certain other political factions.
Under the current proposal, judges serving in the FCC will retire at the age of 68 years — three years higher than the retirement age for Supreme Court judges, who retire at 65.
The new court will not be housed within the Supreme Court premises. Officials indicated that it is likely to be established in the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) building in Islamabad. In turn, the FSC is expected to be relocated to the third floor of the Islamabad High Court building.
However, sources within the FSC revealed that its judges are unhappy with their abrupt relocation and have raised their concerns before the chief justice of Pakistan.</p><small>2025-11-13 18:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/13225103de435b1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954871/india-inaugurates-new-military-airbase-close-to-china-border-source-says' target='_blank'><strong>India inaugurates new military airbase close to China border, source says</strong></a><br><p>India’s air force chief made the inaugural landing of a military transport aircraft at a new airbase capable of fighter jet operations close to the disputed Himalayan border with China, a defence official said on Thursday.
The move comes amid a thaw in ties between the nuclear-armed neighbours, following a milestone pact last October to ease military tension along their de facto border and a visit this year to China by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Air Chief Marshal AP Singh landed the C-130J aircraft on Wednesday at the Mudh-Nyoma air force station in Ladakh, perched at a height of about 4,000m, added the official, who sought anonymity as the matter is a sensitive one.
The Indian Air Force and the defence ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
The new airbase, the region’s third such key station, is just 30 kilometres from the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China.
“This new airfield in Ladakh, capable of fighter operations, will add a new challenge for both of our adversaries,” retired Air Marshal Sanjeev Kapoor wrote on X, referring to neighbours China and Pakistan.
China has an airfield at a similar height, he added.
 






Mistrust persists between China and India despite the thaw, Indian analysts and officials say, with the Indian Army chief pointing this year to continued heightened troop presence and infrastructure build-up on the border by both sides.
India and China share a poorly demarcated border that stretches 3,800km and has been disputed since the 1950s. They fought a brief but brutal war over it in 1962.
Ties soured after a deadly border clash in 2020, before their 2024 pact brought a thaw and easing of some curbs, allowing resumption of direct flights and two-way visits.</p><small>2025-11-13 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/132102060e6cf58.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954875/newly-enacted-27th-constitutional-amendment-challenged-in-supreme-court' target='_blank'><strong>Newly-enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment challenged in Supreme Court</strong></a><br><p>Lawyer Asad Rahim Khan filed a petition with the Supreme Court (SC) seeking to challenge the recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment, moving the court to declare the amendments unconstitutional and to “take measures” to ensure judicial independence.
The 27th Amendment, signed into law earlier today by President Asif Ali Zardari, was widely criticised by the legal fraternity for abolishing judicial independence through the formation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
SC Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah resigned earlier this evening, in response to the 27th Amendment, which “diminished” the apex court.
Khan’s petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn, requested that the Supreme Court declare Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14 to 43, 45A and B, 46 and 48 of the Constitution (Twenty-seventh Amendment) Act, 2025 illegal and unlawful, as it violated Entry 55 of the Federal Legislative List, read with other provisions of the Constitution.
According to the petition, Entry 55 “ensures a horizontal separation between the legislative and judicial branches” by defining the jurisdiction of the apex court. The petition moved the SC to declare that its jurisdiction cannot be abolished by an act of parliament.
Additionally, Khan moved the SC to “direct the respondent (the Federation of Pakistan) to take such measures as may be required for securing the independence of the judiciary; and such further or better relief as may be appropriate in the facts and circumstances of the case may also be granted”.
“The parenthetical clause (“except for the Supreme Court”) makes it abundantly clear that the Apex Court’s jurisdiction — unlike that of the courts below it — cannot be interfered with, let alone abbreviated, through any kind of legislation, even an amendment to the Constitution,” the petition read.
Noting that the act was passed in haste and an “unconstitutional and procedurally defective manner”, Khan argued that rushing the bills through parliament violated key principles of parliamentary democracy and was neither public nor transparent.
“The act is thus an assault on parliamentary democracy itself, and merits being struck down on this score alone.”
He further argued that the amendment is enabling the “influencing and purging [of] independent-minded Judges of the Supreme Court and the high courts” and stated that a judge’s position depending on the whim of the executive is antithetical to judicial independence.
The petition also argued that the composition of the FCC — a key component of the 27th Amendment — was “equally alarming”, as the chief justice would be appointed by the president on the prime minister’s advice, but without any deliberation or consultation.
“This permits the executive to handpick the de facto highest judicial authority in Pakistan, in direct violation of the principle of judicial independence,” Khan argued.
“The initial cohort of FCC judges is likewise to be appointed solely on executive advice, again without any role for the judiciary or any consultative mechanism. A court constituted entirely at the will of the executive cannot claim independence.”
Senate’s approval
The president’s assent to the legislation came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The house first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.</p><small>2025-11-13 17:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633484-justice-amin-ud-din-khan-appointed-as-constitutional-courts-first-chief-justice' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Aminuddin Khan appointed Constitutional Court's first chief justice</strong></a><br><p>

Both judges had called on Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi in separate letters to summon a full court meeting and judicial conference to hold a debate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In his letter to the president today, Justice Shah assailed the amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan”, which “dismantles the Supreme Court of Pakistan, subjugates the judiciary to executive control, and strikes at the very heart of our constitutional democracy”.
“By fracturing the unity of the nation’s apex court, it has crippled judicial independence and integrity, pushing the country back by decades,” he wrote.
“As history bears witness, such a disfigurement of the constitutional order is unsustainable and will, in time, be reversed - but not before leaving deep institutional scars.”
The judge stated that he had a choice between serving as an SC justice, which he said “undermines the very foundation of the institution one has sworn to protect”, or hand in his resignation.
“Staying on would not only amount to silent acquiescence in a constitutional wrong, but would also mean continuing to sit in a court whose constitutional voice has been muted,” Justice Shah wrote.
“Unlike the 26th Amendment — when the Supreme Court of Pakistan still retained the jurisdiction to examine and answer the constitutional questions — the present amendment has stripped this court of that fundamental and critical jurisdiction and authority.
“Serving in such a truncated and diminished court, I cannot protect the Constitution, nor can I even judicially examine the amendment that has disfigured it,” he stated.
On the other hand, Justice Minallah stated in his letter that when he took the oath of office 11 years ago, he swore to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”.
He wrote: “Prior to the passage of the 27th Amendment, I wrote to the Chief Justice of Pakistan, expressing concern over what its proposed features meant for our constitutional order.
“I need not reproduce the detailed contents of that letter, but suffice it to say that, against a canvas of selective silence and inaction, those fears have now come to be,” he added.
Justice Minallah regretted that the Constitution he swore to uphold was “no more”, adding that he “can think of no greater assault on its memory than to pretend that, as new foundations are now laid, they rest upon anything other than its grave”.
“What is left of it is a mere shadow; one that breathes neither its spirit, nor speaks the words of the people to whom it belongs,” the judge wrote.
“These robes we wear are more than mere ornaments. They are to serve as a reminder of that most noble trust bestowed upon those fortunate enough to don them,” the letter read. “Instead, throughout our history, they have too often stood as symbols of betrayal through silence and complicity alike.”
Justice Minallah is the eldest son of Nasrum Minallah, who was a commissioner during the 1960s and 70s. He is the son-in-law of Justice Safdar Shah, who was part of the bench that convicted and sentenced former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto but wrote a dissenting note against the conviction, for which he faced the wrath of the then-military dictator, General Ziaul Haq.
He joined Pakistan Customs and rose to senior positions, but later resigned and started practising law. Following the sacking of former chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, he joined the lawyers’ movement for the restoration of the judiciary.
However, after Justice Chaudhry’s restoration, he became a critic of the judiciary because of excessive suo motu cases, which led to the pendency of routine cases.
In November 2022, then-CJP Umar Ata Bandial administered the oath to Justice Minallah, Justice Shahid Waheed and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi as the judges of the Supreme Court.
Earlier in the evening, sources told Dawn that the president was expected to administer the oath to the chief justice of the Federal Constitutional Court — the establishment of which would now be realised after the enactment of the 27th Amendment bill — tomorrow at the Presidency.
Former AGP Makhdoom Ali Khan resigns from Law and Justice Commission
Separately, former attorney general of Pakistan Makhdoom Ali Khan tendered his resignation from the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan to CJP Afridi.
“When you sought my consent to be a member of the commission, I accepted without a second thought.
“The Constitution, by then, had been amended for the 26th time. I could see despondence on the once shining faces of promising young lawyers. I continued to believe, however, albeit without cause, that it remained possible to negotiate the bends and avoid a free fall. The realists cautioned that I was out of touch.
“The habits of a lifetime take time to die, however. These made me think that with technique, with finesse and with reason, persuasion will find a way. Advocacy will break through. The institution though battered and holed had not keeled over. And while it was afloat so was hope. It would of course require advocacy beyond ability which was possible given the extraordinary motivation. It always is,” he said.
However, he said the 27th Constitutional Amendment had “sunk that ship”.
He added, “It has scuttled whatever was left of an independent judiciary. That being so, I cannot continue to be a member of an institution erected on the promise to reform the law. No law reform is possible or can be effective without an independent judiciary. To continue in these circumstances would be to perpetuate the worst fraud possible: a fraud on oneself. I can go on but that would serve no purpose … I, therefore, thank you for the opportunity but confess my inability to continue. I resign.”
Senate’s approval
The president’s assent to the legislation came hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on Monday and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate today to consider the latest changes.
The 27th Amendment promised, on paper, to “streamline” governance through new constitutional courts, revived executive magistrates and even a relook at how the armed forces are commanded.
At the heart of the amendment is the creation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters, while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.
 
 

Clause 23 of the amendment stated that the incumbent CJP — Justice Yahya Afridi — would maintain his office until the end of his tenure. Clause 56 of the amendment stated that once incumbent CJP Afridi’s term comes to an end, the future CJP would be the senior-most judge from the chief justices of the FCC and apex court.
