“A temporary ceasefire has been decided between the Pakistani government and the Afghan Taliban regime, with the mutual consent of both parties, for the next 48 hours from 6pm today, at the request of the Taliban.”
“During this period, both sides will make sincere efforts to find a positive solution to this complex but solvable issue through constructive dialogue,” the FO said.
Taliban regime spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said on X that Afghan forces were instructed to respect the ceasefire, “unless any aggression takes place”.
Strikes on Kabul, Kandahar
Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported that the Pakistan armed forces conducted “precision strikes” in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province and capital Kabul.
A statement uploaded on X, quoting security sources, said: “Pakistan Army’s retaliatory action against Afghan Taliban aggression, key hideouts destroyed. Key hideouts of Afghan Taliban successfully targeted by Pakistan Army.
“These precision strikes were carried out in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. As a result of these strikes, Afghan Taliban Battalion Number 4 and Border Brigade Number 6 completely destroyed. Dozens of foreign and Afghan operatives killed.”
The statement added that the Pakistan Army possessed the “full capability to give a strong and complete response to any external aggression”.
 






In a subsequent update, PTV reported, citing security sources, that strikes were conducted in Kabul as well.
“The centre and leadership of Fitna al-Hindustan were targeted in Kabul. The Pakistan Army possesses the full capability to give a befitting response to any aggression,” PTV reported.
Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
The PTV post quoted security sources as saying that the Pakistan Army targeted Afghan Taliban Battalion Headquarters No 4, Battalion 8, and Border Brigade No 5 in Kandahar.
“All these targets were meticulously selected, isolated from civilian populations, and successfully destroyed,” the post read.

Earlier in the day,the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said security forces repulsed an attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 of their members.
According to the ISPR, Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said.
 
 

Today’s fighting is the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following the incident in Kurram last night and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
According to the ISPR, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 injured in the incident that began with Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border. The military’s media affairs wing also said that credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment showed that “more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher”.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself.
The weekend clash took place against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries and the ties seem to have nose-dived with recent increase in hostilities at the border.
On Monday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’ that there were “no ties” between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he had said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister had also said that hostilities between the two sides could resume “at any time”.</p><small>2025-10-15 18:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628745-imran-khan-seeks-parole-to-help-resolve-afghanistan-problem' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan seeks parole to mediate Pakistan-Afghanistan tensions: sister</strong></a><br><p>

Greta was one of 450 people aboard the Global Sumud Flotilla, a humanitarian aid mission involving over 40 vessels which aimed to deliver food, water and medicine to the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s two-year onslaught on the besieged enclave.
The boats were intercepted by the Israeli navy on October 1, with Greta and all other activists being arrested and kept in Israeli custody. She was released and deported to Greece on October 6.
In her interview, Greta recounted her treatment in Israeli custody, which ranged from humiliation, threats of violence and physical beatings.
“She doesn’t want headlines about herself and the torture she says she was subjected to,” Aftonbladet reported.
“That was one of the first things she said on the evening she returned home, at a press conference in Sergels Torg together with several of the other Swedes who participated in the large Global Sumud Flotilla that attempted to bring emergency aid to Gaza.”
Quoting Greta, the report read, “This is not about me or the others from the flotilla. There are thousands of Palestinians, hundreds of whom are children, who are being held without trial right now, and many of them are most likely being tortured.”
“This shows that if Israel, with the whole world watching, can treat a well-known, white person with a Swedish passport this way, just imagine what they do to Palestinians behind closed doors.”
Greta noted that what the flotilla activists went through is “only a small, small part of what Palestinians have experienced” and described bullet holes with bloodstains and messages carved into the cell walls by Palestinian prisoners detained there previously.
The activist recounted the night the flotilla was boarded, mentioning chemical agents employed by Israel and saying “that she will never again be able to look at a starry sky without thinking about drones”.
“It was extremely hot down there. We just sat there. Those who weren’t guarding us walked around the boat, tearing things apart and throwing everything around,” she described.
“After about 20 hours, they arrived in Ashdod, Israel’s largest industrial port, 40 kilometres south of Tel Aviv. A soldier pointed at Greta Thunberg and said, ‘You first, come on!’” the publication wrote.

Greta added that she was not allowed to wear her t-shirt with “Free Palestine” on it and was ordered to change. She put on an orange one with the text “Decolonize” instead.
“And then I put on my frog hat. When I’m about to get off the boat, there are a bunch of police officers waiting for me,” Greta recalled. “They grab me, pull me to the ground, and throw an Israeli flag over me.”
Aftonbladet reported that Greta was dragged to a paved area fenced in with iron fences in a “protracted scene that lasts for over six hours”, according to Greta and several participants in the flotilla.
“It was kind of dystopian,” Greta said. “I saw maybe 50 people sitting in a row on their knees with handcuffs and their foreheads against the ground.
“They dragged me to the opposite side from where the others were sitting, and I had the flag around me the whole time. They hit and kicked me. Then they ripped off my frog hat, threw it on the ground, stomped and kicked it, and kind of threw a tantrum,” she added.
“They moved me very brutally to a corner that I was turned towards. ‘A special place for a special lady’, they said,” Greta explained. “And then they had learned lilla hora (little whore) and ‘Hora Greta’ (whore Greta) in Swedish, which they repeated all the time.”
Greta added that while the Israeli flag was draped around her, guards would attack her if she touched the flag, even if it flapped towards her. She then described being bound “very tightly” with zip ties.
“They took my bag and threw away everything they interpreted as being related to Palestine,” she added. “They took every item and stared into my eyes while slowly cutting them up with a knife, while ten people took selfies.”
The activist also described the moment far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir came to the facility and verbally abused the detainees.
“He shouted, ’You are terrorists. You want to kill Jewish babies.’ Those who shouted back were taken aside and beaten. They were thrown to the ground and beaten,” Greta recalled. “But I could only see it out of the corner of my eye, because every time I lifted my head from the ground, I was kicked by the guard standing next to me.”
She then described a “moving scene” to Aftonbladet: “I needed to go to the bathroom and asked to do so. Then I had to be led through where people were sitting and they saw me. A female member of the Swedish delegation said, ‘We are with you, Greta.’
“Then she was taken aside and assaulted. When I continue through the rows of people sitting there, they say ‘Slay!’” she added, referring to a slang term meaning to do something well.
“They say ‘Slay’ because they know it’s my word. And those who say slay get beaten by the guards. I continue forward and then someone shouts ‘Slaaaay’. And then more and more people join in and shout ‘Slay’, and when everyone is shouting it, they can’t assault everyone,” Greta said.
Greta then described being taken into a building to be searched and undressed, stating that the guards had “no empathy or humanity”.
“There’s a lot I don’t remember. So much is happening at once. You’re in shock. You’re in pain, but you go into a state of trying to stay calm,” she said.
She described being forced into a cleaning closet, where Ben-Gvir hurled abuse at her while the exchange was filmed.
“Then Ben-Gvir and his media team come in and stand there filming, and he says, ’I will personally make sure that you are treated like a terrorist and that you rot in prison. You are Hamas. You are a terrorist. You want to kill Jewish babies’,” Greta described.
“While he is shouting, I sit as calmly as I can and quote UN conventions and say that Israel is not immune and must respect international law. I thought this was being recorded and would be spread to the public, but I still haven’t seen it spread.”
Greta then said she refused to sign papers stating, among other things, that she had entered Israel illegally, Aftonbladet reported, adding that she was then put in a freezing cold prison van, before being transported to Ktzi’ot Prison in the Negev Desert.
“It was mockery, rough handling, and everything was filmed,” she said. “Everything they do is extremely violent. People’s medications were thrown into the trash can in front of their eyes. Heart medication, cancer medication, insulin.”
She also described a large picture covering one wall, showing a bombed-out Gaza and people fleeing, with text in Arabic reading, “The new Gaza” next to a large Israeli flag, Aftonbladet reported.
“In prison, she is held in different cells. Sometimes a cell of around 15 square meters with 13 other prisoners,” the report read. “There are many days—four? Time blurs together; there were no clocks. They receive hardly any food and no clean water during their entire captivity, but are forced to drink from the tap in the toilet sink, where something brown flows. Several became ill.”

Greta told the outlet that she “couldn’t afford to cry” because of dehydration and said that she was locked in an isolated cell filled with insects.
“It was so hot, like 40 degrees. We begged the whole time: Can we have water? Can we have water? In the end, we screamed. The guards walked in front of the bars the whole time, laughing and holding up their water bottles. They threw the bottles with water in them into the trash cans in front of us,” she recounted.
Aftonbladet reported that around 60 people were put in a small cage outdoors, citing several participants of the flotilla, adding that most of them did not have room to sit down.
“When people fainted, we banged on the cages and asked for a doctor. Then the guards came and said, ‘We’re going to gas you’,” Greta outlined. “It was standard for them to say that. They held up a gas cylinder and threatened to press it against us.
“During the nights, guards regularly came by and shook the bars, shining flashlights, and several times a night they came in and forced everyone to stand up,” she added.
The activist told the Swedish outlet that Stockholm did not do anything to ensure better conditions for Swedish prisoners and that there was no access to legal representation except for five minutes with a lawyer at a port.
“We were together and told them about the treatment we received. About the lack of food, water, about the abuse. The torture. We showed them the physical injuries we had — bruises and scratches,” she said.
“We gave them all our contact details — I gave them my father’s number and the number of our contact in the organisation. We were clear: everything we say now must be released to the media.”
Greta told Aftonbladet that three people from the Swedish embassy made contact with her and her fellow Swedes, but only to tell them that they had consular access.
“We said over and over again: we need water. And they saw that the guards had water bottles,” she recounted. The embassy staff said: ’We’ll make a note of that.’ One of us, Vincent, said: ’Next time we meet you, you must bring water.’“
When the embassy staff returned two days later, Greta said they did not bring any water, “except for a small bottle of their own that was half empty”.
“Vincent, who was in the worst shape, got to drink it,” she told Aftonbladet. “We kept asking the guards, ‘Can we have some water?’ but they just walked around with their water bottles and didn’t answer.”
Aftonbladet reported: “Several participants reported that a female activist became enraged and kicked the trash can where the guards had thrown their water bottles. Bottles spilled onto the floor, and Greta and the others threw themselves on the floor and hurried to open the bottles and drink the water left behind by the guards.”
Greta added that the embassy staff saw this but left the prison anyway.

Pramedasa Stadium in Colombo.
Chasing a revised target of 113 to win after earlier rains had reduced the match to 31 overs per side, Pakistan were 34-0 in 6.4 overs when rains returned to end any chance of the match being completed.
Fatima Sana shone with the ball earlier as England could only make 133-9 after being put into bat. The Pakistan skipper ended with figures of 4-27 that included three of the English top-order batters including their captain Nat Sciver-Brunt.
England’s innings was interupted in the 25th over when rains first arrived in the Sri Lankan capital before the game resumed several hours later.
Having lost their first three matches at the tournament, Pakistan needed a win to boost their chances of reaching the semi-finals and they looked a team on a mission.
Just in the second over of the first innings, Diana Baig struck after Tammy Bemaunt left one that jagged back in and took her off stump — a picture-perfect wicket for Pakistan’s front-line pacer after a no-ball earlier in the over.
Fatima followed it up with an even better delivery — pegging back Amy Jones’ middle stump with one that seamed back in after pitching in the corridor of uncertainty.
The Pakistani skipper followed it up with another booming inswinger to get her opposite number Nat Sciver-Brunt by making a mess of her stumps.
 






Heather Knight was the next to follow in the same over as England slumped to 39-4 in just the seventh over.
The English side were in all sorts of trouble at the end of the powerplay — losing half their side for just 54 led by Fatima’s three scalps.
Alice Capsey got a chance in the 18th over when Muneeba Ali dropped a regulation catch inside the circle at square-leg off the bowling of Rameen Shamim.
However, Rameen eventually got her scalp five overs later when Capsey missed a sweep and was adjudged lbw on a ball that — according to ball-tracking — would have hit the leg-stump.
Rain came to the rescue of the English batters as their innings was teetering along at 79-7 at the halfway mark of the innings.
Pakistan were by far the happier side going into the rain-induced break, but memories of Beth Mooney’s hundred that rescued Australia back from the brink of disaster after being 76-7 must have been on the minds of Fatima’s charges.
After play resumed with the innings curtailed to 31 overs per side, England’s Charlie Dean hit a few boundaries to help her side cross the 100-run mark before falling to Fatima.
Pakistan’s openers got the innings going with a boundary in the very first over as Muneeba Ali sent the ball to the fence through point.
Omaima Sohail returning to the side hit a couple of boundaries through the covers before rain stopped play in just the seventh over of the innings.
The players also observed a minute of silence in remembrance of squad member Shawaal Zulfiqar’s father, who passed away on Monday.
 






Last week‘s defeat against Australia left their knockout hopes hanging by a thread as Pakistan registered three losses on the trot and needed a win today to keep their campaign alive.
Pakistan had made two changes in their side, with Aliya Riaz and Omaima Sohail back in the team.
Speaking at the toss, Fatima said: “Pitch looks like it will spin, and we will want to take advantage. The spinners will want to take advantage … we want to bat longer, build partnerships. We need to finish off games.”
Pakistan women’s all-rounder Syed Aroob Shah said on Tuesday that the team was looking to “perform better with the bat” ahead of the England encounter.
Squad member Shawaal would be continuing with the squad after her father passed away in Sialkot, the Pakistan Cricket Board said on the same day.</p><small>2025-10-15 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15164031c6ad39c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949102/coas-munir-calls-on-president-zardari-discusses-internal-and-external-security' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir calls on President Zardari, discusses internal and external security</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir called on President Asif Ali Zardari at the Presidency on Wednesday, where both discussed internal and external security threats.
The meeting comes in the wake of escalating border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, with security forces repelling an attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border this morning and killing 15 to 20 fighters, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
Today’s clash, the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, follows the incident in Kurram on Tuesday night and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
According to a statement from the President’s Secretariat, Field Marshal Munir briefed the president on Pakistan’s overall internal and external security landscape.
“He (army chief) also apprised the president of the recent security situation arising from the aggressive and provocative actions of the Afghan Taliban regime, as well as the measured and befitting response by the Armed Forces of Pakistan,” the statement read.
It added that the president reaffirmed that Pakistan will defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs and expressed full confidence in the “strength, valour, capacity, and preparedness of Pakistan’s Armed Forces”.
President Zardari “lauded their (armed forces) vigilance and professionalism in defending the nation’s frontiers and in swiftly repelling cross-border attacks along the Afghan border”, the statement concluded.
 






President Zardari later met a delegation led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and reviewed matters of national significance, including the prevailing political and security situation, and recent regional as well as international developments affecting Pakistan’s strategic and economic interests.
PM Shehbaz apprised the president of his recent visits to Egypt and Malaysia, including his engagements with international leaders and efforts for peace in Gaza.
“President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif also held a one-on-one discussion, during which they exchanged views on key national priorities and the overall direction of government policies. Both leaders agreed to continue political consultations on matters of national importance,” a statement from the PPP said.
 






According to the ISPR, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 injured in the weekend skirmishes which began with the Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border.
The military’s media affairs wing also said that credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment showed that “more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher”.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself.
The weekend clash took place against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.</p><small>2025-10-15 17:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15200603b8e6e10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949121/cop-shot-dead-while-guarding-polio-team-in-kps-nowshera-police' target='_blank'><strong>Cop shot dead while guarding polio team in KP’s Nowshera: police</strong></a><br><p>A police constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district on Wednesday, police said.
The attack comes a day after a Levies constable was shot dead while guarding a polio team in the province’s Swat district.  The government launched a nationwide polio eradication campaign earlier this week, aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children. A special order was issued for the drive, with the deployment of 285 police personnel across the country to provide security to the vaccination teams.
A statement shared with Dawn.com by Nowshera police spokesperson Turk Ali Shah said that the constable, identified as  Maqsood, was killed on the spot when assailants opened fire on him. However, he managed to protect the polio workers he was accompanying.
“The attack took place within the jurisdiction of the Nizampur police station,” the statement said. “Following the incident, security for polio teams across the area was tightened, while the campaign in the affected locality was suspended.”
It added that following the attack, Regional Police Officer (RPO) Mardan Jawad Qamar and District Police Officer (DPO) Nowshera Ahmed Shah visited the site and reviewed the situation.
“A heavy contingent of police reached the area soon after the incident, cordoned it off, and launched a search operation to trace the attackers,” the statement added.
Law enforcement agencies are making “full efforts” to arrest those involved, it said.
The statement further added that the funeral prayer for the martyred constable was offered with official honours at the Police Lines, Nowshera.
“The ceremony was attended by police and army officers, political and social figures, and a large number of locals.
“The body of the martyred officer was sent to his native place, Khushgi Bala, “where the martyr will be buried with full official honours,” it added.
Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP.
Data from September showed that the number of vaccine refusals in KP dropped in the most recent immunisation drive. However, in some areas, such as Lowi Mamund tehsil, residents announced a boycott of the drive.
In May, a policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was martyred in a gun attack by unidentified assailants in Balochistan’s Noshki district, while another was killed in KP’s Bajaur district in February.
Meanwhile, in August, two more polio cases were reported in KP, bringing the national tally to 23 this year.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) had previously claimed similar attacks on polio teams, falsely portraying the inoculation campaigns as a Western conspiracy to sterilise children.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts.</p><small>2025-10-15 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15215045224ed4f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949108/fact-check-viral-video-does-not-show-pakistani-tank-captured-by-afghan-taliban-amid-recent-conflict' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video does not show Pakistani tank captured by Afghan Taliban amid recent conflict</strong></a><br><p>Posts from Afghan media outlets and users on social media platform X on Wednesday shared a video allegedly showing a Pakistani tank captured by the Afghan Taliban. However, the tank in the clip is not Pakistani.
On Sunday, fierce border clashes between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban resulted in the martyrdom of 23 troops and left over 200 Taliban fighters dead, including a number of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan terrorists. Both nations claimed to have destroyed the border posts of the other side.
On Tuesday, fighting flared up again between the neighbours in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The next day, the third major skirmish also took place, with the Pakistani security forces saying an attack by the Afghan Taliban was repulsed in Spin Boldak, killing about 15-20 Taliban fighters.
Meanwhile, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid said in a social media post that the Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province. Mujahid claimed that more than 12 civilians were killed and over 100 were injured in the attacks carried out by Pakistani forces with the use of “light and heavy weapons”.
Today, Indian journalist Sidhant Sibal, assistant editor of foreign affairs at Indian media outlet WION, shared a video on X of a tank being driven.
The post’s caption read: “Islamic Emirate government releases videos of Afghan forces capturing Pakistani weapons and tanks. Pakistan launched an attack in the border areas of Afghanistan in the last 24 hrs, Afghan side has said.”
The post gained 15,100 views, but was deleted after a few hours.
The same video with a similar claim was shared by Mujahid as well, with the following caption: “In retaliatory operations, multiple Pakistani aggressor soldiers were killed, their posts and centres were captured, weapons and tanks fell into the hands of Afghan forces, and most of their military installations were destroyed. However, the mujahideen, with high spirits, are ready to defend their homeland, sanctuaries, and people.”
The post gained 247,800 views.
The video and claim were also shared by state-owned Afghan television channel RTA Pashto with the caption: “In Spin Boldak, the enemy’s captured tank!”.
It also shared a picture of the very same tank in the video.
“Be victorious,“ said the caption of the post, which gained 12,000 views. The same video and claim were also shared by the media outlet’s English account on X.
Afghan digital media outlet Zawia News also shared the same video with the caption: “The Taliban claims that in the morning battle in Spin Boldak, in addition to inflicting casualties on the Pakistani side, they have also captured posts, weapons, and a tank from them. Due to the firing from the Pakistani side, civilian people and traders have also suffered casualties as well as financial losses.”
The post gained 7,000 views.
The video with a similar claim was further shared by an Indian propaganda account on X with the caption: “Big! The Islamic Emirate govt releases videos showing Afghan forces capturing Pakistani weapons and tanks”.
The video gained 77,000 views.
The video was widely shared by different Afghan and Indian users on X as can be seen here, here, here, here and here, collectively gaining more than 85,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter.
It was observed that some users in the comments of the posts contested the claims and said the video showed an Afghan T-62 tank.
 


As per the Tank Encyclopedia, a voluntary online database of armoured vehicles, the T-62 is a Soviet main battle tank introduced in 1961 as a successor to the T-55. It features a distinctive 115 millimetre smoothbore gun, a low-profile turret, recognisable by the fume extractor positioned midway on its barrel.
It was also used by the Soviet army in Afghanistan and later by the Afghan forces.
Comparing the tank seen in the video with reference images of the T-62 on the website shows that both feature a similar gap between the fourth and fifth road wheels.
The placement of the fume extractor in the middle of the barrel can also be seen in both images, distinguishing it from similar tanks such as the T-55, which features the extractor closer to the muzzle.
 


A keyword search to confirm whether or not the Afghan Taliban used the T-62 tank showed that according to The International Institute for Strategic Studies, the Afghan Taliban possess several T-62 tanks, which they inherited from the Soviet era and the former Afghan National Army. Many of these were left behind after decades of conflict and later refurbished for limited operational use or display.
A June 23, 2021, article on Dutch open-source intelligence defence analysis website Oryx titled: “Disaster at hand: documenting Afghan military equipment losses since June 2021 until August 14, 2021,” also reported that five T-62 tanks were captured from the former Afghan forces by the Taliban.
A February 10, 2025, article by Militarnyi, a Ukrainian media website focused on military and defence issue, titled: “Afghanistan begins restoring M114 Howitzers,” also reported that the Afghan Taliban had restored T-62 tanks.
An image search for pictures of Afghan Taliban using the tank yielded a June 30, 2022, X post, from an account describing itself as being “focused on military history of Afghanistan”, with the following caption: “The Taliban reactivated several T-62 and T-55 tanks in Kunduz. They’re in service of the 217 Omari Corps.”
The post shared images of Afghan Taliban members riding the tank.
 






Furthermore, an Oct 13, 2025, YouTube video was also found by Indonesian news outlet Tribun Jateng that showed the Afghan Taliban transporting their T-62 amid the current tension with Pakistan.
 


Meanwhile, neither a keyword search yielded any mainstream media reports on Pakistan having or using T-62 tanks nor did an image search led to any pictures of the tank being used by the Pakistani military.
Contacted for comment, Dawn.com news editor Ali Osman not only confirmed that the tank in the viral video was a T-62 tank, he also said that it was never inducted into the Pakistan Army.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows a Pakistani tank captured by the Afghan Taliban amid their recent conflict is false. The tank shown is the T-62, which does not belong to Pakistan and continues to be used by Afghanistan.

This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.</p><small>2025-10-15 16:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/152133248327e5f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949123/imran-khan-has-offered-to-resolve-afghanistan-problem-if-freed-on-parole-ptis-barrister-gohar' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan has offered to ‘resolve Afghanistan problem’ if freed on parole: PTI’s Barrister Gohar</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said on Wednesday that former prime minister Imran Khan has offered to resolve the recent hostilities between Pakistan and Afghanistan and other issues if he is released on parole.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9 protests. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady.
 
 

Meanwhile, lingering tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan over cross-border terrorism broke out into outright fighting and skirmishes over the weekend that left several dead and injured on both sides. A temporary ceasefire was announced today after three days of fighting.
Addressing a press conference outside Adiala Jail after a meeting with Imran, Barrister Gohar said: “Today, Imran has sent this message: ‘I offer you people that release me on parole and I will solve the Afghanistan problem for you.’”
The same was mentioned a little earlier by Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who said the PTI founder was pained by the repatriation of Afghan refugees in haste after Pakistan hosted them for decades.
As per Noreen, Imran said it was the job of politicians to achieve peace and had offered to play his part in the endeavour if he was released on parole.
 






“They should think because the conditions of Pakistan have become such that three million people have left the country, multi-national companies are leaving the country, and there is no foreign investment in Pakistan. He [Imran] says there is a need for peace and that only comes with political stability,” she said.
However, expressing doubt, Imran’s sister said her brother would never be taken up on his offer.
A message posted on Imran’s X account, which is not controlled by him, asserted that all relevant stakeholders should be taken on board when formulating a policy against terrorism, be it local tribes in the province, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, the federal government, or the Afghan government.
“The issue of terrorism cannot be solved without dialogue with the Afghan government,” the message had said. The PTI founder then directed the new KP government to talk to relevant stakeholders and formulate an effective and comprehensive strategy against terrorism to ensure long-term peace in the province.</p><small>2025-10-15 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/151549184ced292.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949076/26th-amendment-case-justice-ayesha-asks-whether-article-191a-means-full-court-cannot-be-formed' target='_blank'><strong>26th Amendment case: Justice Ayesha asks whether Article 191A means full court cannot be formed</strong></a><br><p>Justice Ayesha Malik wondered on Wednesday whether Article 191A of the Constitution meant that a full court could no longer be formed as the Supreme Court’s (SC) Constitutional Bench (CB) heard petitions against the 26th Amendment.
Article 191A was an addition to the Constitution made under the 26th Amendment to form constitutional benches in the Supreme Court to specifically deal with cases pertaining to constitutional matters, with its judges nominated by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
The Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence.
The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi, also a former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president, continued his arguments for the fourth consecutive hearing today. The hearing was adjourned till October 20 (Monday).
 


Thus far, Zuberi, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA)’s counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioner Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed have presented their arguments.
They have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
Today’s hearing
At the outset of the hearing, petitioner Advocate Akram Sheikh brought up the matter of a “good judicial environment”.
At this, Justice Mandokhail, referring to his exchange with Justice Ayesha yesterday, said: “What happened yesterday should not have happened.”
 
 

Sheikh also urged the bench to fix a duration for lawyers to present their arguments, at which Justice Aminuddin noted that time restrictions applied to everyone.
Assuring the bench that he would conclude his arguments today, Zuberi said he would cite past court orders that define the difference between a bench and a full court.
Justice Hilali then asked whether judges will have to stop calling a full court a bench, to which Zuberi replied in the affirmative. Citing several rulings, the lawyer said constituting benches was the Practice and Procedure Committee’s power.
Zuberi reiterated that he was requesting a full court, adding, “You can [only] form a bench.”
Justice Mazhar noted that the verdicts cited by Zuberi were from before the 26th Amendment was passed, when Article 191, under which the CB was formed, was not present.
Justice Mazhar said, “The Constitutional Bench can hear the case of the 26th Amendment. If needed, all judges of the Constitutional Bench can be included.
“But you are saying that so and so judges should be part of it, and not the others, so this is strange,” he added.
Zuberi then replied that there were no restrictions on the CB forwarding the matter to the CJP. Justice Aminuddin remarked, “It is one thing to refer a matter to the chief justice, and another to pass a judicial order.”
Zuberi was then told to read out Clauses 3 and 5 of the Constitution’s Article 191A. Justice Ayesha asked, “Does any rule prevent this bench from issuing a judicial order to form a full court? What is stopping us from ordering the Judicial Commission to nominate all judges as a judge of the Constitutional Bench?
“Are we saying that the Judicial Commission ranks above the Supreme Court?” she asked.
 
 

At this, Justice Mandokhail observed that the SC could reverse any unconstitutional decision made by the JCP. “I acknowledge that there is no bar on the JCP to nominate all judges as part of the Constitutional Bench,” he said.
Here, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “Constitutional will be read as it is written here; interpretations of one’s choice cannot be made.”
Justice Mazhar then said he agreed with Justice Ayesha’s interpretation of Article 191A.
Addressing Zuberi, he said, “Now, your arguments will change … Let’s suppose the Judicial Commission nominates all judges as part of the Constitutional Bench, now who will form a full court? According to you, the [Practice and Procedure] Committee has the power to only form benches.”
Justice Mazhar asked whether the CB should form a full court itself or send the matter to the JCP, to which Zuberi replied that the matter should be sent to the CJP. Justice Mazhar remarked that Zuberi’s argument was over then. Zuberi contended that the top judge could constitute a full court if he was the CB’s head.
At one point during the hearing, Justice Rizvi asked whether there had been examples of other countries, where CBs had existed for a long time, of sending constitutional matters to regular benches. Zuberi replied that he was not aware of any such case, but argued that South Africa’s supreme court could hear appeals of decisions made by its constitutional court.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail pointed out that in India, the chief justice was given the authority to form CBs, but the situation in Pakistan was different, as the CJP did not have that power. Justice Aminuddin noted that Zuberi wanted a 16-member bench rather than a full court.
Justice Ayesha then remarked, “Does Article 191A mean that a full court can never convene now? Can decisions of a larger bench no longer be overturned?”
“Our case is exactly this,” Zuberi said, at which Justice Ayesha sought arguments from him on his request to form a pre-Amendment full court bench. Justice Afghan questioned what would happen if all judges could not be nominated for the CB in the JCP’s voting process, even if the current bench orders the commission to do so.
“Can we influence this voting process? Can we stop the voting process through a judicial order?” he asked. Zuberi replied that the CB could still pass the directives, and it was the JCP’s authority to decide who could be included in the CB.
Here, Justice Mandokhail recalled, “The committee requested the Judicial Commission once or twice to give us more judges, [but] there was an objection in the Commission that not to take any judge’s name, rather specify the number of them.”
Justice Aminuddin observed that as the CB head, it was his “privilege” to suggest names of judges to the JCP for the CB. At one point, Justice Hilali remarked that the full court matter could only be sent to the chief justice, as the JCP could nominate the rest of the CB judges, but it could not include other judges in the CB.
During the hearing, Justice Aminuddin also stated that the SC currently had a total capacity of 34 judges.
Justice Hilali remarked, “If we go back to before the 26th Amendment and want the chief justice to form a full court, then the chief justice (Yahya Afridi) is a beneficiary of the 26th Amendment. Then, [senior puisne judge] Justice Mansoor [Ali Shah] is an affected party of the 26th Amendment. Does this mean that the matter will again come back to Justice Aminuddin then?”
 
 

Zuberi replied that it would be the chief justice’s discretion and he could not “dictate” the matter. “I cannot have a bench of my choice formed. I am only saying that this is an important case of this country; the collective wisdom of all the judges should be present.”
The ex-SCBA president argued that while the laws stated that the CB will hear constitutional matters, nowhere was it written that a full court cannot hear those. He added that neither was the full court’s jurisdiction taken away through Clauses 5 and 8 of Article 191A, nor was its authority to pass judicial orders limited.
Here, Justice Mandokhail asked the lawyer whether the CB could consider the Amendment in the matter of challenging it or not. Zuberi responded that the judges could and that he had no objection to it.
Justice Mazhar indirectly recalled an objection raised in a previous hearing by a lawyer who urged the court to ignore the 26th Amendment. “I have not said so. You can consider it. It is a part of the Constitution; hence, we are challenging it,” Zuberi replied.
Justice Hilali wondered whether the current CB could issue orders in the capacity of the Supreme Court. Upon Zuberi saying that it can do so, Justice Mandokhail observed, “You are saying two different things […] On the one hand, you are saying that we can hear the case, but on the other, you are saying that those judges brought under the 26th Amendment cannot.”
At one point, Justice Hilali asked Zuberi whether he had challenged only the amendments related to the judiciary.
The lawyer replied in the negative, detailing that he had also challenged the tweaks pertaining to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). An amendment made to Article 215 allows the chief election commissioner (CEC) and an ECP member to continue to hold office until his successor enters upon the office”, notwithstanding the expiration of his term.
 
 

Justice Mandokhail pointed out the amendments related to the right to a clean environment and riba, asking if those had been contested as well in the petition. Zuberi responded in the negative.
However, he added, “I have also challenged the procedure through which the Amendment was passed. Our main issue is the independence of the judiciary.”
Zuberi then concluded his arguments. Subsequently, the hearing was adjourned till Monday.</p><small>2025-10-15 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628750-pakistan-passport-remains-fourth-weakest-in-global-index-for-fifth-year' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan passport remains fourth weakest in global index for fifth year</strong></a><br><p>

Left-arm spinner Noman Ali was South Africa’s chief tormentor as Pakistan won a gripping first Test by 93 runs at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium.
Set a daunting 277-run target for victory, the visitors and World Test champions were bowled out for 183 on day four.
Speaking at the post-match press conference, skipper Shan said: “The message is this — we are playing good cricket against quality oppostions.
“But at the same time, the challenge is that we need to consistently perform and win matches against top teams.”
He added that talk regarding the first and second divisions of teams in Test cricket would become moot as a result.
 


Shan also said that mistakes were made, and although there was room to work around them in home conditions, there might not be similar chances in away conditions.
South African left-armer Senuran Muthusamy took 11-174 in the match.
Pakistan made 378 in their first innings, with South Africa scoring 269 in reply.
On a deteriorating surface, the hosts collapsed in their second innings to 167, but it proved enough.
Player-of-the-match Noman finished with 4-79 and 10-191 in the match for his third haul of ten wickets or more in Tests with his left-arm spin.
As Noman continued to play the main character, bamboozling South African batters on an abrasive pitch in the first Test, Shaheen Shah Afridi keenly waited for his turn.
It finally arrived on the fourth day of the contest after Pakistan’s pace spearhead had bowled in the earlier stages of the match, but for no real avail.
However, on the match’s penultimate morning, when the left-armer’s length delivery darted into South African top-order batter Tony de Dorzi’s pads to trap the southpaw lbw, it was evident that Shaheen was keen to take the centre stage.
The lanky pacer went on to take three more wickets to blow away the South African tail and finished with figures of 4-33.
Shan was all praise for the left-arm pacer, saying: “He showed why he is counted amongst the top bowlers of the world today with his performance.”
The victory gives Pakistan an ideal start to the World Test Championship, having come last in the previous edition.
The second and final Test starts in Rawalpindi from Monday.
“The spinners came into play, reverse swing helped the bowlers do their job today, and the batters did well enough, but we still have a lot of challenges in the middle order,” said Shan.
“We lost 11-37 over the course of two innings, which is not good; we must overcome that.”
‘First innings deficit was crucial’: South Africa skipper
The defeat broke South Africa’s sequence of ten straight Test wins, culminating in the WTC title in June this year when they beat Australia at Lord’s.
Skipper Aiden Markram said the first-innings deficit of 109 was crucial.
“They (Pakistan) had a really good partnership in the first innings when we had them five wickets down,” he said Markram of a Mohammad Rizwan-Salman Agha stand of 163 runs for the sixth wicket.
“We probably could have scored a few more runs in the first innings but I am proud of the way we fought.
“But we need to clean up our game and come back better in the next match.”
He added that the toss was not that crucial to the final result.
Brevis took the fight to the Pakistan spinners in the morning and had reached an aggressive career-best 54, with six fours and two sixes, when Noman bowled him with a sharply turning delivery.
Pakistan had struck in the first over of the day through fast bowler Shaheen, who trapped Tony de Zorzi for 16 without any addition to the overnight total of 51-2.
Tristan Stubbs struggled to cope with the sharp turn and was on two when a premeditated reverse sweep off Noman safely landed in Salman Agha’s hands.
Brevis reached his second Test half-century with a six off Noman before becoming the spinner’s fourth victim.
Opener Rickleton’s dogged resistance was broken by Sajid just before lunch for a gritty 45.

The land belongs to the Malir Development Authority (MDA). It comprises 3,117 houses, including those of 200 to 250 Pakistani families. Around 15,680 Afghan nationals were previously residing in the camp. Of them, 14,296 have returned to Afghanistan, while the remaining 1,384 are still living there and are being repatriated in phases.
West Zone Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Irfan Ali Baloch told Dawn.com, “The government-owned land was spread over 200 acres, with 3,000 houses built to accommodate Afghans.”
DIG Baloch further said he had written a letter to police authorities to set up a special committee comprising representatives of the city administration, police and other relevant institutions to prevent illegal occupation of the vacated government land.
“It was the biggest camp of displaced Afghans where an estimated 30,000 Afghans used to live,” he said.
“They were repatriated to their home country recently in three phases as per the policy of the federal government. However, 2,000 Afghans are still living there.”
DIG Baloch said he talked with Karachi’s commissioner, and the operation was launched to demolish the houses to prevent the land mafia from occupying them. He added that structures built over 20 acres were demolished today.
“The operation would continue for the next three to four days,” DIG Baloch said.
In October 2023, the government gave an ultimatum to all undocumented immigrants to leave Pakistan by the end of that month or risk imprisonment and deportation to their respective countries.
The following month, the government initiated a nationwide operation to deport illegal foreign nationals, the majority of whom were Afghans, after the deadline to voluntarily leave the country had expired.
In March of the following year, Pakistan began preparations to launch the second phase of its repatriation drive to send nearly one million ‘documented’ Afghans back to their homeland, with directives to district authorities and police to map and collect data of their whereabouts across the country.
This year, March 31 was officially set as the deadline for Afghan Citizen Card holders to leave Pakistan voluntarily, with a renewed warning by the interior ministry that mass deportations would commence afterwards.</p><small>2025-10-15 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15193915e54b11e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949118/fbr-again-extends-deadline-for-filing-income-tax-returns-to-oct-31' target='_blank'><strong>FBR again extends deadline for filing income tax returns to Oct 31</strong></a><br><p>The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) on Wednesday announced that the October 15 deadline for filing income tax returns will now be extended to October 31.
A notification issued by the revenue board read that the deadline was being extended following requests from trade bodies and tax bar associations, and was being implemented as per Section 214A of the 2001 Income Tax Ordinance.
“The Federal Board of Revenue is pleased to communicate that the date of filing of Income Tax Return for Tax Year 2025, for the persons who were required to file their returns by September 30, 2025 and was extended up to October 15th, 2025 … is further extended to October 31, 2025, in view of the requests from various trade bodies and tax bar associations,” the notification read.
 






This is the second time the FBR has extended the deadline for filing income tax returns despite an earlier stance that it would not do so, signalling that the tax authority yielded to pressure from various quarters and walked back on its firm commitment.
At midnight on September 30, the initial deadline for filing tax returns for tax year 2025, the FBR announced that it was extending the deadline to October 15.

Sharaa, who once headed the Syrian branch of al Qaeda and who toppled predecessor Bashar al-Assad, a close Russian ally, late last year, was speaking at the start of Kremlin talks with Putin, his first visit to Russia since coming to power.
“There are bilateral relations and shared interests that bind us with Russia, and we respect all agreements made with it. We are working on redefining the nature of relations with Russia,” Sharaa, who was speaking in Arabic, told Putin.
Putin told him that Moscow was ready to do all it could to act on what he called “many interesting and useful beginnings” that had already been discussed between the two sides when it came to renewing relations.
The Kremlin chief also congratulated Sharaa on the fact that parliamentary elections were held earlier this month in Syria.

“I believe that this is a great success for you, because it leads to the consolidation of society, and despite the fact that Syria is currently going through difficult times, it will nevertheless strengthen ties and cooperation between all political forces in Syria,” said Putin.
Russian military bases
The Kremlin said before the talks that the fate of Russia’s two main bases in Syria — the Hmeimim air base in Syria’s Latakia province, and its naval facility at Tartous on the coast — would be discussed.
Russia, which has economic and energy-related interests in Syria that it also wants to secure, has a military presence at Qamishli airport —in the northeast near the borders of Turkey and Iraq — as well.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday that Moscow believed Damascus wanted the military bases to stay and spoke about an idea of also using them as logistics hubs to get aid to Africa by sea and air.
Syrian officials are seeking guarantees that Russia will not help rearm remnants of Assad’s forces, a Syrian source said before the talks.
Sharaa is hoping that Russia might also help rebuild the Syrian army, the same source said.
Sensitive visit
Sharaa’s visit is sensitive. Russia used its military muscle to back Assad for years against Syrian rebels who came to power in December last year, led by Sharaa. Moscow then granted asylum to Assad and his family when they fled the country.

The Assads now live discreetly in Moscow, according to Russian media.
Sharaa will use the talks to formally request that Moscow hand over Assad to face trial over alleged crimes against Syrians, two Syrian sources told Reuters.
Russia prides itself on being able to protect its foreign allies and is not likely to agree to hand over Assad to Damascus. Lavrov said on Monday that Russia had given Assad refuge because his life had been under threat.
Sharaa, who is hoping to secure economic concessions from Russia, including the resumption of wheat supplies on favourable terms and compensation for war damage, is expected as well to press for Moscow’s backing to resist Israeli demands for a wider demilitarised zone in southern Syria.
He may also raise the issue of redeploying Russian military police as a guarantor against further Israeli encroachments, one of the two sources said.
The Kremlin said it did not expect Putin and Sharaa to hold a news conference after their talks.</p><small>2025-10-15 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15170744051d67c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949109/punjab-minister-rejects-hrcps-claims-of-hiding-information-following-operation-against-tlp' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab minister rejects HRCP’s claims of ‘hiding information’ following operation against TLP</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Information Minister Azma Bukhari on Wednesday rejected the claims made by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) regarding the government “concealing information” about the Muridke operation carried out to disperse Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan’s (TLP) march they claimed was in solidarity for Palestinians.
The TLP began protests in Lahore on Oct 9, announcing a march to the US embassy in Islamabad to oppose the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas after two years of conflict in Gaza. The demonstrations quickly turned violent, with police using baton charges and tear gas against stone-pelting protesters.
The following day, clashes in Lahore’s Shahdara area left at least 40 officers injured, while the TLP claimed over 10 workers were killed. As the group attempted to move towards Islamabad, Punjab Rangers and police from five districts were deployed to Muridke, where trenches were dug and an operation launched to disperse them.
Regarding the Mudrike Operation and the violence that broke out between police and TLP protestors, the HRCP voiced “deep concern” not only over the violence but also over what it described as a “lack of transparency and credible, independent information surrounding the operation.”
In response to the statement, Bukhari pointed out that the government had made sincere efforts to dissuade the TLP from marching towards the US Embassy in Islamabad, but the group refused to cooperate.
“We carried out the operation to maintain a law and order situation, as the march had blocked all main routes, including the GT Road, to traffic,” she told Dawn.com.
The minister said the HRCP itself had acknowledged in the statement regarding the TLP’s involvement in hate speech and other human rights violations.
“We tried not to reach the point of carrying out an operation and avoid this situation, but the extremists did not believe in human rights,“ she said.
Bukhari alleged that TLP leaders and activists had issued threats of “dire consequences in their speeches” and opened fire on law enforcement agencies (LEAs), resulting in the deaths of some policemen.
“The Palestinians, including Hamas, have accepted the peace agreement, but the TLP chose to march towards the American Embassy with ulterior motives.”
She said that the operation was still underway.
“The government would provide all the information after completion of the operation,” Bukhari added.</p><small>2025-10-15 14:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15181636575b211.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949099/governor-kundi-administers-oath-to-ptis-sohail-afridi-as-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>Governor Kundi administers oath to PTI’s Sohail Afridi as KP CM</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi administered the oath to PTI MPA Sohail Afridi as the province’s chief minister on Wednesday.

Afridi was elected the new KP chief executive on Monday during an assembly session marred by the opposition’s walkout and amid the prevailing uncertainty regarding the resignation of outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur.
 
 

Declaring Afridi’s election constitutional, Peshawar High Court (PHC) Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah had orderered Kundi a day ago to administer the oath by 4pm today or else the provincial assembly speaker would perform the ceremony the same day under Article 255(2) of the Constitution.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had subsequently also asked Kundi to fulfil his “constitutional and legal responsibility” in accordance with the high court’s order and return to his province to administer the oath to Afridi.
Following the PHC’s order, a spokesperson for Kundi had said the governor would administer the oath, adding that arrangements were being made at the Governor’s House.

Afridi’s election was held amid uncertainty about the status of Gandapur’s resignation from the provincial chief executive’s position. The two resignations submitted to Governor Kundi by Gandapur — who is also from the PTI and stepped down on party founder Imran Khan’s directive — were returned over “disparate signatures”.
The PTI maintained that a chief minister’s resignation did not require the governor’s approval under the Constitution. With this contention, the party elected Afridi in a session boycotted by the opposition. The same day, in a pre-emptive move, it approached the PHC with the request pertaining to Afridi’s oath-taking.</p><small>2025-10-15 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15145052cc57572.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949092/all-you-need-to-know-about-the-deadliest-pakistan-afghanistan-flare-up-in-years' target='_blank'><strong>All you need to know about the deadliest Pakistan-Afghanistan flare-up in years</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Afghanistan have often engaged in minor border skirmishes, particularly since the withdrawal of US forces and the Taliban’s takeover in 2021. However, tensions have recently escalated to an unprecedented level, with clashes over the past few days prompting intervention from mediators.
The latest flare-up coincided with a historic visit by Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to India, raising alarm in Islamabad after he referred to Kashmir as part of India and said terrorism was Pakistan’s “internal problem” that the country should solve itself.
Escalation
The recent clashes began late on Saturday night, when 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists killed at the border following an attack from the Afghan side at around 9pm, according to the military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The ISPR said skirmishes between the two sides began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna-al-Hindustan is a term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory earlier this week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintained that Kabul must “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
By midnight, both sides were targeting each other, as Afghan forces struck several Pak­istani posts and the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) and artillery pounded Afghanistan’s posts, targeting hostile positions in the Afghan provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, Khost, Paktia, and Paktika.
Pakistan warns of ‘unwavering, befitting response’
On Sunday, the Foreign Office (FO) warned that further acts of aggression from Afghanistan would receive an “unwavering and befitting response”. It expressed concern about the “unwarranted aggression by the Afghan Taliban, Fitna al Khawarij and Fitna al Hindustan”, which it said would destabilise neighbourly relations between the two nations.
The same day, Afghan Taliban Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid had said that Pakistani strikes on Kabul “will have consequences” and that the country had “weapons to respond”.
‘Stalemate’ situation
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Monday described the situation as a “stalemate”, noting that there were “no ties, direct or indirect” between Islamabad and Kabul in the fallout of the unprovoked attack.
“You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’ while reporting a lull in attacks.
He also stressed that Pakistan had the “right to react” to being attacked, and warned that the fighting could resume again at any time.
Attacks resume
As Asif predicted, the exchange of blows resumed again last night between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to state media reports.
State-run PTV, citing security sources, described the attack from the Afghan side as unprovoked once again, adding that the Pakistani army “responded with full force and intensity”.
 






Today, the ISPR said that security forces repulsed another attack by the Afghan Taliban along the Balochistan border, killing around 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban.
It said that the Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said.
It added that as Pakistani troops repelled the attack, 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban were killed and several others were injured.
Calls for restraint
China, which shares a border with the two countries, sought to play a mediating role in calming the hostilities. Beijing’s foreign ministry said on Monday that it had asked the two countries to protect their nationals and investments in the region, according to AFP.
United States President Donald Trump, while on his way to Israel to oversee the exchange of hostages between Israel and Gaza’s Hamas, also expressed an interest in resolving the conflict, saying, “I’m good at making peace.”
 


Additionally, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief, Maulana Fazlur Rehman, offered yesterday to mediate between Pakistan and Afghanistan in an effort to ease the tensions, citing his past experience with peacemaking between the two sides.
As the only Pakistani political leader who has met the Taliban supreme leader, Shaikh Hibatullah, the chief said, “I have been in contact with the Afghan leadership, and they want to resolve the issues through understanding.”
He added that both sides should refrain from blaming each other for the hostilities.
 
 

Previous improvement in ties
Islamabad and Kabul had witnessed an improvement in bilateral ties this year, after steps such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee and upgrading diplomatic ranks.
However, Pakistan has long been pressing the Taliban rulers to take action against the TTP and other Pakistani militant groups in view of the increase in attacks across Pakistan.
Last week, during the Moscow Format Consultations held in the Russian capital, Pakistan’s Special Representative to Afghanistan, Mohammad Sadiq, sought]15 regional countries’ cooperation to “effectively counter terrorism and dismantle all terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil”.
The Taliban government insists it does not allow anyone to use Afghan soil against Pakistan.
Muttaqi’s trip to India
The meeting in Moscow was also attended by Muttaqi, who, the next day, left for New Delhi for the first visit to India by a Taliban leader since they came to power. Although New Delhi does not formally recognise the Taliban government, it has taken steps to thaw relations.
While in India, Muttaqi issued controversial remarks on terrorism in Pakistan with reference to Pahalgam, the site of a deadly attack in India-occupied Kashmir in which 26 tourists were killed. India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the attack, while Islamabad denied the allegations. The incident led to a four-day military escalation between Pakistan and India before being halted with US intervention.
Muttaqi’s statement referred to Pahalgam as a part of India, drawing severe backlash from Pakistan’s FO.
In a response to the India-Afghanistan joint statement, the FO expressed “strong reservations” on the remarks and described the reference to Jammu and Kashmir as part of India to be “in clear violation of the relevant UN Security Council resolutions” and “highly insensitive”.

According to a statement by the ISPR, Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said.
It added that as Pakistani troops repelled the attack, 15 to 20 Afghan Taliban were killed and several others were injured.
“The situation is still developing. There are reports of further buildup at staging points of Fitna-al-Khwarij and [the] Afghan Taliban,” the statement said.
Fitna-al-Khwarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The ISPR said that the attack from the Afghan side was “unfortunately […] orchestrated through divided villages in the area, with no regard for [the] civil population”.
“The Afghan Taliban also destroyed the Pak-Afghan Friendship Gate on their side, which clearly displays the mindset with regard to mutual trade and easement rights of the divided tribes,” it added.
The statement by the military’s media affairs wing underlined that the incident in Balochistan was an isolated event.
“On [the] night of October 14/15, Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khwarij tried to attack Pakistani border posts in Kurram Sector in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“These attacks were effectively repulsed, causing heavy losses to Afghan posts. Eight posts, including six tanks, were destroyed in the effective yet proportionate response of Pakistani troops. Twenty-five to thirty Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khwarij fighters were suspected to have been killed,” the ISPR said.
The ISPR further stated, “The insinuations that the attack was initiated by Pakistan are outrageous and blatant lies, just like the claims of capturing Pakistani posts or equipment. The propaganda of [the] Taliban regime can be debunked with basic fact checks.”
The statement also reaffirmed that the “armed forces stand resolute and fully prepared to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. All acts of aggression against Pakistan will be responded to with full force”.
Before the ISPR’s statement today, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid also posted on social media platform X about the incident at the border in Balochistan.
He alleged that Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
Mujahid claimed that more than 12 civilians were killed and over 100 were injured in the attacks carried out by Pakistani forces with the use of “light and heavy weapons”. The Afghan government spokesperson also claimed heavy losses on the Pakistan side, including the capture of posts and weapons, as well as fatalities.
President, PM laud security forces
Following the incident in Balochistan, a statement on the PPP’s X account said President Asif Ali Zardari had “strongly condemned” the cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.
“Attacks from Afghanistan are a blatant violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty,” the statement quoted him as saying, adding that he also paid tribute to the armed forces for their “courage and professional expertise”.
The president said the Afghan Taliban government was continuously “violating” the 2020 Doha agreement — a deal signed between the US and Afghan Taliban that included guarantees from the Taliban that it would prevent militant groups from using Afghan soil to threaten the security of the US and its allies.
President Zardari accused the Afghan Taliban of “providing safe havens to Taliban terrorists”, who he said were a threat to other countries in the region. The president said such measures were destabilising the entire region, including Pakistan.
“The Afghan government is deviating from its promise to establish a broad-based representative government,” he further stated.
On the incidents along the border in Kurram and Balochistan, he said the Pakistan Army had “effectively repelled the attacks” in those areas.
He called on the Afghan authorities not to let their soil be used for terrorism and anti-Pakistan activities.
“Such attacks harm the peace and friendly relations in the region,” the president said, adding that Pakistan wanted peaceful ties based on cooperation with all its neighbours.
“Any aggression against Pakistan will be met with a strong and unequivocal response,” he asserted.
 






A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) today said premier Shehbaz Sharif had expressed concern over “incitement” by the Afghan Taliban, Fitna-al-Khwarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan (the term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan) at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
He also paid tribute to the security forces for repelling the attack by the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram sector, the statement said. It further quoted the PM as observing that the Pakistan Army had given a “strong” response to the Afghan Taliban’s “unprovoked aggression”.
“National integrity will be defended at all costs. The use of Afghan soil for incidents of terrorism in Pakistan is condemnable,” he added.
Tense ties
Today’s border clash in Balochistan is the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following the incident in Kurram last night and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
According to the ISPR, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 injured in the incident that began with Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border. The military’s media affairs wing also said that credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment showed that “more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher”.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself.
The weekend clash took place against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries and the ties seem to have nose-dived with recent increase in hostilities at the border.
On Monday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said while speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’ that there were “no ties” between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he had said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister had also said that hostilities between the two sides could resume “at any time”.

In a statement issued by the Sindh CM House, Shah expressed deep sorrow and grief over Durrani’s passing. Murad called Durrani “a sincere, loyal and principled leader of the party, saying he played an important role in strengthening the Sindh Assembly and stabilising democracy.
“Agha Siraj Durrani made public service the axis of his politics,” he said, expressing his condolences to the bereaved family.
“The services of the late Agha Siraj Durrani will always be remembered,” he said.
President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed “deep sorrow” over Durrani’s passing.
“The president paid tribute to his political and public services, noting his role in strengthening democracy and serving the people of Sindh,” said a post by the Presidency on social media platform X.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the late Durrani for his services as the Sindh Assembly speaker, saying that his contributions to politics and public welfare would “always be remembered”, APP reported.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar remembered Durrani as a “seasoned parliamentarian and devoted public representative”.
Dar said in a post on X that he was deeply saddened by Durrani’s demise.
“May Allah Almighty grant him the highest place in Jannah and give strength to his family and loved ones to bear this huge loss,” he added.
 






Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in a post on X, also expressed his sorrow at Durrani’s passing, calling him an “honourable man who stood by the PPP and the leadership during the toughest of times”.
 






National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said Durrani was a “wise and astute politician”, saying that his services for the promotion and strengthening of democracy would be remembered.
“The void created by the passing of Agha Siraj Durrani will not be filled for a long time,” Sadiq added.
 






Born in 1953, Durrani completed his matriculation from Karachi’s St. Patrick’s School in 1971, and subsequently received his Bachelor of Commerce degree from Karachi and his LLB degree from Karachi’s Sindh Muslim Law College.
 
 

Along with his older brother Agha Salahuddin, he had contested the 1985 party-less elections, held under General Ziaul Haq, from Shikarpur and lost. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of embezzlement in several cases during Nawaz Sharif’s first government and remained in jail for some time.
He had served two consecutive terms as the Sindh Assembly speaker, from 2013-2018 and from 2018-2023.</p><small>2025-10-15 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628716-field-marshal-munir-briefs-president-zardari-on-afghan-taliban-govts-aggressive-actions' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir briefs President Zardari on Afghan Taliban govt's 'aggressive actions'</strong></a><br><p>

The petition, on which the court had reserved its verdict earlier today, was filed by JUI-F leader Maulana Lutfur Rehman yesterday. Rehman, who was among the four contenders for the KP CM post, had requested the court to “set aside” Afridi’s election and declare it null and void.
At today’s hearing, which was presided over by  Justice Arshad Ali and Justice Waqar Ahmad, Barrister Yaseen appeared on behalf of Rehman against PTI’s Salman Akram Raja.
Addressing the court, Raja pointed out that the JUI-F petition at hand “has become ineffective in light of yesterday’s PHC order.”
Responding to his comments, Justice Ali said, “Yes, we are aware of the order, but let’s hear the petitioner’s argument.”
Barrister Yaseen told the court, “How was a new chief minister elected if the resignation of the former CM had not yet been accepted and the seat remained occupied?”
Citing Article 105 of the Constitution, the petitioner’s counsel pointed out that only the Governor has the right to advise the CM,“ adding that “Gandapur’s resignation was sent by post; he did not submit it himself.”
To this, Justice Ali responded, saying, “I understand your point — the post will remain vacant until the resignation is accepted.”
The petitioner’s lawyer further argued that the “election was unconstitutional and should not have taken place.” He cautioned that “electing a new chief minister while there already was a chief minister in place could create a constitutional upheaval.”
“If the resignation had been accepted, then it would have made sense to hold the election and all respective parties would have taken part in it,” he added.
“The cabinet has not yet been dissolved; it is still in place,” he noted, to which Justice Ali said: “ When the chief minister (Gandapur) is not in his position any more, how are we talking about the cabinet?“
“Yes, that is exactly what I am saying — Ali Amin Gandapur is still the chief minister,” Yaseen said, in response to the judge’s comments.
Justice Ali, addressing the petitioner’s lawyer, said, “Have you read yesterday’s order from the chief justice”?
“Yes, I have read it,” he said, alleging that PTI had filed an incorrect application.
Justice Ali offered the petitioner’s legal counsel two options: “to either withdraw the petition or let the case be heard on merit.”
“Decide on the merit,” barrister Yaseen said.
Subsequently, the court reserved its decision in the matter and later dismissed the petition.
The plea
Yesterday, JUI-F’s Rehman filed a petition in the PHC, requesting that the election of Afridi as the KP chief minister be “set aside” and declared null and void.
Rehman was one of the four people in the race for the KP CM office, along with Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP and PTI’s Afridi.
In the petition, Rehman named six respondents, including the KP government, Governor Kundi, the KP Assembly through Speaker Swati, the secretary of the provincial assembly, Gandapur and Afridi.
He requested the court to set aside the election and declare it “ab initio void” as it was “wholly unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, without jurisdiction, coram non judice.”
Rehman asked the court to halt any further proceedings in the matter until the governor had “lawfully received and verified” the resignation of Gandapur.
The petition called for a fresh election “in accordance with the Constitution and the assembly rules, after lawful confirmation of vacancy.”
KP CM crisis
Afridi’s election on Monday was held amid uncertainty about the status of Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation from the provincial chief executive’s position, prompting the opposition to boycott the election.
On Monday, before the election, two resignations submitted to KP Governor Kundi by Gandapur — who stepped down on party founder Imran Khan’s directive — were returned over “disparate signatures”, and Kundi summoned him on October 15 (today) to settle the matter.
By that time, KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati had already convened an assembly session to elect a new leader of the house. And the PTI maintained that under Article 130(8) of the Constitution, a chief minister’s resignation did not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
The opposition, however, disagreed and walked out of the session held for the CM election. Following its boycott, candidates fielded by the JUI-F, the PPP and the PML-N received zero votes while Afridi won the race with 90.
At yesterday’s hearing at the PHC, Chief Justice (CJ) S.M. Attique Shah issued the directive to the Governor to administer the oath to CM-elect Afridi, instructing that the KP Assembly speaker should administer the oath if the governor did not.
The court’s decision came on a PTI application seeking the nomination of the assembly speaker or any other person “considered appropriate” in place of the governor to administer the oath to Afridi.
Following the court’s decision, Kundi said while speaking to the media in Karachi that he had been saying he would abide by the Constitution. “I never said that I would not administer the oath,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-15 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15155311d8bb4cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949096/internet-services-restored-after-repair-of-submarine-cable-ptcl' target='_blank'><strong>Internet services restored after repair of submarine cable: PTCL</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Tele­commu­nications Limited (PTCL) on Wednesday said the international cable consortium had completed the repair of a repeater installed in the submarine cable, which had affected internet speeds across the country.

In the latest global ranking issued on October 7, Pa­­kistan’s travel docum­ent was placed at 103 in the list — tied with Yemen — and ranked higher than only those of Iraq (104), Syria (105) and Afghanistan (106).
Per the ranking, Pakistan and Yemen’s passports permit visa-free access to 31 countries only out of 227 travel destinations, Iraq’s allows travel to 29, Syria’s gives access to 26 destinations, and Afghanistan’s travel document only affords the bearer access to 24 destinations without a visa.
Pakistan’s passport has been declared the world’s fourth worst since at least 2021 on the Henley index, which calculates countries’ “visa-free score” — the number of destinations travellers can access without a prior visa, or with a visa on arrival.
The travel document placed 100th on the list in 2024 and 2023, 109th in 2022 when it allowed entry into 32 countries sans a prior visa, and 107th in 2021 with the same visa-free score.
 
 

The top spot yet again belonged to Singapore, as its passport provides citizens visa-free access to 193 destinations, followed closely by South Korea in second place with a visa-free score of 190, and Japan ranking third with 189 destinations its citizens can visit without a visa.
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and Switzerland rank fourth, with visa-free access to 188 locations.
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland and the Netherlands rank fifth with a visa-free score of 187.
Also notable was that for the first time since the Henley Passport Index was created 20 years ago, the United States has fallen out of the world’s top 10 most powerful passports.
“Once unrivalled at No.1 in 2014, the American passport has now slumped to 12th place, tied with Malaysia, with visa-free access to only 180 of 227 destinations worldwide,” Henley said in a press release.
Similarly, the British passport has slipped to its lowest-ever position on the index, dropping from sixth to eighth since July, despite also once holding the top spot in 2015.’
The United Arab Emirates’ passport, which entered the top 10 for the first time last year, hiked one spot, moving to eighth with a visa-free score of 184.
China’s passport, which ranked 59th last year with 85 destinations accessible without a visa, dropped to 64th with its visa-free score lowering to 82.</p><small>2025-10-15 10:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1515201430a9cfc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949083/apple-lobbies-india-to-change-tax-law-seen-hindering-its-expansion-report' target='_blank'><strong>Apple lobbies India to change tax law seen hindering its expansion: report</strong></a><br><p>Apple is lobbying India’s government to modify its income tax law to ensure the company is not taxed for ownership of high-end iPhone machinery it provides to its contract manufacturers, an issue seen as a hurdle to its future expansion, sources say.
The push coincides with Apple’s growing India presence as it diversifies beyond China. Counterpoint Research says iPhone’s share in the Indian market has doubled to 8 per cent since 2022. And while China still accounts for 75pc of global iPhone shipments, India’s share has quadrupled to 25pc since 2022.
India is the world’s second-largest mobile market. Apple’s contract manufacturers Foxconn and Tata have pumped in billions of dollars to open five plants, but millions of those expenses go into acquiring pricey machines for iPhone assembly.
Experts say Apple potentially faces billions of dollars in additional taxes if it changes its business practices without convincing New Delhi to change a 1961 law covering foreign ownership of equipment used in India.
 
 

In China, Apple procures the machines used to make iPhones and gives them to its contract manufacturers, and is not subject to tax even though it still owns them.
But that’s not possible in India as the Income Tax Act would consider such ownership by Apple as a so-called “business connection”, making the US firm’s iPhone profits liable for Indian taxes, said a senior government official and two other industry sources.
Apple executives have held talks with the Indian officials in recent months to tweak the law, as it fears the current legislation could hamper its future growth, said the sources.
“Contract manufacturers cannot put up money beyond a point,” said the first industry source. “If the legacy law is changed, it will become easy for Apple to expand … India can become more competitive globally.”
Reuters is the first to report Apple’s concerns and lobbying efforts on the law.
Apple did not respond to Reuters questions, and neither did India’s IT and finance ministries, which are involved in the discussions.
India cautiously reviewing Apple request
Smartphone manufacturing is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s agenda, and India’s deputy IT minister last year privately said China and Vietnam could race ahead as major smartphone export hubs due to their lower tariffs on phone parts.
A senior Indian official said “discussions on taxation rules impacting Apple are ongoing”, but New Delhi is cautious as any changes to the law could diminish its sovereign right to tax a foreign company.
“It’s a tough call,” said the official, who highlighted that Apple’s increased investments are equally important.
“India needs investments. We have to find a solution.”
 
 

Apple has since 2023 opened a handful of directly-owned retail stores in India, though it also sells its products through online and offline distributors.
Foxconn and Tata have, over the years, invested more than $5 billion in setting up Apple manufacturing.
Specialised equipment can cost billions
One precedent of Indian law often cited by tax experts involves UK-based Formula One. India’s Supreme Court held in 2017 that even though F1 did not own a circuit near New Delhi, it was liable to pay tax on profits for the days when it exerted full control during its Grand Prix India event.
If Apple were to own machines inside Indian iPhone factories, it would amount to exerting control under current laws, experts said.
“If the activities of Apple constitute a business connection, then the global revenue may be used as a basis to compute the income attributable in India, leading to billions in tax exposure,” said Riaz Thingna, a partner at Grant Thornton Bharat LLP.
Taiwan’s Foxconn is Apple’s largest contract manufacturer in India, having shipped products worth $7.4bn this year by August, compared to $7.5bn in all of 2024, commercially available customs data shows.
 
 

The income tax law, however, does not bother Apple’s South Korean rival Samsung, as almost all of its phones are made in its own Indian factories.
The India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), which backs Apple, has, in a confidential representation to the government, called for changes to the law, saying tax certainty is “paramount for businesses seeking to expand and scale.”
“Typical CMs (contract manufacturers) are unable or unwilling to invest in such large quantities of specialised equipment … The cost of the equipment can rise to billions of dollars,” ICEA said, without naming any company.
“In certain cases, [it] may also be supplied … free of cost.”</p><small>2025-10-15 10:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15145844a0a6673.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949087/suparco-to-launch-pakistans-first-hyperspectral-satellite-on-oct-19' target='_blank'><strong>Suparco to launch Pakistan’s first ‘hyperspectral satellite’ on Oct 19</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s space agency on Wednesday announced the upcoming launch of the country’s first hyperspectral satellite (HS-1) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in China, scheduled for October 19.
Hyperspectral imaging is a type of advanced camera technology used in satellites to study the Earth and space, according to a study published in the Journal of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience. Unlike regular satellite cameras that capture only a few colours (like red, green, and blue), hyperspectral cameras capture hundreds of very narrow colour bands. This means they can detect tiny differences in light that the human eye, or even normal satellites, can’t see.
Because of this, scientists can use hyperspectral images to identify materials, detect changes in vegetation, find minerals, monitor pollution, or even study the atmosphere in much greater detail than before.
According to a statement from the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), the launch is a “landmark mission [which] represents a transformative milestone in Pakistan’s national space programme, propelling the country into a new era of advanced space-based applications in agriculture, disaster management, urban development, and environmental monitoring.”
It said that in the agriculture sector, HS-1 will enable precision farming through high-resolution hyperspectral data acquisition and calibration.
“The satellite will provide detailed insights into crop health, soil moisture, and irrigation patterns, enhancing yield estimation by 15 to 20 per cent and contributing significantly to food security,” it added.
The statement further said that the satellite’s “cutting-edge sensors” will help monitor environmental changes, map infrastructure, and assess urban growth patterns for urban development.
“By capturing unique spectral signatures of man-made structures, HS-1 will support sustainable city planning, land-use assessment, and efficient resource management,” said Suparco.
The space agency detailed that HS-1 will serve as a “vital tool” for early warning and rapid response in environmental monitoring and disaster management.
The satellite’s “advanced imaging capabilities” will aid in flood prediction, landslide tracking, and geo-hazard assessment, particularly across the Karakoram Highway and northern Pakistan, it said.
Moreover, per the statement, the satellite will also enhance post-disaster assessment, transportation network analysis, and water resource modelling, providing timely data on floods, earthquakes, deforestation, and land degradation.
The integration of HS-1 into Pakistan’s expanding remote sensing fleet, comprising PRSS-1 (launched in July 2018), EO-1 (launched in January 2025), and KS-1 (launched in July 2025), will “significantly strengthen the nation’s space-based infrastructure”, said Suparco.
“The mission aligns with the National Space Policy and Suparco’s Vision 2047, which aims to position Pakistan at the forefront of space technology and innovation for sustainable national development.”
Last month, a senior official from Suparco said the agency was integrating space-based applications into its disaster risk management framework, “paving a path anchored in science and international collaboration to better prepare for natural calamities”.
In July, the foreign ministry announced the successful launch of a remote sensing satellite from China, which aimed to “strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities”.</p><small>2025-10-15 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15131237df6fe34.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949080/noman-shaheen-spur-pakistan-to-93-run-victory-over-south-africa-in-first-test' target='_blank'><strong>Noman, Shaheen spur Pakistan to 93-run victory over South Africa in first Test</strong></a><br><p>Left-arm spinner Noman Ali was South Africa’s chief tormentor as Pakistan won a gripping first Test by 93 runs in Lahore on Wednesday.
Set a daunting 277-run target for victory, the visitors and World Test champions were bowled out for 183 on day four.
Man of the match Noman finished with 4-79 and 10-191 in the match for his third haul of ten wickets or more in Tests.
 






With the weary Gaddafi Stadium pitch taking sharp turn and low bounce, the 39-year-old Noman exploited the conditions well despite a stubborn 73-run stand between Dewald Brevis and Ryan Rickelton in the morning.
In all, spinners from both sides took 34 wickets, with just six going to fast bowlers.
South African left-armer Senuran Muthusamy took 11-174 in the match.
Pakistan made 378 in their first innings, with South Africa scoring 269 in reply.
On a deteriorating surface, the hosts collapsed in their second-innings 167 but
it proved enough.
On Wednesday, with the tourists 137-6 at lunch the writing was very much on the wall, then Sajid Khan dismissed Muthusamy for six soon after the break.
Pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi dismissed Kyle Verreynne (19), Prenelan Subrayen (eight) and Kagiso Rabada (nought) to finish with 4-33.
The victory gives Pakistan an ideal start to the World Test Championship, having come last in the previous edition.
The second and final Test starts in Rawalpindi from Monday.
In the morning, Brevis took the fight to the Pakistan spinners and had reached an aggressive career-best 54, with six fours and two sixes, when Noman bowled him with a sharply turning delivery.
Opener Rickleton’s dogged resistance was broken by Sajid just before lunch for a gritty 45.
Pakistan struck in the first over of the day through fast bowler Shaheen, who trapped Tony de Zorzi for 16 without any addition to the overnight total of 51-2.
Tristan Stubbs struggled to cope with the sharp turn and was on two when a premeditated reverse sweep off Noman safely landed in Salman Agha’s hands.
Brevis reached his second Test half-century with a six off Noman before becoming the spinner’s fourth victim.
Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated the team on their win — which he said was a result of teamwork — and hoped for the team’s continued success in the second Test.
“Pakistan played excellently against South Africa in every department,” Naqvi said.

The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
After New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later raising the tally to seven. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after its three air bases were targeted.
However, Indian political and military leadership have continued to make aggressive statements, repeating terrorism allegations that Pakistan has repeatedly refuted.
Yesterday, Indian Army’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai claimed that the Indian Navy was fully prepared during ‘Operation Sindoor’, the term New Delhi used for its May 7 strikes on Pakistan. He further said that any further hostilities by Pakistan could have been “catastrophic for it”, Times of India reported.
Lt Gen Ghai claimed that more than 100 Pakistani soldiers were killed during the May conflict along the Line of Control, according to The Hindu. The Indian officer also reiterated India’s claim of inflicting major damage on Pakistani airbases and destroying its air assets on the ground, the report said.
Without taking any names, a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said: “The contradictions in the Indian Army presser are so evident that they should not be dignified with a response. Evidently, the Indian leadership is attempting to mould history to its liking by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts.
“It appears that [the] Indian army and the political leadership have not been able to reconcile with the idea that they have been decisively beaten in Marka-i-Haq, and that their falsehoods have been fully exposed,” it added.
 
 

The military’s media affairs wing noted with grave concern that five months after the May conflict, “in the run-up to elections in Bihar and West Bengal, Indian military leadership has started parroting the same delusional, fabricated and provocative propaganda that they regurgitate before every state election in India”.
“It is saddening to see the military leadership of a nuclear-armed country issuing irresponsible statements under immense political pressure. The lies being fed to the Indian public and international audience have turned the Indian military machine into a laughing stock,” the statement said.
The ISPR cautioned that “any professional soldier would know that unnecessary chest thumping and unwarranted statements might initiate a cycle of jingoism and lead to serious consequences for peace and stability in South Asia”.
It asserted that the world now recognised India as the “true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, bent upon adventurism and hegemonism to the detriment of its people and its neighbours”.
 
 

The ISPR stressed that the “Indian armed forces and its political masters must realise that Pakistan’s people and its armed forces are fully capable and committed to defend every inch of our territory with full resolve”.
“Every act of aggression will be dealt with a swift, resolute and intense response that will be remembered by posterity,” it said.
Last week, the military’s top brass had warned India that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.</p><small>2025-10-15 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15092631279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949031/imran-says-pti-answerable-to-people-of-kp-will-never-act-against-their-interests' target='_blank'><strong>Imran says PTI answerable to people of KP, will never act against their interests</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan said on Tuesday that his party had been given a mandate by the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would not act against their interests.
Imran’s remarks come after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Friday vowed the country would not ‘mortgage’ the security of its people with any country.
He said “appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators was not and never would be a policy”, while addressing KP’s security situation in Peshawar. Responding to Imran’s call — from jail — for talks with the Afghan Taliban to end bloodshed, the DG ISPR said the state and forces would not be swayed by political distortions.
He added that no single person — “most responsible for bringing terrorism back to KP” — could dictate national security. He also cited “governance gaps” in the province’s infrastructure and counter-terror funding.
In a post on Imran’s official X account last night — which he does not operate himself — the PTI founder congratulated KP MPAs on the transition in governance after Sohail Afridi’s election as the new chief minister.
“The way members of the KP Assembly voted for my nominated chief minister, without any ifs or buts, is commendable,” he said.
He also paid tribute to outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who resigned “not once but thrice” without any hesitation.
 






He also gave a special message to the new KP chief minister, calling him his “opening batsman” and telling him to play as such.
“The PTI is the largest political party in Pakistan. Branding people associated with the party as traitors just because they do not agree with a certain policy is an extremely dangerous act,” Imran said, calling for an end to the practice of labelling people as “anti-state”.
“As a politician, it is my right to criticise any policy that is against the interest of the people, the country’s integrity and democracy. I have and will continue to oppose every policy against national interests,” the ex-premier said.
“The PTI has been given a mandate by the people of KP and we are answerable to them, not the DG ISPR. Therefore, we will never go against the interests of the people of Pakistan and the province,” he added.
Imran asserted that he did not have an enmity with the army, saying: “The army is mine, the country is mine and its people are also mine.”
 
 

He went on to say that several members of his family were part of the armed forces, adding that he felt sorrow when soldiers were martyred while fighting against terrorism.
“But unrest still persists and our people are killed on both sides,” he said.
“History has proven that military operations alone are not the solution for terrorism. Our principled position is that military operations in KP are unacceptable because innocent people are martyred in the name of ‘collateral damage’ and are displaced from their areas,” Imran said.
“For decades, military operations are being conducted but this scourge still remains. Every year, precious blood is being spilt; sometimes army and police personnel are martyred, other times innocent civilians lose their lives in terrorist incidents,” he added.
“I have always said that in order to completely eradicate terrorism, an effective, comprehensive strategy based on political insight is needed instead of decisions taken behind closed doors,” he said. The PTI founder further said that any policy made without the input and consultation of political representatives and the KP government was unacceptable.
Imran asserted that all relevant stakeholders should be taken on board when formulating a policy against terrorism, be it local tribes in the province, the KP government, the federal government or the Afghan government.
“The issue of terrorism cannot be solved without dialogue with the Afghan government,” he said. The PTI founder then directed the new KP government to talk to relevant stakeholders and formulate an effective and comprehensive strategy against terrorism to ensure long-term peace in the province.
Imran’s statement comes after Afghan Taliban forces launched an unprovoked attack on posts situated on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. The ISPR said 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.

If approved, the IMF will provide Pakistan $1bn under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and $200 million under its Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), bringing total disbursements under the two arrangements to about $3.3bn.
Last week, an IMF mission led by Iva Petrova had concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on the second review of the EFF — agreed in 2024 to shore up the economy after a severe financial crisis — and the first one for the RSF climate loan.
The mission had left Pakistan without signing a staff-level agreement. However, the Fund had said “significant progress” had been made towards reaching the deal. A day earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb — who is currently in Washington — had expressed the hope that the agreement would be reached this week.
In a statement issued early on Wednesday by the Fund, Petrova stated that the staff-level agreement remained subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board.
“Supported by the EFF, Pakistan’s economic programme is entrenching macroeconomic stability and rebuilding market confidence,” she said.
“The recovery remains on track, with the FY25 current account recording a surplus — the first in 14 years, the fiscal primary balance surpassing the programme target, inflation remaining contained, external buffers strengthening, and financial conditions improving as sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly,” she said.
However, the IMF official added, the recent floods had weighed on the country’s outlook, particularly of the agriculture sector, bringing down the projected FY26 gross domestic product (GDP) to about 3.25-3.5 per cent.
“The floods underscore Pakistan’s high vulnerability to natural disasters and substantial climate-related risks, and the continuing need to build climate resilience,” Petrova said.
She also said that the Fund wanted to express its sympathy to those affected by the recent floods, adding that it was “grateful to the Pakistani authorities, private sector, and development partners for many fruitful discussions and their hospitality throughout this mission”.
‘Pakistan reaffirmed commitment to maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing reforms’
The IMF official also noted progress on Pakistan’s policy priorities, saying: “The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the EFF and RSF-supported programmes, and to maintaining sound and prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing ongoing structural reforms.”
She said that authorities remained committed to meeting the FY26 budget primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP, anchored in sustained efforts to mobilise revenue through tax policy and compliance measures, and “stand ready to take necessary actions should revenue shortfalls risk program targets”.
“At the same time, the authorities are assessing the flood damage and are providing urgent flood relief support in the affected provinces via reallocations in the provincial and federal budgets,” Petrova said.
She also noted that social protection remained a key pillar of the EFF-supported programme and authorities were working on enhancing the generosity, coverage and administrative capacity of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
“They are also committed to scaling up non-BISP health and education spending at both the federal and provincial levels to support inclusive growth and safeguard vulnerable populations,” she said.
She further said that efforts were underway to enhance revenue mobilisation, broaden burden-sharing between federal and provincial governments, and strengthen public financial management.
“In particular, recognising the provinces’ vital role in domestic revenue mobilisation, the federal authorities will continue deepening collaboration with provincial counterparts.
“The authorities are also making important progress in strengthening tax policy design, with the newly established tax policy office, which will lead medium-term reforms to simplify the tax code and reduce reliance on ad hoc measures,” she said.
The IMF official noted that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was committed to a prudent monetary policy stance, guided by incoming data, including the impact of recent floods and the evolving economic recovery, to ensure inflation remains durably within its target range of five to seven per cent.
“While the floods are likely to have a temporary impact on prices, the SBP stands ready to adjust its policy stance should price pressures intensify or inflation expectations become unanchored. While the sustained buildup of international reserves is welcome, further steps are needed to deepen the foreign exchange market to facilitate transactions, support price discovery, and cushion external shocks,” she said.
On the issue of circular debt, she said that Pakistan remained committed to preventing its accumulation through timely tariff adjustments that ensure cost recovery and maintaining a progressive tariff structure.
“Structural reforms continue to focus on enhancing the performance, efficiency, and governance of distribution companies, including through privatisation; upgrading the transmission system; privatising inefficient generation companies; and completing the transition to a competitive electricity market,” Petrova said.
She further said that authorities were making progress in delivering structural reforms aimed at boosting productivity, strengthening governance, and improving the business environment to support private sector development.
“Further effort is needed to advance the state-owned enterprise reform agenda and scale back the state’s footprint in the economy. The authorities are also planning reforms to reduce government intervention in commodity markets to foster a productive, diversified, and internationally competitive agricultural sector that meets food security needs. Efforts to boost international trade continue, including with the implementation of the new national tariff policy,” she said.
Petrova went on to say that the recent floods and those of 2022 had underscored the need for building Pakistan’s climate resilience.
“Policies supported by the RSF and aligned with national commitments are helping to strengthen resilience, including recently implemented reforms to promote green mobility and transport decarbonisation,” she noted.
“The authorities remain committed to advancing future reforms, including strengthening the climate information architecture and financial risk management, improving water system resilience, establishing a framework for coordinated disaster risk financing, and aligning energy sector reforms with national mitigation commitments,” she added.</p><small>2025-10-15 04:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15072113bc3a195.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949005/tlp-chief-saad-rizvi-on-fia-radar-for-money-laundering' target='_blank'><strong>TLP chief Saad Rizvi on FIA radar for ‘money laundering’</strong></a><br><p>• Huge cache of foreign currency, around 2kg gold recovered from Rizvi’s home
• FIA says outfit’s financiers will be placed on stop list

LAHORE: The authorities have launched a money-laundering investigation against Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan chief Saad Rizvi after “huge sums” of foreign currency were allegedly recovered from his residence in Lahore during a raid by the law enforcement agencies.
The Punjab police said the raid was conducted by the provincial police, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), adding that all items, including the gold ornaments, were confiscated. The raid at the residence of the TLP chief came after the crackdown on the outfit’s march on Sunday night. Police said Mr Rizvi had escaped during the crackdown in Muridke.
A senior police official said the law enforcers were shocked to find such a large amount of foreign currency, gold, and silver at the residence, as the TLP chief did not run any business before the formation of the radical outfit.
In light of these findings, the authorities expanded the scope of their investigation to acquire details of bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, his son, and other family members to assess the total movable and immovable assets he had obtained under the TLP banner.
The total currency allegedly recovered from the residence amounted to Rs110 million, including 50,000 Indian rupees.
In a separate statement, the FIA said it has initiated legal and financial actions against a religious group involved in anti-state protests and violent activities, adding that the accounts and assets of several important officials and workers of the religious group were being examined based on evidence.
According to the statement, “The FIA has frozen several bank accounts that were allegedly being used to fund violent protests.” Similarly, key individuals involved in fundin­g the TLP were being placed on the stop list.
TLP headquarters ‘no-go’ area
According to a police official, who shared initial findings with Dawn, the TLP purcha­sed dozens of properties in the vicinity of its headquarters — the hub of its activities — on Multan Road, making it a ‘no-go area’ for the LEAs and the general public. He said that the TLP chief had created a team of his loyal extremists and accommodated them by purchasing various houses at throwaway prices.
 
 

“Several streets connected to the TLP’s main office have become a hub of the organisation’s trusted workers/supporters,” he said, adding that a separate team of the TLP was provided an office equipped with the latest gadgets to run and handle social and regular media campaigns. He said a dedicated team of highly trained activists was made available by the TLP to respond quickly to police operations. The Punjab police officially shared the detailed inventory of recovered valuables from the TLP chief’s residence.
They included 1.92kg of gold, 898g of silver, 69 branded wristwatches, 28 gold bangles weighing 445g, 12 bracelets (490g), 24 necklaces, chains, and lockets, and 46 gold rings (355g). Similarly, the raiding team also recovered one silver crown and 32 silver rings from the house.
22 FIRs against TLP
On the other hand, the Punjab police lodged at least 22 FIRs against TLP chief Saad Rizvi and his violent supporters across the province on various serious offences. In the primary FIR, Muridke police booked over 300 suspects on serious charges, ranging from terrorism to murder.
Besides Mr Rizvi, his brother Anas Rizvi and many central leaders were also booked for inciting hate and instigating workers to raise anti-state slogans. The FIR said Ins­p­e­ctor Shahzad Nawaaz was allegedly kidna­p­ped and thrashed by a TLP mob, leaving him injured. It also accused Saad Rizvi of shooting the inspector in his abdomen, leaving him critically injured. The police officer later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital.
 
 

It said that the TLP mob attacked the policemen with clubs, iron rods and sharp-edged weapons containing nails and injured several, adding that the TLP supporters were armed with lethal weapons and they opened indiscriminate fire at policemen, injuring many of them.
As per the reports, the Pakpattan, Sahiwal, and Chichawatni police lodged three cases against Mr Rizvi, his supporters and workers under the anti-terrorism law and other offences. Another FIR alleged that Mr Rizvi’s speech, broadcast live via social media from Burawla Chowk, incited his followers to block roads, shut down markets, block traffic, and disrupt public order.
Separately, the Gujrat police also booked at least 120 TLP activists on terrorism char­ges. The FIR was lodged with the Reh­m­ania police on the report of SI Aftab Rasool.
Calls for probe
Meanwhile, renowned cleric Mufti Mun­eebur Rehman urged the formation of a judicial commission, led by a serving superior judge, to investigate the crackdown on the TLP to disperse the protesters.
“There is a growing demand that a judge of the high court or the SC should lead a thorough and independent investigation into this heart-wrenching and brutal incident. The aim is to identify those responsible and to recommend appropriate punishments based on the findings,” he said while reading out a joint declaration issued at the conference of clerics in Karachi. He also urged the Punjab government and administrations across the province to hand over the bodies of the deceased TLP workers to their families and to cease raids on the homes of its activists.
Mufti Muneeb also urged the TLP leaders to reconsider their strategy and refrain from resorting to violence, instead focusing on securing their rightful place through the democratic parliamentary system. The Human Rights Comm­ission of Pakistan said the it was deeply concerned by the events that had unfolded since Oct 8, culminating in violent cla­shes between security forces and the TLP, causing multiple deaths and casualties among protesters and policemen.
 
 

“We are equally concerned by the lack of transparency and credible, independent infor­mation surrounding the operation, providing which was the government’s responsibility. While state authorities have neglected to address the TLP’s consistent role in promoting hate speech and inciting mob viole­nce against individuals and groups, particularly religious minorities, this does not justify the alleged use of excessive force,” it said.
Both the Constitution as well as international law mandate that security forces, even when dispersing violent assemblies, use the minimum necessary force, it said.
