A statement by Edhi confirmed the recovery and added that the body was transferred to Civil Hospital.
The fire had erupted on Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
Medical authorities also identified three more bodies today. According to a statement by Edhi, three of the 21 unidentified bodies at the Edhi morgue were identified. The remains belong to a 15-year-old girl and two men.
The bodies were identified using DNA samples, the statement added.
On Tuesday, a large crowd gathered at the scene, with law enforcement creating temporary barriers to prevent people from approaching the plaza. Smoke could still be seen emanating from the building’s rubble.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the dead also appeared to include five women. The police surgeon said that officials had conducted a post-mortem examination of “fragmentary human remains”.
Jacketing at Rimpa Plaza
According to the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), a part of the structure of Rimpa Plaza — another shopping mall adjacent to Gul Plaza — has also been affected due to continued exposure to heat and fire.
SBCA Director General Muzammil Halepota told Dawn that three floors of the 13-storey building had been affected, and an SBCA technical committee visited the site on Tuesday.
They found that two pillars had been weakened and the SBCA suggested jacketing to strengthen the pillars by adding a layer of steel supports around them.
“An SBCA team has started the process,” Halepota said, adding that a notice had also been issued to the owners of Rimpa Plaza regarding the pillars’ repair.
All Gul Plaza records available, SBCA maintains
The SBCA, a day earlier, also rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”.
“The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”.
According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998.
“Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said.
“A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.”
The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies.
It is worth noting that South DIG Asad Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire.
“The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body.
“The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.
In a more recent development today, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori met a delegation led by Gul Plaza President Tanveer Pasta and Karachi Chamber of Commerce’s Javed Balwani.
A statement issued by the governor’s office said Pasta appreciated Tessori’s efforts for the “timely rescue operation and effective measures” after the fire erupted at Gul Plaza and thanked him for “raising his voice for the victims” of the tragedy at every forum.
“During the meeting, Tanveer Pasta agreed, in principle, with the recommendations of the Sindh governor and Karachi Chamber of Commerce,” the statement said, without elaborating on the said recommendations.
Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi visited Gul Plaza today. Speaking to the media at the site, he said the inquiry of the incident was a very complicated one as it had multiple angles.
He said the matter would have to be probed from all angles, and the inquiry committee would try to make “long-term and far-reaching recommendations” to the government.</p><small>2026-01-21 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21143257f4373b2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968225/na-passes-bill-seeking-amendments-to-elections-act-for-secrecy-of-parliamentarians-assets' target='_blank'><strong>NA passes bill seeking amendments to Elections Act for secrecy of parliamentarians’ assets</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly (NA) passed on Wednesday the Elections Amendment Bill, 2026, seeking secrecy of parliamentarians’ assets.
In the bill, the proposed amendment to Section 138 of the Elections Act seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the speaker of the assembly concerned or, as the case may be, the chairman of the Senate may, by a ruling delivered in the chamber, determine that the statement of assets and liabilities of that member shall not be published publicly by the commission if such publication would pose a serious threat to the life or safety of the members or, as the case may be, his family, for a period not exceeding one year at a time and subject to the condition that a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities shall be submitted confidentially to the Election Commission.”
The bill needs the Senate’s assent and the president’s approval before it becomes law.

The delegation, which includes members of both the Senate and the National Assembly of Pakistan, will also engage with the members of the Pakistani diaspora to emphasise the significance of their participation in promoting national causes in the United States.
The delegation will participate in multiple forums, beginning with an Inter-Parliamentary Group (IPG) session at the Rayburn House Office Building on Wednesday, followed by a press conference at the National Press Club (NPC) and a diplomatic reception in New Jersey.
According to Dr Gholam Mujtaba, chairman of the Pakistan Policy Institute USA (PPI-USA), who has been instrumental in organising the visit, the engagements are designed to promote legislative-to-legislative dialogue, deepen institutional cooperation, and highlight Pakistan’s role in regional stability and global diplomacy.
The Rayburn IPG session will be hosted by Congressman Al Green as the congressional sponsor and Congressman Ron Estes will deliver keynote remarks. Confirmed US participants include representatives Tom Suozzi, Laura Gillen, and Josh Gottheimer.
On the Pakistani side, senators Saleem Mandviwalla, chief whip of the Senate, and Rana Mehmoodul Hassan, chairman of the standing committee on cabinet, will engage US lawmakers on parliamentary cooperation, security, trade, and diaspora-enabled diplomatic channels.
“The dialogue comes at a sensitive regional juncture, as developments in the Middle East and South Asia continue to impact global security and economic interests,” Dr Mujtaba said.
“Pakistan’s strategic relevance, its commitment to democratic values, and the contributions of the Pakistani-American community will all be highlighted during these engagements.”
The NPC briefing will allow the delegation to share insights with US and international media on parliamentary diplomacy, bilateral relations, and areas of potential cooperation. Discussions are expected to focus on trade, investment, counterterrorism, and the role of diaspora networks in strengthening ties between the two countries.
The delegation will conclude its visit with a reception in Clifton, New Jersey, on January 24, to be attended by US lawmakers, city and state officials, and members of the Pakistani diaspora to encourage dialogue on community-level cooperation and private-sector engagement.</p><small>2026-01-21 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21124506a236eb2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968217/ihc-asks-how-imran-khans-x-account-case-can-proceed-without-lawyer-access' target='_blank'><strong>IHC asks how Imran Khan’s X account case can proceed without lawyer access</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday questioned how proceedings in the case concerning PTI founder Imran Khan’s X account could continue if authorities were denying his counsel access to him.
The remarks were made by Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, who was presiding over a hearing on a petition against the incarcerated former premier regarding “inflammatory posts” made from an X account operated in Imran’s name.
During today’s hearing, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja, who is representing Imran in the case, told the court that he had not been able to meet his client for consultation.
“The court has received responses from Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and jail authorities,” Justice Tahir said.
Addressing Raja, Justice Tahir said that “final arguments in the case will be presented on February 24 if you meet (Imran)”.
The judge then directed Raja to submit a detailed response in court in connection with the contempt petition over the denial of meetings with the PTI founder. The court also issued instructions to advocate general Islamabad to submit a written response in the contempt case.
Justice Tahir was then informed by the state counsel that “a larger bench was hearing cases involving meetings”.
At this, Justice Tahir said, “They (defence) are saying that until the meeting is held, how will the case proceed any further?”
Raja argued that “a case has been filed against me, yet I am not allowed to meet my client,” adding that he has not been able to meet the incarcerated party founder “ever since the case was filed”.
The court instructed the state counsel to submit a written response on the matter.
The defence counsel further recalled that the IHC had issued an order on November 4 allowing meetings; however, “it has not been implemented for two months”.
“Should I go there today for a meeting?” the PTI leader asked, adding that the party founder was “being kept in solitary confinement”.
Justice Tahir maintained that an order will be issued regarding the meeting.
“The case will only move forward if we allow him (Raja) a meeting,” the judge said to the state counsel.
As the hearing continued, the court also found the response submitted by PTA to the petition “unsatisfactory”.
“Look at what the writ petition is and what your response is,” Justice Tahir, expressing displeasure, said to the PTA counsel.
The hearing was adjourned till February 24.
On Nov 4, 2025, Justice Tahir issued a directive to Adiala jail authorities to ensure that Raja is allowed to meet Imran in relation to the case.
The court had also instructed the deputy attorney general and the state counsel to immediately convey the order to the jail administration through a phone call.
The former premier’s family and party leaders have recently faced increased restrictions in meeting him. In December last year, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that meetings with the incarcerated leader would remain suspended till February 8.
The petition
In September, a petition was filed in the IHC challenging the alleged inflammatory posts made from the official X account of the PTI founder during his imprisonment.
The petition was filed by citizen Ghulam Murtaza Khan through Barrister Zafarullah Khan Advocate, stating that the dissemination of “provocative and malicious” content from the account of a convicted prisoner is unlawful and contrary to prison rules.
The petitioner requested the court to direct the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency and the PTA to conduct a thorough investigation to determine who has been operating the PTI founder’s account while he remains incarcerated.
The petition further sought directions for blocking and removing such content from social media platforms.
It also called upon the court to instruct the jail superintendent to ensure that the prisoner is not allowed to access or operate social media in violation of jail regulations, terming such activity “unconstitutional and illegal.”
A written reply submitted to the court by Adiala jail authorities last year denied that the X account was being operated from within the jail.
Superintendent of the Adiala jail stated the PTI founder was under strict surveillance and had no access to any prohibited device, “particularly mobile phones”</p><small>2026-01-21 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21133458a96c1d3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968220/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-wefs-informal-gathering-of-world-economic-leaders-in-davos-today' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to attend WEF’s Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders in Davos today</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will be attending the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Informal Gathering of World Economic Leaders (IGWEL) session on “Restoring a Spirit of Dialogue in a Divided World” on Wednesday (today) in Davos, according to a post on the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) X account.
The premier is on a three-day visit to the Swiss town (from January 20-22), primarily to lead a high-level delegation from Pakistan, including Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, at the 56th Annual Session of the WEF.







According to the PMO, he is also expected to meet International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva today. Moreover, he is also expected to meet “various world leaders on the sidelines of the WEF”, the PMO statement on X said.
It added that the premier will also attend and address a “breakfast event”.
The premier arrived in Davos on Tuesday. In a post on X, PM Shehbaz wrote that he was visiting Davos to advance Pakistan’s engagement at the WEF with global trade and investment partners.
“Pakistan’s ongoing economic reform journey is unlocking profound opportunities, driven by a resilient and entrepreneurial workforce and significant potential across energy, agriculture, minerals, and emerging technologies,” PM Shehbaz said.
He added that Pakistan was “ready to harness this potential into mutually beneficial economic cooperation and long-term investment”.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), the prime minister will also host and chair a Pakistan-specific “High-level Business Roundtable” with different corporate leaders during the visit.
“Articulating Pakistan’s perspective on global and regional peace and development and highlighting the government’s vision and achievements in the areas of economy, trade and investment opportunities will be part of the prime minister’s key messages during the visit,” the FO statement said.</p><small>2026-01-21 09:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/210858073c0ccbe.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968159/pti-moves-high-court-for-meetings-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>PTI moves high court for meetings with Imran</strong></a><br><p>• PTI claims several held, injured after police scuttle rally in Pindi• Aleema seeks brother’s release; Uzma confident Feb 8 protest will ‘shut down’ entire country
ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Tuesday moved the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking permission to meet incarcerated leader Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in Adiala jail, as well as an order by the court to end their unlawful solitary confinement.
On the other hand, the Punjab police used force to disperse a PTI protest in Rawalpindi after the former ruling party wrapped up its sit-in outside the prison and decided to stage a rally in the garrison city. The PTI, in a statement posted on X after midnight, said the police crackdown resulted in several arrests and injuries.







A group of about 17 senators, including Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, approached the high court under Article 199 of the Constitution, making the Punjab Home Department and the Adiala jail superintendent respondents.
The petition challenged the alleged unlawful and unconstitutional use of solitary confinement and other inhumane practices against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi in jail. According to the petition, the continued solitary confinement amounts to torture and violates fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution.
Barrister Zafar said the senators approa­ched the court in discharge of their constitutional duty of parliamentary oversight and to safeguard human dignity and the rule of law.
The petition maintained Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi had been kept in prolonged isolation for the last two months without any judicial order or statutory justification under the Pakistan Penal Code or the Prisons Act.
It alleged denial of basic prisoner entitlements, including access to books, news­­papers, TV, family visits, and confidential meetings with counsel, as well as the arbitrary refusal to allow lawmakers to meet them.
The senators contended that these measures were punitive, politically motivated, and part of a broader pattern of coercive treatment of political detainees, undermining constitutional democracy and parliamentary oversight.
Separately, PTI interim chairman Barrister Gohar, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja also arrived at the IHC to seek the fixing of cases related to Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi.
According to sources, the PTI leadership requested a meeting with the IHC chief justice, but the meeting could not take place.
Speaking to the media, Barrister Gohar said he had gone to the chief justice’s chamber to request early fixation of the cases but was unable to meet him. He added that another attempt would be made later.
Barrister Gohar said the PTI had approa­ched the IHC about 15 times but could not secure a hearing date, stressing that a woman’s appeal should be heard expeditiously.
Crackdown on PTI rally
The PTI supporters and family members of Imran Khan staged a sit-in outside the prison for a few hours after they were barred from meeting the former prime minister in the morning. In the late evening, they decided to stage a rally in the garrison city, prompting the police to disperse the crowd.
A video posted by the PTI on X showed several cars leaving the jail area, with party workers and supporters moving on foot. “Even today, Chairman Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were not granted a meeting with the family. Khan sahib’s sisters and party workers have set off for a protest rally in Islamabad,” the post’s caption read.







However, the rally was scuttled by the police, with videos of the crackdown posted on X by the PTI. These videos could not be independently verified.
The PTI claimed that its workers were also injured in the action, and several, including minors, were allegedly rounded up. It also alleged that the police roughed up the sisters of Mr Khan and other party leaders.







Visit to Adiala
In the morning on their way to the prison, the PTI leaders were stopped at ‘DHA Naka’ instead of ‘Factory Chowk’, but were allo­wed to move a little further after some time.
Imran’s sister Uzma Khanam said that it has been decided that wherever the police stop them, they will hold ‘Quran Khwani’ there. She said that on February 8, the entire country “will be jammed” to protest the alleged rigging in the 2024 elections.
She urged the party supporters to fly kites with the name of Imran Khan on Basant so that “his name and picture would be on land and in the skies”.
Replying to a question, Aleema Khan said they wanted the release of Imran Khan instead of just meetings.
PTI leader Shafiul­lah Jan said that in the past, the authorities used to stop PTI workers three kilometres from the jail, but on Tuesday, they were stopped eight kilometres from the jail.

“Prime Minister Netanyahu announced that he has accepted US President Donald Trump’s invitation and will join as a member of the Board of Peace, which will be composed of leaders of the world,” the office said in a statement.







The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of post-war Gaza, but its charter seen by AFP does not appear to limit its role to the Palestinian territory, and members have to pay up to $1 billion for a permanent spot on it.
The board “seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict”, reads the preamble of the charter sent to countries invited to participate.
It will be chaired by Trump himself, who will also “separately serve” as the representative of the United States.
Dozens of countries and leaders have said they have received an invitation, including close US allies but also adversaries.
A day earlier, the UAE president and Bahrain’s king accepted an invitation to sit on Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’, joining a handful of countries to have endorsed the initiative.
Longtime US ally France, however, has indicated it will not join.
While announcing the creation of the board last week, Trump also unveiled plans to establish a “Gaza Executive Board” operating under the body.
The executive board would include Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi.
Netanyahu has strongly objected to their inclusion.
Ties between Turkey and Israel have deteriorated since Israel’s Gaza invasion started in October 2023 following an unprecedented attack by Hamas on Israel.</p><small>2026-01-21 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21121348b28bc0b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968213/maxwell-and-waugh-among-franchise-owners-in-bollywood-backed-european-t20-league' target='_blank'><strong>Maxwell and Waugh among franchise owners in Bollywood-backed European T20 league</strong></a><br><p>Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell and former captain Steve Waugh are among the franchise owners in a new European Twenty20 league, which will begin in August after two false starts.
Backed by the cricket boards of Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands, and approved by the governing International Cricket Council, the European T20 Premier League’s (ETPL) founders include Bollywood star Abhishek Bachchan.
“Mainland Europe is not known for cricket,” Bachchan told Reuters from Sydney, where they unveiled owners of the three teams, including the Amsterdam franchise owned by a group that includes Waugh and Jamie Dwyer, a five-time International Hockey Federation player of the year.
“It’s an opportunity to create a huge cricket ecosystem in and around Europe. With ETPL, we hope we can bring the magic of cricket euphoria to mainland Europe.”

         View this post on Instagram            

Maxwell is a co-owner of the Belfast franchise, while former New Zealand internationals Nathan McCullum and Kyle Mills bought the Edinburgh side.
The ICC has 33 members in Europe, most for any continent, including full members England and Ireland. Scotland and Netherlands have played World Cups, while Italy will make their T20 World Cup debut next month.
“Italy’s World Cup qualification indicates Europe’s interest in cricket, and cricket being in the 2028 Olympics is another boost for Europe,” Bachchan said.

“We hope to turn ETPL into one of the top T20 leagues in the world.”

Waugh hoped the Amsterdam franchise would inspire more kids to take up the game.
“Franchise cricket has the world’s best players playing with locals,” the two-time World Cup winner told Reuters.
“At Amsterdam, the Dutch players will have the opportunity to play alongside players like Mitchell Marsh, the current Australia T20 captain, or Steve Smith, one of the all-time greats of the game. You can’t buy that kind of experience.”
Initially conceived as Euro T20 Slam, the league could not take off in 2019 and its planned launch last year was delayed for the second time.</p><small>2026-01-21 07:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646342-rainfall-strong-cold-spell-expected-in-karachi-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Rainfall, strong cold spell expected in Karachi from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

If BCB remains adamant on not travelling to India for the 20-team tournament, Scotland is likely to replace Bangladesh as per current rankings.
“I am not aware that Scotland will be included in our place,” Asif told reporters.
“If the ICC bows to pressure from the Indian cricket board and tries to impose pressure on us by setting unreasonable conditions, we will not accept those conditions.
“In the past, there are examples that Pakistan said that they will not travel to India and ICC changed the venue. We have asked to change the venue on logical ground and we cannot be pressurised to play in India by putting illogical pressure.”

The standoff was triggered by the removal of Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from Kolkata Knight Riders’ roster for this year’s Indian Premier League on Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) instructions for unspecified “developments all around”.
Citing security concerns and national pride, the BCB responded by announcing its national team won’t travel to India for its group stage games in Kolkata and Mumbai.
BCB wants to play each of its four group-stage matches in Sri Lanka, where the marquee India-Pakistan clash will also be held as per the mutually agreed arrangement for ICC events until 2027.
Bangladesh is currently placed in Group ‘C’ along with the West Indies, Italy, England and Nepal.
In its last meeting with ICC officials in Dhaka, the BCB had proposed swapping positions with Ireland in Group ‘B’, which features tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe.
Such a move would allow Bangladesh to remain in Sri Lanka for entirety of its group-stage engagements.
While the BCB considers it unsafe for its players to travel to India, the ICC’s risk assessment report did not flag any specific or direct threat to the team’s participation in the World Cup.
The bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh have deteriorated in recent months, exacerbated by the reported killings of Hindus in Bangladesh.
Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal and current Test skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto have cautioned against a very hard-line approach on the controversial subject, with the former saying that decisions taken today would have repercussions 10 years down the line.

Campaigning begins on Thursday for Bangladesh’s election, which has sparked protests and counter-protests. Ties between the South Asian neighbours soured after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.
India’s past support for Hasina has frayed relations between the two neighbours since her overthrow.
India’s withdrawal move was part of “internal readjustments”, the official said, without elaborating. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to Indian media reports of New Delhi’s decision.
It was not immediately clear when the families would return.
The foreign ministries of India and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In December, India summoned Bangladesh’s high commissioner, or ambassador to voice its concern over what it called a deteriorating security situation there, particularly threats targeting the Indian mission in the capital, Dhaka.
Bangladesh’s ex-premier Hasina was sentenced to death in November after a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on the student-led uprising in 2024.
The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly sought Hasina’s extradition to Bangladesh, while rejecting New Delhi’s concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community.
Meanwhile, a popular student leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising, Sharif Osman Hadi, was wounded in an assassination attempt last month and died after being flown to Singapore for treatment.

Calling the move a deliberate “weaponisation of water,” Pakistan’s representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, said India’s actions amounted to material breaches of the landmark 1960 treaty.







Speaking at the Global Water Bankruptcy Policy Roundtable hosted by Canada and the United Nations University on Tuesday, Ambassador Jadoon said that since April last year, India had committed several serious violations of the treaty, including unannounced disruptions of downstream water flows and the withholding of critical hydrological data.
“Pakistan’s position is unequivocal; the treaty remains legally intact and permits no unilateral suspension or modification,” he said.
He stressed that for more than six decades, the Indus Waters Treaty had provided a time-tested framework for the equitable and predictable management of the Indus River basin, which sustains one of the world’s largest contiguous irrigation systems.
The basin, he noted, provides over 80 percent of Pakistan’s agricultural water needs and supports the lives and livelihoods of more than 240 million people.
Ambassador Jadoon said water insecurity had emerged globally as a systemic risk, affecting food production, energy systems, public health, livelihoods, and human security.







“For Pakistan, this is a lived reality,” he said, describing the country as a semi-arid, climate-vulnerable, lower-riparian state facing floods, droughts, accelerated glacier melt, groundwater depletion, and rapid population growth — all of which are placing immense pressure on already stressed water systems.
Highlighting Pakistan’s response, he said the country was strengthening water resilience through integrated planning, flood protection, irrigation rehabilitation, groundwater replenishment, and ecosystem restoration.
He cited initiatives such as ‘Living Indus’ and ‘Recharge Pakistan’ as key national efforts. However, he emphasized that systemic water risks could not be managed by any country in isolation, particularly in shared river basins.
Predictability, transparency, and cooperation in transboundary water governance, he said, were matters of survival for downstream populations.
Ambassador Jadoon further called for water insecurity to be formally recognised as a systemic global risk in the lead-up to the 2026 UN Water Conference, urging that cooperation and respect for international water law be placed at the center of shared water governance to ensure real protection for vulnerable downstream communities.</p><small>2026-01-21 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/21104552ff67c6d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968208/japan-court-sentences-ex-pm-abes-assassin-to-life-in-prison-nhk-reports' target='_blank'><strong>Japan court sentences ex-PM Abe’s assassin to life in prison, NHK reports</strong></a><br><p>A Japanese court on Wednesday sentenced a 45-year-old man to life imprisonment for fatally shooting former prime minister Shinzo Abe, public broadcaster NHK reported, in an incident that stunned the nation three and a half years ago.
Tetsuya Yamagami was arrested on the spot in July 2022 after fatally firing at Abe with a homemade gun while he was delivering a campaign speech in the western city of Nara. Abe, the country’s longest-serving premier, was 67.

 

A guilty verdict was all but certain after Yamagami admitted to killing Abe in the first court hearing at the Nara District Court in October, and attention had been on the severity of the sentence.
Prosecutors sought a life sentence last month, calling the act an “extremely grave incident that is unprecedented in post-war history”.
Although he was no longer Japan’s leader at the time, Abe remained a powerful and binding force within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. His absence has left a vacuum within the party, which has since seen two leadership races and, by extension, a revolving door of prime ministers.
Abe himself served as prime minister for a total of 3,188 days over two separate terms, stepping down in September 2020, citing health reasons.
His protege Sanae Takaichi now leads Japan and the LDP, but the party’s grip on power has considerably diminished.
Abe’s killing also brought to light a deep link between his party and the Unification Church, an organisation many consider a cult. An in-party investigation found that more than a hundred lawmakers had dealings with the group, leading many voters to shun the LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war period.
Media have quoted Yamagami as telling the court that he held a grudge against the Unification Church after his mother’s large donation to it caused financial hardship for their family, and that he took out his anger on Abe because the former prime minister had once sent a video message to an event held by a group affiliated with the church.
Founded in South Korea in 1954, the Unification Church is famous for its mass weddings and counts Japanese followers as a key source of income.
Yamagami’s lawyers, meanwhile, argued that the family’s misfortune caused by the donation to the Unification Church should be taken into consideration and limit his prison term to 20 years at most.
While Abe was a divisive figure domestically, he was among the few global leaders to have a strong rapport with US President Donald Trump.
Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his 2016 election victory, and the two went on to forge a close bond over rounds of golf in the United States and Japan. Prime Minister Takaichi has repeatedly referenced their friendship in her own dealings with Trump.</p><small>2026-01-21 06:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2110423939b086b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968207/trumps-plane-returns-to-air-base-after-minor-electrical-issue-white-house' target='_blank'><strong>Trump’s plane returns to air base after ‘minor’ electrical issue: White House</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump’s plane was forced to return to an air base late Tuesday due to a “minor electrical issue” shortly after departing for Switzerland, the White House said.
Air Force One returned to Joint Base Andrews out of an abundance of caution, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. It landed shortly after 0400 GMT.
Journalists traveling with Trump reported that lights in the cabin went out briefly after takeoff.

 


After returning to Andrews, Trump resumed his trip to the Davos forum early Wednesday.
Trump and his entourage changed planes at Joint Base Andrews and took off again shortly after 0500 GMT, about two-and-a-half hours after his initial departure.
With its classic blue and white livery, Air Force One is arguably the world’s most iconic plane and an instantly recognisable symbol of the US presidency.
Trump has long been unhappy with the current Air Force One jets - two highly customized Boeing 747-200B series aircraft that entered service in 1990 under president George H.W Bush.
Last year, Trump said his administration was “looking at alternatives” to Boeing following delays in the delivery of two new 747-8 aircraft.

In May, Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth accepted a Boeing 747 that the Gulf emirate of Qatar offered to Trump for use as Air Force One.
The jet - worth hundreds of millions of dollars - has raised huge constitutional and ethical questions, as well as security concerns about using an aircraft donated by a foreign power for use as the ultra-sensitive presidential plane.</p><small>2026-01-21 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2110284015c3a56.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968206/lahore-again-emerges-as-most-polluted-city-in-the-world' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore again emerges as most polluted city in the world</strong></a><br><p>Lahore has again emerged as the most polluted city in the world with its air quality being classed as “hazardous”, according to air quality monitoring platform IQAir.
In past few years, air pollution has become one of the most pressing public health and environmental crises facing Pakistan. Various cities of the country, most notably Lahore, deal with smog, especially in the winter months. The phenomenon is attributed mainly to industrial emissions, vehicular pollution, stubble burning and air movement.
Lahore was placed at the top of the list of most polluted cities globally on Wednesday morning, with an air quality index (AQI) of 452, while Karachi ranked ninth at 179, according to the IQAir live tracker.

On Tuesday, the platform issued an air quality alert for Pakistan as major cities experienced “unhealthy” to “hazardous” levels of air pollution, posing “serious health risks to residents, especially children and the elderly”.
At the time, Lahore’s air quality index (AQI) had soared to 507 — well into the “hazardous” bracket (301+). Karachi ranked sixth on the list with an “unhealthy” AQI of 178 a day earlier.

“Residents are advised to limit outdoor activity, keep windows closed, wear masks when outside, and use air purifiers indoors,” the alert said.
Punjab authorities have made efforts to tackle the smog in Lahore, including via the use of water sprinklers and rapid response initiatives to curb stubble-burning. However, despite claiming an improvement in the air quality, the pollution persists.</p><small>2026-01-21 05:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646315-over-2400-fire-incidents-reported-in-karachi-last-year-report' target='_blank'><strong>Over 2,400 fire incidents reported in Karachi last year: report</strong></a><br><p>

The campaign was inaugurated at Azadi Chowk by Commissioner Maryam Khan, Lahore Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Bilal Siddique Kamyana, and Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Dr. Athar Waheed.
A road safety camp was set up on Yadgar Road, Azadi Chowk, where free safety rods were installed on motorcycles. The commissioner, CCPO, and CTO reviewed the installation process and emphasised strict enforcement of safety measures during Basant.

 

On the other hand, the Punjab government on Tuesday directed all public sector universities and colleges in Lahore to place their buses at the disposal of the district administration to ensure free transport for the public during the three-day ‘Safe Basant’ celebrations from Feb 6 to 8.

Colleges, universities told to provide buses along with drivers to administration to ensure ‘Safe Basant’ activity

According to officials, the Punjab Higher Education Department (HED) issued instructions to vice chancellors, principals, and administrations of public sector universities and colleges to provide buses along with drivers for three days. The move aims to facilitate citizens, reduce traffic congestion, and enhance public safety during the cultural festival.
The HED deputy secretary conveyed the directions to educational institutions through official communication, including WhatsApp messages, asking them to fully cooperate with the government initiative.
The decision comes as part of a broader ‘Mehfooz Basant’ plan being implemented by the Punjab government, Lahore district administration, and law-enforcement agencies to ensure safe and regulated celebrations within the limits of Lahore district.
Meanwhile, speaking to the media, Commissioner Maryam Khan said free ride services would be available across the city during the three-day festival and made it clear that no motorcycle would be allowed on Lahore’s roads without a safety rod. She reiterated that ‘Safe Basant’ would be celebrated strictly within Lahore district on Feb 6, 7, and 8, and kite flying would not be permitted before Feb 6.

 

She further stated that the sale of kites and strings would be allowed only from Feb 1 to 8, while manufacturing of kite-flying material would be restricted to Lahore district alone. Only registered manufacturers, traders, and sellers would be allowed to operate, and all must display valid NOCs. Online registration of businesses is underway through the “e-Biz” app, with licences being cleared within three days.
CCPO Bilal Siddique Kamyana warned that strict legal action would be taken against violations of Basant-related laws, including aerial firing and non-compliance with safety regulations. “Ensuring the safety of citizens is our top priority, and there will be zero tolerance for violations,” he said.
CTO Lahore Dr. Athar Waheed said 100 road safety camps have been established across the city, where safety rods are being installed on 50,000 to 60,000 motorcycles daily. He added that more than one million safety rods would be installed to ensure maximum protection for motorcyclists during Basant.
Officials said all departments, including police, traffic police, district administration, and educational institutions, would work in close coordination to ensure that ‘Safe Basant’ is celebrated peacefully, safely, and in accordance with the law.

Zafar Khan, a fire officer, has not left the site of this shopping mall in Karachi since the night of January 17, when the iconic building caught fire. The raging blaze claimed 28 lives, while rescue teams continue to search for more than 60 missing people amid the charred rubble.
Being the most visible part of the response, much of the blame has fallen on the firefighters. But days later, with smoke still seeping from the building, Zafar can still be seen standing amid the blackened debris and angry murmurs, explaining again and again why it has been such an uphill task to douse the fire.
Amid the accusations and smoke, lies a quieter truth that must not be forgotten: fires may erupt in minutes, but the conditions that allow them to rage unchecked fester over years and years.
Where plastic or similarly inflammable material is present, he says, fire has a habit of re-erupting the moment it receives oxygen. “That is why, even now, firefighting and cooling continue side by side.”

When asked how he copes with public accusations of “incompetence” and “undue delays”, he barely pauses. “We are here to save people’s lives and property. It is part of our training not to get too emotional as we focus on our work while being confronted by people who are freaking out. We understand that ours is also a thankless job. People also yell at and curse doctors in hospitals who are caring for their loved ones.”
The Gul Plaza inferno and its aftermath have given rise to a storm of allegations, with the first finger pointed squarely at the firefighters.
Citizens, angered, frustrated and left helpless by the tragedy, accused the fire crew of arriving late, running out of water, lacking equipment and skill, and failing to control a fire that broke out around 10.15pm on Saturday but continued to smoulder until Tuesday morning.

Smoke billowing from the building’s eastern side fuelled public suspicion that something inside was still burning, but firefighters had left it “unchecked”.
Karachi Metropolitan Corporation’s Chief Fire Officer, Humayun Khan, however, explains his crew’s side of the story, one that rarely surfaces or makes news.

“We responded to the distress call about the fire at Gul Plaza almost immediately and reported here within 10 to 12 minutes of receiving that call,” he tells Dawn.
By the time fire tenders reached the site, however, a crowd of 10,000 to 12,000 people had gathered at the site, turning panic into a physical obstacle. “Yes, we understand their anxiety, but coming in our way in their panic is not right. In fact, it is a violation,” he adds.
He further explains how each distress call made to the helpline is digitally registered with the caller’s ID, followed by a confirmation call, a process which leaves little room for dispute over response time.

He also says how, upon arrival, firefighters had to face competing demands from shopkeepers, each insisting their shop be saved first, while ambulances that had reached the site earlier blocked the access routes for the fire trucks.

“There is a need to keep ambulance routes separate,” the fire chief says. “Ignoring such standard operating procedures [SOPs] can make even small incidents big.”
What puzzled him most was that many shopkeepers decided to stay inside the burning building instead of running outside immediately.

Even after 12 fire tenders and three snorkels were deployed, he recalls, his crews had to struggle to manoeuvre hoses amid pressure from shopowners, which created a lot of confusion. “Still, we were able to help the shopkeepers grab their valuable documents that were left behind, along with cash worth millions,” he shares.
According to members of the fire crew, people also questioned them about their tactics. Would foam or chemical agents not have been more effective against a fire that kept flaring up?

Officer Zafar agrees in principle, but said that there were limitations. “Foam needs to reach the precise area, which we were unable to reach in this case. It is ineffective if sprayed from afar,” he explains.
When asked why all firefighters were also seen wearing plain disposable masks and not specialised ones or helmets with torches, Fire Chief Humayun quickly shook his head.
“We are not short of such equipment,” he says. “But we use them when needed. The fumes carry particles that choke the gas masks. Putting them on to take off again and go back to have them cleaned will take too much time.”
Besides, he says, his team wore disposable masks and plain helmets when firefighting from outside. “We will use whatever is needed after going inside. We have already started doing that now, as the fire is more or less under control. We are just waiting for the building to cool.”

It is also a structure in danger of collapsing, he says, explaining, “We also need to be careful as we have already lost one firefighter when a portion of the building fell on him.”

The martyred fireman, Furqan Ali, 36, was associated with the Nazimabad Fire Station and had been serving in the KMC Fire Department since 2018. He was appointed on a deceased quota after his father, also associated with the fire department, passed away while in service.
For those on the ground, the deeper problem lies far beyond a single blaze. According to Sub-Fire Officer Sajid Ali Khan, the commercial complex, which was spread over nearly two acres of land, had not a single fire hose reel or extinguisher.

“It is life insurance to have an extinguisher. You only need to refill it once a year, which costs about Rs1,000. Gul Plaza generated revenue in millions each day, and no one there thought about this?”

“If they had a fire extinguisher in the first shop where the fire initially erupted, they could have put it out there and then,” he maintains.
Leading Firefighter Riazuddin points to a systemic failure. He says that large buildings that lack fire exits, smoke alarms, or sprinkler systems pose serious risks. “There is a lack of awareness regarding fire safety here. There are no fire drills, so people don’t know what to do if a fire breaks out,” he says.

He explains that in the past, there used to be civil defence training in schools, which was no longer imparted to students. “Do you know that fire doesn’t kill, but smoke and suffocation do?”

“If you stay low during a fire (stay close to the ground), you can easily crawl out to safety because smoke gathers about a foot above the ground,” he points out.

“But who’s to spread such awareness in a land where you have no time or use for fire drills?”
Back at the front of the blackened plaza, Zafar remains at his post, watching the structure exhale wisps of smoke. For him and his fellow firefighters, the work is not about public approval or blame, but about staying long enough to make sure the fire does not return, and leaving only when it is finally safe to do so.

ISLAMABAD: In a loud and clear message, the Supreme Court on Tuesday affirmed its appellate hierarchy under the 27th Amendment by holding that civil petitions concerning rent and family matters, previously adjudicated by high courts under Article 199, are maintainable before it.
The controversy emerged from an office objection regarding the maintainability of a civil petition on the ground that the impugned judge-ment had been rendered by a high court under Article 199 in a rent matter and, thus, was not maintainable before the SC under the constitutional dispensation introduced through 27th Amendment.
The office objection further contended that following the insertion of Article 175F(1)(c) by the 27th Amend­ment, high court functions as the final judicial forum in rent matters, and as such, no appeal against a judgement pertaining to a rent matter lies before the SC.
The office also argued that while Article 185(3) confers general appellate jurisdiction upon the SC, Article 175F(1)(c), being a specific provision introduced subsequently, excludes rent matters from all appellate forums beyond the high court.
A three-judge SC bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, and comprising Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, overruled the office objection through a short order on Dec 12, 2025, while hearing the case of Messrs Moon Dental Clinic, Islamabad.
In the detailed reasons authored by the CJP, the court cited Article 175-F(1) of the Constitution, which provides for the appellate jurisdiction of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC).
From a plain and textual reading of Articles 185(3) and Article 175-F(1)(c), the judgement explained that Article 185(3) operates as a general source of appellate jurisdiction of the SC in respect of judgements, decrees, orders or sentences of the high courts, subject only to the exclusion contained within it — namely, cases to which clause (1) of Article 175F applies.
Article 175F(1), in turn, sets out the appellate jurisdiction of the FCC and, by virtue of the proviso to clause (1)(c), expressly excludes cases relating to rent and family matters from its jurisdiction.
The core question before the court, therefore, was whether judgements or orders of a high court pertaining to rent and family matters, which stand expressly excluded Article 175F(1), are removed altogether from the appellate framework beyond the high court, including the Supreme Court, or whether such exclusion places them outside the scope of Article 175(1), thereby attracting the appellate jurisdiction of the SC under Article 185(3).
The judgement clarified that the proviso to Article 175F(1)(c), which states that “no appeal shall lie against a judgement or an order of a high court made under Article 199 in a case relating to rent and family matters,” operates as a true proviso and qualifies the general scope of clause (1)(c) by expressly excluding such matters.
By this exclusion, rent and family matters are removed from the operative field of Article 175F(1)(c).
Read in conjunction therewith, the proviso to Article 185(3), which provides that “no appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court in cases to which clause (1) of Article 175F applies”, it becomes evident that the bar on the appellate jurisdiction of the SC applies only to cases that actually fall within.
Article 175F(1).
Since rent and family matters are expressly excluded from the applicability of Article 175F(1)(c), such cases cannot be regarded as falling within Article 175F.
Consequently, petitions arising out of rent and family matters are not barred from the appellate jurisdiction of the SC under Article 185(3), it explained.
The court held that the office objection, premised on the petition arising from a rent matter, was misconceived and rightly overruled.
Accordingly, the SC ruled that the present petition was maintainable and would be proceeded with in accordance with law.

Six Afghans and one Chinese national were killed, and several others were injured in the blast at a Chinese restaurant in a heavily-guarded part of the city centre.
Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s foreign minister, told a press briefing on Tuesday that China has requested the Afghanistan government to spare no effort in treating the injured.
On Monday, videos shared on social media showed smoke billowing from a large hole torn in the facade of the restaurant building, while debris littered the street outside.

Demand comes after militant group Islamic State claimed the Kabul blast

“We have received 20 people at our hospital,” Dejan Panic, the Afghanistan director of humanitarian group EMERGENCY, said in a statement, adding that seven were dead on arrival.
“Among the wounded are four women and a child.”
The Taliban took control of war-torn Afghanistan in 2021 and said it would restore security, but bomb attacks have continued, many of them claimed by the local arm of the Islamic State group.
Militant group Islamic State claimed the Monday’s blast that tore through a Chinese-run restaurant in the commercial Shahr-e-Naw area, police spokesperson Khalid Zadran said.
The Afghan branch of Islamic State militant group said in a statement it was carried out by a suicide bomber.
The restaurant serving the Chinese Muslim community was jointly run by a Chinese Muslim man, Abdul Majid, his wife, and an Afghan partner, Abdul Jabbar Mahmood, Zadran said. “The nature of the explosion is unkn­own so far and is being investigated,” he said.
The Amaq news agency said the domestic arm of Islamic State had put Chinese citizens on its list of targets, citing “growing crimes by the Chinese government against Uyghurs”. Rights groups accuse Beijing of widespread abuses of Uyghurs, a mainly Mus­­lim ethnic minority group numbering about 10 million.

JERUSALEM: Israeli bulldozers began demolitions at the headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in east Jerusalem on Tuesday, in what the organisation called an “unprecedented attack” and a “serious violation of international law”.
UNRWA spokesman Jonathan Fowler said that Israeli forces “stormed into” the compound shortly after 7am and ejected security guards from the site, before bulldozers entered and began demolishing buildings.
“This is an unprecedented attack against UNRWA and its premises. And it also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the privileges and immunities of the United Nations,” Fowler said.

 

“What happens today to UNRWA can happen tomorrow to any other international organisation or diplomatic mission around the world,” he warned.
The demolition of the UNWRA headquarters comes at a time when a Palestinian children’s football club in the occupied West Bank faces imminent demolition after being threatened by Israel, despite an international campaign to save it, according to a BBC report.
Roland Friedrich, the agency’s director in the occupied West Bank called the move political, saying “it seems the intent is to seize the land for settlement construction as has openly been stated by Israeli officials for many years in the media and elsewhere”.
AFP photos showed heavy machinery demolishing structures at the UNWRA compound, where now an Israeli flag fluttered overhead.
An AFP photographer reported that far-right Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir had made a brief visit to the site. “For years, these supporters of terrorism were here, and today they are being removed from here along with everything they built in this place. This is what will happen to every supporter of terrorism,” the Israeli minister said.
A series of investigations, including one led by France’s former foreign minister Cath­e­rine Colonna, found some ‘neutrality-related issues’ at UNRWA but stressed Israel had not provided conclusive evidence for its headline allegation.
‘Ownership’
In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry defended the de­­molitions and said Israel “owns the Jerusalem compound”.
The compound in Israeli-occupied territory has been empty of UNRWA staff since January 2025, when Israel “banned” its operations in the Gaza Strip.
“UNRWA-Hamas had alrea­­dy ceased its operations at this site and no longer had any UN personnel or UN activity there,” the foreign ministry asserted.
“The compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law,” it insisted.
UNRWA’s Friedrich said the UN rejected the Israeli claim, explaining that the compound “remains United Nations property and is protected by the privileges and immunities of the UN, regardless of whether it is currently in use”.
Though the UNRWA ban applies in east Jerusalem due to its occupation by Israel, the agency still operates in Gaza.
Attempt to erase identity
UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini denounced the demolitions on X, saying it was yet another attempt by “Israeli authorities to erase the Palestine Refugee identity”.







Meanwhile, a Palestinian children’s football club in the occupied West Bank faces im­­minent demolition despite an international campaign to save it, according to a BBC report.
Its supporters say it provides a rare sporting opportunity for young Palestinian players, particularly those living in the nearby Aida refugee camp, while Israel declared it illegal.
On Nov 3, 2025 the children found a notice pinned to the gate of the football field. It was followed soon by a demolition order.

According to the rates issued by the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA) based on interbank exchange rates, the world gold market has surged by $43 per ounce to $4,713.
As per Reuters, gold climbed to a fresh record high as escalating geopolitical tensions boosted safe-haven demand. Gold, seen as a safe store of value during economic and political instability, soared 64pc in 2025 and has added another 10pc since the start of the year. The metal’s rally has also been supported by expectations of US interest rate cuts, which reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.
APSGJA President Qasim Shikarpuri said that investors have intensified their purchases of gold worldwide, including in Pakistan, since US President Donald Trump announced tariffs on European countries.
He said gold jewellery buying in the country continues to get weaker with every fresh increase in local rates. “Families come to the shops for gold, polishing their silver jewellery for their daughters’ wedding instead of purchasing pure gold jewellery,” he said.
Qasim claimed that gold in Pakistan is selling below cost by Rs30,000 per tola compared to Dubai rates.

DAVOS: US President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was ‘no going back’ on his goal to control Greenland, refusing to rule out taking the Arctic island by force and rounding on allies as European leaders struggled to respond.
Trump’s ambition — spelled out in social media posts and mock-up AI images — to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow Nato member Denmark has threatened to blow apart the alliance that has underpinned Western security for decades.
It has also threatened to reignite a trade war with Europe that rattled markets and companies for months last year, though Trump’s Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against what he called “hysteria’ over Greenland.
“As I expressed to everyone, very plainly, Greenland is imperative for National and World Security. There can be no going back On that, everyone agrees!” Trump said after speaking to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.
To drive home the message, Trump posted an AI image of himself in Greenland, holding a US flag. Another showed him speaking to leaders next to a map showing Canada and Greenland as part of the United States.
Separately, he leaked messages including from French President Emmanuel Macron, who questioned what Trump was ‘doing on Greenland’. Trump, who has vowed to impose tariffs on countries that stood in his way, had earlier threatened to hammer French wines and champagnes with a 200pc tariff.







‘New independent Europe’
The European Union has threatened to hit back with trade measures. One option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($109 billion) of US imports that could automatically kick in on Feb 6 after a six-month suspension.
Another option is the “Anti-Coercion Instrument” (ACI), which has never yet been used. It could limit access to public tenders, investments or banking activity, or restrict trade in services, the sector in which the US has a surplus with the bloc, including the lucrative digital services provided by US tech giants.
Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told parliament in Copenhagen on Tuesday the worst may still lie ahead. “We can negotiate about everything political, including security, investments and the economy, but we cannot negotiate our most fundamental values: sovereignty, our country’s identity, our borders, our democracy,” she said.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, which Trump is also due to attend this week, sought to rally leaders around building a “new independent Europe”.
“The seismic change we are going through today is an opportunity, in fact a necessity to build a new form of European independence,” she said.
“We will only be able to capitalise on this opportunity if we recognise that this change is permanent,” she added.
Bessent pushes back against ‘hysteria’
Bessent, also speaking at the Davos gathering of the world’s political and business elite, said a solution would be found that ensures national security for the United States and Europe.
“It’s been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax,” he said. “I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all.”
Asked about the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the US and Europe, Bessent replied: “Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case?… Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath.”
Danish sovereignty over Greenland questioned
Protesters marched in Zurich, Switzerland, late on Monday, carrying a giant banner saying: “TRUMP NOT WELCOME. NO WEF! NO OLIGARCHY! NO IMPERIALIST WARS!”, Swiss newspaper NZZ reported.
The foreign minister of Russia, which has been watching with glee as Trump’s drive to acquire Greenland widens splits with Europe, said that “Greenland is not a natural part of Denmark” and also denied that Moscow had any designs on the island.
“It was neither a natural part of Norway nor a natural part of Denmark,” Sergei Lavrov told reporters in Moscow. “It is a colonial conquest. The fact that the inhabitants are now accustomed to it and feel comfortable is another matter.”

Briefing the media on Tuesday, Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain said the conference would contribute to increased bilateral agricultural trade, expanded investment in priority sub-sectors, modernisation of production and processing systems, and the establishment of commercial partnerships between private sector entities of the two countries.
Cooperation across 10 priority sub-sectors of agriculture includes collaboration in seed production technology; export of heat-treated beef; construction of grain storages and warehouses; strengthening ties for cheese production and export; improvement of local milk processing machinery; export of heat-treated offal; collaboration in buffalo UHT milk and camel milk powder; poultry machinery and technology; chemicals and bio-pesticides; feed mill equipment; renewable technologies in irrigation; value addition in mango pulp and tea; efficient fodder production; fish and shrimp feed technology; fruit processing; development of sweet and seedless Chinese citrus orchards in Pakistan; value addition of rice; soya milk packaging; and exchange of best citrus varieties with mango (chaunsa) variety.

 

Of the 78 agreements signed, 37 were business-to-business investment agreements, 24 joint ventures and 14 partnership agreements. The 10 priority sectors identified were agri-chemicals and inputs; agri-machinery; food processing and value addition; meat and poultry industry; dairy products; fruits and vegetables; animal feed; fisheries and aquaculture; cold chain systems; and food-grade packaging and equipment.

Agriculture formally included as priority area under CPEC 2.0

To ensure implementation of the MoUs, dedicated units were being established in the ministry as well as at the Pakistan Embassy in Beijing to oversee follow-up, the minister said. He added that enhanced cooperation in agriculture would help boost Pakistan’s exports. Currently, Pakistan exports agricultural products worth $8bn, and the government aims to double this figure over the next three years.
Mr Hussain explained that the conference was conceived as a targeted, investment-focused platform rather than a general consultative forum. Its design emphasised direct private sector engagement, investment matchmaking and facilitation support, aligned with national priorities for agricultural modernisation and export-led growth.
He said 116 Chinese companies and 165 Pakistani companies were invited to participate, enabling business-to-business matchmaking between shortlisted firms from both sides. Pakistan also showcased investable projects, value chains and policy reforms. He added that Pakistan had already signed a protocol for milk products with China.
Documents revealed that the food security ministry plans to sign more than 25 sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and export protocols with key partners, including China, in 2026. Pakistan plans to introduce a new seed policy and a national agricultural biotechnology policy to create pathways for GMO seeds.
Proposals are under consideration to allow the export of pesticides and fertilisers under specific conditions, particularly targeting regional and African markets.
The participants of the conference were informed that Pakistan’s annual fruit production exceeds 10 million tonnes, while vegetable production stands at over 9m tonnes. With a rising population, domestic demand is growing at more than 5pc annually.

Speaking for more than an hour before taking questions from reporters, Trump said the UN had potential but added that he had never considered turning to the organisation to help resolve conflicts. Asked whether his envisioned Board of Peace could supplant the UN, he replied that it “might”.
Earlier in the day, Tru­mp released a list of what he described as major achi­e­vements from his first year back in office, highlighting what he portrayed as successes in both domestic and foreign policy.
Public opinion polls released around the same time showed growing voter dissatisfaction with the administration’s immigration policies.
Against that backdrop, the first 15 minutes of Trump’s appearance in the White House briefing room appeared aimed at reshaping public opinion. Holding a stack of printouts detailing immigrants with criminal records detained by US authorities in Minnesota — labelled “the worst of the worst” —the president sought to argue that his immigration policies were producing concrete results.

Presiding over the 22nd meeting of the provincial cabinet at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat, Mr Bugti said that despite similar or higher numbers of such cases in other provinces, particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the issue in Balochistan had been politically exploited for years without any serious effort to find a lasting solution.

 

The chief minister stressed that from Feb 1 onw­ards, no enforced disappearance would take place under the authority of the state or the government.
He maintained that the new legislation would help dispel allegations of enforced disappearances and counter negative propaganda directed at Pakistan. The chief minister said that security forces in Balochistan often operate in grey zones and conduct intelligence-based operations where suspects are detained for investigation. However, he added, the new legal framework would ensure transparency and accountability.

Balochistan cabinet okays detention rules, witness protection bill

Mr Bugti clarified that if individuals were abducted by terrorist groups or went into hiding on their own, the responsibility could not be attributed to the state. He noted that courts and relevant commissions already existed to examine claims of enforced disappearance, but allegations were often amplified without verification to fuel anti-state narratives.

 

To address this, the cabinet approved the rules for the Balochistan Prevention of Detention and De-radicalisation Act, 2025. Under the law, designated centres have been established where suspects will be investigated under the supervision of authorised police officers, along with counselling aimed at countering extremism and anti-state indoctrination.
Families of those under investigation will be informed within 24 hours, allowed visitation and provided medical facilities. No individual will be shifted outside these centres.
During the meeting, the provincial cabinet also approved the Balochistan Witness Protection (Amendment) Bill, 2025. Mr Bugti said that in the past, the absence of an effective witness protection mechanism had led to extremely low conviction rates in terrorism and serious criminal cases. Under the new reforms, witnesses will testify through faceless courts, with their identities kept fully confidential, a measure expected to significantly improve convictions.
The cabinet expressed satisfaction over merit-based recruitments conducted through online testing in the Finance Department and decided to gradually digitalise recruitment processes across all provincial departments.
Among other decisions, the cabinet approved the abolition of the Religious Affairs Department, with staff to be adjusted in other departments, the creation of two new divisions (Pishin and Koh-i-Suleman), administrative realignment of Ziarat with Loralai, and the establishment of Municipal Committee Karbala in Pishin district.
The cabinet also approved policies related to the evaluation of law officers, amendments to grant-in-aid rules for minority affairs, measures to curb child labour, the declaration of higher technical education as an essential service and verification of academic credentials of contract teachers.
The chief minister directed the Chief Minister’s Inspection Team to initiate verification of degrees, warning that FIRs would be registered against holders of fake credentials, starting from Nasirabad and Dera Bugti.
Education-related decisions included adopting the national curriculum as part of the provincial syllabus from the academic year 2026-27, launching the Chief Minister Academic Excellence Programme and hiring ad-hoc teachers for mathematics, science and English at middle, high and higher secondary levels.
In the social sector, the cabinet approved the Balochistan Protection and Promotion of Reproductive Health Rights Bill, 2026, aimed at improving maternal and child health, expanding access to family planning services and safeguarding basic reproductive health rights.

The Sindh chief secretary had formed the body on Monday, comprising Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi and the Karachi additional inspector general, directing that a report be submitted within seven days.
Sources told Dawn that the committee held its first meeting on Tuesday, led by the Karachi commissioner. They said the committee called officials from the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA), the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) Fire Brigade, Rescue 1122 and the owner of the mall and sought details from them.
Meanwhile, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that based on the KMC’s audit of various buildings, the SBCA had started to “take action”.
“A letter with a list of non-compliant buildings has been sent to the Association of Builders and Developers (Abad),” he said on X.
The SBCA letter attached with the post and addressed to the Abad chairman said that the KMC’s fire department had conducted a fire safety audit and identified owners/builders who had failed to meet safety requirements.
It called on the Abad chairman to direct its members to comply with the deficiencies highlighted within three days. “Immediate action is expected in the interest of public safety and the city at large, please,” the letter said.







The fire had erupted on Saturday night. The plaza, parts of which collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three-storey building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
Death toll reaches 28
On Tuesday, a large crowd was seen gathered at the scene, with law enforcement creating temporary barriers to prevent people from going toward the plaza. Smoke could still be seen emanating from the building’s rubble.
Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the death toll had reached 28. She said the dead also appeared to include five women. The police surgeon said that officials had conducted a post-mortem examination of “fragmentary human remains”.
She said that so far, a total of eight bodies had been identified. She said that doctors had collected 48 samples from relatives for DNA profiling and cross-matching.
Karachi South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that out of a total 75 missing persons, the locations of 38 were found to be at Gul Plaza through geo-fencing. He said the location of the remaining could not be confirmed.
He added that DNA samples were sent to the Sindh Forensic DNA and Serology laboratory at the University of Karachi’s International Centre for Chemical and Biological Sciences and they expected the process of cross-matching to continue for the next two to three days.
Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hasssanul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that rescue workers had finally accessed the building’s basement, first and second floors, where both rescue and search operations were underway.
He asserted that the rescue operation would continue until the last missing person was recovered. The spokesperson said that a small portion of the nearby Rimpa Plaza high-rise was “partially” affected by the continuous exposure to heat.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by Keamari police said that the merchandise salvaged from the rubble was being shifted to the KMC Ground, adding that a contingent had been deployed to ensure security.

 


All Gul Plaza records available, SCBA maintains
The SBCA also rejected reports that the building records for the shopping mall were not available, deeming them “baseless and contrary to facts”.
“The impression being given that the records of Gul Plaza are not available with the SBCA is incorrect,” the authority said in a statement. It said that all approved records related to Gul Plaza, including sanctioned plans, completion plans, and construction details, were “preserved and available with the authority”.
According to the SCBA, the building was originally constructed in 1979, while a revised plan was approved in 1998.
“Thereafter, under the Regularisation Amendment Ordinance 2001, the project was duly regularised in 2003 in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations,” SCBA said.
“A revised no-objection certificate (NOC) for sale and advertisement was issued in 2005, under which approval was granted for 175 shops in the basement, 355 shops on the ground floor, 188 shops on the first floor, 193 shops on the second floor, and 191 shops on the third floor, making a total of 1,102 approved shops.”
The SCBA added that the building had two staircases from the basement to the ground floor, six staircases from the ground floor to the first floor, five staircases from the second floor to the third floor, and 16 exit routes on the ground floor for emergencies.
It is worth noting that DIG Raza told Dawn that out of the 16 exits, 14 were closed at the time of the fire.
“The SBCA clarifies that it completely rejects any notion of concealing facts or disappearance of records,” the statement read, maintaining that all legal and technical records related to Gul Plaza were available with the body.
“The SBCA believes in full cooperation and transparent investigations, and a fact-based report will be presented to determine responsibility,” the statement added.
Governor Tessori meets traders
Separately, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori met with traders to discuss the tragedy’s impact on the businesses housed in Gul Plaza. He was flanked by multiple business leaders, including Jawed Bilwani, former president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (KCCI).
Tessori thanked business tycoon Rafiq Pardesi, who he said called him to pledge his services for reconstructing Gul Plaza on a cost-to-cost basis, without any profit.
“We should not play the blame game. Once an incident has occurred, we must pay and compensate for it. We must bring forward those mistakes, but we all must console the traders’ community that has suffered,” the governor said.



While appreciating the Sindh government’s announcement of Rs10 million compensation for the families of the deceased, he underscored the need to take steps to prevent such incidents.
Tessori thanked the Pakistan Navy for sending their fire brigade “within 20 minutes, as well as the police for their efforts. He stressed the need to consult the president of the charred mall’s association and inquire about the management’s role.
“Those involved in such acts, the lower staff, the inspectors who take money for clearing these shops and ignoring safety measures — that money is payment for murder, not bribery,” the governor asserted, pointing out the lack of adherence to safety protocols.
Tessori said he listened to a phone call that a Baloch man made to his seven-months pregnant wife, who was inside the plaza and crying for help.
“Plazas can be reconstructed and everyone will get money. But we all should be afraid of the wails emanating from this city,” he said.
“We must learn lessons from this incident. If such a murderous plaza stands or is about to be built, we must prevent it,” he asserted. The governor noted that legislation stopping such buildings from being constructed existed but lacked implementation.
He called on the KCCI to form a committee to seek reports from the management of plazas, offices and other public spaces about potential safety hazards.
Tessori also said that he would write a joint letter with the Saylani chief to the Karachi mayor proposing that all traders from Gul Plaza be immediately moved to an abandoned parking plaza near Empress Market to return to work.
Meanwhile, Bilwani thanked Tessori and noted that he was the “first” official to reach the site.
He recalled that when the blaze erupted, he urged people to help each other instead of questioning who or what caused the fire. “Karachi’s people are at the forefront in such things [to help others].”
The businessman said he also told CM Murad that traders will prioritise helping those in need after the fire incident instead of blaming others for it.
KP CM conveys condolences to Murad Shah
Meanwhile, in a letter to Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah on Tuesday, his Khyber Pakhtunkhwa counterpart Sohail Afridi conveyed his “heartfelt condolences” over the fire incident.
Stating that he was “deeply saddened” by the incident, the KP CM noted that the blaze “led to the loss of precious lives and caused immense distress to many families”.
“My thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families in this hour of grief, and I sincerely hope for the swift recovery of those who were injured,” the chief minister wrote.
CM Afridi added, “I also wish to convey my sympathies to the Government of Sindh which is confronted with the difficult task of responding to the aftermath of this tragedy.
“At moments like these, the sorrow of one province is felt by the entire nation, and the people and Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stand with the people and Government of Sindh in solidarity and compassion.”







The KP CM’s letter comes after his visit to Karachi earlier this month, when he was accorded a warm welcome by the Sindh government, but the journey ended with him decrying the “treatment” meted out to him by the provincial administration.
During the visit, a meeting with CM Murad was on CM Afridi’s agenda but it did not take place, with both sides placing the fault on the other.
‘65 people remain missing’
On Monday, speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Mayor Wahab said that the tally thus far showed that 65 people were missing.
“Others are saying there are 77 missing, but I can confirm that it is 65,” Wahab said. “Of those 65, we have retrieved and identified 18 bodies. We have retrieved other bodies, but they have not been identified; we are waiting on DNA,” he said.
He said that firefighting operations had concluded, and cooling work was ongoing.
“We have been able to access three areas of the building: we can enter two areas where the structure is still standing, and one portion in the rear that collapsed,” Wahab said.
The mayor added that until last night, reports of movement were received, but when rescuers accessed those areas, there were no signs of life. He said that rescue workers had been told to be mindful of this and instructed to drill with caution.
He said that 1,200 shops were active in the plaza. “Over the years, naturally, problems emerged that need to be investigated for negligence,” Wahab said.
The provincial government has set up an inquiry committee, led by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi, to probe the causes of the fire.
CM Murad on Monday had announced a relief, inquiry and fire-safety reform package, saying the government would support both bereaved families and affected shopkeepers.
The chief minister said the family of each deceased victim would receive Rs10 million in compensation. He also promised assistance for the shopkeepers, saying a special committee had been constituted to help those affected.</p><small>2026-01-20 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646229-pakistan-keeps-airspace-closed-for-india-for-another-month' target='_blank'><strong>India flights barred as Pakistan renews airspace closure for another month</strong></a><br><p>
