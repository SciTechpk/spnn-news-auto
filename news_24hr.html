Monsoon rains fall across the region from June to September, offering respite from the summer heat and are crucial to replenishing water supplies. However, heavy downpours also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas. Under the influence of approaching monsoon currents, Karachi experienced hot and humid weather on Sunday and the Meteorological Depart­ment forecast rain with thunderstorms for today in the city.
Speaking at a press conference in Karachi, Ghani said: “There are chances of severe rains in Sindh, especially in Karachi, with chances of urban flooding … regarding that, whatever is humanely possible, which a person, government or institution can do, we have made those arrangements.”
 


He added that instructions were given earlier as well about rain preparations and that the Sindh chief minister had directed the same in a meeting today as well.
According to the Met Office, rainfall as of 8am at Surjani Town was recorded at 2.4 millimetres, 1.5mm in Gulshan-i-Maymar and Korangi and 1mm at Faisal airbase, while trace rainfall was recorded in Gulshan-i-Hadeed, University Road, Jinnah Terminal, North Karachi, Keamari, Nazimabad and old airport area.
According to a notice by the Sindh Provincial Disaster Management Authority, the Pakistan Meteorological Depart­ment (PMD) has forecast widespread rain and thunderstorms with few moderate to isolated heavy or very heavy falls in the province till August 22, with occasional gaps.
The rains are likely in Karachi, Hyderabad, Jacobabad, Shikarpur, Larkano, Kamber Shahdadkot, Ghotki, Sukkur, Kashmore, Naushahro Feroze, Dadu, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Jamshoro, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Umerkot, Thatta, Sujawal, Badin, Matiari and Tharparker from today.
Ghani added that local councils were told to mobilise their resources and make arrangements specifically for chronic problem areas so citizens face minimal difficulties during the rain.
He also requested people and opposition parties to avoid criticism at a time of calamity, but to focus on helping the people, adding, “later you can criticise whatever is lacking you see — but when there’s a difficulty, I think we should show solidarity”.
Last month, at least six people lost their lives in different incidents of roof collapse, electrocution and drowning during widespread rains in many districts of Sindh.
Sindh CM puts local bodies, administration on high alert
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah chaired an emergency meeting to oversee preparations for the monsoon rains expected to impact Karachi and other parts of the province.
A press release from his office said CM Shah put all the local bodies, administration and traffic police on high alert, and directed them to strengthen coordination between the relevant departments and organisations.
The meeting, held at CM House, was attended by Ghani, Karachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab, Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Principal Secretary to Chief Minister Agha Wasif, Finance Secretary Fayaz Jatoi, Local Government Secretary Waseem Shamshad, and others.
 






The chief minister focused on ensuring the city’s infrastructure was ready to handle the anticipated downpour, while the mayor briefed him on ongoing efforts to improve drainage systems at 44 nullahs and critical choking points across Karachi, with approximately 150 drains under the control of towns undergoing cleaning to facilitate the smooth flow of rainwater.
CM Shah directed Ghani and Wahab to take all necessary steps to minimise disruption and ensure the safety of citizens. Wahab told the chief minister that, in addition to drainage improvements, 120 suction vehicles from the water board were strategically positioned in low-lying areas to clear any accumulated water quickly.
He said the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) was also working closely with the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to secure additional machinery if needed, demonstrating a coordinated approach to disaster management.
Directing all relevant agencies to remain vigilant, the chief minister instructed local government bodies to maintain a fully mobilised presence during the rain spell. He emphasised the importance of proactive measures by the city administration and urged the traffic police to ensure smooth traffic flow, even in the event of heavy downpours.
“The provincial government is fully prepared to manage the rains, but constant vigilance and rapid response from all departments are crucial,” the Sindh chief minister asserted. “Our priority is to protect our citizens and minimise any potential damage caused by the monsoon.”
Residents were advised to stay informed about weather updates and take necessary precautions to ensure their safety during the anticipated rainfall.</p><small>2025-08-18 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18184908e12dece.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931689/countrys-running-well-no-need-for-27th-amendment-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Country’s running well, no need for 27th Amendment: FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday said that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for a 27th Constitutional Amendment.
Even though the 26th Amendment is still mired in controversy, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.
With the 26th Amendment, the government introduced sweeping changes to the judicial framework. Sources had said certain contentious matters, such as a separate constitutional court, left unresolved in the 26th Amendment, would now be taken up in the new amendment.
Speaking to reporters in London during a visit to the United Kingdom, the deputy PM said: “We are still digesting the 26th Constitutional Amendment so there is no need for a 27th right now. The country is running well. There is stability and economic improvement.
“We are putting our full attention towards GDP growth and development. Under [Prime Minister] Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership, all efforts are being made.”
Dar added that under the leadership of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017, Pakistan was “the 24th-biggest economy” and added that the government was working to bring the economy to that point.
“We are headed that way very quickly and we are getting ready to become part of the G20,” Dar said.
Though the speculations are rife, there has been no official word regarding the 27th Constitutional Amendment. At present, the proposal to further reform the judiciary is at a very initial stage, but consultations are reportedly underway within the ruling PML-N and some legal circles. Despite these purported consultations, any draft for this proposed bill has yet to see the light of day.
In June, amid speculation in legal circles about the government planning to bring in the 27th Amendment, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges.
Dar meets British lawmakers of Pakistani origin
As part of an official visit to the UK, Dar had “productive meetings” with British lawmakers of Pakistani origin, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).
The deputy PM arrived in the UK on Saturday ahead of diplomatic engagements with British and Commonwealth leadership from August 17-19. The FO said earlier this week that he would meet British Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, among other senior officials.
In today’s statement, the FO said that Dar met with British members of parliament (MP) Mohammad Yasin, Tahir Ali, Imran Hussain, Ayoub Khan and Adnan Hussain.
“The deputy prime minister/foreign minister underscored the deep historical and cultural bonds between Pakistan and the United Kingdom, which are further strengthened by the vibrant Pakistani diaspora in the UK,” the statement read.
 






During the meetings, Dar highlighted the diaspora’s pivotal role as a bridge between Islamabad and London, fostering mutual understanding, cultural exchanges and robust people-to-people connections, the FO added.
Dar “emphasised Pakistan’s strong commitment to enhancing bilateral parliamentary exchanges with the United Kingdom,” the statement read.
“He noted that such engagements facilitate the sharing of democratic experiences, international best practices and core democratic values, which are vital for the growth and stability of democratic institutions in both countries.”
The FO said that the deputy PM appreciated the efforts of the MPs to bring greater attention to the issue of human rights violations in occupied Kashmir and commended them for raising awareness on the situation in the UK.
In a separate statement today, the FO stated that Dar met UK Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hamish Falconer, at the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), calling their meeting “productive”.
“During the meeting, both sides reviewed the full spectrum of bilateral relations and reaffirmed their shared commitment to deepening cooperation across political, economic, climate and people-to-people domains,” the FO stated.
 






Dar and Falconer also exchanged views on regional and global developments, while the deputy PM highlighted Pakistan’s commitment to economic reforms and shared Pakistan’s perspective on peace and stability in South Asia.
“He (Dar) underscored the importance of the just and peaceful resolution of [the] Jammu and Kashmir Dispute, in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions,” the statement read.
According to the FO, both sides appreciated the trajectory of UK-Pakistani relations and noted the importance of regular, high-level interactions to maintain ties and open up new avenues for cooperation.

The NJPMC, which was set up under an ordinance in 2002, makes recommendations for bringing about an improvement in the capacity and performance of the administration of justice, setting performance standards for judicial officers and persons associated with performance of judicial and quasi-judicial functions, improvement in the terms and conditions of service of judicial officers, court staff and to ensure skilled and efficient judiciary. Last month, the NJPMC constituted a “dedicated committee” to devise an institutional response to the emotive and chronic issue of enforced disappearances in the country.
A press release issued today from the Supreme Court said the committee’s 54th meeting was held under the chairmanship of Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and attended by the high court chief justices, as well as AGP Awan.
In its institutional response to cases of enforced disappearances, the committee “unanimously reiterated the need for a comprehensive mechanism for ensuring [the] production of any detained person before the magistrate within 24 hours”.
The press release added that AGP Awan “ensured that such a mechanism would be developed and placed before the committee in its next meeting”.
Earlier this month, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) revealed that enforced disappearances and other issues were fuelling public alienation and political instability in Balochistan following a fact-finding mission to the province.
According to the report, titled Balochistan’s Crisis of Trust, the HRCP undertook the mission from July 9-12 to respond to the “escalating concerns over the deteriorating state of fundamental rights and civic freedoms in the province”. The mission aimed to examine the state of fundamental freedoms in the province and the broader impact of conflict and militarisation on civilian life, the report said in its terms of reference.
In the first half of 2025, a total of 125 missing persons cases were submitted to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. The total number of cases received up till June 2025 was 10,592, while 1,914 cases of them were disposed of and 6,786 were traced, the commission said.
In December 2024, the Cons­ti­tutional Bench of the Sup­reme Court emphasised that only parliament holds the authority to add­ress and resolve the longstanding, yet unlawful, practice of enforced disappearances — a persistent issue that has plagued the nation for decades.
Protecting judiciary and case disposal timelines
On the issue of safeguarding judicial independence, the press release noted that the NJPMC appreciated the high courts for making standard operating procedures (SOPs), emphasising the “inclusion of stage-wise timelines from complaint filing to final action”.
“It was decided that all such instances of extraneous influence shall be reported within 24 hours and action thereon shall be finalised within 14 days,” the press release added.
The NJPMC said that the SOPs should provide for immediate redressal measures to safeguard the dignity of the complainant judge. It also called for a reporting mechanism to the CJP for information and intervention, where necessary.
“The high courts shall notify the SOPs and share the same with the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan,” the press release said.
The committee also approved the following uniform timelines for the disposal of different categories of cases:

Declaratory suit (land disputes): 24 months
Declaratory suit (inheritance disputes): 12 months
Injunction suit (land disputes): six months
Recovery suit (public revenue/money matters): 12 months
Specific performance (contract enforcement): 18 months
Rent cases: six months
Family suit (dissolution/dower/maintenance/guardianship): six months
Succession cases (uncontested): two months
Execution petitions/family court decree: six months
Execution petitions/banking court decree: 12 months
Execution petitions/civil court decree: 12 months
Execution petitions/rent matters: three months
Criminal trial (juvenile offenders-JJSA, 2018): six months
Criminal trial (punishment up to seven years): 12 months
Criminal trial (punishment above seven years): 18 months
Criminal trial (murder): 24 months
Labour cases: six months

“These timelines would be considered as one of the key performance indicators in judges performance evaluation,” the press release said.</p><small>2025-08-18 14:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619370-pakistan-monsoon-death-toll-tops-650-after-floods-ravage-kp-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan monsoon death toll tops 650 after floods ravage KP, Punjab</strong></a><br><p>

Wang arrived in the Indian capital on Monday for a two-day visit during which he will hold the 24th round of border talks with Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and also meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
“This (discussing border issues) is very important because the basis for any positive momentum in our ties is the ability to jointly maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas,” Jaishankar told Wang in his opening remarks.
It is also important for the two countries to pull back their troops amassed along their disputed border in the western Himalayas since a deadly border clash in 2020, Jaishankar said.
 






India’s foreign ministry said in a social media post that “important engagements of the India-China Special Representatives and on bilateral relations” were scheduled over the next two days.
 






Wang’s visit comes days before Modi travels to China — his first visit in seven years — to attend the summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, a regional political and security group which also includes Russia.
Relations between the Asian giants began to thaw in October after New Delhi and Beijing reached a milestone pact to lower military tensions on their Himalayan border following talks between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Modi in Russia.
The world’s two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for influence across South Asia, and fought a deadly border clash in 2020.
But caught in global trade and geopolitical turbulence triggered by US President Donald Trump’s tariff war, the countries have moved to mend ties.
Restarting border trade across their icy and high-altitude Himalayan border is expected to feature high on Wang’s agenda. Its resumption would be significant for its symbolism, and follows agreements to return direct flights and issue tourist visas.</p><small>2025-08-18 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18175235b8d0a8e.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931684/us-trade-adviser-navarro-says-indias-russian-crude-buying-must-stop' target='_blank'><strong>US trade adviser Navarro says India’s Russian crude buying must stop</strong></a><br><p>White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday said India’s purchases of Russian crude were funding Moscow’s war in Ukraine and had to stop.
New Delhi was “now cosying up to both Russia and China”, Navarro wrote in an opinion piece published in the Financial Times today.
“If India wants to be treated as a strategic partner of the United States, it needs to start acting like one.”
India’s Foreign Ministry has previously said the country is being unfairly singled out for buying Russian oil while the US and European Union continue to purchase goods from Russia.
US President Donald Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods earlier this month, citing New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil. The move will take total tariffs on imports from India to 50pc.
“India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs,” Navarro wrote.
The adviser also said India’s close ties with Russia and China made it risky to transfer cutting-edge US military capabilities to India.
Separately, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s top refiner, will continue to buy Russian oil depending on economics, the company’s head of finance Anuj Jain told an analyst meeting today.
Jain said his company’s Russian oil processing in the June quarter was about 24pc compared to an average 22pc in 2024/25.
He said purchases for the September quarter were continuing and the discounts on Russian oil were in the range of $1.50 per barrel to the Dubai benchmark.
Longtime rivals China and India are quietly and cautiously strengthening ties against the backdrop of Trump’s unpredictable approach to both.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit India from Monday for talks on the disputed border between the two countries.
A planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off, a source said over the weekend, delaying talks on a proposed trade agreement and dashing hopes of relief from additional US tariffs on Indian goods from August 27.</p><small>2025-08-18 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18123039658342b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931651/t20-asia-cup-are-pakistan-right-in-leaving-out-babar-rizwan' target='_blank'><strong>T20 Asia Cup: Are Pakistan right in leaving out Babar, Rizwan?</strong></a><br><p>The rumour mill had been churning for some time now. And yet, the notion of going into the T20I Asia Cup next month without the most experienced batters in the line-up was considered too big of a gamble even for this administration that continues to be crushed under the weight of abysmal results.
Moreover, the hamstring injury to Fakhar Zaman during Pakistan’s last T20I assignment in the Caribbean further fuelled the speculation. But the administration has been crystal clear in its ambitions for the T20I side.
And so Aaqib Javed, one of the four selectors, flanked by head coach Mike Hesson confirmed on Sunday that for the first time in a decade, Pakistan did not intend to take Babar Azam, their highest run-scorer across all international cricket in the last 10 years, to the Asia Cup, as he announced the squad. Mohammad Rizwan was the other notable omission from the squad.
Pakistan have played 14 T20Is this year and both former captains have not featured in any of them.
The implosion
To understand how we got to this point, let us consider how Pakistan have fared with the duo over the last five years.
In 2021, Pakistan’s campaign in the T20I World Cup was unfolding like a fairy tale. They were the first team to qualify for the semi-finals and defeated all five teams in their group to move into the knockouts. They walloped India by 10 wickets to secure the first-ever men’s World Cup win over the arch-rivals and trounced New Zealand, Afghanistan, Namibia, and Scotland.
Come the semi-final game, Pakistan had been the favourites even before the first ball was bowled. They had played their entire ‘home’ cricket in the UAE, the hosts for this tournament, over the last decade, and had been playing like a side that had every right to win the competition.
But then, it all imploded.
 
 

Any mention of that semi-final brings back images of Hasan Ali overrunning the catch or Matthew Wade despatching Shaheen Afridi for three consecutive sixes to overhaul Pakistan’s 176 with an over to spare. Many still criticise Hasan, who had also given 15 runs in the 18th over, and Shaheen.
But the contest had been pretty much settled in Australia’s favour by the first half of the first innings. In yet another conservative batting display, Rizwan Babar put up only 71 runs from the first 10 overs on what was possibly the best batting surface rolled out in that tournament.

Overall, the Riz-Bar partnerships in the 2021 T20I World Cup produced 411 runs at a staggering average of 82.20. No other opening pair came close to that many runs and that average. But their run-rate of 7.33 was the worst among the four sides that made it to the semi-finals.
Pakistan’s overall run-rate in this tournament stood at 8.56, the second best behind England’s 8.66. It underscored the brisk scoring abilities of the batters after Babar and Rizwan, but the openers left too little balls for them to score from. In fact, of the 696 balls that Pakistan played in the 2021 T20I World Cup, Rizwan and Babar faced a whopping 460 — the most balls that number one and two of any team had played in that tournament.
Leave little to the middle order
T20s are won by hitting out the oppositions. To this end, the initial overs, the first six overs (powerplay), in particular, and the first 10 overs, are considered the best phases to gather runs as that is when the conditions are the most in favour of the batting side.
The new Kookaburra ball comes onto the bat nicely and the provision of only two fielders outside the inner-circle in the first six overs opens up huge gaps for the batters, encouraging them to clear the in-field often.
But as the ball gets old and soft, the run scoring becomes challenging. The older ball on surfaces such as the ones in the UAE start to grip. Nowadays, each side has specialised death bowlers for the last five overs, which further impedes run scoring.
Over the years, it has become a norm for teams to load their top-order with power-hitters who can hit boundaries more often and score at blistering rates. Not Pakistan. Until the start of this year, when Rizwan and Babar were part of the line-up, Pakistan continued to play the new ball with caution, rather than attack it, and left it to the middle order to take the side to defensible scores.
 

A comparison of overall and opening partnership run-rates for Test playing nations in T20Is from Jan 1, 2021, until Dec 31, 2024.

There were three T20I World Cups played between 2021 and 2024 and all three were won by teams who lead the overall run-rate chart: India in 2024, England in 2022 (with Pakistan being the finalists), and Australia in 2021.
During this time, Pakistan, already among the bottom half of the 12 teams, were one of the only four sides to have a negative difference between the first-wicket partnerships and overall run-rates. Pakistan’s negative run-rate stood at 0.33. It was the second worst behind India, who had much healthier overall and opening-stand run-rates than Pakistan’s.
The last three T20I World Cups have been played at venues known for their middling scores. That, in theory, perfectly aligns with Pakistan’s conservative batting approach. But all the teams playing in these tournaments had been doing one thing right that Pakistan had not been: their openers had been maximising the powerplays and the first 10 overs.
That Pakistan played the final of the 2022 T20I World Cup in Australia was due to other results going their way and their bowlers rising up to the occasion. They were some noteworthy performances with the bat, but the batting unit, as a collective, failed to click.
Riz-Bar scored at just 6.45 an over. In the list of last four teams, Pakistan’s run-rate was made to look better only by India who had a first-wicket run-rate of 4.98, the second worst in the tournament after Namibia’s 4.44. Openers from New Zealand and England recorded the best run-rates for the first wicket in the entire tournament as they dashed 9.26 and 9.20 runs per overs.
Pakistan will hope that 2024 goes down as the most terrible T20I World Cup in the history for them. They crashed out in the group-stage after the embarrassment of losing to USA — who were making their first appearance in the tournament and were only there courtesy of being the hosts — and India. Pakistan started with Riz-Bar opening against USA and India and sandwiched Saim Ayub between the two — as Babar dropped to number three — for the matches against Canada and Ireland.
 
 

The two opening pairs did not even go at run-a-ball. Their run-rate of 5.37 was almost two runs — 1.87 to be precise — less than what Reeza Hendricks and Quinton de Kock scored at for finalists South Africa, which was the worst among the four semi-finalists. Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, the winning side’s openers, scored 7.82 runs every six balls, and the opening pairs of Afghanistan and England scored at 7.65 and 9.95. England had the best run-rate for the first-wicket in the tournament.
Need for speed
What made Pakistan persist with Riz-Bar was their ability to gather runs consistently. They have put together 2,522 runs at an average of 46.70 and have eight stands of 100 or more in 56 innings. They also have made ten 50-partnerships. They remain the only opening pair to breach the 2,000-run mark in the format.
But these runs have come at a sluggish 7.91 runs per over. It is the second worst run-rate when the top 10 most successful opening partnerships in the history of the format are assembled by the metric.
 

All-time leading opening partnerships in T20Is

More than the number of runs, it is the rate at which they are scored is what matters in this format. Pakistan, more often than not, left out crucial runs batting first and failed to chase the challenging totals when these two batted together for longer.
2024 proved to be the breaking point as Pakistan won only nine of the 26 completed T20Is and the onus of Pakistan’s appalling year was put on how Riwan and Babar approached the game. Six of these wins were against Zimbabwe (two), Ireland (two), and Canada, and the other three were against second-string New Zealand in Christchurch, Rawalpindi, and Lahore.
The two, once again, scored the most runs from their country, but what those runs lacked was impact. Babar was the fifth best run-getter in the world and made 738 at a strike rate of 133.21. Rizwan was 18th on the list with 617 runs at 117.30. Seven more batters made over 100 runs for Pakistan that year and six had better strike rates than Riz-Bar — Fakhar Zaman (152.57), Saim Ayub (143.67), Usman Khan (122.75), Iftikhar Ahmed (115.72), Irfan Khan Niazi (140.36), Shaheen Afridi (130.09), and Shadab Khan (150.68).
Their strike rates gave grimmer reading in the T20I World Cup that year. Rizwan, the captain, made his 110 runs at 90.90 and Babar scored his 122 at 101.66.
The humiliation of a group-stage exit from the home Champions Trophy sparked changes in Pakistan’s T20I set-up. It is often the case in Pakistan that attempts to rectify the blunders of one format in another. Hence, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) removed Rizwan from the captaincy of the shorter-format and dropped him along with Babar from the T20Is altogether to bring in youngsters and lesser experienced players who enjoyed the reputation of being aggressive with the bat.
 
 

The PCB went in overdrive to package these changes as a realisation that they had fallen behind and that this was a much-needed overhaul to evolve with the rest of the world. The selectors, head coach, and captain spoke about the necessity of instilling aggression in the batting, and promised to do it right at the top of the batting order.
That this year’s PSL was the worst for Rizwan and Babar further stressed the necessity of moving on from the two. Rizwan made 367 runs — the least he has scored in the last five years — in 10 matches. Babar’s returns were even worse. He scored 288 runs, which are the least he has made in a single edition of the PSL when he has played more than two matches.
In with the new
The squad Pakistan has announced for the T20I Asia Cup and the tri-series against Afghanistan and hosts UAE in the lead-up to the continental championship comprise players who have now become regular under this head coach and captain. It does not happen in Pakistan that a bunch of players are handed a long rope. But this is important if the management desires from the players to buy in to an ideological shift that it is introducing. Players, especially batters, need to be divorced from the fear of failure if they are asked to play aggressive and high-risk cricket.
Pakistan, this year, have played only one T20I series at home, which they won comprehensively against Bangladesh in Lahore. This new approach is yet to produce results on the road. Out of the three series in New Zealand, Bangladesh, and West Indies, Pakistan have won only the latter, that too 2-1.
“We were challenged with three different surfaces [in each of the three series],” Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson said on Sunday after selector Aaqib Javed announced the squad. “In Lahore, the surfaces were flat and the batting excelled. We went to Bangladesh where they were incredibly challenging and low-scoring games.
“Our top order sets the game up. All the games we won, the top order performed really well. The third game in the West Indies, our openers put on 140 [138]. We need that at a run rate that gets us ahead of the game. T20 is all about setting the game up and being ahead of the game all the time in case you get yourself out. From a batting point of view we’ve got a line-up that can continue to do that.”
 
 

When asked about Babar, Hesson said: “Babar played nicely in the first ODI but missed out on the next two. There’s no doubt Babar’s been asked to improve in some areas around taking on spin and in terms of his strike rate. Those are things he’s working really hard on.
“But at the moment, the players we have selected have done exceptionally well. Sahibzada Farhan has played six games and won three Player of the Match awards. A player like Babar has an opportunity to play in the BBL (Australia’s Big Bash League) and show he is improving in those areas in T20s. He’s too good a player not to consider.”
The series win at home against Bangladesh was followed by their first-ever series defeat to the same opposition in the corresponding series in Mirpur, Dhaka. Pakistan, this year, have won seven of the 14 T20Is.
As it seems, the management would rather lose with the younger lot that they can nurture to play a certain way than with the established players who refuse to alter their approach.</p><small>2025-08-18 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18144947fe430bf.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931669/kp-govt-releases-rs800m-relief-fund-for-flood-hit-areas-rs500m-for-worst-affected-buner' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt releases Rs800m relief fund for flood-hit areas, Rs500m for worst-affected Buner</strong></a><br><p>As flash floods continue to ravage Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the provincial government on Monday released Rs800 million in relief funds for all affected districts, with an additional Rs 500m specifically for worst-hit Buner.
The recent catastrophic floods in KP have claimed at least 325 lives as of Monday and injured 156 people, as the nationwide toll from rain-related incidents since late-June rose to 657.
The KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday announced Rs800m in relief funds to the administrations of affected districts on the instructions of the provincial government.
A separate relief fund of Rs500m has been earmarked for Buner district, which accounts for the majority of casualties with 217 deaths and 120 injuries, according to a PDMA report released today.
Buner was followed by Shangla, with 36 deaths and 21 people injured in flash floods and roof collapses since August 15. At least 95 houses have been damaged— 55 fully — with as many schools partially destroyed.
 






Mansehra and Bajaur recorded 24 and 21 deaths, respectively, and five injuries each. Swat reported 17 deaths and two injuries, but witnessed the heaviest damage to infrastructure as 219 houses have been either fully or partially damaged and 163 cattle have perished.
Five people died and three people were injured in Lower Dir due to flash floods and thunder strikes, while 100 cattle perished. Three people died in Battagram due to flash floods, while a roof collapse in Nowshera killed two people.
PM pledges federal cabinet’s one-month salary for flood relief
PM Shehbaz pledged the federal government’s complete support for flood-hit communities in KP, announcing the donation of one month’s salary from the federal cabinet to aid relief efforts, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Chairing a meeting to review ongoing relief efforts by the federal government in KP, GB and AJK, the prime minister directed federal institutions to intensify efforts to assist citizens in affected districts. The meeting was attended by federal ministers, the NDMA chief and the PM’s chief coordinator.
“In this hour of calamity, there is no federal or provincial government; we must ensure the assistance and rehabilitation of affected people,” PM Shehbaz said. “Helping our distressed Pakistani brothers and sisters is our national responsibility”.
The PM added that this was “not a time for politics but for service and healing the wounds of the people”.
 






The federal government was ordered to provide financial assistance to the families of deceased and affected individuals under the Prime Minister’s relief package.
“Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam will oversee relief and rehabilitation operations in affected areas, while the relevant federal ministers will personally monitor the restoration of electricity, water, roads, and other facilities in affected areas,” the prime minister added.
The PM also instructed all relevant federal ministers to visit the northern areas in person and discouraged the National Highway Authority (NHA) from differentiating between provincial or national highways, stating that opening routes for relief must be the top priority.
He also ordered the communications ministry, NHA, and Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) to repair highways and bridges in affected areas.
“[The] minister for communications should personally oversee rehabilitation operations,” the PM ordered.
Additionally, the minister for power was tasked with visiting affected areas and inspecting and prioritising restoration of the electricity system.

“The NDMA should present a comprehensive plan for the distribution of relief items to flood victims in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the prime minister said, instructing the finance ministry to provide the necessary resources to the authority.
The relevant federal ministers were directed to remain in affected areas “until the last person received assistance and basic infrastructure was restored”.
“[The] ministry of health should send medicines and medical teams to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and establish medical camps, while [the] Benazir Income Support Programme should be mobilised to assist the affected,” the prime minister ordered.
Participants in the meeting were briefed on the ongoing relief activities by the NDMA and federal ministers. They were informed that the federal government, provincial governments, the Pakistan Army and other institutions had established 456 relief camps and conducted 400 rescue operations so far.
The meeting was briefed that relief trucks carrying essential items were being dispatched, while the prime minister ordered that convoys be sent to the hardest-hit areas.
According to the preliminary estimates, damages to public and private property exceeded around Rs126 million.
Meanwhile, the NDMA presented a report on the provision of rations, tents, medicines, medical teams and other essential items, with the prime minister ordering that more relief goods be dispatched.
The meeting’s participants were informed that the monsoon season would continue until the second week of September, with two major spells of rain expected and six having already passed.
Muqam briefed the meeting on the situation in Swat, while Power Minister Awais Leghari delivered a briefing on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Special Assistant to the PM Mubarak Zeb briefed the meeting on Bajaur, while the NHA chairman reported on Malakand and the communications secretary briefed the meeting on the situation in Gilgit.
Restoration of flood-affected areas a national obligation: Tarar
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that rescue, relief and restoration of  flood-affected areas was a “national obligation”, assuring that the federal and provincial governments would work collectively to fulfil this responsibility.
During a media briefing alongside Climate Change Minister Musaddiq Malik and NDMA Chairman  Lieutenant General Inam Haider in Islamabad, Tarar said an important meeting was chaired by  Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif today  on the recent flooding caused by monsoon rains.
Tarar said ongoing rescue and relief activities in flood hit areas was discussed in the meeting and improved  coordination was ongoing with provincial governments.
He noted that several meetings were held at the National Command and Control Center before the monsoon rains hit, with representatives of all provincial governments participating.
“Data has been regularly provided by the NDMA to the relevant authorities through the Early Warning System,” Tarar said.
He added that relief activities were being carried out by the armed forces and other organisations in flood-affected areas across KP, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The communications secretary was already in GB to supervise restoration of the Skardu-Gilgit Road, Tarar said, while the National Highway Authority chairman was in Malakand Division leading efforts to restore roads.
Similarly, Tarar said, Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam was also in Buner monitoring rescue and relief work.
“The prime minister has instructed the ministers for water, power and communications to ensure their presence in these areas to personally monitoring restoration work of  infrastructure related to their respective ministries,” he said.
Monsoon threat to persist till end August: NDMA
During today’s briefing, NDMA chairman Haider warned that monsoon conditions would remain precarious until the end of August, with normalisation expected by late September.
He warned that the country remains at risk of further torrential downpours, with two to three additional spells likely in the coming weeks.
“The last spells will end by Sept 10, and the overall situation is expected to normalise by the end of September,” he said.
He added that search operations are underway for missing people, who would be added to the official death toll if not found.
“More than 425 relief camps have been set up in flood-hit areas, offering essential supplies and medical care,” Haider said. “Displaced families are also being accommodated in government buildings, including schools.”
Food distribution under the Prime Ministers Ration Programme is ongoing, in coordination with provincial governments and relevant authorities, he added.
The NDMA chairman said that special army units have been deployed on the directions of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), with critically injured individuals were being airlifted to hospitals.
“Field ambulances are actively transporting patients, and major hospitals are fully engaged,” he said, adding that the National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) remains on high alert and is continuously releasing multi-source data to support relief efforts.
“Pakistan Army Aviation bases have activated reserve systems to support emergency evacuations during the ongoing monsoon emergency.”
Practical and moral need for aid: Saeed Ghani
Sindh Minister for Local Government, Housing and Town Planning Saeed Ghani condoled with the victims of the KP floods, adding that the Sindh government had offered to send aid to KP.
Addressing a press conference in Karachi, he acknowledged that the toll was a “huge number”, with many people still missing. “The nation has shown solidarity with the people of KP, GB, Kashmir,” the minister said.
“The Sindh government has even sent aid, but I heard that the government said this morning that they do not require any,” he added. “I thought this was unreasonable. There is a practical and moral need for aid and for the country to show unity.”
Ghani stated that the Sindh government “sent some items” and would not hold back if anything else was needed.
“We have faced such crises in the past. Sometimes, incidents happen that even the provincial and federal governments cannot tackle together,” he said.
“International organisations have come forward and helped us, such as the UN, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
“These are threats that will not go away, despite our efforts,” Ghani said.

Pakistan generates millions of tonnes of solid waste annually, but only a small fraction of sewage is treated. Inadequate sanitation in urban areas leads to recurring floods, waterborne illnesses and the resurgence of preventable diseases such as cholera, dengue and polio.
The chief minister is currently on a five-day visit to Japan. A statement from her office said CM Maryam issued the order during a visit to Japan’s largest wastewater treatment plant in Yokohama today.
 






“Japan’s modern technology and methods will be used for sewage and waste management in Punjab,” the statement quoted her as saying.
The statement added that she inspected the waste treatment systems of Asahi, Yokohama City, Kanagawa, Washimaku and Yodogawa.
According to the statement, the chief minister was given a detailed briefing on methods of collecting garbage and wastewater, along with waste disposal systems of Japanese cities.
 






She was apprised by the authorities that Yokohama was “the second largest city in Japan in terms of population” and that its Solid Waste and Wastewater Treatment Plant treated 1.5 million litres of wastewater daily.
“Yokohama Waste Treatment Plant is also operating several plants that generate energy from waste. This energy is used for heating systems for the local population,” the statement cited the Japanese authorities as saying, adding that the plant was an “ideal institution for disposal of waste using modern technology and methods”.
“Despite being an industrial city, Yokohama is at the top of [the] highest environmental standards,” they said.
The chief minister was told that waste was separated into reusable components through a “modern plant and automated system”.
She said that this environmental and urban development model would be implemented in Punjab.
The chief minister also attended a briefing on urban development at Yokohama’s Town Hall, where she participated in a discussion on bringing the construction quality of roads and buildings in Punjab “to the level of Japan”.
 






“City-to-city” cooperation was also agreed on in various sectors between Yokohama and the province of Punjab, according to posts by the PML-N.
 






Under her leadership, Punjab has emerged as a frontrunner in environmental governance. The province recently launched Pakistan’s first Environmental Protection Force, implemented a ban on single-use plastics and equipped over 1,500 construction sites with dust suppression systems in Lahore.</p><small>2025-08-18 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/181432423468e92.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931664/afghan-leaders-women-activists-to-hold-dialogue-in-islamabad-next-week-think-tank' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan leaders, women activists to hold dialogue in Islamabad next week: think tank</strong></a><br><p>An Islamabad research institute is set to host Afghan leaders and women activists this week to discuss the regional peace and stability, organisers said on Monday.
Pakistan and Afghanistan have witnessed an improvement in bilateral relations after taking steps to improve ties, such as the revival of the Joint Coordination Committee and upgrading diplomatic ranks.
The South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (Sassi) University will organise the dialogue on August 25 and 26, according to Dr Maria Sultan, the think tank’s chairperson and director general.
While both neighbouring countries have held bilateral engagements at the government level, this will be the first such Pak-Afghan dialogue since the 2021 Taliban takeover of Kabul.
Some Afghan TV channels and media run by Afghan journalists in exile contended that Pakistan has invited anti-Taliban leaders. However, the Sassi University chairperson denied that the dialogue was against the Taliban or other Afghan political parties.
Sultan said, “The main purpose is to discuss peace and stability. This will also provide an opportunity for Afghans to discuss the situation in Afghanistan and adopt a joint stance.”
The two-day conference will be a closed-door event, which will also mark the beginning of the Islamabad Process, according to Sultan. To a question, she said that the Taliban and other political parties have not been invited, but they would be in future meetings.
Former United States special representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad termed the meeting “unwise” due to the participation of some who oppose the Taliban. “Afghan citizens are entitled to their political views, but Pakistan’s seeming support of them by hosting their conference is hugely unwise and an intended provocation,” he wrote on X.
 






However, Afghan leaders slammed Khalilzad for opposing the gathering to discuss the situation in their country.
Former Afghan parliamentarian Fawzia Koofi, who confirmed to Dawn.com that she has been invited to the dialogue, noted: “Engagement with regional countries is key in influencing the situation in Afghanistan.
“If regional countries, including Pakistan, are willing to provide a space for such dialogue, this should be welcomed as a positive step towards building trust between the people of both countries.”
Responding to Khalilzad’s remarks, she said, “Some former diplomats object; is it because they want to be the Arctic of our country’s destiny forever? Isn’t it time to let us craft what is good for us?”
Koofi further said women’s groups, as well as political and civil society representatives, must be able to meet and discuss the future of their country and its women.
 
 

“Women and girls in my country are enduring one of the most repressive realities in the world today. We must collectively support any initiative that leads to a peaceful settlement and restoring women’s rights in Afghanistan,” Koofi stressed.
Sultan evaded questions about Khalilzad’s comments but highlighted that the former envoy had led the US in talks with the Taliban in Qatar, but now he opposes a meeting of Afghans to discuss the future of their country.
“The meeting would be Afghan-owned and will be attended by various segments of the society,” she said, adding that a meeting should not be a matter of concern for anyone.
Ambassador Asif Khan Durrani, Islamabad’s former special representative for Kabul, told Dawn.com that Pakistan should not take sides on Afghanistan’s matters.
“If it’s an academic exercise, then it’s okay. The purpose should be to appraise yourself with the overall political scenario in Afghanistan without taking sides. Since it’s an open event, the public should know its findings,” Ambassador Durrani noted.
When asked about the impression that Pakistan will host anti-Taliban leaders, he said, “As regards anti-Taliban composition, then the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) are anti-Pakistan and enjoying the Afghan Taliban’s hospitality. So, any objections to the above lines are uncalled for.”
 
 

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar visited Kabul in July, where an agreement was signed for the Pakistan, Uzbek­istan and Afghanistan railway project to boost regional connectivity. Later that month, Dar said Pakistan received “recent assurances” from Afghan authorities that the neighbouring country’s soil would not be used for terrorism.
Islamabad has repeatedly demanded that Kabul take action against the banned TTP. In January, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir noted that the only point of contention between the two countries was the presence of the TTP and cross-border attacks.</p><small>2025-08-18 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1811403513fc8fe.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931656/security-agencies-foiled-balochistan-suicide-attack-on-independence-day-cm-bugti' target='_blank'><strong>Security agencies foiled Balochistan ‘suicide attack’ on Independence Day: CM Bugti</strong></a><br><p>Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Monday said security agencies had arrested an alleged “would-be suicide bomber” as they foiled a terrorist attack on Independence Day.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
Addressing a press conference in Quetta alongside other top officials, the chief minister said: “On August 14, the suicide bombers had planned to target innocent citizens who were celebrating Independence Day.”
He commended the security agencies, the Balochistan Counter-Terrorism Department, and the police for saving the province from “huge destruction”.
CM Bugti then aired a recorded statement of a highly educated man who had been arrested for his alleged involvement in facilitating terrorists.
In the video, the man, working as a lecturer at Balochistan University, confessed to having links with terrorist groups.  After airing the man’s statement, CM Bugti noted that the information being shared was “not in great detail”, so as not to sabotage ongoing investigations.
He recalled that the Nov 2024 Quetta Railway Station bombing, in which “32 precious lives were lost and 50-plus were injured”, and explained how the arrested lecturer was allegedly involved in facilitating the attack.
“He (the lecturer) had him (the suicide bomber) sit on a motorcycle and dropped him near the railway station, and after that, handed him over to another handler about one kilometre away from the railway station,” Bugti said.
 


Stating that some attributed the Balochistan militancy issue to “deprivation”, the chief minister rhetorically asked: How are these people deprived?
“The mother is still receiving a pension which means she was a government employee, his wife is also a government employee, he himself is a Grade-18 [officer], has studied and done a PhD on Pakistani scholarship, brother is an employee in Reko Diq [project], which means he was not deprived in any way,” Bugti added.
CM Bugti explained that the BLA’s Majeed Brigade operated in “three to four tiers” — “footsoldier” being the lowest and comprising uneducated people, the second tier using women for targeted killings in cities, and the top-most “sophisticated” tier that the lecturer was a part of.
“This is the first time security forces have accomplished such a big success, of arresting a leader of Majeed Brigade’s ‘sophisticated’ tier,” Bugti said.
He said that the narrative about “deprived people engaging in such acts”, which he noted was also echoed in a multi-party conference (MPC) in Islamabad yesterday, was “an attempt to legitimise this entire fight against Pakistan”.
In a gathering organised by the Awami National Party on Sunday, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman questioned the government’s writ in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s tribal areas. Balochistan National Party-Mengal and Jamaat-i-Islami were among the various parties that attended the moot.
 
 

Bugti mentioned that when the CTD went to arrest the “would-be suicide bomber”, his neighbours intervened and tried to resist the arrest.
“I want to tell the people of Balochistan: we filed an FIR (first information report) against all of them, every one of them is arrested.
“But please, stay away from these people. If you stay close to them, you will also be treated like a suicide bomber,” he advised.
“This has nothing to do with unparalleled or underdevelopment,” Bugti said, again criticising yesterday’s MPC for terming violence in KP as terrorism but describing the militancy in Balochistan as “something else”.
“We are not in favour of collective punishment. But the Balochistan government will also see when relatives of those who join these groups do not alert their security agencies, political leadership or tribal elders, which means the entire family is involved,” Bugti warned.
Responding to reporters’ queries, the Balochistan CM, while asserting he did not want to “go into any blame game”, said it seemed the previous provincial governments had divorced themselves from the issue.
 
 

Pointing out the listing of individuals in the Fourth Schedule, Bugti stressed the importance of further strengthening the CTD’s Special Branch for improved intel.
“We have investigated 2,000 to 2,500 people, especially government employees. Some were innocent and their names were from the Fourth Schedule, some were sent explanation letters, some were suspended, some were terminated.
“We will not spare. We’ll fight this war, in warfare and lawfare too,” CM Bugti asserted.
“Those who wish to talk to us will find our doors open,” the chief minister said, urging all political parties to stand against terrorism and to acknowledge the state’s sacrifices in countering it.
‘Betrayal of state’
In his statement, the lecturer provided details of his alleged links to terrorist outfits, saying that in 2020, he was introduced to three individuals affiliated with “an organisation”, two of whom were later killed. He said that two men, Dr Habetan and Feh Khaliq, got him to join a militant group and had him meet with a man named Basheerzai.
He said that all introductions were carried out through the Telegram messaging app, known for privacy features like secret chats, self-destructing messages, and anonymity.
The lecturer recalled that, on the instructions of Dr Habetan and Feh Khaliq, he had assisted the group by providing shelter to a militant injured in a clash in Kalat and stated that he had handed the man over to another individual before the incident, and that the militant died the next day in a railway suicide bombing.
He further recounted another incident in which he sheltered a man for seven to eight days, who was later intended to be used in an August 14 attack. The lecturer also confessed that he had purchased a pistol, which was subsequently used in targeting security forces and government employees.
The man expressed regret over his actions, admitting that they were unlawful and amounted to a betrayal of the state.</p><small>2025-08-18 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619344-rubio-says-us-keeping-eye-on-pakistan-india-after-trump-brokered-ceasefire' target='_blank'><strong>Rubio says US keeping 'eye on Pakistan, India' after Trump-brokered ceasefire</strong></a><br><p>

The rate reduction signifies a significant reversal of the tariff hike imposed on April 2, 2025, when Washington, under its ‘reciprocal tariffs’ policy, introduced additional duties on over 60 trading partners to address trade imbalances. These tariffs ranged from 10–50pc, with Pakistan initially placed in the higher bracket, alongside other developing states.
Beyond public statements by US President Trump and Pakistani leadership, detailed information about the trade deal remains scarce in the public domain. Key official sources, such as the US Department of Commerce, have yet to release details of the agreement.
The existing Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, signed in 2003, probably continues to serve as the main platform for bilateral discussions. In Pakistan as well, economic ministries have not yet published comprehensive details online.

While tariff relief is a positive development, industry experts caution that it addresses only one facet of Pakistan’s broader trade competitiveness challenges

 
 

However, media reports suggest that Pakistan has agreed to offer duty-free access to US goods and facilitate American investment in key sectors such as oil, minerals and crypto. Reportedly, over 4,000 US products now face zero tariffs in Pakistan.
“The goal is to translate recent diplomatic progress into tangible economic gains,” a senior official shared in confidence. “We are hopeful for further tariff concessions, particularly in light of rising imports of oil and other goods from the US. Currently, the trade balance is in our favour, though the total volume is relatively modest.
“Now the onus is on the private sector. They must rise to the occasion and capitalise on the relative advantage this agreement offers over regional competitors in the US market,” he added.
Following recent developments, a Pakistani refinery has secured a crude oil shipment from the United States, expected to arrive soon.
Usama Qureshi, Vice Chairman, Cnergyico Pk Ltd, confirmed the oil deal, stating, “The government encouraged the refining sector to explore US crude imports as part of efforts to strengthen bilateral trade. We evaluated West Texas Intermediate for its pricing, yield benefits and freight economics. Once we found it commercially viable, we finalised the deal. If the results of the first cargo prove favourable, we may scale up imports to as much as one million barrels per month.”
 
 

Haroon Akhtar, Special Advisor to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production, currently on an official visit to Osaka, Japan, responded promptly to queries and shared an optimistic view of the evolving trade engagement with the United States.
“Pakistan has exportable surplus capacities in several industries, especially in value-added textiles, which hold strong potential for increased exports,” he noted.
He clarified that trade talks with the US are being formally led by the ministry of commerce. “I serve on the prime minister’s steering committee overseeing trade terms, but the ministry of industries is not part of the negotiating team,” he added.
Commenting on private sector involvement, Mr Akhtar said, “Extensive consultations were held with private businesses at every stage of the negotiation process.”
The duty reduction has strengthened Pakistan’s competitive position in the US market. While regional rivals like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Vietnam face 20pc tariff, and India up to 50pc, Pakistani exports now benefit from a comparatively lower 19pc rate. The US remains one of Pakistan’s top export destinations, with the trade surplus largely driven by textile shipments.
According to the US trade representative, total bilateral trade in goods and services between the US and Pakistan reached $10.1 billion in 2024. This comprised $7.2bn in goods trade and $2.9bn in services. The US recorded a $3bn goods trade deficit, with exports to Pakistan at $2.1bn and imports from Pakistan at $5.1bn. In services, however, the US held a modest surplus of $610m, exporting $1.7bn worth and importing $1.1bn.
 
 

While tariff relief is a positive development, industry experts caution that it addresses only one facet of Pakistan’s broader trade competitiveness challenges. Structural bottlenecks, such as high energy costs, complex tax and refund procedures, and erratic policy changes, continue to undermine the country’s ability to fully leverage international market opportunities.
Contrary to Mr Akhtar, Dr Khurram Tariq, former president of the Faisalabad Chamber and current Chairman of Kay and Emms, expressed disappointment over the exclusion of private sector representatives from US trade deal talks. “I was part of the planning working group, but none of the four private sector members were taken on the negotiation trip, even though we offered to self-finance,” he said.
While acknowledging the 1pc edge over Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Vietnam, he called it “notional” given Pakistan’s far higher production costs due to elevated interest rates and energy prices. “If we had parity with countries facing 10pc additional tariffs, like Turkey or Egypt, it could have significantly boosted exports and helped address our foreign exchange needs,” he added.
Musadiq Zulqarnain, a prominent exporter, supported government-led trade talks, citing the diverse interests across sectors. “While textiles and apparel are key, other products matter too, and the talks go beyond exports to broader trade and investment. Taking businessmen along could complicate things. That said, the government has remained in consultation, both locally and during talks. I have personally been in touch throughout,” he noted.

The average size has fallen from 6.4 acres in 2010 to 5.1 acres in 2024. Over the same period, the number of farms increased by 42 per cent — from 8.26 million to 11.7m. This shift is hardly surprising in a country with the region’s highest population growth rate of 2.55pc.
Among several factors, generational inheritance and the unchecked sprawl of housing colonies across cities and towns are two major drivers of farmland fragmentation. Therefore, one thing is certain: the trend is likely to intensify in the years ahead, due to exponential population growth and growing urbanisation.
However, the fundamental question is whether the continuing reduction in farm sizes aligns with the natural evolution of Pakistan’s agriculture sector.
Until just a few decades ago, farming in Pakistan relied heavily on oxen for almost every task — from ploughing fields and lifting water from wells to threshing wheat and transporting produce. In such a labour-intensive system, landlords had no choice but to keep tenants who owned a pair of oxen and could provide family labour, typically cultivating eight to 12 acres per family on a crop-sharing basis.

Lacking enabling factors, smallholders struggle as farming evolves to large, capital-intensive enterprises

This partly explains why proponents of agrarian socialism (leftists) in Pakistan have consistently advocated reforms since 1947, calling for caps on landholdings and redistribution of surplus land to landless farmers that are actually doing the work.
 
 

Over the past two decades, however, rapid mechanisation has been transforming Pakistan’s agricultural landscape, especially in Punjab. Today, there is no dearth of farmers who can easily manage hundreds of acres with only a handful of employees, aided by machines such as combine harvesters, rice transplanters, corn planters, corn pickers, potato planters and diggers, laser land levellers, and even drones for pesticide spraying. Farming has thus evolved into a capital-intensive corporate enterprise, run on the same management principles as any other business.
This transformation has shaken the very foundations on which the leftists’ case for land reforms once rested. Landlords no longer need a large number of workers in general, and tenants in particular. As a result, the tenant system has, for the most part, disappeared from Punjab’s private farms. In this new dynamic, many passive or absentee landlords now prefer renting out their land rather than engaging tenants, unless they have any political motives.
With agriculture becoming increasingly capital-intensive, the sector is tilting in favour of large farms — a sharp reversal from the past. Small farms are now at a clear competitive disadvantage; their survival has become even harder as the government is gradually withdrawing agricultural subsidies and crop support prices.

Until a few decades ago, farming relied heavily on oxen for almost every task and landlords had no choice but to keep tenants with their own livestock who could provide family labour and cultivate 8–12 acres

Today, most smallholders can no longer afford even a tractor and a tubewell — the two most basic farming necessities. Their limited landholdings make such capital-intensive investments financially impractical due to underutilisation, compounded by their chronic financial constraints. In the absence of farmers’ cooperatives, they are left to rent tractors and buy irrigation water from neighbouring tubewells. Sadly, exorbitant machinery rental charges drive up their production costs.
 
 

This financial squeeze is aggravated by lower crop yields, as sizeable farms are better positioned to adopt mechanisation, use high-yielding expensive seeds, apply optimal quantities of inputs, and maximise land utilisation by reducing field corners and watercourses. Likewise, tractors and other machinery consume less time and fuel (per acre) when operating on larger fields.
Compounding the crisis, government policies — widely seen as anti-farmer — have further undermined the prospects of small farms. Input prices continue to rise, crop prices are falling, and climate change is driving a sharp decline in crop yields, all while farm sizes steadily shrink. Collectively, these pressures have eroded the economic viability of smallholdings and put the country’s broader agricultural productivity at serious risk.
Several countries — including India and Bangladesh — have smaller average farm sizes, yet their smallholders have managed to mechanise and prosper thanks to generous government subsidies, well-functioning cooperatives, and the adoption of appropriate technologies, such as walk-behind power tillers in Bangladesh.
 
 

In Pakistan, which lacks such enabling factors, reverse leasing — where smallholders rent out their land to larger farmers — has become increasingly common, particularly in Punjab. For many, it offers a safer and more profitable alternative to cultivating land on their own.
However, this is not the only option for smallholders, as two other potential survival strategies remain; the first is to shift towards labour-intensive, high-value crops, though this appears impractical given that nearly 7m farms — the vast majority — are under five acres. The second is to form organised cooperatives that pool machinery, purchase inputs in bulk, and market produce collectively to secure better margins.
Let us see what policy measures the government takes down the road to tackle this growing crisis.

With over 5.2 million businesses spread across manufacturing, services, and trade, SMEs contribute nearly 40 per cent to the GDP and employ more than 80pc of the non-agricultural labour force. From the furniture makers of Gujrat to the tech startups of Karachi, these businesses reflect the diversity and potential of Pakistan’s economic landscape.
Yet, despite their significant contribution, many SMEs are unable to reach their full potential. The journey from potential to performance remains difficult for many, primarily due to structural and systemic barriers. While there have been positive efforts by both public and private sectors to support SMEs, including initiatives from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the SME Development Authority (SMEDA), many small businesses continue to face considerable challenges.
After reviewing hundreds of SME financing proposals over the years, one theme consistently stands out: potential is not the problem — access is. Many businesses struggle to scale due to obstacles such as limited credit access, weak legal frameworks, and insufficient enabling infrastructure.

Small businesses account for the majority of private sector activity but receive less than 7pc of private sector credit, one of the lowest ratios in South Asia

Access to capital remains a persistent barrier for the sector. SMEs account for the majority of private sector activity in Pakistan but receive less than 7pc of private sector credit, one of the lowest ratios in South Asia. The core issue lies in how “bankable” businesses are defined.
Traditional lending models in Pakistan are collateral-based, meaning banks prefer assets such as titled land or property. However, most SMEs operate from leased premises, home setups, or shared spaces — meaning their largest assets, such as inventory, receivables, and talent, don’t qualify as acceptable collateral.
Take the example of Ali, a furniture exporter from Gujarat, who landed a sizable export order from a UAE client, with an upfront partial payment and healthy profit margins. Yet, when he applied for a Rs10m loan to fulfil the order, he was denied as he didn’t own a property in major cities like Lahore or Karachi. Despite a strong business case and verified buyer, the exporter couldn’t meet the rigid collateral-based requirements of a traditional lending system. Ali’s story, however, is not unique. Many businesses with real potential are being held back not by a lack of demand, but by outdated lending norms.
Banks are waking up to the reality that the SMEs need far greater support — and that their financing struggles have gone unaddressed for far too long. What’s needed now is a broader shift in how we assess creditworthiness. It’s time the entire industry moved towards expanding cash-flow-based lending, where financing is tied to a business’s revenue stream rather than physical assets alone.
Additionally, expanding credit guarantee schemes, where risk is shared between the bank and the SME, can encourage more lending to this vital sector. Institutions such as the Pakistan Credit Guarantee Company continue to play a key role in this area, but a wider adoption of these models is crucial for SME growth.
Another challenge the SME sector faces in Pakistan is the weak legal enforcement and recovery framework. Even when banks are willing to lend, recovering loans from SMEs is often a painful process. One of the core issues is Pakistan’s weak foreclosure framework, which allows defaulters to delay or avoid repayment, discouraging banks from increasing their SME exposure.
A key element in this story is Section 15 of the Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, introduced in 2001 to allow banks to recover collateral without going through drawn-out court procedures. It aimed to speed up loan recovery and reduce the risks of lending. However, in 2013, the Supreme Court struck it down, stating that foreclosure without judicial oversight violated Article 10-A of the Constitution — the right to a fair trial. For the next three years, banks operated without a clear legal pathway to recover collateral. This legal vacuum severely impacted SME financing, as lenders grew wary of the risk.
In 2016, Section 15 was reenacted by the government, with a few amendments providing the right to a fair trial to customers, as per the spirit of Article 10-A; however, the same was immediately challenged before the higher courts. The Lahore High Court upheld it in March 2020, and in October the same year, the Supreme Court dismissed appeals against it. This reaffirmed banks’ rights to foreclose on collateral.
However, in practice, recovery remains slow and uncertain due to court delays, frivolous litigation, and a lack of enforcement. Legal ambiguity continues to paralyse the very purpose Section 15 was meant to serve.
A real-life example illustrates the problem clearly. A textile SME in Faisalabad defaulted on a Rs50m loan. The lending bank initiated recovery under Section 15, but the borrower filed a false claim of repayment and secured a stay order. Over the next four years, the case remained stuck in court while the borrower moved assets and continued operations under a different name. The bank eventually absorbed the financial loss and, unsurprisingly, reduced its future SME lending. This is not an isolated case — it reflects a broader pattern across the financial sector.
To address this issue and unlock SME financing, targeted legal reforms are essential. First, stay orders should be time-bound — limited to two to three months unless there is a compelling reason to extend. Second, courts must ensure both parties are heard before granting a stay, to prevent misuse. Third, fast-track procedures should be introduced with fixed timelines for collateral auctions. Lastly, tax incentives should be offered to auction buyers by removing or reducing the seller’s tax liability, increasing participation and speeding up asset realisation.
Unless these reforms are implemented, banks will continue to avoid SME lending, depriving the economy of its most dynamic growth engine. Fixing the foreclosure framework is not just about protecting lenders, it’s about creating a healthier, more inclusive financial system for Pakistan.
The future of Pakistan’s economy will be shaped not in boardrooms but in workshops, warehouses, and small offices across the country. If we want truly inclusive and sustainable growth, empowering SMEs is not optional — it is essential.

But as Taliban authorities swept to power and tightened their grip on the country, they have pushed for Afghanistan’s water sovereignty, launching infrastructure projects to harness precious resources in the arid territory.
Dams and canals have sparked tensions with neighbouring states, testing the Taliban authorities’ efforts to build strong regional ties, as they remain largely isolated on the global stage since their 2021 takeover.
At the same time, the region is facing the shared impacts of climate change intensifying water scarcity, as temperatures rise and precipitation patterns shift, threatening glaciers and snowpack that feed the country’s rivers.
Here are key points about Afghanistan’s transboundary water challenges:
Central Asian states to the north
Afghanistan is emerging as a new player in often fraught negotiations on the use of the Amu Darya, one of two key rivers crucial for crops in water-stressed Central Asia, where water sharing relies on fragile accords since Soviet times.
Central Asian states have expressed concern over the Qosh Tepa mega canal project that could divert up to 21 per cent of the Amu Darya’s total flow to irrigate 560,000 hectares of land across Afghanistan’s arid north, and further deplete the Aral Sea.
Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan are likely to face the biggest impact, both joined by Kazakhstan in voicing alarm, even as they deepen diplomatic ties with the Taliban authorities — officially recognised so far by only Russia.
“No matter how friendly the tone is now,” water governance expert Mohd Faizee warned,  “at some point there will be consequences for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan when the canal starts operating”.
Taliban officials have denied that the project will have a major impact on the Amu Darya’s water levels and pledged it will improve food security in a country heavily dependent on climate-vulnerable agriculture and facing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.
“There is an abundance of water, especially when the Amu Darya floods and glacial meltwater flows into it” in the warmer months, said project manager Sayed Zabihullah Miri, during a visit to the canal works in Faryab province, where diggers carved into a drought-ridden plain dotted with camels and locusts.
Iran to the west
Iran is the only country with which Afghanistan has a formal water sharing treaty, agreed in 1973 over the Helmand river, which traverses Taliban heartland territory, but the accord was never fully implemented.
Longstanding tensions over the river’s resources have spiked over dams in southern Afghanistan, particularly in periods of drought, which are likely to increase as climate shocks hit the region’s water cycle.
Iran, facing pressure in its parched southeastern region, has repeatedly demanded that Afghanistan respect its rights, charging that upstream dams restrict the Helmand’s flow into a border lake.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
A statement from the Regional Reference Laboratory for Polio Eradication at Islamabad’s NIH said the latest cases involve a six-year-old girl from Union Council Pattan in KP’s Kohistan district, and a 21-month-old girl from UC Matli-2 in Sindh’s Badin.
“With these detections, the total number of polio cases in Pakistan in 2025 has reached 21, including 13 from KP, six from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the statement noted.
Polio was a highly infectious and incurable disease that could cause lifelong paralysis.  The only effective protection against the debilitating virus is through the repeated administration of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, alongside timely completion of all routine immunisations, the statement said.
It added that from September 1 to 7, a sub-national polio vaccination campaign will take place, targeting more than 28 million children under the age of five in 99 districts across all provinces and regions.
“The campaign in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa will be conducted from 15 September. The goal is to ensure every child in these districts receives the vaccine to protect them from the lifelong consequences of polio,” it said.
It added that the campaign was part of the ongoing efforts to quickly strengthen immunity among children and close existing protection gaps.
“Parents and caregivers are strongly urged to ensure their children receive the polio vaccine during this and every campaign.”
Last week, poliovirus was found in 36 per cent of samples across 87 nationwide districts tested in July.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.</p><small>2025-08-18 07:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619313-fresh-monsoon-spell-lashes-kp-punjab-as-pakistans-rain-death-toll-surpasses-650' target='_blank'><strong>Fresh monsoon spell lashes KP, Punjab; four die in Swabi as cloudburst triggers flood, landslides</strong></a><br><p>

The Baein and Auj drains at the river Ravi have started overflowing, and hundreds of acres of land have been submerged. Land erosion is being reported near Chak Jamil, Fatehpur, Shahpur and Chanjhora villages due to the floodwater. Water level in Ravi has risen from 12,000 cusecs to 51,400 cusecs.
Meanwhile, Rescue 1122 rescued 68 people trapped in the floodwater due to flooding in the rain drain flowing into the Shakargarh tehsil. Of these, eight citizens were trapped near village Dinpur and 60 were rescued near village Sikmal. The local administration has setup 15 flood relief camps on the banks of River and its rainwater drains.
Narowal Deputy Commissioner Syed Hassan Raza said that the situation on the banks of Ravi and its rain drains was under control. He said that all the departments of the district administration were on high alert.

68 people trapped in floodwater rescued near Shakargarh tehsil

The river Sutlej is experiencing a low to mid-level flood and dozens of villages near the Baba Farid Bridge protective embankment on the Pakpattan-Minchanabad Road are at risk of flooding.
 
 

Local villagers report land erosion at the embankment on the river’s right bank. Villages in Pakpattan and Minchanabad tehsil of Bahawalnagar are at risk of flooding. Locals fear the floodwater could damage surrounding villages, including Malik Bahwal, Mir Khan, Shahou Moor, Naveed Khan Goun and water could also reach the shrine of Chan Pir in Pakpattan. Pakpattan Assistant Commissioner Rab Dino Maitlo told Dawn via phone that the situation in Pakpattan was under control.
However, villagers near Baba Farid Bridge have reportedly begun reinforcing the embankment on a self-help basis. Meanwhile, local administration has set up eight flood relief camps in the area and Rescue 1122 personnel are advising villagers to relocate along with their livestock to safer areas.
At Head Sulemanki on Sutlej, water flow has risen to 60,000 cusecs after a flow of 2,0000 cusecs in the last 24 hours. Okara Deputy Commissioner Ahmad Usman Javed and District Police Officer Muhammad Rashid Hidayat visited Head Sulemanki to gauge the situation.
They were told that relief camps had been established and officials of health, livestock and Rescue 1122 were performing their duties. The camps had been stocked with medicines and food, and cattle fodder had also been arranged at the camps. Announcements were being made from local mosques at localities on the banks of the river to vacate the area.
At Taunsa Barrage, Dera Ghazi Khan the inflow of water in Indus was recorded at 420,000 cusecs while the outflow was 417,000 cusecs on Sunday morning. Populations from low-lying riverine areas have been evacuated and flood relief camps have been established.
Dera Ghazi Khan Commissioner Ashfaq Ahmed Chaudhry chaired a meeting to review the situation. The meeting was informed that two major spells of rain were expected by August 23, which could increase the water levels in the river and could also cause hill torrents. The commissioner said the situation was under control and all departments were on high alert. The commissioner directed deputy commissioners and relevant officials to ensure availability of de-watering machines to deal with possible urban flooding.
He further directed to ensure availability of livestock vaccination, fodder, and anti-snakebite vaccines. Strict enforcement of the ban on boating and swimming in rivers and streams was also ordered, with mandatory use of life jackets for emergency boatmen.

Cambridge University Press said tradwife, a portmanteau of traditional wife, reflected “a growing, controversial Instagram and TikTok trend that embraces traditional gender roles”.
The dictionary also took on the challenge of defining skibidi, a word popularised in online memes, as a term which had “different meanings, such as cool or bad, or can be used with no real meaning”.
The gibberish word was spread by a YouTube channel called “Skibidi Toilet” and is associated with the mindless, “brain rot” content found on social media and consumed by Gen Alpha’s overwhelmingly digital lifestyle.
The dictionary defined delulu, derived from the word delusional, as “believing things that are not real or true, usually because you choose to”.
As an example, it cited a 2025 speech in parliament where Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese used the phrase “delulu with no solulu”.
 


“It’s not every day you get to see words like skibidi and delulu make their way into the Cambridge Dictionary,” said Colin McIntosh, Lexical Programme manager at the Cambridge Dictionary.
“We only add words where we think they’ll have staying power. Internet culture is changing the English language, and the effect is fascinating to observe and capture in the Dictionary.”
Other new phrases include “lewk”, used to describe a unique fashion look and popularised by RuPaul’s Drag Race, and “inspo”, short for inspiration.
Work from home culture has given rise to “mouse jiggler”, referring to a way to pretend to work when you are not.

A complaint registered with the Lahore Pakistan Railway police, Razia Sultan, resident of Fateh Ali Colony of Narowal, said that she boarded the Lasani Express passenger train with her daughters and son to travel to Narowal from Lahore. She alleged that two boys, aged between 20 and 22, started harassing her daughters. She said that when she and her son tried to stop them from molesting her daughters, they attacked her son. She said other passengers intervened and saved her son.
However, she alleged that as soon as the train stopped at the Narang Mandi railway station, around 10 to 12 boys came and attacked her and her children. She said that they punched and kicked them and they were helpless because of the sudden attack. She said that on hearing their screams, passengers in the train rescued them from the youths. 
An FIR was registered against 14 unknown boys on the complaint of the woman in Lahore. 
Eyewitness passengers Muhammad Kamal and Azeem Akhtar said these young men board the passenger train daily from Narang Mandi, Kala Khatai and Sri Rampur railway stations. They claimed that this was not the first incident of harassment of girls, women and families. 
They alleged that these group travel without tickets and Railways personnel and police were also afraid of them. 
They said that these youths worked at various factories and shops in Lahore and they routinely abuse travellers in passenger trains between Lahore and Narowal. 
Passengers Abdul Shakoor and Farhan Ali said the trains were overloaded and families and female students were not safe from these unruly youth. 
They claimed that these young men occupy seats without tickets, refuse to vacate them for families and routinely misbehave and abuse passengers. 
They said the Pakistan Railways had failed to provide safe travel facilities to passengers, especially female students and families. 
They said that after a video of a young man abusing women in the Lasani Express went viral on social media, female passengers and families were now scared to travel in the train. 
Citizens and passengers have demanded that Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif take immediate notice of this situation.

PESHAWAR/ISLAM­ABAD: With more than 150 people feared missing, the recent catastrophic floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have claimed at least 323 lives, provincial authorities said on Sunday, as the nationwide toll from rain-related incidents since late-June rose to 657.
As another two to three waves of heavy rain are expected in early September, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed members of his federal cabinet to personally supervise relief operations in the worst-hit KP province.
Speaking at a news conference on Sunday, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Asfandyar Khattak said that as per details collected by revenue staff in the Buner and Shangla districts, around 150 people are still missing.
He added that rescue operations were underway and that five armed forces helicopters were at the disposal of the provincial government.
Flanked by Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif and Dir­ector General Resc­ue-1122 Muhammad Tayyab Abdullah, Mr Khattak said the provincial government had released Rs1.5 billion for relief activities.
Out of the initial release of Rs500m, the allocations included Rs150m for Buner, Rs100m for Mansehra, Rs50m for Bajaur, Rs40m each for Batagram, Swat, and Shangla, and Rs10m each for Upper Kohistan, Lower Kohistan, and Kolai Palas, he added.
The PDMA DG further said that 33 trucks of non-food items had reached Buner, eight had reached Swat, and seven had reached Bajaur, while additional supplies were also being dispatched.
More rain in Sept
With heavy monsoon rains expected to persist until August 22, National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Spokes­person Dr Tayyab Shah warned on Sunday that two to three more spells of heavy rain are expected to hit the country in September.
He noted that this year, monsoon rainfall had been 50 to 60 per cent heavier than last year.
This year’s monsoon season ranks among the most destructive in recent memory, he said.
NDMA put the number of those who had lost their lives in rain-related incidents across Pakistan since June 26 at 657, with 929 injured.
Of the total casualties, 171 were children, 94 women, and 392 men.
KP province alone accounted for 390 deaths, including 288 men, 59 children, and 43 women, underscoring the province’s disproportionate vulnerability to seasonal downpours and related hazards.
 
 

In Punjab, 164 people including, 70 children, 63 men, and 31 women, have died in rain-related incidents since June 26.
Sindh has recorded 28 deaths, including 14 children, 10 men, and 4 women.
In Balochistan, 20 fatalities, including 11 children, 5 men, and 4 women were reported.
In Gilgit-Baltistan, the toll reached 32 deaths, comprising 18 men, 8 children, and 6 women.
Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) reported 15 casualties, evenly split among 5 men, 5 women, and 5 children while in Islamabad, 8 people died, including 4 children, 3 men, and a woman.
GB situation
In Gilgit-Baltistan, a cloudburst-triggered flood in Katishu village of Kharmang district claimed two lives on Sunday.
 
 

Police said a woman and her daughter went missing after the flash flood struck their village. The body of their daughter has been recovered, while the woman is still missing. Two other women, injured in the flood, were shifted to Skardu for treatment.
The flash flood also caused severe damage to fields, water channels, agricultural land, and both public and private properties.
Meanwhile, rescue teams recovered the body of a four-year-old girl from under flood debris in Khalti village, Gupis Valley (Ghizer district), while the body of an elderly man was retrieved on Saturday night. Both had gone missing in flash floods on Friday.
On the other hand, several major roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), Baltistan Highway, Ghizer–Shandur Road, and Naltar Highway, along with various link roads, remained blocked, leaving thousands of people, including tourists, stranded.
Local residents faced acute shortages of drinking water, prolonged power outages, and disruption of mobile and internet connectivity in several areas.
In Gilgit city, residents held protest demonstrations, blocking main roads against the prolonged water and electricity crisis. They said locals had been without basic utilities for several days.
‘Ministers to supervise KP relief ops’
In the wake of recent destructive rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed federal ministers to supervise relief operations in the province.
 
 

“On the prime minister’s directives, federal ministers will participate in relief operations in the flood-hit districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” said an official statement from the PM Office.
As per the instructions, Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam will oversee relief distribution in Shangla and Buner; the Federal Minister for Power Division will assist in Buner; Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Yousaf will supervise operations in Mansehra; and the PM’s Special Assistant Mubarak Zeb will oversee aid distribution in Bajaur.
The prime minister is personally overseeing NDMA’s relief operations across all flood-affected districts of KP.
Under the PM’s Relief Package, more truckloads of supplies are being dispatched to the affected districts. The relief goods include food rations, tents, and medicines, which are being handed over to the respective district administrations.
Water levels in rivers
Meanwhile, the PDMA Punjab reported that the River Sutlej continued to experience fluctuating water levels, with a low-level flood situation at Ganda Singhwala and Sulemanki.
The authority said that the current water flow stands at 70,000 cusecs at Ganda Singhwala and 74,000 cusecs at Sulemanki, with authorities closely monitoring the situation due to ongoing fluctuations.
The Sutlej River is expected to remain at low to medium flood levels in the coming days, with flows ranging between 75,000 to 85,000 cusecs.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that water flows exceeding 80,000 cusecs could trigger low-level flooding in the Sutlej, while 120,000 cusecs may lead to moderate flooding, and 175,000 cusecs could cause high-level flooding.
The PDMA has also forecast severe monsoon rains in most districts of Punjab, with the seventh spell of monsoon rains expected to continue until August 22/23.

A spokesperson for the FIA in Balochistan said on Sunday that the accused, Abdul Malik, was detained near the Chaman Passport Office while accepting extra payments from people in exchange for expedited passport services.
“Authorities recovered 13 Pakistani passports, 51 tokens, 48 data forms, nine verification forms and a mobile phone from the suspect during a raid,” the spokesperson added.
Malik failed to provide a satisfactory explanation regarding the recovered documents. Further investigation is underway.
In a separate operation, the FIA Balochistan Zone arrested five suspects allegedly involved in human trafficking and rescued four individuals.
The Anti-Human Trafficking Circle apprehended Rasool Bacha, Aminullah, Hashmat Ali, Talib Hussain and Ehsanullah, who were reportedly members of a gang facilitating illegal travel abroad using fake documents and charging millions of rupees.
“The group was sending people to Iran and Turkiye through illegal routes and fake documents,” the FIA spokesperson said.
“Three of the suspects — Rasool, Aminullah and Hashmat — were listed as most wanted by Pakistani embassies in Iran and Turkiye,” he said, adding that they had already sent large numbers of people abroad illegally. Talib and Ehsanullah were found to be involved in helping people cross the border unlawfully.
During the raid, four citizens were rescued from the suspects’ residence. The group was reportedly working for an agent named Faheem Gujar based in Iran. The FIA said investigations are underway and raids are being conducted to apprehend other members of the network.

The carrier, which normally carries 130,000 people daily and is part of the global Star Alliance of airlines, had planned to start ramping up operations on Sunday evening, after a labour relations board ordered the union to return to work and start binding arbitration.
The union said no, setting up an almost unprecedented standoff with the Canadian government, which had requested the back-to-work order.
The Canadian Union of Public Employees, which represents 10,000 Air Canada cabin crew, had pushed for a negotiated solution, saying binding arbitration would take pressure off the airline.
The attendants are striking for better wages and to be paid for work on the ground, such as boarding passengers. They are currently only paid when planes are moving, sparking some vocal support from Canadians on social media.
CUPE invited Air Canada back to the table to “negotiate a fair deal,” calling the order to end its strike unconstitutional. The airline said it would delay plans to restart operations from Sunday until Monday evening and described the union as illegally defying the labour board.
The government’s options to end the strike now include asking courts to enforce the order to return to work and seeking an expedited hearing. The minority government could also try to pass legislation that would need the support of political rivals and approval in both houses of parliament, which are on break until September 15.
“The government will be very reticent to be too heavy-handed because in Canada the Supreme Court has ruled that governments have to be very careful when they take away the right to strike, even for public sector workers that may be deemed essential,” said Dionne Pohler, professor of dispute resolution at Cornell University’s Industrial and Labour Relations School.
Another option is to encourage bargaining, Pohler said.
The government did not respond to requests for comment.
On Saturday, Prime Minister Mark Carney’s Liberal government moved to end the strike by asking the Canada Industrial Relations Board to order binding arbitration. The CIRB issued the order, which Air Canada had sought, and unionised flight attendants opposed.
The previous government, under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, intervened last year to head off rail and dock strikes that threatened to cripple the economy, but it is highly unusual for a union to defy a CIRB order.
The CUPE said its rejection was unprecedented when such an order was made according to rules, known as Section 107, that the government invoked in this case.
Travelers at Toronto Pearson International Airport over the weekend said they were confused and frustrated about when they would be able to fly.
Italian Francesca Tondini, 50, sitting at the Toronto airport, said she supported the union even though she had no idea when she would be able to return home.
“They are right,” she said with a smile, pointing at the striking attendants.
The dispute between cabin crews and Air Canada hinges on the way airlines compensate flight attendants. Most, including Air Canada, have traditionally paid them only when planes are in motion.
In their latest contract negotiations, flight attendants in both Canada and the United States have sought compensation for hours worked, including for tasks such as boarding passengers.
New labour agreements at American Airlines and Alaska Airlines legally require carriers to start the clock for paying flight attendants when passengers are boarding.
American’s flight attendants are now also compensated for some hours between flights. United Airlines’ cabin crews, who voted down a tentative contract deal last month, also want a similar provision.</p><small>2025-08-18 04:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/18095208f95de9e.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931596/anp-led-multiparty-moot-declares-past-policies-a-failure' target='_blank'><strong>ANP-led multiparty moot declares past policies ‘a failure’</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A multiparty conference (MPC) on Sunday declared that past internal and foreign policies are responsible for the current instability and terrorism plaguing Pakis­tan, particularly in the Khyber Pakht­unkhwa and Balochistan provinces.
The conference, organised by the Awami National Party (ANP), asserted that peace and development are not possible without democracy, the supremacy of the constitution, and granting rights to the provinces.
Although 20 political parties atten­ded the conference, the PTI was absent. According to ANP sources, the PTI was invited to the conference, but no prominent leader from the party attended it on Sunday.
Attendees included Senator Aimal Wali Khan, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, PML-N’s Irfan Siddiqui and PPP’s Nayyer Bukhari, among others.

Calls for an end to military operations in KP, Balochistan

In a joint declaration, the participants condemned all forms of terrorism and extremism, which they alleged were a result of past policies, and stressed the need for new steps to address the issues.
The declaration suggested an end to military operations in KP and Balochistan and called for the establishment of a “Truth Commission, under judicial oversight, to investigate losses”. The participants also demanded the abolition of so-called “death squads” and illegal armed groups to protect citizens.
The conference urged for the full implementation of the 18th Constitu­tional Amendment and suggested that non-constitutional bodies, especially the Special Investment Facilita­tion Council (SIFC), should be abolished.
 






The participants stated that the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award should be implemented as per the Constitution and that the rights of provinces over their minerals and resources must be granted.
The declaration also suggested the cancellation of land allotments in Balochistan and KP.
On human rights, the participants of the meeting called the enforced disappearances a violation of the Constitution and demanded that all missing persons be recovered and produced in courts.
They also called for the release of political prisoners, the lifting of travel restrictions on politician Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal, and the abolition of the Peca Act to ensure media freedom.
The declaration stated that Pakis­tan should not participate in foreign wars and should remain neutral. It called for historic trade routes to be reopened and for the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to their homes. It also demanded an halt to the forced repatriation of Afghan refugees.
Additionally, the declaration  rejected a proposal to merge the Levies Force with the police in Balochistan and the decision to merge the Frontier Consta­bulary with the Federal Constabulary.
It demanded that all powers in the merged districts be transferred to the civil administration and that laws like the “Action in Aid of Civil Power” be abolished.
The declaration demanded a relief package for flood-affected districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and handing over of Rescue 1122 vehicles to the provincial government.
However, PML-N and PPP refused to sign the joint declaration.

• Move comes amid push to address continuing glut in gas network
ISLAMABAD: The government is almost set to allow new gas connections at the price of imported LNG — around Rs3,900 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) at the current rate — and almost four times the current connection fee.
Sources told Dawn that a summary has been moved by the petroleum division to the federal cabinet for lifting the ban on new connections, with a first-year target of 120,000.
Priority would be given to applicants who had previously been issued demand notices or had paid the urgent fee but could not get connections because of a subsequent ban. The number of new connections would be enhanced for next year.
Around 250,000 applicants fall in this category, who would have to file affidavits not to approach the courts for their past claims and the connection fee increase. Before the ban, consumers were allowed to pay an upfront fee of Rs25,000 to secure a connection on a priority basis, unlike the routine Rs5,000-Rs7,500 fee. On the other hand, a new LNG connection earlier cost Rs15,000.
At present, more than 3.5 million applications for new connections are pending with the gas companies. While new connections provide an additional avenue for the gas companies to claim a guaranteed return on fixed assets (pipelines and related infrastructure), this also leads to higher gas losses and lower revenue recoveries on top of greater gas shortages in winter.
No wonder then that the Lahore-based Sui Northern is rationing gas supplies even before the peak winter demand and provides gas to domestic consumers for 6-9 hours per day — at breakfast, lunch, and dinner hours. The recent increase in fixed charges starting July 1, 2025 by 50pc provides an additional incentive to secure higher funds without the additional gas supply.
 
 

The moratorium on new gas connections was imposed in 2009, partially removed after six years before being enforced again in 2022 due to rising gas shortages. Sources said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had recently expressed displeasure with delays in new connections.
New connections
The new connection fee would now be set at Rs40,000-50,000 and the consumers would be billed at the notified re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) price — currently at about Rs3200 per mmBtu. The final price, including general sales tax, would go up to Rs3,900-Rs4,000 per mmBtu. The average gas price for high-end domestic consumers with a monthly consumption of 300 cubic metres per month currently stands at Rs3,300 per mmBtu and goes up to Rs4,200 per mmBtu for more than 400 cubic metres of monthly consumption.
The cabinet was informed that a comparative price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) was worked out at around Rs5,300 per mmBtu, and it was being used by millions of poor and lower-middle-class consumers, including those in the remote areas, which meant the LNG-based piped gas supply would still be cheaper 35-40pc.
Gas surplus
The removal of the gas connection ban is being pushed to address a continuing glut in the gas network that is putting at risk the integrity of the pipeline system and the sovereign international commitments. The Ministry of Finance recently suggested considering “demand side intervention through lifting of moratorium on new gas connections” to address the issue of the LNG surplus.
The higher LNG imports also involve greater foreign exchange requirements. Interestingly, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) had been resisting allowing the cost of LNG diversion to domestic consumers for almost a decade, but it recently allowed Rs75 billion in revenue requirements of gas companies for the 2015-22 backlog and indicated it’d adjust the 2023-25 claims in the subsequent price revisions.
Even with existing gas connections, the two gas companies, particularly SNGPL serving Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, face acute gas shortages in winters and imported LNG supply to residential consumers leads to the multiplication of circular debt. Already, the gas companies face around Rs200bn of annual revenue shortfall on this account.
However, the government has found itself in a paradoxical situation owing to economic slowdown, forced closure of gas to industrial captive power plants, unaffordable electricity rates, and insignificant utilisation of LNG by the power sector, for which the entire import arrangement was made in 2015-16, including sovereign commitments and more than $7bn worth of infrastructure.
The mandatory 66pc LNG utilisation in four “must-run” power projects of over 5200MW, for which the long-term international contracts were signed in 2015-16 and then in 2020-21, has since been reduced to 33pc LNG utilisation. These plants, however, remain outside the grid through tactical operations, shifting the power sector’s circular debt to the petroleum sector.
At present, more than 300 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of domestic gas fields have been put on forced closure to create space for the imported LNG at more than twice the domestic producer price.
This is not only at the expense of domestic gas fields, but also causes weekly losses of billions of rupees to gas producers, compromising future exploration and development activities.
This means at least three monthly cargoes under the long-term contracts with Qatar have become surplus. This is on top of the diversion of a monthly LNG cargo to the international market that was contracted by Pakistan under a guaranteed private long-term contract.
Last winter, the government had postponed five cargoes — 500mmcfd — from Qatar, which are now due for rescheduling in FY2026 on top of about 150 annual routine cargoes.

Chairing a review meeting on cashless economy in Islamabad on Sunday, he directed all the provincial chief secretaries to fully cooperate with the federal government in expanding the Raast digital payment system to the district level.
The prime minister expr­essed satisfaction over the progress made towards a cashless economy and digital financial systems.
 
 

The meeting was briefed that Pakistan will develop digital public infrastructure to create digital IDs for every citizen, integrating national identity cards, biometrics and mobile numbers.
These digital IDs will enable secure and efficient payments.
It was further said that the provincial governments have shown significant progress in linking government-to-public and public-to-government payments with the Raast system.
The meeting was info­rmed that the federal development agencies have granted right of way for fibre connectivity, while discussions are ongoing with Pakistan Railways and the National Highway Authority to expand digital infrastructure.
