According to a statement issued by the FIA today, four suspects from UAE were detained after the agency conducted an operation at the Karachi airport.
“The suspects were involved illegal activities in the UAE,” the statement said.
It said that the suspects, belonging to Hafizabad, Mandi Bahauddin and Gujranwala, were arrested by UAE authorities and deported to Pakistan upon completion of their sentences.
“They arrived in Pakistan on emergency passports,” the statement added.
The crackdown against human trafficking and illegal activities was ongoing, it said, adding that global cooperation was essential against human smugglers running prostitution rings.
“The suspects were transferred to the Anti-Human Trafficking Circle in Karachi for further legal action,” the statement said.
All resources are being utilised to eliminate human trafficking, it concluded.
Separately, The FIA Immigration Karachi detained eight passengers for interrogation who arrived from Cambodia and Mauritius, respectively.
According to the FIA spokesperson Abdul Ghafoor, the four who arrived from Mauritius were in contact with agents involved in human smuggling.
Meanwhile, the four who arrived from Cambodia were in contact with human smuggling agents living abroad.
According to the spokesperson, the agents had extracted hundreds of thousands of rupees from them on the pretext of providing them jobs in Cambodia.
They were sold to “illegal” companies in Cambodia, the spokesperson said.
“These illegal companies seized travel documents from them and forced the affectees for online scamming,” Ghafoor said, adding that they managed to save themselves and arrived in Pakistan on an emergency passport.
The passengers were moved to an anti-smuggling circle of the FIA in Karachi for identification of the agents, the spokesperson added.
In January, more than 30 officers of the FIA were booked and dismissed from service over their alleged collusion with human smugglers in sending Pakistanis abroad illegally.
The FIA had begun the purge following the capsising of a boat carrying illegal immigrants near Greece in December last year. As per the estimate, more than 80 Pakistanis drowned in the accident, 36 were rescued. The remaining were presumed dead.
In response to the tragedy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered the authorities to take action against the human smugglers and officials aiding them. Since then, a countrywide crackdown has been launched against human smugglers, leading to the arrests of dozens of suspects.
Consequently, FIA Lahore arrested 177 human smugglers during the last three months.</p><small>2025-05-17 16:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/17141746a213b0d.jpg?r=142043' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911576/uk-urges-all-sides-to-meet-treaty-obligations-amid-indias-suspension-of-iwt' target='_blank'><strong>UK urges ‘all sides’ to meet treaty obligations amid India’s suspension of IWT</strong></a><br><p>UK’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs David Lammy on Saturday urged “all sides” to abide by their treaty obligations, referring to India’s move last month to hold the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan in abeyance unilaterally.
Delhi’s suspension of its participation in the 1960 IWT was part of its series of measures against Pakistan, which it blamed, without any evidence, for a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. Pakistan strongly denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe into it.
“We would urge all sides to meet their treaty obligations,” Lammy told Reuters in Islamabad at the end of his two-day visit, when asked about India’s April 23 suspension of the (IWT), potentially squeezing Pakistan’s water supply.
The 1960 pact governs the use of the Indus River system. Pakistan has said it would consider “any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan” to be an “act of war”.
Islamabad plans to launch international legal action against India over its move. The Pakistan Commission on Indus Waters earlier this month shared a detailed report with the federal government about massive violations of the IWT by New Delhi.
 
 

During his interview with Reuters, Lammy also said Britain was working with the US to ensure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan endures.
“We will continue to work with the United States to ensure that we get an enduring ceasefire, to ensure that dialogue is happening and to work through with Pakistan and India how we can get to confidence and confidence-building measures between the two sides,” Lammy said.
“These are two neighbours with a long history but they are two neighbours that have barely been able to speak to one other over this past period, and we want to ensure that we do not see further escalation and that the ceasefire endures,” he added.
 
 

Pakistan has said Britain and other countries, in addition to the United States, played a major role in de-escalating the fighting. Diplomats and analysts say the ceasefire remains fragile.
Lammy also said Britain would continue to work with Pakistan on countering “terrorism”, saying that it is “a terrible blight on this country and its people, and of course on the region”.
US averted likely Pak-India nuclear war: Trump
Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump said Washington had averted what could have been a nuclear war between Pakistan and India.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack allegations continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention for both sides to finally drop their guns. On May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, Trump announced that a ceasefire had been reached between India and Pakistan.
“The situation had escalated to the point where nuclear war could have broken out,” Trump said in an interview with US outlet Fox News on Friday.
 


Responding to a question about getting both countries to step back from the brink of war, Trump called it a “bigger success than I will ever be given credit for”.
“Those are major nuclear powers […] and they were angry. […] It was tit-for-tat, it was getting deeper and more missiles,” he said. He added the next step would have been “the N-word”, responding in the affirmative to the host confirming he meant “nuclear”.
“That’s the worst thing that can happen,” Trump noted. Referring to discussions he said he had with both Pakistan and India on trade, the US president said: “I’m using trade to settle scores and make peace.”
Trump said that he had great conversations with Pakistan. “You know we can’t forget them because it takes two to tango.”
 
 

“So proud of what we’re able to do with India and with Pakistan,” the US president said.
He continued that Pakistan would love to trade with the US. “They are brilliant people. They make amazing products. We don’t do much trading with them.”
As the US imposed heavy levies on dozens of allies and rivals alike on April 2, Pakistan was hit by a 29 per cent tariff on goods it exports to the US. The government has said it is seeking ways to address the existing trade imbalance between the two countries.
On trade with New Delhi, Trump said that India was one of the highly tariffed nations, making it almost “impossible to do business”.
However, India is ready to cut 100pc of its tariffs for the US, he added. “That deal will come soon,” the president said.
On Thursday, he had stated that India had offered a trade deal that proposed “no tariffs” for American goods.
This interview was the third time in a week that the US president expressed his intention of deepening trade ties with Pakistan and India.
“We’re going to do a lot of trade with Pakistan … and India,” Trump said earlier this week, recalling that he warned both countries of “not doing any trade” if they did not stop fighting. A day after the ceasefire, he said he was going “to increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.
The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of record escalation between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of unprovoked military actions despite Islamabad’s call for a neutral probe into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.
 
 

Trump said after the ceasefire was struck that talks should take place in a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced.
The military has confirmed that 13 security personnel, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.
It has also stated that 40 civilians — including seven women and 15 children — lost their lives during the Indian aggression, while 121 others sustained injuries.
Pakistan, Turkiye reaffirm commitment to regional stability
Separate, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had a telephonic conversation with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan.
“The two leaders exchanged views on the recent developments in the region and discussed ways to further strengthen Pakistan-Turkiye bilateral relations. They reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing cooperation on matters of mutual interest and promoting regional peace and stability,” the Foreign Office said.

Moody’s first gave the United States its pristine “Aaa” rating in 1919 and is the last of the three major credit agencies to downgrade it.
“Successive US administrations and Congress have failed to agree on measures to reverse the trend of large annual fiscal deficits and growing interest costs,” Moody’s said on Friday, as it changed its outlook on the US to “stable” from “negative”.
The announcement drew criticism from people close to Trump.
Stephen Moore, former senior economic adviser to Trump and an economist at Heritage Foundation, called the move “outrageous”. “If a US backed government bond isn’t triple A-asset then what is?” he told Reuters.
White House communications director Steven Cheung reacted to the downgrade via a social media post, singling out Moody’s economist, Mark Zandi, for criticism. He called Zandi a political opponent of Trump.
Zandi declined to comment. Zandi is the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, which is a separate entity from the credit ratings agency Moody’s.
Since his return to the White House on January 20, Trump has said he would balance the budget while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has repeatedly said the current administration aims to lower US government funding costs.
 
 

But the administration’s attempts to raise revenue and cut spending have so far failed to persuade investors.
Trump’s attempts to cut spending through Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have fallen far short of its initial goals. And attempts to raise revenue through tariffs have sparked concerns about a trade war and global slowdown, roiling markets.
Left unchecked, such worries could trigger a bond market rout and hinder the administration’s ability to pursue its agenda.
The downgrade, which came after market close, sent yields on Treasury bonds higher, and analysts said it could give investors a pause when markets re-open for regular trading on Monday.
“It basically adds to the evidence that the United States has too much debt,” said Darrell Duffie, a Stanford finance professor who was formerly on Moody’s board. “Congress is just going to have to discipline itself, either get more revenues or spend less.”
Focus on deficits
Trump is pushing lawmakers in the Republican-controlled Congress to pass a bill extending the 2017 tax cuts that were his signature first-term legislative achievement, a move that nonpartisan analysts say will add trillions to the federal government’s debt.
The downgrade came as the tax bill failed to clear a key procedural hurdle on Friday, as hardline Republicans demanding deeper spending cuts blocked the measure in a rare political setback for the Republican president in Congress.
Moody’s said the fiscal proposals under considerations were unlikely to lead to a sustained, multi-year reduction in deficits, and it estimated the federal debt burden would rise to about 134 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2035, compared with 98pc in 2024.
“Moody’s downgrade of the United States’ credit rating should be a wake-up call to Trump and Congressional Republicans to end their reckless pursuit of their deficit-busting tax giveaway,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Friday.
“Sadly, I am not holding my breath.”
The cut follows a downgrade by rival Fitch, which in August 2023 also cut the US sovereign rating by one notch, citing expected fiscal deterioration and repeated down-to-the-wire debt ceiling negotiations that threaten the government’s ability to pay its bills.
Fitch was the second major rating agency to strip the US of its top triple-A rating, after Standard & Poor’s did so after the 2011 debt ceiling crisis.
“They have got to come up with a credible budget agreement that puts the deficit on a downward trajectory,” said Brian Bethune, an economics professor at Boston College, referring to Republican lawmakers.
Market fragility
Investors use credit ratings to assess the risk profile of companies and governments when they raise financing in debt capital markets. Generally, the lower a borrower’s rating, the higher its financing costs.
“The downgrade of the US credit rating by Moody’s is a continuation of a long trend of fiscal irresponsibility that will eventually lead to higher borrowing costs for the public and private sector in the United States,” said Spencer Hakimian, chief executive at Tolou Capital Management, a hedge fund.
Long-dated Treasury yields, which rise when bond prices decline, could go higher on the back of the downgrade, said Hakimian, barring news on the economic front that could increase safe-haven demand for Treasuries.
The downgrade follows heightened uncertainty in US financial markets as Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on key trade partners has over the past few weeks sparked investor fears of higher price pressures and a sharp economic slowdown.
“This news comes at a time when the markets are very vulnerable and so we are likely to see a reaction,” said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors.</p><small>2025-05-17 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/171511172e484b9.png?r=161119' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911597/dg-ispr-hails-irans-peace-efforts-amid-pak-india-escalation' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR hails Iran’s peace efforts amid Pak-India escalation</strong></a><br><p>Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), has lauded Iran’s peace efforts in the recent Pakistan-India conflict and warned of “forces” seeking to create a rift among brotherly countries.
Just two days after India, without any evidence, blamed Pakistan over last month’s deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, Iran had offered to mediate between the two as tensions escalated.
“Pakistan is fully grateful to the international community, and we are especially grateful to brotherly countries, including the Islamic Republic of Iran,” Gen Chaudhry told IRNA in an interview published today — the first by any Pakistani armed forces’ spokesperson to an Iranian outlet.
“We should be aware that there are forces in the region that, with the help of external factors, are seeking to create misunderstanding and confusion among brotherly countries in the region and want to create a rift between friends and brothers,” the DG ISPR added.
 






According to IRNA, Lt Gen Chaudhry spoke about the latest developments in South Asia as well as the “importance of regional and international diplomacy to help de-escalate tensions”. He also “focused” on the recent visit of Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi to Islamabad, the report added.
During his visit to Islamabad, Araghchi had met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir. He later also made a trip to New Delhi, reiterating his call for restraint.
 
 

The DG ISPR appreciated Tehran’s efforts and support to help de-escalate tensions in the region.
“We are pleased with all the efforts of the international community and brotherly countries, especially Iran, which played a role in reducing tensions,” he was quoted as saying.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as tensions over the Pahalgam attack continued to build up. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10, when tensions between the two countries peaked, for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
The Pakistani army spokesman emphasised that Iran and Pakistan “have very historical and brotherly relations and have always stood by each other in all challenges and trials”.
 
 

Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted that the two nations were “neighbouring and friendly countries that are in contact with each other on many issues and fields”.
“Pakistan is eager and pursues that the borders of the two countries are the borders of peace and friendship, and we look forward to it,” the DG ISPR told IRNA.
The military’s spokesperson stressed that Tehran and Islamabad were “cooperating together for lasting peace and stability in the region”.
President visits Gujranwala Cantonment
Separately, the ISPR said President Asif Ali Zardari visited Gujranwala Cantonment today where he lauded the “exemplary conduct and professional excellence” of the military in the successful execution of Marqa-i-Haq, acknowledging their “resolute determination and unshakable courage in the face of unprovoked aggression”.
“He paid solemn tribute to the military and civilian martyrs who laid down their lives in defence of the motherland, affirming that their sacrifice remains a sacred trust and a source of enduring national pride. He underscored that the sons of the soil, fortified by the enduring spirit of the nation, stood with unwavering resolve to defend the motherland and thwarted hostile designs with exceptional valour and operational acumen.”
The president said history would bear witness to how, “within a matter of hours, the Pakistan Armed Forces repelled aggression with unmatched precision and resolve, sending an unequivocal message” of the country’s strength, resilience and national unity.
During his interaction with officers and troops, the president commended their “exemplary morale, combat readiness and devotion to duty”.
The ISPR added that he extended congratulations on the successful culmination of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, and expressed “profound pride in the defenders of the nation, affirming that the people of Pakistan hold their brave soldiers in the highest esteem as the true custodians of national honour and sovereignty”.
 






Separately, PML-N President and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif praised the armed forces and parliament for national unity.
A statement issued by the PML-N said Nawaz lauded the professionalism and bravery of the armed forces, saying they “defended the motherland like an iron wall against Indian aggression”.
“We offer our deepest gratitude to God for granting us success,” he was quoted as saying during a meeting with PML-N Parliamentary Leader in the Senate and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs Senator Irfan Siddiqui, who called on him in Raiwind.
Nawaz also lauded the role of parliament, saying that “setting aside all political differences and speaking with one voice for the sake of national security” was a welcome and commendable step.
“By reflecting the emotions of 240 million citizens, the people’s representatives boosted the spirit of the brave armed forces,” he said.
He also commended Pakistani media for “presenting the truth before the world and exposing the enemy’s falsehoods”.
Senator Siddiqui briefed the PML-N president on the parliamentary party’s performance during the session. Nawaz underscored the importance of institutional collaboration, stating that parliament’s unified stance had reinforced national resolve and showcased Pakistan’s democratic maturity in times of crisis.
The statement concluded that the meeting underscored the PML-N’s commitment to upholding state interests and its confidence in democratic institutions.

On the contrary, said Khamenei, the United States uses its power to give “10-ton bombs to the Zionist (Israeli) regime to drop on the heads of Gaza’s children”.
Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after departing the United Arab Emirates on Friday that Iran had to move quickly on a US proposal for its nuclear programme or “something bad’s going to happen”.
Earlier on Saturday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Trump speaks about peace while simultaneously making threats.
“Which should we believe?” Pezeshkian said at a naval event in Tehran.
“On the one hand, he speaks of peace and on the other, he threatens with the most advanced tools of mass killing.”
Tehran would continue Iran-US nuclear talks but is not afraid of threats.
“We are not seeking war,” Pezeshkian said.
His remarks, said Khamenei, “aren’t even worth responding to.”
They are an “embarrassment to the speaker and the American people,” Khamenei added.
“Undoubtedly, the source of corruption, war, and conflict in this region is the Zionist regime — a dangerous, deadly cancerous tumour that must be uprooted; it will be uprooted,” he said at an event at a religious centre in Tehran, according to state media.
While Trump said on Friday that Iran had a US proposal about its nuclear programme, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in a post on X said Tehran had not received any such proposal.
 






“There is no scenario in which Iran abandons its hard-earned right to (uranium) enrichment for peaceful purposes…” he said.
Araqchi warned on Saturday that Washington’s constant change of stance prolongs nuclear talks, state TV reported.
“It is absolutely unacceptable that America repeatedly defines a new framework for negotiations that prolongs the process,” the broadcast quoted Araqchi as saying.
Pezeshkian said Iran would not “back down from our legitimate rights”.
“Because we refuse to bow to bullying, they say we are source of instability in the region,” he said.
A fourth round of Iran-US talks ended in Oman last Sunday.
A new round has not been scheduled yet.</p><small>2025-05-17 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/171619067a885e1.png?r=163214' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911598/security-forces-kill-two-assailants-after-they-attempt-to-attack-fc-post-in-turbat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill two assailants after they attempt to attack FC post in Turbat: police</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed two armed assailants on Friday night in an encounter after they tried to attack a Frontier Corps (FC) check post in Balochistan’s Turbat city of Kech district, according to the police.
Faced with increasing attacks by militants, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations.
According to a police statement, Kech SSP Zohaib Mohsin said, “Unidentified armed men tried to attack an FC check post last night, but the forces killed the two armed men in retaliation.
“While chasing the two armed men, they were surrounded and killed in Sangani Sar and their bodies were later handed over to the administration. However, the identities of the slain men have not been ascertained yet,” the statement quoted him as having said.
In another incident in Nasirabad, 40 kilometres from Turbat, women and children were injured when a grenade was thrown at a house.
According to police office Zahoor Ahmed, unidentified motorcyclists threw a grenade at a house in Nasirabad.
As a result, Meeral Qasim, Ayesha Shabbir, Fatima Shabbir and Shahzad Shabbir were injured,
Four Levies personnel were also martyred in an armed attack on their check post in the Nasl area of Khuzdar district late on Friday night.
Earlier in the week, one person was killed and 10 others injured when a blast struck the convoy of PPP MPA Ali Madad Jattak in Quetta on Wednesday, but the lawmaker was unharmed.
Earlier in the week, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti declared that the ongoing insurgency in Balochistan will soon meet the same fate as the Kurdish movement in Turkiye, asserting it is an India-backed conflict driven by self-interest rather than a fight for rights.</p><small>2025-05-17 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/17172046d2a81a4.jpg?r=172130' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911605/aleema-khanum-and-ptis-kanwal-shauzab-face-off-in-tense-court-exchange-over-leaked-video' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema Khanum and PTI’s Kanwal Shauzab face off in tense court exchange over leaked video</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khanum and former party MNA Kanwal Shauzab had a tense exchange in court on Saturday over a video that surfaced of the latter criticising the former.
In the recently surfaced video, Shauzab can be allegedly heard and seen criticising Aleema for disrespecting party office-holders and interim chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, saying that Imran’s sister should not dent the party. Shauzab allegedly said she would confront Aleema herself over the issue.
That happened today as Shauzab approached Aleema in the Rawalpindi anti-terrorism court (ATC), saying she wanted to talk to her. However, Imran’s sister said: “Just leave it. What you said was right. Many other people speak against us. We are now used to such accusations.”
To this, Shauzab told her that she wanted to speak with her in this regard to which Aleema rebuffed her, saying: “I am not angry with you, [now] go.”
Shauzab replied: “A specific part of an old video of mine was used against me.” Aleema subsequently told her that many from the PML-N and other parties also spoke against her. Imran’s sister thereafter left while ignoring the party member.
Court rejects Aleema’s request to travel abroad
Meanwhile, ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah rejected Aleema’s petition requesting permission to exempt her from court appearances so she could travel abroad.
Talking to the media outside the court, she said she had been visiting the courts for the past week due to “newer and newer cases”, alleging that they were being filed to impede her travel abroad.
She questioned who was afraid of her and why for going abroad.
Aleema further alleged that there were around 50-60 cases against her for delivering her brother’s messages to the people.
Earlier this week, Islamabad High Court Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro had directed the removal of her name from the Provisional National Immigration List and Passport Control List.
Aleema had approached the court to challenge the inclusion of her name in the travel ban lists. The court had allowed her to seek permission to travel abroad by approaching the relevant trial court handling the cases registered against her.</p><small>2025-05-17 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/17123603b4735f0.jpg?r=123623' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911542/international-law-indus-wars' target='_blank'><strong>International law & Indus wars</strong></a><br><p>ON April 23, India unilaterally declared the Indus Waters Treaty to be “in abeyance” — a term neither recognised in treaty law nor found in the IWT itself. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) — the authoritative international agreement on treaty law — instead describes a party’s releasing itself from its treaty obligations as a ‘suspension’.
Treaties such as the IWT are not limited by time, continuing instead in perpetuity under Article 42 of the VCLT. And under Article 57 of the VCLT, a treaty can only be suspended if it allows for such suspension, or with the mutual consent of all contracting parties. The IWT, a multilateral treaty with India, Pakistan and the World Bank as signatories, does not provide for suspension and can unilaterally only be terminated or suspended if a party commits a material breach of treaty as described under Article 60 of the VCLT. India’s accusations of Pakistan’s alleged role in the Pahalgam attack are completely unsubstantiated; but in any event, that attack has no nexus with the scope of the IWT nor — assuming that Pakistan were even hypothetically involved — constitutes a material breach thereof.
The scope of and obligations under the IWT, which Pakistan complies with, principally deal with the allocation and usage of river waters, and incidentally with hydropower generation from them. Any stoppage, restriction, or interference in the flow of waters in rivers allocated to Pakistan under the treaty, including the Chenab, constitutes a clear violation by India of Article III (2) of the IWT, which obligates India to refrain from interfering with the flow of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab rivers.
Apart from these treaty violations, customary law codified in Article 2 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility establishes that conduct in the breach of a state’s international obligations, that is attributable to it, constitutes an internationally wrongful act, thus necessitating the payment of full reparations to affected parties. Violations of a state’s treaty obligations constitute prima facie an internationally wrongful act, as affirmed by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the ‘Phosphates in Morocco’ case and the famous ‘Rainbow Warrior’ arbitration. Thus, India’s interference in the flow of the Chenab river constitutes an internationally wrongful act and also places India in breach of Article 26 of the VCLT, which codifies the principle of pacta sunt servanda — ie, agreements must be honoured. India’s culpability under international law thus obliges it to pay Pakistan reparations for the damage caused by its illegal acts.

India’s interference in the flow of the Chenab constitutes an internationally wrongful act.

Article IX of the IWT provides only two methods of dispute resolution: technical disputes, including engineering issues, are referred to a neutral expert, while treaty violations and questions of its interpretation, which are legal disputes, are referred to the Permanent Court of Arbitration. In the present circumstances, India did not exercise this right, arguably as it knew it stood on shaky legal ground in holding the IWT “in abeyance”.
Though the Simla Agreement, a bilateral treaty between India and Pakistan, emphasises bilateral dispute resolution, it cannot be relied upon to undercut Pakistan’s right to third-party dispute resolution, as India might be interpreting it to do so. The IWT, signed in 1960, predates the Simla Agreement of 1972 by over a decade and, according to Article 28 of the Vienna Convention — as well as customary international law — treaties do not operate retrospectively. Thus, the commitment to promote bilateral dispute resolution under the Simla Agreement does not limit in any way Pakistan’s ability to highlight and prosecute India’s violations of the IWT, including through international fora such as the General Assembly, Security Council and other UN bodies.
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) outlined in the ‘Gabcíkovo-Nagymaros’ and ‘Pulp Mills’ cases that states cannot rely on perceived treaty violations or other internationally wrongful acts as a premise to violate their own treaty obligations. Violating another treaty or international legal norm does not entitle a state to suspend its obligations towards the state owed under the treaty concerned; instead, it constitutes a breach of the said treaty for that state.
India’s interference with the Chenab river’s flow is not only a treaty violation, but also a violation of international humanitarian law considering the state of armed conflict between the two nations, as it impedes civilians’ access to water. Article 54 (4) of the 1977 Protocol I Additional to the Geneva Conventions of Aug 12, 1949, (AP I) specifically outlaws the impediment of water for the purpose of reprisals.
International law explicitly prohibits the destruction or diversion of natural or ecological resources — such as rivers — for the purpose of reprisals or to achieve military objectives. This is recognised through the principle’s inclusion in the Berlin Rules on Water Resources 2004, which codify customary law on water resources, and is framed as a war crime under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and the AP I.
During the recent military conflagration, India carried out strikes on the Neelam-Jhelum hydropower project, triggering Pakistan’s right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. To protect its flow of water guaranteed under the IWT, in an armed conflict, Pakistan reserves the right to target Indian dams and dykes on transboundary rivers as a military objective, if it is necessary and proportional, if such works are being used “in regular, significant and direct support of military operations and if such attack is the only feasible way to terminate such support”, as outlined in Article 56 of AP I, a treaty signed by Pakistan and now mostly considered customary international law.
This permissibility is reinforced considering the ICJ went even further to protect state sovereignty in interpreting Article 2(4) of the UN Charter, as held in its ‘Advisory Opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons’, where the court refused to outlaw even the threat or use of nuclear weapons in extreme cases of self-defence, where a state’s political survival faces an existential threat.
India is violating the law of the use of force by threatening Pakistan’s political survival through its weaponisation of dams and barrages, as the Indus system provides 90 per cent of Pakistan’s water.

In its weekly publication Al-Naba on Friday, the ISKP insisted that one of its members, Abu Ibrahim al-Khorasani, carried out the suicide attack by detonating his explosive belt when the police tried to stop him at a checkpost in the jurisdiction of the Chamkani police station.
Police investigators believe that the police weren’t the target of the suicide bomber, who actually wanted to attack a Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl gathering at the party’s Mufti Mehmood Markaz headquarters, which was attended by leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman the same night.
“It appears that the bomber’s target was the JUI-F gathering, but it has yet to be confirmed,” a source in the police’s counter-terrorism department told Dawn.

Police believe bomber was planning to target JUI-F rally

He, however, said an investigation was going on, so further details of the attack were awaited.
 
 

A senior police official also insisted that the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam -Fazl was the likely target.
“Most probably yes as evident from the past ISKP attacks against the JUI-F gatherings,” he said.
The official said there was “no second opinion about this” but things would become clearer after the ongoing investigations were over.
The JUI-F has long been targeted by terrorists, with most of the attacks being claimed by the ISKP. Fifty-four people lost their lives in a suicide attack in July 2023 when a bomber triggered explosives strapped to his body at a JUI-F workers’ convention in the Bajaur tribal district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
The attack occurred in Khar, the district headquarters and a town bordering Afghanistan.
According to witnesses, hundreds of JUI-F workers were present at the workers’ convention along with their local leaders when the suicide blast ripped through it. The ISKP claimed responsibility for the attack.
Both JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and party workers survived multiple terrorist attacks, while authorities issued several “threat alerts,” urging Fazl to ensure his safe movement.
On Oct 23, 2014, he survived in a suicide attack in Quetta when a bomber detonated his explosive vest outside a JUI-F rally. Two people were killed and dozens injured in the attack, according to police.
On March 30, 2011, the JUI-F chief remained unhurt when a bomber blew himself up near a convoy led by the JUI-F chief on the Peshawar-Islamabad Motorway.
 
 

The bomber, who rode a motorcycle, carried out the attack near the Swabi Interchange when the JUI-F leader’s convoy was around 12km from the venue of a party gathering. Two policemen and eight civilians were martyred in the attack.
The latest “threat alert” was issued by the Dera Ismail Khan police to the JUI-F chief on Feb 16. The police formally warned the JUI-F chief regarding a potential terrorist attack on him.
“Terrorists plan to target Maulana Fazlur Rehman for participating and interfering in religious and political matters,” the alert read.
The police urged Mr Fazl to keep his movement secret, increase his personal security and maintain a record of visitors, who are allowed to see him even after strict checking.

Qureshi has been indicted in multiple cases pertaining to the May 9, 2023 riots and has remained behind bars since August 2023.
Speaking to Dawn.com today, Advocate Rana Mudassar, Qureshi’s lawyer, said his client suffered heart pain early in the morning after Fajr prayers. He underwent a medical assessment by prison doctors.
“He was shifted to the PIC by Rescue 1122 after his health failed to improve,” Mudassar said, adding that Qureshi was currently undergoing various tests at the hospital.
The PTI leader’s family had been informed about his condition, the lawyer added.
In a post on X today, Qureshi’s son urged the nation to pray for his speedy recovery.
 






In July 2024, the PTI vice-president was indicted by a Lahore anti-terrorism court in a case registered by the Shadman police over allegedly attacking and burning the police station.
The same month, he was transferred from Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi to Kot Lakhpat on a police request. It had stated that frequent transportation of the PTI leader from Rawalpindi to Lahore was not feasible for the authorities as well as for the jailed ex-minister.
In November last year, a Lahore ATC indicted Qureshi and other senior PTI leaders in multiple cases relating to May 9 riots. The former foreign minister has pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p><small>2025-05-17 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604897-heatwave-in-karachi-other-areas-of-sindh-to-persist-till-may-20-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Heatwave in Karachi, other areas of Sindh to persist till May 20: PMD</strong></a><br><p>

These pilgrims arrived via 143 flights under the government scheme, while 3,440 more intending pilgrims through 13 flights will reach the holy land today, said Muhammad Umar Butt, a spokesman for the Ministry of Religious Affairs.
Sharing the details with APP, he said that there are five scheduled flights from Lahore, four from Karachi, three from Islamabad and one from Multan today.
This year, the PHM will host over 88,380 pilgrims under the government scheme and more than 23,000 under the private scheme.
He said that as possession of the Nusuk Card is a mandatory requirement for entering Haram Sharif, the pilgrims are being given these through Tawafa Company Al-Rajhi, responsible for facilitating Pakistani pilgrims during Haj, soon after their arrival.
The PHM is utilising Pak Haj App, two toll-free helplines 8002450028 and 8002450029 and WhatsApp numbers (+923700037425 and +923700037427 for prompt resolution of the pilgrims’ complaints.
Additionally, the spokesman said two central hospitals (one each at Makkah and Madina) and 11 dispensaries (nine in Makkah and two in Madina) are providing medical facilities to pilgrims, with 303 doctors and medical staff on duty.
The PHM’s main hospitals are equipped with modern facilities, including ambulances, laboratories, X-ray machines, ultrasound machines, ECG machines, minor operating theatres and separate wards for men and women and isolation wards.</p><small>2025-05-17 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/17141001d8a11fc.jpg?r=141414' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911589/pm-shehbaz-nominates-ministers-kheal-das-ramesh-singh-to-attend-oath-taking-ceremony-of-pope-leo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz nominates ministers Kheal Das, Ramesh Singh to attend oath-taking ceremony of Pope Leo</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has received an invitation to attend the oath-taking ceremony of the new spiritual leader of Catholic Christians Pope Leo XIV, and has nominated two ministers to participate in the event, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected in a surprise choice to be the new leader of the Catholic Church earlier in the month, taking the name Leo XIV, becoming the first American pontiff.
Last week, the newly elected Pope welcomed the ceasefire between  Pakistan and India in his first Sunday message, the pontiff had said he was glad to hear of the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire and hoped negotiations would lead to a lasting accord between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
According to the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, PM Shehbaz has nominated the Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kheal Das Kohistani, along with Punjab’s Minister for Minority Affairs, Ramesh Singh Arora, to attend the ceremony.
They will represent Pakistan and participate in Pope Leo’s oath-taking ceremony, which will be held in Vatican City tomorrow.
Leo became the 267th Catholic pope after the death last month of Pope Francis, who was the first Latin American pope and had led the Church for 12 years and widely sought to open the staid institution up to the modern world.
Francis enacted a range of reforms and allowed debate on divisive issues such as women’s ordination and better inclusion of LGBT Catholics.
Ahead of the conclave, some cardinals called for continuity with Francis’ vision of greater openness and reform, while others said they wanted to turn back the clock and embrace old traditions.
In his first Sunday message, the pontiff also said he was “profoundly saddened” by Israel’s offensive in Gaza.
He called for an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid and the release of the remaining hostages. “No more war!” the pope said, repeating a frequent call of the late Pope Francis.</p><small>2025-05-17 09:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/17130222ec7c08e.gif?r=130919' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911495/hbl-psl-2025-action-resumes-after-nine-day-hiatus-with-playoffs-race-wide-open' target='_blank'><strong>HBL PSL 2025: Action resumes after nine-day hiatus with playoffs race wide open</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) is set to resume on Saturday after a nine-day hiatus with the league entering a decisive phase as five teams remain in the hunt for the four playoff spots.
The league was postponed due to cross-border tensions taking place between Pakistan and India between the early hours of May 7 and May 10, when the escalation seized after a ceasefire agreement.
 






The disruption had seen overseas players fly out of the country before the Pakistan Cricket Board’s decision to resume the tournament got the six franchises scrambling to get their squads back together.
With only eight matches left in the league stage of the 34-match season, the battle for qualification has intensified, with last year’s finalists Multan Sultans already knocked out of contention after losing eight of their nine matches.
The Rawalpindi leg will host the final round of league matches before the playoffs shift to Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, scheduled from May 21 to 25, with May 24 marked as a rest day.
Saturday’s clash between David Warner-led Karachi Kings and Babar Azam’s Peshawar Zalmi will mark the resumption of the tournament and set the tone for a high-stakes final week.
 
 

Kings, currently second on the table with 10 points from nine games, require at least one more win to seal their playoff berth. Zalmi, placed fifth with eight points from eight games, are under pressure to win both of their remaining fixtures to secure qualification and preserve their record of reaching the playoffs in every PSL edition.
Quetta Gladiators have already booked their place in the playoffs with 13 points, and will take on the eliminated Multan Sultans on May 18. While that match may have no bearing on the qualification race, it will offer Gladiators an opportunity to fine-tune their playing XI and test their new signings ahead of the playoffs.
Islamabad United and Lahore Qalandars, both sitting on eight points from nine games, have one fixture left each and must win to stay in contention. Qalandars face Zalmi on May 18 in a virtual eliminator, while United’s final game will be against Karachi Kings on May 19.
A number of international players have returned to bolster their respective squads for the final stretch. Karachi Kings will be reinforced by the return of skipper Warner along with James Vince, Tim Seifert, Mohammad Nabi, Ben McDermott and Scotland’s George Munsey.
Islamabad United, whose last outing saw them halt a four-match losing streak after a blistering start to the season, have recalled Alex Hales, Rassie van der Dussen, Ben Dwarshuis, Jimmy Neesham and Tymal Mills.
Lahore Qalandars, hit by injuries to Tom Curran and Daryl Mitchell, have brought in Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan and Sri Lanka’s Bhanuka Rajapaksa. Zimbabwe’s Sikandar Raza will also rejoin the squad for the crucial match against Zalmi but will depart before the playoffs due to international commitments.
Peshawar Zalmi, whose campaign has seen a late revival, will rely on returning overseas players including Tom Kohler-Cadmore, Max Bryant, Najibullah Zadran and left-arm pacer Luke Wood.
However, they will miss the services of Alzarri Joseph and Mitchell Owen due to other league commitments. Quetta Gladiators have confirmed the continued availability of key overseas performers Rilee Rossouw and Finn Allen, while also adding Dinesh Chandimal, Avishka Fernando and Gulbadin Naib to their ranks.
Multan Sultans, out of the playoff race, will field replacement overseas players to meet league requirements. Peter Hatzoglou and Dilshan Madushanka have been named, following injuries and unavailability of their earlier foreign contingent.
Heading into the final week of the league stage, the top run-scorer is Multan’s Mohammad Rizwan with 363 runs, earning him the Hanif Mohammad Cap, followed by Sahibzada Farhan (321) and Fakhar Zaman (309).
On the bowling front, Mohammad Abbas Afridi and Jason Holder are joint leaders with 15 wickets apiece, while Abrar Ahmed and Hasan Ali have taken 14 wickets each.
Peshawar’s Mohammad Haris leads the wicketkeeping charts with 10 dismissals, and Rilee Rossouw of Gladiators tops the catching list with 11 grabs.
With playoff hopes hanging by a thread for several teams, and key fixtures set to take place over three consecutive days in Rawalpindi, the tenth edition of the PSL is poised for a dramatic conclusion to the league stage before attention turns to Lahore, where the champion will be crowned on May 25.

The CDWP meeting, presided over by Pla­n­­­ning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, also cleared Rs27bn expansion of laptop scheme in Pun­jab and Sindh’s Rs60bn worth of three major projects in the roads and education sectors.
The meeting requested the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) to formally approve five projects worth Rs127.1bn and itself approved five other projects worth Rs15.9bn.
Under the current financial rules, the CDWP is empowered to approve projects costing up to Rs7.5bn, while the projects of higher estimated costs are approved by Ecnec on the recommendations of the CDWP after clearance on technical grounds.
The meeting approved the “Construction of Academic Blocks of National University of Pakistan, Islamabad (New)” project worth Rs1.597bn, “Formulation of National Urban Strategy and Guidelines to Reduce the Im­­pact of Urban Flooding, Droughts, Climate Disasters and National Guidelines for Spatial Planning Considering Climate Change/Dis­aster Risk in Pakista” at a cost of Rs106.401m fully funded by UN-Habitat, and “Establishment of Mirwaiz Molvi Muh­ammad Farooq Shaheed Medical College Muzaffarabad and Kashmir Medical College Muzaffarabad” with a cost of Rs4.338bn.
The CDWP also approved another Rs2.455bn project in the higher education sector, “IT Industrial Innovation, Research Centre and Strengthening of Islamia College University, Peshawar”, and a Rs7.43bn project related to the Information Technology sector, namely “Revamping IT Industry Landscape”.
 
 

A key project forwarded to Ecnec was the “Investment Projects Financing (IPF) Component of the Pakistan Raises Revenue Project”, valued at Rs40.758bn. Funded by a $150m World Bank loan, the project aims to transform the FBR through technology-based reforms and broaden the tax base.
Originally estimated at Rs12.5bn in 2020, the project cost has increased significantly due to delays, exchange rate fluctuations and the inclusion of new components under the prime minister’s FBR transformation programme.
The CDWP also requested Ecnec to formally approve the Rs27bn “CM Punjab Laptop Programme” to distribute laptops to about 112,000 students currently enrolled in public sector educational institutions across the province.
A Sindh government project related to physical planning and housing — “Construction / Reconstruction of Existing Schools in Sindh Affected under 2022 Floods” — worth Rs12.337bn was also referred to Ecnec for approval. The project is sponsored and executed by the provincial government and aims to reconstruct damaged schools, with priority given to those severely affected by the 2022 rains and floods, as verified by the Education Works Division.
Two other projects in Sindh related to transport and communications were also referred to the Ecnec for approval. They are “Extension / Construction of Sindh Coastal Highway Phase II” at a cost of Rs37.718bn. The project involves the extension and construction of a 36km section of the Sindh Coastal Highway, featuring a 14.5-metre formation width, a 7.3-metre two-lane single carriageway, three-metre paved shoulders, and 0.6-metre earthen shoulders on each side.
The second project was “Dualisation of Tando Allahyar-Tando Adam Road” worth Rs9.285bn.
During the meeting, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal directed that only those projects that improve institutional performance and contribute to national development be included in the Public Sector Development Programme. He stressed aligning the development portfolio with the Uraan Pakistan priorities and ensuring continuity and innovation in future projects.
He also directed his own ministry to develop a mechanism for notifying construction rates for highway and building projects, in light of the accurate cost of construction, and thorough scrutiny of projects should be ensured by sponsoring departments to avoid inflated costs. He directed the Higher Education Commission and the Punjab government to coordinate on laptop procurement to consolidate the demand for the next four years and invite leading laptop manufacturers to set up plants in Pakistan.

According to party and police sources, the Lahore police registered the FIR against the PTI leaders and workers for taking out a rally to express solidarity with the armed forces, burning Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s effigy, and torching tyres on Ferozepur Road near Model Town.
 






The FIR was registered against PTI Lahore president Imtiaz Sheikh, Zaheer Abbas Khokhar, Ali Warraich and around 50 other workers under Sections 290 (public nuisance), 291 (Continuance of nuisance after injunction to discontinue), 148 (rioting armed with deadly weapons), 149 (Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) and 431 (mischief by injury to public road, bridge) of the PPC.
Imtiaz Sheikh tweeted that the police had booked him and other party leaders for bringing out the ‘Pakistan Zindabad Rally’.
He said the FIR was registered as PTI leaders and workers torched Modi’s effigy and raised “Pakistan Zindabad” slogans. “We are proud of being booked for holding the Pakistan Zindabad Rally”.

The bill, tabled by MNA Sharmila Faruqui, was not on the agenda of the proceedings but was introduced by suspending relevant rules. Once the bill becomes an act, it will be implemented in the federal capital and no court other than that of the district and sessions judge shall take cognizance of or try any offence under it.
When the bill becomes a law, the Child Marriage Restraint Act 1929 will stand repealed to the extent of the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). However, all orders made, decisions taken, judgements passed by any court shall be deemed to have been validly made, taken and passed under this act.
The bill was introduced with the object to curb, discourage and eventually eradicate the concept and phenomenon of child marriages.

No nikah khwan shall register a marriage where one or both contracting parties are below 18 years of age, says bill

“In this modern day and age, we have the resources and the research which invariably proves that child marriage is harmful to both genders and especially girls who have hit puberty and are able to bear children. Furthermore, child marriages are in complete violation of the rights of children and international obligations and goal 5 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals focuses on gender equality and includes a target to end child marriage by 2030,” stated the bill, whose copy is available with Dawn.
It said: “Therefore, in order to restrain child marriages and protect the basic rights of children, it is expedient to enact a law for the ICT.”
The bill said no Nikah registrar shall register a marriage where one or both the contracting parties are below the age of 18 years and any person solemnising Nikah must ensure that the contracting parties possess valid Computerised National Identity Cards (CNICs) duly issued by the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), clearly showing their respective dates of birth.
It said whoever contravened with or failed to comply with sub-section (1) and (2) shall be liable to be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which shall not be more than one year and with fine amounting to Rs100,000, or both, unless he proved that he had reason to believe that the marriage was not a child marriage.
 
 

The bill sought further punishment for male adults above 18 years of age marrying a child and said: “Whoever, being a male above eighteen years of age, contracts a child marriage shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to three years but shall not be less than two years and shall be liable to fine.”
“Any form of co-habitation, before attaining the age of eighteen years, with or without consent, resulting from a child marriage shall be considered child abuse under this Act.
“Any person who induces, forces, persuades, entices or coerces any child bride or child groom to engage in any such activity prohibited by sub-section (1) or commits an act of child abuse shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than five years and may extend up to seven years and with fine which shall not be less than Rs1 million, or both.”
The bill stated that any person who recruits, harbours, transports, provides or obtains any child for the purpose of marriage shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term of three years with fine.
It also proposed punishment for the parent or guardian concerned in a child marriage and said: “Where a parent or guardian or any other person in any capacity, lawful or unlawful, does any act to promote the child marriage, child abuse or permits child marriage to be solemnised, or negligently fails to prevent it from being solemnised, shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to three years but shall not be less than two years and shall also be liable to fine.”
The bill said notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law, the court may, if satisfied from information laid before it through an application that a child marriage in contravention of this act was going to be arranged or was about to be solemnised, issue an injunction prohibiting such marriage: provided that where a parent of a child involved in a child marriage or third party has laid the information before the court and requests to keep his/her identity hidden from the contracting parties or from the parents or guardians of the contracting parties or the other parent, then the court shall adopt appropriate measures to protect the identity of the third party or parent who has made the application before the court.

The Zhuque-2E Y2 carrier rocket blasted off at 12:12pm (09:12am PKT) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China, marking the fifth flight for the Zhuque-2 series, according to a company statement.
Beijing-based LandSpace became the world’s first company to launch a methane-liquid oxygen rocket in July 2023, ahead of US rivals including Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin.
Interest has grown in recent years in launching carrier vehicles fuelled by methane, which is deemed less polluting, safer and cheaper than more commonly used hydrocarbon fuels and a suitable propellant in a reusable rocket.
LandSpace has increased the rocket’s payload, reflecting increasing demand in China’s expanding commercial space industry amid growing competition to form a constellation of satellites as an alternative to Musk’s Starlink.
Its first successful methane-powered launch did not carry any real satellites, but the second launch in December 2023 successfully sent into orbit three satellites. Saturday’s launch put six satellites into orbit.
Reusable rockets, pioneered by SpaceX, have demonstrated that they can lower costs for launch vehicles and space transportation.
LandSpace founder and CEO Zhang Changwu has said the company had started developing reusable rockets and expected to conduct a test launch in the second half of 2025.
The latest model in its Zhuque-2 series includes technical improvements that will help the company’s goal of launching a reusable rocket.
Saturday’s launch marked the first time LandSpace has deployed a propulsion method that involves chilling both liquid oxygen and methane below their boiling points, boosting thrust.
Chinese commercial space firms have rushed into the sector since 2014, when the government allowed private investment in the industry. LandSpace was one of the earliest and best-funded entrants.
Founded in 2015, LandSpace has secured funding from investors including venture capital firm HongShan, known at that time as Sequoia Capital China, the investment arm of Chinese property developer Country Garden and the state-backed China SME Development Fund.
LandSpace raised 900 million yuan ($120mn) in December from a state-owned fund focussed on advanced manufacturing, while in 2020 it raised 1.2 billion yuan ($170mn), Chinese corporate databases showed.</p><small>2025-05-17 06:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1709585528d1962.png?r=100131' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911465/pakistan-focuses-on-held-kashmirs-missing-persons' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan focuses on held Kashmir’s missing persons</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: A senior Pakistani diplomat told the UN Security Council on Thursday that the “acute” matter of missing persons during armed conflicts was persisting like a “silent crisis”.
Absence of such individuals from their loved ones was a wound that never healed, he underscored.
“The issue of missing persons is particularly acute in conflict zones and occupied territories from Palestine to occupied Jammu and Kashmir,” Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, permanent representative of Pakistan to the UN, said during a discussion.
The debate was held in the 15-member Council on the implementation of its Resolution 2474, which addresses the critical issue.
“They are fathers who never returned home, mothers separated from their children, young boys who disappeared in the dead of night, and daughters whose fates are sealed in silence,” he said, adding, “Their absence is a wound that never heals, leaving families trapped in an endless cycle of hope and despair.”

Envoy calls it ‘a wound that never heals’

The Pakistani envoy said that despite calls for investigations and accountability, the plight of missing persons continues to exacerbate in India-held Kashmir, pointing out that after India’s illegal and unilateral actions of Aug 5, 2019, thousands of young boys were abducted and many were still missing.
“The recent terrorist incident in Jammu and Kashmir was used as a pretext to round up more than 2,000 people to further oppress Kashmiris’ struggling for their legitimate right to self-determination,” Ambassador Asim highlighted.
 






Referring to the unmarked and unknown graves of thousands of victims that have surfaced in recent years, he said that from investigations held so far, it has been revealed that these victims are first disappeared by Indian occupation forces and then tortured to death or summarily executed.
The occupying power, he regretted, continues to deny thousands of enforced and involuntarily disappeared persons from occupied Kashmir and is reluctant to conduct forensic investigations into the 7,000+ unmarked mass graves.
He said that Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), in its two reports of 2018 and 2019 on Kashmir, had recommended to ensure independent, impartial and credible investigations into all unmarked graves in occupied Kashmir.
Ambassador Asim said that missing persons and enforced disappearances is a grim and undeniable reality of the decades-old Kashmir conflict.
Palestinians’ plight
The Pakistani envy also referred to the ongoing tragedy in Gaza, which highlights the devastating impact of armed conflict on missing persons and their families. He said that since October 2023, over 14,000 Palestinians remain unaccounted for, many buried beneath the rubble of destroyed homes, their voices silenced by unrelenting bombardment.
He said the dire situation demands urgent action to account for every missing person, restore family connections, and uphold fundamental rights of those lost in the chaos of conflict.
In this regard, Ambassador Asim suggested these actions: All conflict parties must follow international humanitarian law, protect civilians, and ensure accountability for violations; member states should strengthen collaboration through legal assistance and data sharing to trace missing persons; and, humanitarian organisations must have unrestricted access to conflict zones to assist missing persons and their families.
He said unresolved conflicts need to be addressed, adding that emphasis on dispute resolution is key to resolving the crisis of missing persons.
 
 

“We must work collectively to uphold the dignity and rights of all those affected by conflict and ensure that the missing persons are not forgotten,” the envoy added.
At the outset, Khaled Khiari, Assistant Secretary General at the UN Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs, warned that the crisis of missing persons continues to deepen in conflicts worldwide.
In Ukraine, large numbers of civilians remain unaccounted for in areas under Russian occupation. In Myanmar, disappearances have surged since the 2021 military coup.
In Syria, the missing persons crisis has become a defining feature of the conflict, Mr Khiari said, noting also that questions remain over the fate of those missing from the 1991 Gulf War, as well as the enduring impacts on families and communities in Cyprus.

The bizarre spectacle of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s supporters resorting to criticism and trolling of US President Donald Trump after he re-hyphenated the India-Pakistan saga as a bilateral issue he could help resolve, the anger turned on Turkiye and Azerbaijan.
Regarding Turkiye, the Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports have ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport ground handling major. Air India is lobbying with the government to cancel the wet lease arrangement the Indigo Airlines has with its Turkish counterpart.
While the move against Turkish Airlines is being considered, the two airports have ordered Çelebi to immediately hand over all its ground handling facilities in order to ensure uninterrupted operations at the airports, The Indian Express, citing a statement by the two airports, reported.
 
 

The recent development follows a similar announcement by Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL) on Thursday which further strained ties with Çelebi entities for ground handling and cargo operations at the national capital’s Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport.
“We will continue to provide seamless service to all airlines without disruptions through new ground handling agencies selected by us. All existing employees of Celebi at CSMIA (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai) and SVPIA (Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport, Ahmed­abad) will be transferred to new ground handling agencies on their existing terms and conditions of employment. Ground handling operations at our airports will remain unaffected,” the Indian Express quoted the spokespersons for the two airports as saying.
The anger has turned on the Muslim army spokeswoman as well who was the face of the military operation against Pakistan. A BJP minister from Madhya Pradesh described her as a sister of terrorists. A high court judge in Madhya Pradesh has ordered an FIR against the politician Vijay Shah.
Not to relent, the BJP’s demons continue to stalk it. Now Madhya Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Jagdish Devda has courted another row after he made statements allegedly insulting the armed forces, saying that the “personnel were bowing down to Prime Minister Narendra Modi”.
Speaking at a civil defence volunteers event in Jabalpur on Friday, Mr. Devda said: “Today the entire country, the country’s army and our soldiers bow down at the feet of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The reply he has given cannot be praised enough.”
The remarks, however, have drawn immediate criticism from the opposition Congress with leaders alleging that the BJP has a “sponsored programme” running to insult the forces and demanding an apology from him.
Political reactions poured in across party lines over the insulting remarks against Col Sofiya Qureshi.
 
 

Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh questioned Mr Modi’s silence, calling the remarks “disgraceful” and a reflection of a “diseased mindset.”
Similar criticism was voiced by leaders, including Sachin Pilot, Y.S. Sharmila, Harish Rawat, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati, and Trinamool Congress MP Sagarika Ghosh.
State Congress leaders, including MPCC chief Jitu Patwari, filed police complaints across multiple cities, while party workers held demonstrations in protest.
The military flare-up saw China expressing solid diplomatic support to Pakistan, but there wasn’t a country other than Israel to stand with India without hyphenating it with Pakistan.

Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Haji Muhammad Ayub Miriani, Senior Vice-President Haji Akhtar Kakar, Vice-President Engineer Mir Wais Khan Kakar and former QCCI president and business leader Haji Ghulam Farooq Khilji said that in light of India’s decision, “it is the responsibility of the government of Pakistan and the business community to come forward and establish strong trade relations with the brotherly Islamic countries — Turkiye and Azerbaijan”.
“The business community of Balochistan is ready to play a frontline role in this regard,” the leaders said in a discussion at the QCCI, adding that they “hope the government will also take steps for stronger trade ties with both the friendly countries”.
 
 

The business figures claimed that during the recent conflict, where Pakistan launched “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos,” India suffered “heavy losses” and is now “trying to cover up its failure by blaming countries like Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and China”.
They contended, “The Modi government and the Indian public, in fear of Pakistan’s allies, are now boycotting their products and cancelling confirmed tickets to their tourist destinations.”
They also emphasised Pakistan’s aspiration to expand global trade ties, noting that economic growth depends on international cooperation.
“Pakistan aspires to have good trade relations with all countries of the world and is striving for rapid economic growth, which is not possible without expanding trade,” they said.
The QCCI officials also said their organisation is working to resolve issues faced by industrialists and workers across various sectors, including import-export, agriculture, livestock and transportation.
“We affirm that the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry will play a leading role in improving business ties with countries like Turkiye and Azerbaijan,” they concluded.

• Critical healthcare access plummets as WHO reports last Gaza hospital for cancer and cardiac care non-functional
GAZA: US President Donald Trump said on Friday that  “a lot of people are starving” in the besieged Gaza Strip, where rescuers reported more than 70 people killed in Israeli air strikes since midnight.
Trump’s brief comments on Gaza came as he capped the first foreign tour of his second term, which saw him visit several Gulf countries but excluded key ally Israel.
A two-month ceasefire between Israel and Hamas collapsed in March, shortly after Israel reimposed a total blockade on Gaza that aid agencies say has sparked critical food shortages.
“We’re looking at Gaza. And we’re going to get that taken care of. A lot of people are starving,” Trump told reporters in Abu Dhabi.
 


Israel cut off aid to Gaza on March 2, a tactic it has said is intended to force concessions from Hamas, which is still holding dozens of Israeli prisoners it seized in October 2023.
Hamas insisted on Thursday that the restoration of humanitarian assistance to the war-ravaged territory was  “the minimum requirement” for talks. It also warned that Gaza was not  “for sale” hours after Trump again floated taking over the territory and turning it into  “a freedom zone”.
On Friday, Gaza’s civil defence agency said that 74 people had been killed in Israeli strikes since midnight, reporting dozens more trapped under the rubble as shelling continued. The strikes sparked panic in northern Gaza.
“We were asleep when suddenly everything exploded around us,” north Gaza resident Umm Mohammed al-Tatari, 57, told AFP.
“Everyone started running. We saw the destruction with our own eyes. There was blood everywhere, body parts and corpses. We didn’t know who was dead and who was still alive.” Another resident, 33-year-old Ahmed Nasr, said the bombing continued through the night.
“We couldn’t sleep or find any peace. There is no safety. We could die at any moment,” he said.
AFPTV footage from the Indonesian Hospital in Beit Lahia showed mourners crying over the bodies of their loved ones.
The dead and injured lay on a blood-smeared floor, where medics treated those still alive.
Hamas retaliated in October 2023 with an unprecedented attack on Israel that resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people on the Israeli side, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on official figures.
Of the 251 prisoners taken during the attack, 57 remain in Gaza, including 34 the military says are dead.
The health ministry in Gaza said 2,876 people have been killed since Israel resumed strikes on March 18, taking the war’s overall toll to 53,010.
Israeli media reported on Friday that the military had stepped up its offensive in Gaza following government approval of a plan to retake the territory earlier this month, though the army has yet to formally announce its threatened expansion of the campaign.

The military said it was continuing its operations, adding that over the past day, it had  “struck over 150 terror targets throughout the Gaza Strip including anti-tank missile posts, terrorist cells, military structures, and operational centres”.
Israel’s main group representing the families of prisoners still held in Gaza said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was missing a “historic opportunity” to get their loved ones out.
The United Nations estimates that 70 per cent of Gaza is now either an Israeli-declared no-go zone or under evacuation order.
Minimum requirement
For weeks, UN agencies have warned that supplies of everything from food and clean water to fuel and medicines are reaching new lows.
The World Health Organisation said the last hospital in Gaza providing cancer and cardiac care had stopped functioning after an Israeli attack on Tuesday left it  “severely damaged and inaccessible”.
Israel says its aid stoppage and military pressure are meant to force Hamas to free the remaining prisoners. But senior Hamas official Basem Naim said the entry of aid into Gaza was  “the minimum requirement for a conducive and constructive negotiation environment”.

“After settling disputes like Kashmir and water distribution, we can talk on trade and counter-terrorism as Pakistan is the worst affected country by terrorism which lost 90,000 lives and over $150 billion economic losses,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing a ceremony here on Friday.
The ceremony, marking the Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanks­giving Day), was held at Pakistan Monument and attended by PM Shehbaz, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) Gen Sahir Mirza, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asif Munir, Air Chief Marshal Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar, Naval Chief Admiral Naveed Ashraf, federal cabinet members, diplomats, the families of martyrs, sports personalities and showbiz celebrities, as the nation celebrated Pakistan’s victory in the recent clash with India.
Addressing the ceremony, PM Shehbaz said, “We have won the war but we want peace. We have taught our enemy a lesson but we condemn aggression. We want this part of the world to be as prosperous and progressive as others through hard work, undying efforts and living like peaceful neighbours.”
 







India asked to sit for talks on Kashmir issue, water distribution, joint fight against terrorism

He said a war between the two nuclear powers (Pakistan, India) could endanger the lives of over 1.6 billion people living in the Subcontinent. “If there would be nuclear tussles who will live to tell what happened,” he said.
While reminding the world that Pakistan’s civil and armed forces had been on the front line in the ongoing fight against terrorists for a long time, he said, “If our armed forces had not engaged them (terrorists), they would have been roaming around in many other countries.”
He also unveiled details of his late-night meeting with the armed forces heads on May 9 when India attacked three of Pakistan’s airbases. “After Indian attacks, our Army Chief Gen Syed Asim Munir sought permission to retaliate. His voice was full of commitment, courage and patriotism. Later, you saw that how Indian airbases in Pathankot, Udhampur and many other places were hit,” he added.
The next morning Gen Asim Munir called him to apprise him that Pakistan has given a befitting response to India and that India is seeking ceasefire, PM Shehbaz said, adding that Gen Asim Munir asked him if Pakistan military should accept India’s demand for ceasefire.
 
 

The PM also said he was later informed through evidences that Pakistan had downed six Indian aircraft, including three latest Rafale jets.
“Action of our Air Force with indigenous technology and Chinese planes and gadgets gave such a blow to India that the whole world was stunned how Pakistan achieved such technology silently. Our action demoralised enemies and boosted the confidence of our friends,” he added.
Celebrating the victory, Youm-i-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day) began with a 31-gun salute after Fajr in the federal capital and a 21-gun salute in the provincial capitals, followed by hoisting of the national flag at PM House, holding of rallies and ceremonies in all major cities.
 






On the occasion, the PM in his message highlighted that India while acting cowardly attacked Pakistan on the night between May 6 and May 7, resulting in the martyrdom of innocent citizens.
“We were forced to respond for the sake of these innocent citizens,” he said, adding that the world saw that within a few hours an enemy that was many times bigger came to its knees and the planes that India boasted of turned into ashes and became sign of a bitter lesson of history.
“Our Shaheens hammered the enemy and gave it a befitting reply,” he said. The brave and professional armed forces of Pakistan effectively and fully responded in the language of the enemy and wrote a golden chapter in the military history and foiled the designs of the enemy.
Later PM Shehbaz, accompanied by Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif and Chief of the Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir, visited Combined Military Hospital (CMH) in Rawalpindi to inquire after the health of troops and civilians injured in the Battle of Truth against India.
The PM also visited the residence of martyr Squadron Leader Usman Yousaf, offered condolences to his family, and paid tribute to the martyr’s services for the country and his sacrifice while defending the homeland.
He praised the armed forces for their exceptional bravery, determination, and sense of duty during the battle.

• Insists govt remains committed to ceasefire
• Indian defence minister signals aggressive stance, calls strikes a ‘trailer’
• Jaishankar reiterates any talks will be strictly bilateral
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday rejected India’s claim that recent military strikes had established a “new norm” in their tense bilateral relations, insisting that respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity remains the only acceptable standard in inter-state ties.
The remarks by Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan came amid a fragile ceasefire agreed upon on May 10, following India’s Operation Sindoor (vermilion, a traditional symbol of marriage worn by Hindu women) and Pakistani response codenamed Operation Bunyanum Marsoos (Iron Wall).
Pakistan condemned the strikes as a violation of its sovereignty.
“While India propagates the notion of establishing a ‘new normal’ in bilateral relations, our restrained response has reaffirmed that the only acceptable norm is respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity,” Mr Khan said at the weekly media briefing.
“Pakistan’s effective counterstrikes have reinforced the credibility of its deterrence and dispelled any illusions of India’s conventional superiority or its ambitions to impose hegemony in the region,” he added.
The ceasefire, brokered with US mediation, has held though tenuously.
 
 

Mr Khan underscored Pakistan’s commitment, saying, “Pakistan, as a responsible state, remains committed to the ceasefire and to taking necessary steps towards de-escalation and regional stability.”
He warned, “Given India’s belligerent posture, we call upon our international partners to ensure that India honours its commitments and refrains from further aggression. Should India resume hostilities, Pakistan will have no choice but to respond.”
On Friday, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh described the strikes against Pakistan as “just a trailer, will show full picture if need be,” signalling India’s readiness to escalate, according to Indian media.
Tensions were further complicated by China’s announcement to rename 27 places in Arunachal Pradesh, a region India claims as its own. India’s External Affairs Ministry called the move “vain and preposterous,” asserting, “Arunachal Pradesh was, is and will always remain an integral and inalienable part of India.”
The Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman expressed support for Beijing, saying, “We have noted this development regarding China’s renaming of some areas within Arunachal Pradesh. Pakistan reiterates its consistent support for China on issues of its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
 
 

Mr Singh, in his statements, also urged the International Monetary Fund to reconsider $1 billion in aid to Pakistan, alleging it could fund terrorism. “India has consistently maintained a firm and uncompromising stance against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations,” he said at Bhuj Air Base.
Mr Khan dismissed Mr Singh’s statement, stating, “India trying to politicise an institution like the IMF speaks about its desperation and frustration”.
He also criticised India’s suspension of the Indus Wat­ers Treaty, a 1960 agr­eement governing shared rivers. “Holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance is unilateral and illegal,” Mr Khan said. “It is equivalent to an attack on the people of Pakistan and its economy”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has proposed talks at a neutral venue, but Mr Khan called media discussions on timing and modalities “premature”.
“Professional diplomats are optimists; we are optimistic people. The government remains optimistic,” the spokesman maintai­ned.
India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar on Friday insisted talks would be “strictly bilateral”, signalling resistance to third-party mediation.

The contempt proceedings, initiated against the deputy registrar and others, have now become the centre of a significant legal and institutional controversy.
Interestingly, amicus curiae and senior advocate Faisal Siddiqui suggested to the court that contempt proceedings could be initiated against all concerned, including the judge, stating that even the judiciary was not above accountability.
The contempt proceedings were initiated against court officials after the acting chief justice consolidated identical petitions related to PTI founder Imran Khan’s visitation and fixed them before a three-member larger bench.
 
 

Advocate Siddiqui pointed out that there are precedents in both Pakis­tani and Indian jurisprudence where a judge issued contempt of court notices to another bench.
When Justice Ejaz Ishaq Khan asked whether a judge could move the Supreme Judicial Council for being obstructed in the administration of justice, Mr Siddiqui replied that invoking the contempt law was also an appropriate course of action.
Upon resuming the hearing, Justice Khan was informed that a two-member division bench had suspended the contempt proceedings.
“You are telling this court that it has been stopped from conducting contempt proceedings? This is a serious overstepping of authority,” Justice Khan remarked, questioning both the legality and the basis of the division bench’s intervention.
He reiterated the legal principle that an intra-court appeal (ICA) against an interim order is not admissible. “Didn’t the division bench also know that an ICA against an interim order is not admissible?” he asked. “This order goes against the authority of my senior colleague.”
Justice Khan warned that such judicial overreach could damage public trust in the courts. “If I accept this overstepping of authority, why will litigants have faith in my court? Why would anyone implement the orders issued by this court tomorrow?” he asked.
He also questioned the conduct of court officials, particularly regarding the lack of communication with his bench about the ICA. “Were you forced to file an appeal, or did you act on your own? Are you making a joke of the Islamabad High Court?” he asked the deputy and additional registrars.
Despite the institutional tension, Justice Khan made it clear that he would proceed with the case. “I will proceed with this contempt of court action and write the decision. I will write whether the Chief Justice has the authority to withdraw the contempt case from a judge,” he asserted.
The courtroom witnessed moments of intense reflection and resolve. “Let me make one thing clear — even if I have to sit alone and pretend that people are sitting in front of me, I will still write the order,” the judge declared, underscoring his commitment to judicial independence.
In his written reply, Additional Registrar Aijaz Ahmed stated that appeals against interim orders in contempt of court cases are maintainable if such orders suffer from legal defects or jurisdictional flaws.
The decision, outlined in Paragraph 10 of the judgement dated Feb 6, 2025, overturns a previous precedent and aligns with a ruling of the Lahore High Court, signalling a significant shift in the interpretation of contempt laws.
The reply further clarified that interim orders can be challenged if they are “inherently without jurisdiction, void, or coram non judice” (decided by an unauthorised forum).
The court criticised its earlier reliance on Indian contempt law, emphasising that Pakistan’s statute uses broader language — allowing appeals against any contempt-related orders, not just final or punitive ones.
Advocate Faisal Siddiqui said the situation was creating the impression of a dispute among IHC judges.
Justice Khan responded candidly: “There is a dispute among the judges, why should I pretend otherwise?”
He concluded by stating that he would issue a befitting judgement and adjourned the hearing until June 12.

ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly on Friday passed nine bills, including a money bill that had been blocked by the opposition a day earlier. Only one bill — aimed at amending the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951 [The Pakistan Citizenship (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024] (Section 4) — was deferred.
Meanwhile, two new bills were introduced by suspending the rules and were also passed. These were related to child marriages and trade organisations.
Later, the proceedings of the lower house of parliament were adjourned until Monday.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb moved a bill to amend the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 [The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2024], commonly referred to as the ‘money bill’, which had been blocked by the opposition on Thursday. The treasury benches later managed to get the bill passed by a majority vote.
 
 

The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2024 is already in effect, having originally been introduced last year in the form of an ordinance. However, since the ordinance is about to lapse after completing its constitutional period, it was mandatory for the government to have it passed by the assembly to continue its enforcement.
According to the statement of objects and reasons, the bill is aimed at removing certain difficulties faced by taxpayers in implementing higher tax rates on income from federal government securities. It also seeks to rationalise the standard tax rate on the overall business income of banking companies.
The government had faced an embarrassing situation in the National Assembly on Thursday when the opposition cleverly blocked the passage of the important money bill mid-process by walking out and pointing out a lack of quorum. As the number of treasury members was below the required strength, Deputy Speaker Ghulam Mustafa Shah, who was presiding over the session, adjourned the proceedings.
Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui moved a bill to further amend the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Act, 1975 [The Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (Amend­ment) Bill, 2024], which was subsequently passed.
Another bill, introduced by Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi to amend the Extradition Act, 1972 [The Extradition (Amendment) Bill, 2025], was also passed.
A separate bill to amend the Pakistan Citizenship Act, 1951 [The Pakistan Citizenship (Amen­d­ment) Bill, 2024], also moved by Mr Naqvi, was passed as well.
The interior minister also tabled a bill to amend the Naturalisation Act, 1926 [The Naturalisation (Amendment) Bill, 2024], which the house passed.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar moved a bill to amend the Civil Servants Act, 1973 [The Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill, 2025], which was also passed.
Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan introduced and succeeded in passing a bill to amend the Anti-Dumping Duties Act, 2015 [The Anti-Dumping Duties (Amendment) Bill, 2025].
Two new bills introduced
Two new bills not included in Friday’s agenda were also introduced in the National Assembly. One, moved by MNA Sharmila Faruqui, aims to curb child marriages within the territorial limits of Islamabad. The second, tabled by MNA Ali Musa Gilani, pertains to trade organisations.
Later, MNA Amjad Ali Khan drew the attention of Minister for Communications Aleem Khan to an urgent matter regarding the non-construction of 12 bridges on Kalam Road (N-95) under an Asian Development Bank-funded project initiated in 2013.
He also highlighted the non-rehabilitation of a six-kilometre stretch of road that was washed away by floods. Despite Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s announced rehabilitation packages, no progress has been made, causing grave concern among the public.
