“Yesterday morning at 7:30, after a judicial authority ordered the seizure of the cargo of an oil tanker with the trade name Talara and the flag of the Marshall Islands, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) rapid reaction units of the naval forces monitored its movements and intercepted and seized it,” said the IRGC.
“The tanker was found to be in violation of the law by carrying unauthorised cargo,” the statement continued, adding it “was carrying 30,000 tonnes of petrochemical cargo and was heading to Singapore”.
The Iranian news agency Fars said that action was not taken as a measure against any other nation, but was a purely local matter.
The seized cargo, the report said, was made up of Iranian-produced petrochemicals being illegally exported and “the main culprit was an Iranian individual or business”.
The vessel had departed from Ajman in the United Arab Emirates and was heading south through the Strait of Hormuz when it was approached by three small boats, after which it made a “sudden course deviation”, maritime security company Ambrey said.
The US Navy had earlier said it was “actively monitoring the situation”.
“Commercial vessels are entitled to largely unimpeded rights of navigation and commerce on the high seas,” said the US 5th Fleet, which patrols the region.
The Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway for global oil and liquefied natural gas, has previously been the scene of similar incidents.
Last year, the Revolutionary Guards seized a container ship, saying it had links to Israel, following a deadly attack on Iran’s consulate in Syria blamed on Israel.</p><small>2025-11-15 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633827-indian-sikh-woman-marries-pakistani-man-after-embracing-islam' target='_blank'><strong>Indian Sikh woman marries Pakistani man after embracing Islam</strong></a><br><p>

The Marburg virus is one of the deadliest known pathogens. Like Ebola, it causes severe bleeding, fever, vomiting and diarrhoea and has a 21-day incubation period.
Also like Ebola, it is transmitted via contact with bodily fluids and has a fatality rate of between 25 and 80 percent.
The head of the World Health Organization, Ethiopia’s Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, confirmed on Friday that at least nine cases had been detected in southern Ethiopia, two days after Africa CDC was alerted to a suspected haemorrhagic virus in the region.
“Marburg virus disease (MVD) has been confirmed by the National Reference Laboratory (in Ethiopia),” Africa CDC said.
“Further epidemiological investigations and laboratory analyses are underway and the virus strain detected shows similarities to those previously identified in East Africa.” It said Ethiopian health authorities had acted swiftly to confirm and contain the outbreak in the Jinka area.
It said it would work with Ethiopia to ensure an effective response and to reduce the risk of the virus spreading to other parts of east Africa.
An epidemic of Marburg virus killed 10 people in Tanzania in January before being terminated in March.
Rwanda said in December 2024 it had managed to stamp out its first known Marburg epidemic, which caused 15 deaths.
There is no approved vaccine or antiviral treatment for the Marburg virus, but oral or intravenous rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms increases patients’ chances of survival.
Last year, Rwanda trialled an experimental vaccine from the US-based Sabin Vaccine Institute.</p><small>2025-11-15 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/15223324a7e753f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955067/fact-check-viral-pakistani-cnic-image-does-not-show-wife-of-delhi-blast-suspect' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral Pakistani CNIC image does not show wife of Delhi blast suspect</strong></a><br><p>Multiple Indian accounts on social media platform X since Thursday shared an image of a Pakistani Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC), claiming it belonged to the wife of a primary suspect in the Nov 10 Delhi attack. However, the image does not show the CNIC of the suspect’s wife.
A car explosion near Delhi’s iconic Red Fort rocked the national capital on Monday evening. Twelve people died in the incident. Investigators alleged that the explosion was executed by a terror cell linked to Jaish‑i‑Mohammed (JeM), operating through a cell based around Faridabad and Pulwama.
On Thursday, an X user, who appears to be a pro-Indian based on his previous posts, shared an image of a Pakistani CNIC belonging to a woman.
The post was captioned: “Big breaking: Her name is Afeera Bibi, she is a Pakistani citizen, and she is also the wife of Delhi blast terrorist Muhammad Umar. She works for Jaish-i-Mohammed and is also connected to Dr Shaheen, who used to recruit members for JeM in India! Pakistan should start counting their last days.”
The image gained 434,000 views and 5,700 reshares.
Another Indian propaganda account shared the image and claim as well, with the post garnering over 475,000 views.
The image and claim were soon also shared by other Indian accounts, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here, collectively gaining more than 372,000 views.
Several users on Facebook also widely shared the image with a similar claim, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and allegations of Pakistan’s link to the attack.
To investigate the viral image, a reverse image search was conducted, which yielded an August 25, 2020, X post of the editor of Indian news outlet CNN-News 18 that included multiple pictures of individuals accused in the Pulwama attack, including the viral CNIC image.
The post was captioned: “More proof that Pakistan can not deny. Not just Umar Farooq, NIA India presents his wife’s ID card too as evidence. Issued by Pakistan. Afeera Bibi, wife of Muhammad Umar (Farooq).” It also used the hashtag “Pulwama”.
A suicide bomber had rammed a car into a bus carrying Indian paramilitary police in Pulwama on February 14, 2019, killing 40 of them in the deadliest attack in decades on security forces in the occupied region.
The X post described Afeera Bibi as the wife of Muhammad Umar Farooq, the primary accused in the Pulwama attack.
Further investigation did establish a link between Afeera Bibi and the current Delhi attack. She is currently being investigated by the Indian authorities in connection with the Delhi attack.
A keyword search to corroborate the identity of Afeera Bibi yielded a YouTube video shared by Indian media outlet Times Now dated November 13, 2025.
The video was titled: “Delhi Car Blast Probe: Afeera Bibi, Wife of Masood Azhar’s Nephew & Pakistan Resident, Under Lens.” It reiterated the fact from 2020 that Afeera was the wife of Muhammad Umar Farooq, but also said that she was in touch with Dr Shaheen Saeed, the “mastermind” of the Delhi car blast at the Red Fort.
Multiple other Indian media outlets such as, Republic World, RTV English, India Today, and  News X also reported that Afeera Bibi was in touch with Dr Shaheen during the Red Fort car blast in New Delhi.
However, they all established that she was the wife of the accused in Pulwama and none mentioned her as the wife of the primary accused in the Delhi attack.
Furthermore, the investigation also revealed that the CNIC of Afeera identified her husband as Muhammad Umar Farooq, who was the suspect in the Pulwama attack. According to mainstream Indian media outlets such as NDTV, ANI and Hindustan Times, the name of the primary accused in the Delhi blast is Dr Umar Un Nabi, due to which social media users could perhaps be establishing the connection.
Meanwhile, the CNIC of the Pulwama attack suspect mentions the name as Muhammad Umar Farooq, according to multiple Indian media outlets.
The viral CNIC of Afeera Bibi mentions her husband’s name as Muhammad Umar. The woman is not the wife of the Delhi attack’s prime suspect; she is being investigated in connection with the attack.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral image of a Pakistani CNIC shows the wife of the Delhi attack’s primary suspect is false. The woman in the viral CNIC image is not the wife of the Delhi attack’s prime suspect.

The move comes two days after a congressional committee released thousands of documents that raised new questions about Trump’s relationship with the late financier, and marks the latest in a series of demands by Trump for federal law enforcement to pursue his perceived political enemies.
Attorney General Pam Bondi said Jay Clayton, the top federal prosecutor in Manhattan, will lead the investigation.
The Epstein scandal has been a political thorn in Trump’s side for months, partly because he amplified conspiracy theories about Epstein to his own supporters. Many Trump voters believe Bondi and other Trump officials have covered up Epstein’s ties to powerful figures and obscured details surrounding his death by suicide in a Manhattan jail in 2019.
Trump has harnessed the Justice Department to target other perceived political enemies, notably former Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey and New York State Attorney General Letitia James, both of whom were charged after Trump replaced the prosecutor leading the cases.
‘Not how it’s supposed to work’
Legal experts say Trump’s demands could undermine the criminal cases that emerge from those probes, as judges can dismiss cases found to be motivated by “vindictive prosecution” — which both Comey and James have raised, though judges have not yet ruled on their requests to dismiss the cases.
Patrick J Cotter, a former federal prosecutor, said it was “outrageously inappropriate” for Trump to order the department to investigate individual citizens, adding, “That’s not how it’s supposed to work.”
 
 

Along with Clinton, who socialised with Epstein in the early 2000s, Trump said he had asked the Justice Department to investigate former Treasury secretary Larry Summers and Reid Hoffman, the LinkedIn founder who is also a prominent Democratic donor. All three men were mentioned in the 20,000 Epstein-related documents released by the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.
“Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrats’ problem, not the Republicans’ problem!” Trump wrote on social media. “They all know about him, don’t waste your time with Trump. I have a country to run!”
JPMorgan said in a statement that the US bank regrets its past association with Epstein, who was a client between 1998 and 2013, and did not help him commit “heinous acts”.
Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, Angel Urena, said on X, “These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing. The rest is noise meant to distract from election losses, backfiring shutdowns, and who knows what else.”
 






In a post on X, Hoffman called on Trump to release all of the Epstein files, saying his only engagement with Epstein was to raise funds for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
“I want this complete release because it will show that the calls for baseless investigations of me are nothing more than political persecution and slander,” he said.
 






Summers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Justice Department’s decision to acquiesce to Trump’s demand came despite a July memo in which the department and the FBI said there was no “evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties” in the Epstein case.
 
 

“This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list’,” the memo said. “There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”
Trump faces continued pressure over Epstein
Trump and Epstein were friends during the 1990s and the 2000s, but Trump says he broke off ties before Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges of soliciting a minor for prostitution.
Trump has consistently denied knowing about the late financier’s abuse and sex trafficking of underage girls. Still, some of Trump’s most ardent supporters have accused his administration of a cover-up. Trump, who frequently engages with reporters, has declined to take questions over the last several days as new revelations about Epstein have become public.
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives is expected to vote next week on legislation that would force the Justice Department to release all of the material it holds on Epstein, who was facing federal charges of sex trafficking minors at the time of his suicide.
The measure is expected to pass, even after House Speaker Mike Johnson repeatedly manoeuvred to try to block the vote. It would also require the Senate to pass similar legislation and Trump’s approval to compel the Justice Department to act.
Just four in 10 Republicans in an October Reuters/Ipsos poll said they approved of Trump’s handling of the Epstein files, well below the nine in 10 who approve of his overall performance in the White House.
Epstein socialised with well-known figures
 
 

JPMorgan paid $290 million in 2023 to some of Epstein’s victims to settle accusations that it had turned a blind eye to his sex trafficking. The deal followed embarrassing disclosures that JPMorgan had ignored internal warnings and overlooked red flags about a valued client. The bank did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement.
No credible evidence has surfaced that Clinton, Summers or Hoffman were involved in Epstein’s sex trafficking. All have previously denied wrongdoing and have expressed regret about their relationships with him.
Clinton flew on Epstein’s private jet several times before the financier’s 2008 conviction, while Summers accepted philanthropic gifts from Epstein while serving as president of Harvard University. Hoffman has acknowledged meeting with Epstein multiple times in professional situations.
Before his 2008 conviction, Epstein worked and socialised with a long list of well-known figures, including the UK’s former Prince Andrew, who was stripped of his royal title due in part to his association with Epstein.
Clayton, the prosecutor who will head the probe into Clinton, JPMorgan and the other figures, is a political independent who chaired the Securities and Exchange Commission during Trump’s first White House term.</p><small>2025-11-15 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/15213521c9c4ac5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955250/pm-shehbaz-jordanian-king-affirm-zero-tolerance-for-any-displacement-of-palestinians-from-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, Jordanian king affirm ‘zero-tolerance’ for any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Jordan’s King Abdullah II on Saturday affirmed “zero-tolerance” for any displacement of Palestinians from the besieged Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the devastating military onslaught by Israel in the territory.
The two countries were among the eight Muslim countries that worked with United States President Donald Trump’s administration on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza last month. They also joined other key Muslim and Arab states on Friday in expressing support for a US resolution that seeks to deploy an international stabilisation force in Gaza.
The prime minister and Jordanian king held a bilateral meeting today at the PM House after the latter arrived in Pakistan for a two-day state visit.
 
 

A statement issued from the Prime Minister’s Office on the meeting said: “On the issue of Palestine, both leaders acknowledged the unanimity of views and principled positions taken by Pakistan and Jordan regarding the post-war Gaza; zero-tolerance for any displacement of Palestinians from Gaza. The two leaders agreed to enhance coordination among the eight Arab Islamic countries that are working with the US on the Gaza ceasefire and the Gaza Peace Plan signed in Sharm el Sheikh.”
King Abdullah II also praised Pakistan’s consistent support for Jordan’s role in regional stability and humanitarian efforts during the Gaza conflict, as well as for the territory after the ceasefire.
 






The discussions during the meeting focused on further deepening bilateral relations as well as exploring avenues for enhanced cooperation in the economic, trade, investment, health, science and technology, education, as well as defence sectors.
“Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to enhancing strategic and economic ties between Pakistan and Jordan, as well as expanding mutually beneficial collaboration at regional and international fora.”
The statement said the meeting also featured a comprehensive exchange of views on regional security and peace initiatives, with PM Shehbaz briefing King Abdullah II on recent developments in Pakistan’s neighbourhood, especially Afghanistan and India.
“King Abdullah II acknowledged Pakistan’s key role in maintaining peace and stability in the region,” the statement added.
PM Shehbaz welcomed the king’s visit to Pakistan as a “testament to the enduring friendship” between the two countries, while the latter thanked the people and government of Pakistan for their “warm hospitality”.
The statement further said that both the dignitaries also witnessed a ceremony on the exchange of memorandums of understanding in the fields of media, culture and education.
 






The premier also hosted a banquet in honour of the king and his accompanying delegation.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Information Minister Ataullah Tarar, Climate Change Minister Musaddiq Malik, and senior government officials were also part of the meeting.
 






The king was presented with a guard of honour upon his arrival at the PM House.
 






 






Arrival in Pakistan
The Jordanian king was warmly received by PM Shehbaz and President Asif Ali Zardari on his arrival at the Nur Khan Airbase. PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and First Lady Aseefa Bhutto Zardari were also present to welcome the Jordanian king.
President Zardari said King Abdullah II’s visit would give Pakistan–Jordan relations a new strategic dimension. He added that the ties between the two countries were built on historical brotherhood, mutual trust and shared values.
A statement issued by state broadcaster PTV News on X said the visit reflected the “longstanding fraternal relations” between the two countries and would further strengthen political, economic and cultural ties.
“This visit of King Abdullah II will further solidify the longstanding relations between Pakistan and Jordan and will prove instrumental in expanding the scope of bilateral cooperation between the two brotherly countries.”
 






A statement from the President’s Secretariat said that a formation of Pakistan Air Force JF-17 Thunder aircraft provided a protective escort and accompanied the royal flight to Islamabad as the king’s aircraft entered Pakistani airspace.
The Jordanian monarch’s last visit to Pakistan was at the invitation of former president Mamnoon Hussain. Two memoranda of understanding were signed by both nations, with one related to cooperation in civil protection and defence and the other to cooperation in the housing sector.
Last month, he lauded the Pakistani military’s contributions to regional peace and security in a meeting with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
The army chief was on an official visit to Jordan and had called on the Jordanian king for a meeting, with Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II also present.

A group of lawyers at the convention, held at the Sukkur District Bar, began shouting slogans against President Asif Ali Zardari, whereas another group of lawyers began chanting in the president’s favour.
The disorder intensified with the involvement of plainclothes individuals when a verbal altercation and scuffle broke out between them and lawyers.
Meanwhile, some of the protesting lawyers reportedly held five outsiders, who were in plainclothes and entered the lawyers’ convention, and began beating them up. Advocate KB Laghari said the five individuals were apprehended and handed over to the police.
He asserted that “lawyers are brothers, and no one can make us fight”.
Laghari added that Sukkur District Bar Association President Qurban Ali Malano felt unwell during the unrest and was moved to the hospital due to his deteriorating condition.
PPP workers allegedly caused disruption
The outsiders who caused the clash and disorder during the lawyers’ convention were said to be PPP workers.
The central figure of the conflict was reported to be Mairaj Gopang, a worker of the PPP’s Shaheed Benazir Division and an office-bearer of the Peoples Students Federation (PSF).
According to lawyers, the disturbance began when Karachi Bar General Secretary Rehman Korai mentioned the name of Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar during his speech.
Upon hearing this, the alleged PPP workers attacked the lawyers’ leadership, including Aamir Nawaz Waraich, Malano, Laghari, Haseeb Jamali and Shafqat Raheem, during the speech.
Although other lawyers present tried to protect their leadership, the senior lawyers received minor injuries and were taken to the hospital.
The individuals then began chanting slogans of “Long Live Bhutto” when police brought them to the C-Section Police station.
Syed Zain Shah, president of the Sindh United Party and convener of the Save Sindh River Movement, strongly condemned the attack.
He asserted that this action was not only an attack on the legal fraternity but also a clear assault on the Constitution, law, democratic values and freedom of expression.
Lanjar takes notice
Lanjar took a strong notice of the incident. In a strongly-worded statement, the home minister expressed regret over the incident and termed the attack on lawyers as highly condemnable.
He stated that those involved in the assault would face strict legal action in accordance with the law.
Lanjar emphasised that lawyers were his own community, akin to family, and urged the legal fraternity to avoid internal disputes and maintain unity and discipline.
The minister further said that the government would take every possible step to ensure the safety and protection of lawyers. The home minister added that a full investigation was already ordered and responsibility would be determined following the inquiry.
Lanjar said restoring a peaceful environment remained a top priority of the government, and all necessary measures were being taken in this regard.

Hyderabad Deputy Commissioner Zain-ul-Abideen Memon told Dawn that a fifth body had been recovered from the incident site. “We have seven injured, of whom three are in critical condition.”
A statement from the Rescue 1122 spokesperson said: “A powerful explosion was reported in a firecracker factory on the banks of the Laghari Goth river, Latifabad Police Station B Section limits,” adding that a fire subsequently broke out in the factory.
Latifabad Assistant Commissioner Saud Lund said that he was monitoring the operation himself.
He said the fireworks were being illegally manufactured in a house without a licence. “We can only tell you the actual position once the rescue operation is complete. There is rubble from one room that collapsed with the boundary wall, so there are reports of some people and children who were working there; we are trying to get them out.”

Hyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Adeel Chandio told Dawn that the details of the factory’s licence were being verified the owner of the manufacturing site was not present at the spot.
SSP Chandio added that rescue staff were clearing the site to find any bodies. He added that the police were investigating the ownership of the factory.
DC Zain told Dawn that the fire caused by the blast was extinguished quickly, but its impact was so strong that bricks of the structure were flung several metres away from the site.
He said it looked to be a single warehouse that collapsed, adding that the site was being cleared by Rescue 1122 staff and the exercise would still take some more time.
In an earlier statement, Dr Vinesh Kumar, a duty doctor at Liaquat University Hospital, told Dawn: “One [body] was received expired in the burns ward. Six injured were also shifted  to the burns ward with moderate to severe burn wounds.”
Dr Haya, a doctor at the burns ward, told Dawn that two of the six had burn wounds of “approximately 100 per cent”.
Medico-legal officer Dr Mohammed Hussain told Dawn that two bodies of unidentified males were brought to the mortuary, while Assistant Medical Superintendent Dr Mujeeb Kalwar said one more completely charred body was taken to the burns ward.
The Rescue 1122 spokesperson added that a fire and rescue team, along with an ambulance and a fire brigade truck, were dispatched to the scene as soon as the information was received.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took strict notice of the incident and summoned a detailed report.
“The legal status of the factory should be immediately investigated. Whether the legal license and safety principles required for making fireworks were being followed or not. Playing with lives cannot be allowed, and such incidents are unacceptable in the eyes of law enforcement agencies,” he was quoted as saying in a statement.

According to family sources, his resignation letter stated that in light of the latest amendment to the Constitution, he could not continue in good conscience.
Justice Mirza was appointed as an additional judge of the LHC in March 2014, and his superannuation was due on March 6, 2028.
He is the son of late Justice Zia Mehmood Mirza, a former Supreme Court judge who delivered the famous and only dissenting opinion among seven judges in the case pertaining to the dismissal of Benazir Bhutto’s government by then-president Farooq Ahmad Khan Laghari in 1996. The judge had held that Laghari’s move was unjustified and there was no evidence suggesting there was a breakdown of constitutional order to justify exercising his powers under Article 58(2)(b), which allowed the president to dismiss the elected government and which was ultimately removed in the 18th Amendment.
A press release from the LHC Bar Association (LHCBA) said its officeholders paid tribute to the judge for his resignation and criticised the 27th Constitutional Amendment for having “divided the higher judiciary into pieces” and being responsible for the “burial of the Constitution”.
The LHCBA called on other judges who took oath under the Constitution to also resign from their posts, saying the entire legal community would respect them for the move.
The association also announced observing a strike on Monday, saying that lawyers would completely boycott court proceedings after hearings of urgent cases.
Justice Mirza’s resignation comes two days after the passage of the contentious 27th Amendment, which has been assailed as a “flagrant attack” on judicial independence by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ).
 
 

The move also follows the resignations of the Supreme Court’s senior puisne judge, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, and Justice Athar Minallah, both of whom wrote strongly worded resignation letters censuring the 27th Amendment.
Amid speculation about possible transfers of high court judges, Justices Mohsin Akhtar Ka­­­yani and Saman Rafat Imtiaz of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) have hinted they might not be available to hear cases in the federal capital from next month.
27th Amendment and its impact on judiciary
The 27th Amendment, besides bringing changes in other domains, alters the judiciary’s functioning in two areas — constitutional matters and the transfer of judges.
 
 

The legislation empowers the Judicial Com­mission of Pakistan to transfer high court judges without their consent — a provision that has raised concerns with­­in sections of the judiciary.
The most notable decision made by the ruling coalition is the formation of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), which experts say has dethroned the Supreme Court as the country’s highest judicial forum.
The reason for those concerns is that the FCC will now deal with crucial constitutional matters and its decisions would be binding on all courts, including the SC itself. Under the new Article 189, the SC would be downgraded to the apex court for civil.

The report covered PTI founder Imran Khan’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as prime minister. Imran married Bushra in February 2018.
 






An official response, issued by the party’s media wing, claimed that co-writer Bushra Taskeen was a known critic of PTI and the “so-called” analysis published in the report was to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and stolen elections.
The party said it had the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and publication, if they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology.
 






“We have seen this narrative play out before. Half-truths, innuendo, selective outrage, all packaged and presented as ‘objective analysis’. This attempt to misrepresent facts is not intended to inform Pakistan or its people, but rather to justify political victimisation and distract attention from real crises about human rights violations, economic collapse, constitutional violations and systematically stolen elections,” it claimed.
“What is most striking is the convenient targeting of Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, who have been incarcerated for two years and three months, while the article remains silent on what has been happening in Pakistan for the last three years and seven months. There is no mention of human rights violations, the rigged elections confirmed even by the Commonwealth observers, the hundreds of PTI supporters who have recently been convicted to 10-year sentences in fabricated cases, or the systematic political persecution the party has faced.
“Instead, the writers chose to focus on the personal lives of the country’s most popular and courageous leader, a man revered by millions of Pakistanis, while ignoring the glaring injustices inflicted on ordinary citizens, party members, and the democratic system itself.”
 
 

The party further claimed that the Al Qadir Trust case, frequently cited in the article, was ongoing and had not been “fixed” as implied.
“PTI has consistently sought transparency and judicial resolution. The Constitution itself has been repeatedly tampered with, in fear of Imran Khan, undermining the rule of law. One must ask the writers why they did not highlight these grave concerns and instead chose to sensationalise the personal life of the PTI leader? Furthermore, co-writer Bushra Taskeen is a known critic of PTI, demonstrating clear bias against Imran Khan and favouring the PML-N, calling into question the objectivity of this analysis,” the party stated.
“Imran Khan’s own trials are far from open and fair. They are being conducted inside prison, denying him his basic rights, including meetings with family, friends, and legal counsel, despite explicit court orders. This systematic denial of due process exposes the politically motivated nature of these proceedings, yet the article conspicuously omits these facts.“
The PTI added that they “reserve the right to initiate legal action against all parties involved, including the writers and The Economist, should they fail to issue an immediate, full, and public apology for this baseless, reckless, and defamatory personal attack on the leader of 240 million Pakistanis and the millions of devoted supporters of Imran Khan worldwide”.
“The people of Pakistan know the truth. They see through these attempts to malign their leader and continue to revere Imran Khan for his courage, integrity, and steadfast commitment to the nation. His moral leadership and dedication to justice remain a beacon of hope for millions, despite the relentless political persecution he and his family have endured,” the response concluded.</p><small>2025-11-15 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633781-govt-leaves-petrol-price-unchanged-at-rs26545-per-litre-for-next-two-weeks' target='_blank'><strong>Govt leaves petrol price unchanged at Rs265.45 per litre for next two weeks</strong></a><br><p>

Epstein mentioned the now-incarcerated PTI founder in his email conversations with an unidentified individual on July 31, 2018, according to the latest batch of emails released by the US Democrats on the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday.
In 2019, the United States Justice Department charged Epstein in Manhattan with sex trafficking of minors. Epstein pleaded not guilty, but died by suicide the same year before the trial at age 66.
In an email exchange encompassing various topics, Epstein wrote at 4:04am that Russian President Vladimir Putin had been “kind so far” and quipped, “how the US involves itself in others’ elections”.
Minutes later, Epstein mentioned both Imran and Putin in the same message: “[Putin] hasn’t pointed out assassinations to overthrow [governments] … coup funding … Imran [Khan] in Pakistan, a much greater threat to peace than [Turkish President Recep Tayyip] Erdogan, Khomeini, [China’s President] Xi or Putin.”
The other individual asked, “The populist in Pakistan???”, to which Epstein only replied “really bad news”, apparently referring to Imran.
“The cricket player? — How could he be worse that [sic] the Islamist?” the person conversing with the sex offender wondered.
“Makes Donald look like Einstein. Incapable of truth. Devout Islamist [sic],” Epstein wrote back, seemingly referring to Imran.
“Many nuclear weapons. (not Erdogan or Khomeni). He was married to two friends of mine, one daughter of Jimmy Goldsmith. Super wealthy take over guy. Forced her to convert. Wacko,” the pedophile financier claimed.
“It follows your prediction around cults of personality. He is a cricket
captain. Not a chess player, but he’s good at rousing the crowd,” Epstein added.
 
 

The conversation, as per the emails released, then went silent for 40 minutes before resuming on another topic.
Oxford-educated Imran is described as one of the world’s greatest all-rounders in cricket before he entered politics. He had a string of socialite girlfriends, frequented exclusive nightclubs in London and earned a reputation as a playboy, which he began to tone down soon after 1992.
As the reports of Imran’s mention in Epstein’s emails circulated on social media, users also reshared a picture of Imran and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell from a 1990 party, published by the stock photography website Shutterstock.
Maxwell, currently serving a 20-year prison sentence, was found guilty in 2021 by a jury in New York of helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls.
Epstein’s network of powerful contacts
The latest batch from Epstein’s emails illustrates the extraordinary scope of his contacts with powerful people, ranging from a top adviser to US President Donald Trump to Britain’s ex-prince Andrew.
Epstein’s emails also suggested that Trump was aware of the financier’s sexual abuse and definitely “knew about the girls”. The US president has denied any involvement in or knowledge of the sex-trafficking activities of his former friend.
 
 

The United States House of Representatives is expected to vote next week on trying to force the release of evidence gathered on Epstein by law enforcement over the years, including the identities of the men suspected of participating in his alleged sex trafficking ring.
Trump has angrily called the push for more transparency a “hoax”, while simultaneously demanding a probe of Epstein’s links to others, including former US president Bill Clinton.
Documents already released by Democrats in Congress include email exchanges running from 2009 to 2019, when Epstein died in detention while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p><small>2025-11-15 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633754-big-relief-for-moonis-elahi-as-interpol-drops-nearly-two-year-investigation' target='_blank'><strong>Big relief for Moonis Elahi as Interpol drops nearly two-year investigation</strong></a><br><p>

Since breaking out in April 2023, the war between Sudan’s army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced nearly 12 million and triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.
“We see a situation where more than 30m people are in need of humanitarian assistance. That is half of the population of Sudan,” Danish Refugee Council Secretary General Charlotte Slente told AFP by phone this week after a visit to a border region in neighbouring Chad.
“The suffering we see is unimaginable.”
Sudan had a population of around 50m people in 2024, according to the World Bank.
The aid official’s comments came after a field visit to an area in Chad that borders Sudan’s western Darfur region, which has seen fierce fighting of late.
Violence has escalated dramatically in recent weeks, with the RSF seizing control of the key town of El-Fasher — the army’s last stronghold in Darfur — after an 18-month siege and reports of atrocities multiplying.
“There are violations that cross all international humanitarian laws,” she added. Slente said the NGO had seen evidence of mass killings and sexual violence in Sudan.
“We see detentions, we see abductions, forced displacement and torture,” she said.
She accused the international community of not doing enough.
“Statements have a very limited impact both on the ongoing humanitarian needs on the ground, and they have not been able to stop the violence,” she said.
She warned that there were other cities still under siege that were not receiving the same level of attention.
The town of Babanusa, the last army stronghold in West Kordofan state, has been under siege for several months, as have North Kordofan state capital El-Obeid and South Kordofan’s Kadugli and Dilling.
“The international community must stop managing the consequences of this conflict and must start preventing the atrocities,” said Slente.</p><small>2025-11-15 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/15094050658ca2d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955231/9-dead-32-injured-in-accidental-explosion-at-occupied-kashmirs-police-station' target='_blank'><strong>9 dead, 32 injured in ‘accidental explosion’ at occupied Kashmir’s police station</strong></a><br><p>At least nine people were killed and 32 injured in an “accidental explosion” at the Nowgam police station in India-occupied Kashmir’s Srinagar when confiscated explosives detonated late last night, authorities said on Saturday.
Most of those killed were policemen and forensic team officials who were extracting samples from a large cache of explosives seized earlier this week in Haryana state, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said.
The Ministry of Home Affairs confirmed the casualties, PTI reported. The ministry’s joint secretary, Prashant Lokhande, said the cause of the incident was being investigated and any other speculation into the cause of the blast was unnecessary.
Both Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha and Director General of Police Nalin Prabhat termed the incident “accidental”.
 






The governor said he has ordered a “probe to ascertain the cause of the accidental explosion”, while the police chief also stressed that “any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary”.
“Due to the sensitive and unstable nature of the recovered material, the sampling and examination were being carried out with extreme caution. Despite all precautions, an accidental blast occurred last night,” the police officer was quoted as saying by The Hindu.
“The building of the police station has been severely damaged and the adjacent buildings have been affected,” he added. “Small successive explosions” prevented immediate rescue operations by the bomb disposal squad, the PTI reported.

The local police also dismissed reports of the People’s Anti-Fascist Front (PAFF) claiming responsibility or of any other foreign link as “patently false, baseless and mischievous”.
According to the PTI, those killed in the incident included three people from the Forensic Science Laboratory, two from the revenue department, two police photographers, a member of the State Investigation Agency and a tailor.
At least 24 police personnel and three civilians were admitted to various hospitals in Srinagar, PTI quoted officials as saying.
Some of the bodies had been “completely burnt”, a police source told Reuters. “The intensity of the blast was such that some body parts were recovered from nearby houses, around 100-200 metres away from the police station.”
Raids in IoK following Delhi blast
The blast comes four days after a deadly car explosion in Delhi, which killed at least eight people in what India has called a “terror incident”.
India’s anti-terrorism National Investigation Agency is leading the probe into the blast, but so far,  officials have given little further information on who the perpetrators might be — and whether it was a homegrown group or had links from abroad.
Indian media have widely connected the November 10 blast with a string of arrests just hours before, when they claimed to have seized explosive materials and assault rifles.
Indian police have carried out sweeping raids in occupied Kashmir since Wednesday. There has been no confirmation that the searches this week are connected to the New Delhi explosion, but the raids represent a renewed effort by police to tighten security after the incident.
Officers also raided Al-Falah University in Faridabad, while security forces on Friday demolished a house in occupied Kashmir’s Pulwama district.</p><small>2025-11-15 10:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633749-president-zardari-signs-amendment-bills-for-army-air-force-and-navy' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari signs amendment bills for Army, Air Force and Navy</strong></a><br><p>

The president gave his assent to the Pakistan Army (Amendment) Bill 2025, the Pakistan Air Force (Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill 2025. Notifications of the same were also shared by the PPP on social media platform X.
With his assent, the bills have now become part of the Constitution.
 






As explained by Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar in the National Assembly (NA) earlier this week, it now means that the five-year tenure of the CDF will commence from the date of his notification of the appointment.
All three pieces of legislation, which were hurriedly passed by Parliament without any debate earlier this week, pertain to the contentious 27th Amendment.
The amendment, which has paved the way for the establishment of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and changes to the military leadership structure, has been heavily criticised by the opposition.
 
 

Under the new changes made to the Army Act, the expression “chief of the army staff” will be replaced with “chief of the defence forces” as per the 27th Amendment. Similarly, the expression “Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee” (CJCSC) will be replaced with the “commander of the Natio­nal Strategic Command”.
Further, changes have been made to Section 8A of the Pakistan Army Act 1952, saying that “provided that for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces under paragraph (a) of Clause 4 of the Article 243 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
Another change pertains to the appointment of commander of the National Strategic Command says, “The prime minister may, on the recommendation of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces, appoint the commander of the National Strategic Command, from amongst generals in the Pakistan Army, for a tenure of three years.” The proposed amendment also authorises the prime minister to “reappoint the commander…for additional tenure of three years and/or extend the tenure(s)…up to three years” on the recommendations of the CDF.
Under the changes, the appointment, reappointment or extension of the commander of the National Strategic Command, or the “exercise of discretion by the appointing authority in this regard, shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever”.
Further, the federal government may, on the recommendation of the army chief and concurrently the CDF and by order in writing, “authorise the officer appointed as vice chief of the army staff or deputy chief of the army staff to exercise and perform such of the powers and functions vested in the chief of the army staff under any law, rules, regulations, orders or instructions for the time being in force as may be so specified”.
Meanwhile, the changes to the air force and navy laws include the elimination of the post of CJCSC from their documents.</p><small>2025-11-15 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1512322369a1721.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955238/in-visit-to-cadet-college-in-wana-naqvi-holds-elements-from-across-the-border-responsible-for-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>In visit to Cadet College in Wana, Naqvi holds elements from ‘across the border’ responsible for terrorism</strong></a><br><p>Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday paid a visit to the Cadet College in Wana, where an attack was thwarted earlier this week, saying that elements from “across the border” were responsible for terrorist incidents.
In remarks which were televised, Naqvi told tribal elders gathered at the college during his visit that several officials from Pakistan — including himself, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Defence Minister Asif Khawaja — had spoken to Afghanistan about the issue of terrorism.
“We repeatedly told them one thing: terrorism should be stopped. Do not destroy the peace in our country,” he said.
The minister further said that Pakistan’s economic indicators and its relations with other countries were headed in the right direction. However, elements from “across the border” came to the country to carry out attacks, he said.
He also referred to the suicide blast in Islamabad on Tuesday, saying that elements from “across the border” were involved. Naqvi has previously said that both the Wana and Islamabad incidents had Afghan involvement.
The Cadet College had come under attack on November 10. While all students and teachers were safely rescued and all terrorists holed up inside the building were killed, the clearance operation resulted in the martyrdom of three individuals.
 


“Our local people are not used [in carrying out these attacks],” Naqvi said. “For some time now, you can see none of the attacks have been carried out by a local citizen,” he added.
According to a handout issued by the interior ministry, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Frontier Corps (South) Inspector General Major General Mehr Omar Khan had welcomed the minister at the college. During his visit, Naqvi met officers and soldiers from the Pakistan Army, who had participated in foiling the attack, and also met students and faculty members from the college.
The statement said that Naqvi also announced that the college would be renovated, adding that the Pakistan Army and FC had set a remarkable example of bravery and professionalism by safely rescuing all students and teachers.
‎
“The enemy wanted to execute an Army Public School-like attack, but our brave soldiers foiled the attempt, sending the terrorists to hell and defeating the conspiracy,” he was quoted as saying.
“These are savages who have no link with humanity. No faith permits targeting children, and these beasts have no religion. Calling them human is an insult to humanity,” he said.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-11-15 08:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633730-bushra-bibi-influenced-imran-khan-on-governance-key-decision-making-report' target='_blank'><strong>Bushra Bibi influenced Imran Khan on governance, key decision-making: report</strong></a><br><p>

• Service strategic commands to be unified under National Strategic Command
THE wiring diagram of national security establishment has been rewritten through the most sweeping overhaul of the country’s Hig­her Defence Organisation (HDO) since 1976.
The proponents of the restructuring, introduced through Amendment in Article 243 of the Constitution and the subsequent changes in the legislations governing Army, Air Force and Navy, call it modernisation, while its critics warn about centralization.
At the centre of this redesign sits a single office, which is that of the Chief of the Army Staff, who would soon also be the Chief of the Defence Forces. The dual title has conferred new powers to this office with regards to multi-domain integration, restructuring, and creating jointness of the armed forces. The open-ended wording of the legislative amendment raises question as to who would shape the CDF’s role, from joint force integration to structural reforms, which apparently wouldn’t require parliamentary approval.
 
 

The legislation also abolishes the Chai­rman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, the tri-service post designed to maintain institutional balance and coordination within the armed forces in view of the lessons learnt from 1971 War when Navy came to know about the war through news on radio and navy’s ship Khyber was lost after being hit by Indian missile, a retired four-star general recalled while discussing HDO restructuring with Dawn. The dissolution of the chairman’s office, effective November 27, would formally end nearly five decades of joint-service representation in armed forces decision-making at least during war time.
The new command architecture has been projected by the government and the military as a functional necessity. Modern wars move at digital speed. Cyber, space, drones, and information operations don’t respect the boundaries of traditional services. But Pakistan has lived for decades with an HDO that was regularly described by experts as “anachronistic” and “structurally hollow.” In that sense, reform was overdue.
But how reform is done matters as much as why.
Rather than dispersing authority across a joint command or empowering a neutral coordinating chief much like what the United States did through Goldwater-Nichols Act or India with its Chief of Defence Staff, the restructuring has concentrated the logic of ‘jointness’ in the office of the army chief.
“Jointness is not being created between the services, its being created above them,” a retired army general who extensively studied HDO said.
Former PAF Chief Air Chief Marshal Abbas Khattak, while talking to Dawn said, “Historical experience bears testimony to the efficacy of the independent status of the land, sea and air forces, which was achieved after much debate and analysis within the advanced western armed forces decades back.”
“Are we then rejecting the globally accepted and practiced approach and regressing to the previous configuration without what should have resulted from a meaningful debate amongst our senior veterans and serving officers,” he added.
The new system virtually makes almost every top armed forces’ appointment contingent on the recommendation of the CDF-cum-COAS. It has been legislated that the newly created position of CNSC, an office overseeing nuclear forces, would be appointed, reappointed, and his service may be extended solely on the CDF’s recommendation and the process would be shielded from judicial review.
This does not mean hierarchy behind the nuclear controls has drastically changed. The National Command Authority remains civilian-led and structurally intact, but it does tilt the institutional balance inside the military in favor of the Army even though the delivery systems are spread across the three services.  The existing service strategic commands will be unified under new National Strategic Command.
“With new appointments of CDF and possibly Commander National Strategic Command becoming part of the NCA, both of whom would be from the Army, and CDF being senior to the other two services chiefs, it is not yet clear how the delicate balance between the three services, and between military and civilian components of the NCA would be maintained,” worried Dr Adil Sultan, dean of Faculty of Aerospace and Strategic Studies at Air University. Dr Adil is former PAF officer and has also served in the Strategic Plans Division.
Section 8E(2) has drawn immediate attention for its sweeping exclusion of judicial review. It states that “the appointment, reappointment or extension of the CNSC… shall not be called into question before any court on any ground whatsoever.” This unprecedented ouster clause looks to shield CNSC appointments and extensions from any legal challenge.
Legal experts warn that such language contradicts with Articles 4, 9, and 199 of the Constitution, which guarantee equality before law and judicial recourse.
Military law expert Col (retd) Inam-ur-Rahim noted: “It has been held by the apex court in a number of cases that any action of the military authorities, if taken without jurisdiction, coram non judice or in bad faith, can be challenged in the high courts as well as in the Supreme Court.”
Although the amended legislations do not link the appointments and extension in services of Air Force and Navy chiefs to the recommendation of CDF, but observers say that the way the system has been designed, it looks that all four-star appointments would be done in consultation with CDF, whereas three star and below promotions and transfers would continue to be done by the respective services chiefs.
Pakistan Army Act
A subtle but significant change in Section 176C of Pakistan Army Act gives the CDF-cum-COAS decisive control over how his own powers are delegated. The amendment allows the federal government to authorize vice or deputy chiefs of army staff to exercise COAS functions, but that has been linked to the recommendation of the CDF-cum-COAS himself. Earlier it was the executive’s prerogative to make such appointments, though they were rarely made by political government. Military rulers, Zia and Musharraf, appointed VCOAS to run the army, while they ruled the country.
A military source, speaking on the background, however, said the current chief does not intend to appoint a vice chief of army staff, for now.
Moreover, an amendment in Section 176A of Pakistan Army Act preserves constitutional primacy for the person with the rank of Field Marshal. It specifies that where inconsistencies arise, Article 243 of the Constitution, which governs command of the armed forces, will prevail.
Military law expert Omar Farooq Adam, while explaining the amendment said: “If there is any inconsistency between the provisions of Section 176A of the Army Act as to the service of Field Marshal then Article 243 of the constitution will be relied on mainly with regards to terms and conditions of service.”
Section 176A of the Pakistan Army Act empowers the federal government to make regulations for the governance, command, discipline, recruitment, terms of service, rank, precedence, and administration of the Pakistan Army, as well as for any other purposes of the Act beyond those covered by rules under Section 176.
The government defends the reforms as “clarity, not concentration”. They argue the position of Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee had long become ceremonial, that duplication needed to be eliminated, that global best practices demanded a single strategic integrator. And in fairness, much of that is true. CJCSC had neither the influence nor the required operational command. The services often behaved more like parallel bureaucracies than components of a joint war-fighting machine.
But modernisation means reducing the power of individual service chiefs and strengthening joint institutions that dilute single-service dominance. This model does the opposite by pulling more levers upward into a single office and lengthens its tenure to at least 2030 and potentially beyond to 2035. Therefore, instead of producing a system that could streamline decision-making the restructuring is risking becoming overly dependent on the personality, preferences, and politics of whoever occupies that seat.
The role of Navy and Air Force in decision making looks diminished precisely at the moment when their roles should be expanding due to maritime competition and emerging airspace threats.
ACM Khattak argues that “modern air forces cannot work well when treated as an ancillary and under some other entity or command”. He further said: “The question before us is not about institutional pride, but whether Pakistan chooses to align with globally proven models or revert to older arrangements that other nations ultimately abandoned after hard experience.”
This is not an argument against jointness. The country’s armed forces need jointness desperately. It needs integrated command structures, a strong civilian led defence ministry, and clear oversight mechanisms that bring coherence to national security planning. It needs what all modern militaries need, which is institutions stronger than individuals.
“I share the general opinion that institutions and traditions are stronger than individuals and must take precedence,” former army chief Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani had said at the time of his retirement.

Published in Dawn, November 15th, 2025</p><small>2025-11-15 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/15110229cc08f50.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955234/unsc-expected-to-vote-on-gaza-stabilisation-force-next-week' target='_blank'><strong>UNSC expected to vote on Gaza stabilisation force next week</strong></a><br><p>The UN Security Council (UNSC) will vote on the US-sponsored draft resolution authorising an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) for Gaza on November 17 (Monday), diplomatic sources told Dawn on Saturday.
The vote comes as Washington presses members to endorse US President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan, while Russia has formally placed a rival text before the UNSC, arguing that the American draft falls short of established international legal principles. Pakistan had joined other key Muslim and Arab states on Friday in expressing support for the US resolution.
In a post on X, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the administration’s plan “is the best path to peace in the Middle East”, noting that the resolution “enjoys broad international and regional support”.
 






“We are grateful to Qatar, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan, and Turkiye for their endorsement,” he wrote, adding that the Middle East has “never been this close to a real and lasting peace”.
Soon after the US circulated its draft, the Russian Mission to the UN issued a detailed explanation of its decision to table an alternative resolution.
Moscow said it welcomed the mediatory efforts that produced the current ceasefire, the release of Israeli hostages and detained Palestinians, and the resumption of humanitarian aid.
But it stressed that it was the UNSC — “the main body responsible for maintaining international peace and security” — that must define the “rightful role and necessary tools to ensure accountability and control”.
The Russian statement argued that the US draft did not sufficiently uphold “universally recognised international legal standards”, particularly the long-standing two-state framework for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement.
It said Russia’s proposal sought to align the peacekeeping arrangements for Gaza with established UNSC decisions, while “not contradicting the American initiative”.
Moscow said its draft would enable the UNSC to set “clear modalities” for deploying a peacekeeping contingent and establishing an administration in Gaza. It calls on the UN secretary general to submit options for implementing the relevant provisions of Trump’s plan, but within the broader international legal architecture.
“Only a truly equitable and inclusive approach … can ensure a durable cessation of hostilities,” the mission said, expressing hope that UNSC members would reach an agreement.
Islamabad, regional allies support US resolution on Gaza peace
In a joint statement on Friday, Pakistan, Qatar, Egypt, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, and the US reaffirmed their support for the resolution, describing the Trump plan as a “historic” framework endorsed at Sharm Al-Sheikh.
They said the plan “offers a pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood” and “a viable path towards peace and stability, not only between the Israelis and the Palestinians, but for the entire region”.
The group urged the UNSC to adopt the resolution swiftly.
The US mission, in an earlier statement, warned that the Gaza ceasefire remains “fragile” and urged UNSC members not to “sow discord” at a time when the draft is under active negotiation.
Washington has been consulting partners since mid-October and began “good-faith negotiations” on the text with UNSC members in early November.
US officials say the resolution is intended to operationalise Trump’s 20-point plan, backed by more than 20 countries at Sharm Al-Sheikh on October 13, 2025. Central to the draft is the creation of a stabilisation force and a transitional governance body for Gaza.
If adopted, the US draft would authorise a two-year mandate, running through the end of 2027, for a transitional body known as the Board of Peace, chaired by Trump.
It would also authorise the formation of a temporary 20,000-strong ISF force mandated to dismantle weapons held by non-state armed groups, protect civilians, and secure humanitarian corridors.
The US has clarified that no American troops will be deployed to Gaza as part of the force.
With rival drafts now before the UNSC  and several permanent members retaining veto power, Monday’s vote is expected to be a critical test of whether the council can unite behind a common framework for the stabilisation of a post-conflict Gaza.</p><small>2025-11-15 06:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/15112533ad882a2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955237/trump-says-he-is-considering-f-35-fighter-jet-deal-with-saudis' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he is considering F-35 fighter jet deal with Saudis</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Friday that he is considering agreeing to a deal to supply Saudi Arabia with F-35 stealth fighter jets, which are made by Lockheed Martin.
“They wanna buy a lot of jets,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One. “I’m looking at that. They’ve asked me to look at it. They want to buy a lot of ‘35’ — but they want to buy actually more than that, fighter jets.”
The potential sale comes as Trump plans to host Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman at the White House next week, when they are expected to sign economic and defence agreements.
 


Asked about the talks, Trump told reporters it was “more than meeting, we’re honouring” Saudi Arabia.
He repeated that he hoped Saudi Arabia would soon join the Abraham Accords, which have normalised relations between Israel and Muslim-majority nations.
Riyadh has resisted such a step absent agreement on a roadmap to Palestinian statehood.
A Pentagon intelligence report has raised concerns over the potential F-35 deal, warning that China could acquire the aircraft’s technology if the sale proceeds, the New York Times reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the assessment.
 
 

Trump and the crown prince may also discuss a US-Saudi defence agreement. The Financial Times reported about a month ago that there were hopes the two countries could sign such an agreement during Salman’s visit.
The Saudis have sought formal US guarantees to defend the kingdom as well as access to more advanced US weaponry.
Saudi Arabia is one of the largest customers for US arms, and the two countries have maintained strong ties for decades based on an arrangement in which the kingdom delivers oil and Washington provides security.</p><small>2025-11-15 06:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1510322682bbd67.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955232/trump-says-he-will-likely-sue-bbc-for-up-to-5-billion-over-edited-speech' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says he will likely sue BBC for up to $5 billion over edited speech</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would likely sue the BBC next week for as much as $5 billion after the British broadcaster admitted it wrongly edited a video of a speech he gave but insisted there was no legal basis for his claim.
The British Broadcasting Corporation has been plunged into its biggest crisis in decades after two senior leaders resigned following accusations of bias, including over the editing of Trump’s speech on January 6, 2021, when his supporters stormed the Capitol.
Trump’s lawyers had initially set a Friday deadline for the BBC to retract its documentary or face a lawsuit for “no less” than $1bn. They also demanded an apology and compensation for what they called “overwhelming reputational and financial harm,” according to a letter seen by Reuters.
The BBC, which has admitted its editing of Trump’s remarks was an “error of judgement,” sent a personal apology to Trump on Thursday but said it would not rebroadcast the documentary and rejected the defamation claim.
“We’ll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn, probably sometime next week,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he headed to Florida for the weekend.
“I think I have to do that, I mean they’ve even admitted that they cheated,” he said. “They changed the words coming out of my mouth.”
 






Trump said he had not spoken with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, with whom he has built a solid relationship, about the issue, but that he planned to call him this weekend. He said Starmer had tried to reach him and was “very embarrassed” by the incident.
The documentary, which aired on the BBC’s flagship ‘Panorama’ news programme, spliced together three video excerpts from Trump’s speech, creating the impression he was inciting the January 6, 2021, riot. His lawyers said this was “false and defamatory”.
‘Beyond fake, this is corrupt’
In an interview with British right-leaning TV channel GB News, Trump said the edit was “impossible to believe” and compared it to election interference.
“I made a beautiful statement, and they made it into a not beautiful statement,” he said. “Fake news was a great term, except it’s not strong enough. This is beyond fake, this is corrupt.”
Trump said the BBC’s apology was not enough.
“When you say it’s unintentional, I guess if it’s unintentional, you don’t apologise,” he said. “They clipped together two parts of the speech that were nearly an hour apart. It’s incredible to depict the idea that I had given this aggressive speech which led to riots. One was making me into a bad guy, and the other was a very calming statement.”
BBC Chair Samir Shah sent a personal apology on Thursday to the White House and told lawmakers the edit was “an error of judgement”.
The following day, British culture minister Lisa Nandy said the apology was “right and necessary”.
The broadcaster said it had no plans to rebroadcast the documentary and was investigating fresh allegations about editing practices that included the speech on another programme, ‘Newsnight’.
Biggest crisis in decades
The dispute has escalated into the broadcaster’s most serious crisis in decades.
Its director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, quit this week over the controversy amid allegations of bias and editing failures.
Starmer told parliament on Wednesday he supported a “strong and independent BBC” but said the broadcaster must “get its house in order.”
“Some would rather the BBC didn’t exist. Some of them are sitting up there,” he said, pointing to opposition Conservative lawmakers.
“I’m not one of them. In an age of disinformation, the argument for an impartial British news service is stronger than ever.”
The BBC, founded in 1922 and funded mainly by a compulsory licence fee, faces scrutiny over whether public money could be used to settle Trump’s claim.
Former media minister John Whittingdale said there would be “real anger” if licence payers’ money covered damages.</p><small>2025-11-15 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/6917b73734887.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955143/no-chairs-tables-of-eateries-on-walkways-along-karachis-major-roads' target='_blank'><strong>No chairs, tables of eateries on walkways along Karachi’s major roads</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The city commissioner on Friday announced a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for placing chairs and tables on walkways and pavements along the roads that are 100 feet wide or more and strictly prohibited restaurants and eateries from encroaching on these areas.
As per the new standard operating procedures, no outdoor placement of chairs and tables or any obstruction on footpaths, service lanes or road shoulders along the major arteries (100 feet or more) would be allowed.
However, eateries on 60-100 feet commercial roads and below 60 feet neighbourhood streets can use the space with a prior no-objection certificate (NOC) from the town office and deputy commissioner concerned without obstructing movement of pedestrians or vehicles.
As per the mechanism of obtaining the NOC, the proprietor of an eatery will submit an application to the town municipal office with a trade licence, rental agreement and an undertaking.

Commissioner announces ‘zero tolerance’ against encroachments by roadside food outlets, tea shops

The joint verification of the application would be conducted by the town municipal officer, traffic police and mukhtiarkar to assess obstruction, hygiene and nuisance potential.
The town officer will forward their recommendation to the deputy commissioner for conditional approval, valid of one year.
255 eateries unsealed
As many as 255 roadside tea shops and restaurants sealed for encroaching on walkways and pavements are now set to reopen after agreeing to follow the new SOP guidelines.
 
 

Officials said that the city administration on Friday decided to unseal the closed eateries after their association assured implementation of the newly framed guidelines.
They said that the decision to unseal was taken after the written assurance of implementation of the SOP by the restaurants association and the submission of a written affidavit by hotels.
Commissioner Syed Hasan Naqvi had formed a committee, headed by Additional Commissioner Ghulam Mehdi Shah, to prepare the SOP.
The committee, which also comprised deputy commissioners of districts East and Central and representatives of the restaurant association, to submit proposals to make it mandatory for hotels to be kept within their limit.
According to the SOP, roads have been divided into three categories: zero tolerance roads, 100 feet wide or more; commercial and secondary roads, 60-100 feet wide; and neighbourhood streets, below 60 feet wide.
There will be no encroachment on a road of one hundred or more feet at all.
The decision to determine the desired location for the hotel or tea house will be made with the confirmation of the authorised representative and traffic police and the recommendation of the town officer. The concerned DC will issue the NOC.
The commissioner said that the city administration will continue action against encroachments in the city and the unsealed eateries would be monitored.

Team incharges asked to submit reports to chief security officer of their respective division on daily basis

In a directive, the senior superintendent of police operations said in line with the government’s orders, the police crackdown against illegal Afghan nationals was continuing, but the police performance regard was disappointing.
Keeping in view this, the police have established a task force tasked with apprehending illegal Afghan nationals and shifting them to the holding centres on a daily basis.
The concerned police officials (Muharrars) have been directed not to assign any other duty to those selected as members of the special units.
A pro forma was also distributed among the special team in-charges regarding arresting illegal Afghan nationals and submitting their findings by 9pm to the chief security officer of their respective division on a regular basis.
During the last two days, the Rawalpindi police along with Special Branch, CTD and City Traffic Police conducted search and strike operations to arrest Afghan nationals illegally residing in the garrison city.
As many as 92 Afghan nationals illegally residing in the garrison city were detained, while eight cases were registered against landlords and tenants who did not register their tenancy details with the concerned police station.
Police on Friday conducted search operations in different areas and checked 1,123 houses, 336 shops, 49 hotels, two inns and the particulars of a total of 1,524 people, a police spokesman said.
He said that during the search operations, 92 illegal Afghan residents were detained. Eight cases were registered against landlords and tenants who failed to register their tenancy details.
The search operations were conducted in the areas of Kallar Syedan, Rawat, Gujar Khan, Chontra, Dhamial, Mandra, Kahuta, Chakri, Pirwadhai, Ratta Amral, Ganjmandi, City, Waris Khan, Banni, New Town and Sadiqabad.

The police spokesman said that all resources were being used to establish the rule of law and maintain peace and order.
Meanwhile, a man was gunned down by two unidentified motorcycle riders in the RA Bazaar Police Station area on Friday night, police said.
Initial police reports suggested that Adalat Khan, a resident of Tehsil Havelian, Abbottabad, had booked a ride for Ghaziabad. While he was travelling on a motorcycle and reached the PSO Pump on Ghaziabad Street, two unknown individuals arrived on another motorcycle and opened fire with a pistol.
As a result, Adalat Khan was critically injured and died on the spot.
The attackers managed to escape from the scene. Police have launched an investigation into the murder.

• JUI-F’s Younis Zehri terms the bill ‘against Islamic teachings’
• CM Bugti cites Shariat Court’s judgement in response
• Opposition vows to challenge legislation in court
QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Friday adopted the Child Marriage Prohibition Bill with majority votes amid strong protests by opposition members.
The presentation and passage of the bill triggered heated scenes in the House, with opposition lawmakers shouting slogans and creating a ruckus. During the chaos, opposition members encircled the speaker’s dais and tore copies of the bill.
The session, chaired by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, began with the draft law on banning child marriage being presented to the House.
Speaking on the bill, Leader of the Opposition Younis Zehri of the JUI-F said the legislation was against the teachings of the Quran and Sunnah and was being introduced merely to please a non-governmental organisation. Responding to this, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said that the Shariat Court was the highest authority on such matters and its judgement had already been conveyed.
Mr Zehri tore up the agenda documents in protest. As the bill was being presented, opposition members continued their agitation, tearing copies of the bill and throwing them in the air. Despite the uproar, the Child Marriage Prohibition Bill was approved by the assembly.
Opposition MPA Asghar Tareen stated that although the bill had been passed, the opposition would challenge it in court. Heated exchanges also took place between government and opposition members during the session.
During the session, issues regarding the delay in laptop distribution for students in Panjgur, sports activities and funding in Gwadar, and various points of order and departmental questions were addressed. However, three resolutions could not be presented due to disruptions during the approval of the Child Marriage Prohibition Bill.
Condolence
The House also condoled the deaths of Senator Irfan Siddiqui and Agha Siraj Durrani, and members paid tribute to those martyred in recent terrorist incidents.
Leader of the Opposition Younis Zehri criticised the Planning and Development Department for providing incorrect information on its projects, saying it undermined both his and the assembly’s privileges.
The speaker ruled that a proper response would be provided in the next session and that accountability would follow in case of negligence.
Speaking to the media after the session, CM Bugti reaffirmed the provincial assembly’s constitutional right to legislate following the passage of the child marriage bill.
“Legislation is the constitutional right of the government, and the provincial assembly exercised that right today,” he said.
 






He noted that the bill had been passed with majority votes, calling it a symbol of the strength of the democratic process.
CM Bugti emphasised that protest was the democratic right of the opposition, which the government respected. He assured that dialogue and negotiation would remain open.
He underlined that while dissent is part of democracy, legislation is always carried out in the best interest of the people.
 
 

He clarified that the bill had been under committee review for six months and was approved by the Balochistan Cabinet before being passed in the Assembly.
He stressed that the government prioritises consensus-based legislation, ensuring every bill undergoes extensive consultation and transparent procedures.
CM Bugti assured the public that the government was working with sincerity and responsibility for the development and welfare of Balochistan, and that the legislative process would continue without interruption.
Later, the speaker adjourned the session until November 17.

• India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh fared better
• China, Iran and Russia at bottom
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has been ranked 27th out of 100 — ‘Not Free’ — in terms of internet freedom by a global democracy watchdog in a recent report, which cited government measures to expand censorship practices.
During June 1, 2024 to May 31, 2025, the report issued by the US-based Freedom House noted that the authorities threatened to block virtual private networks (VPNs) and adopted amendments to the country’s cybercrime law that rights groups said could be abused.
On the other hand, countries like India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh are markedly more open, classified as ‘Partly Free’, with much higher freedom scores of 51, 53, and 45, respectively. The watchdog was unable to track Afghanistan’s score.
The countries placed at the bottom are China, Myanmar, Iran and Russia with scores of 9, 9, 13¸and 17, respectively.
The watchdog noted that governments in the countries that suffered the most extreme declines over the 15 years of global deterioration in internet freedom — Pakistan, Egypt, Russia, Turkiye, and Venezuela — intensified their control over the online environment in response to challenges to their rule.
 
 

Between 2011 to 2015, Pakistan’s internet freedom deteriorated sharply, plunging from 55 to 69.
From 2012 onwards, the status moved from ‘Partly Free’ to ‘Not Free’, reflecting increasing restrictions.
“Pakistanis reported periods of poor internet quality and disruptions to their access to WhatsApp, Signal, and other platforms throughout the coverage period,” the report noted.
“Researchers found that the connectivity disruptions were likely linked to the deployment of new website monitoring and blocking technology,” it added.
It noted that in November last year, the authorities restricted internet services across Islamabad as widespread protests in support of former prime minister Imran Khan took place. “[Imran] Khan was imprisoned throughout the coverage period.”
It continued that the platform became accessible during a four-day military conflict between Pakistan and India, which followed a terrorist attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
It maintained that “the military establishment sought to curtail the influence” of the PTI founder and his party.
VPNs
The report noted that in May this year, Pakistani officials unblocked X (formerly Twitter), which had been restricted since February 2024.
“Authorities repeatedly threatened to block VPNs operating in Pakistan without registration. Registration requirements released in Nov 2024 required the disclosure of information identifying customers; however, at the end of the month authorities said they would not block unregistered VPN connections,” the report noted.
 
 

“The development reportedly came after the law ministry found that the government lacked legal standing to block VPNs.”
The watchdog noted that amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) signed into law in January 2025 contained ambiguous language rights groups said could be used to remove online speech deemed undesirable by authorities.
It added that at least five people were sentenced to death during the coverage period after being convicted of blasphemy in connection with material posted online.
The report noted that Pakistan held regular elections under a competitive multiparty system.
“However, the military exerts enormous influence over the conduct of elections, government formation, and policies; intimidates the media; and enjoys impunity for indiscriminate or extralegal use of force,” it added.
Of the 72 countries assessed in Freedom on the Net 2025, conditions deteriorated in 28, while 17 countries registered overall gains.
“The authorities often impose selective restrictions on civil liberties. Militants conduct terrorist campaigns against the state and also regularly carry out attacks on members of religious minority groups and other perceived opponents.”
Global situation
Overall, it noted that the global internet freedom decli­ned for the 15th consecutive year.
Kenya experienced the most severe decline of the coverage period, after authorities responded to nationwide protests over tax policy in June 2024 by shutting down internet connectivity for around seven hours and arresting hundreds of protesters.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Consti­tutional Court (FCC) formally commenced on Friday after its chief justice and four judges took oath, though the proceedings were overshadowed by a boycott from five senior judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and questions are being raised over what principle, if any, guided these appointments.
Critics point out that if seniority was the yardstick, none of the appointees — except Justice Aminuddin Khan, who has been elevated as chief justice of the FCC — is senior to members of the now-defunct Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court, several of whom have been ignored.

This, they argue, is done in contrast to the spirit of the 1996 Al-Jihad Trust case, which ruled that appointments to the superior courts should be transparent so that litigants and the people at large retain faith in the independence of the judiciary.
If constitutional expertise was the criterion, none of these judges is known for pursuing constitutional matters in their practice as lawyers or has to their credit any significant constitutional judgements, again, except for Justice Amin­uddin, who, as a CB member, decided a number of constitutional matters.
“People have every right to know the transparent criteria on the basis of which these judges were picked to create history by becoming judges of the FCC, and on what basis other CB judges were sidelined,” commented a senior counsel on condition of anonymity, adding that the resignation of two Supreme Court judges before these appointments had already made the FCC controversial.
According to a notification issued on Friday, Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah were appointed FCC judges by President Asif Ali Zardari under Article 175A(3), read with Article 175C, of the newly amended Constitution through the 27th Amendment.
Soon after taking the oath, the FCC chief justice appointed retired district and sessions judge Muhammad Hafeez Ullah Khan as registrar of the new court for a period of three years and Mazhar Bhatti as the chief justice’s secretary. Their terms and conditions will be determined later.
Justice Aminuddin Khan, who in the morning was sworn in as FCC chief justice by the president at the Presidency, later administered the oath to Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi in the courtyard of the IHC.
During the IHC ceremony, none of the judges of the Supreme Court, most conspicuously Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, were present. Five IHC judges — Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Babar Sattar and Saman Rafat Imtiaz — also did not attend.
However, Justices Arbab Mohammad Tahir, Moh­ammad Asif, Mohammad Azam Khan and Raja Inam Ameen Minhas were present. IHC Chief Justice Sardar Sarfraz Dogar was also present on the podium where the FCC judges were seated.
Earlier in the morning, seven seats had been placed on the podium, but four were later removed. The ceremony also began behind schedule.
Justice Aminuddin Khan hinted that more judges may be administered the oath in a day or two and that the FCC may eventually have a total strength of 13 judges. At the Presidency, both the CJP Yahya Afridi and Justice Aminuddin Khan arrived together for the oath-taking.
Whether the judges were selected for competence or on a subjective assessment of loyalty to the government and a perceived willingness to “toe the government’s line” was a matter of concern, the senior counsel said, warning that the impartiality of the FCC risked being compromised from the outset.
“If impartiality is suspected, no court has any ground in the eyes of the public,” he regretted, adding that the government should have moved to allay such perceptions when two Supreme Court judges resigned over making the apex court subordinate to the FCC.
Former additional attorney general Tariq Mehmood Khokhar described Friday’s oath-taking as an event that would be remembered “not as the commencement of a new judicial chapter, but as the death rites for the nation’s existing constitutional order and judicial independence”.
It had, he said, become a flashpoint for “intense nationwide criticism and public outrage” over its implications. An unelected executive, he argued, had moved an unelected legislature to enact a constitutional amendment, circumventing the Supreme Court by establishing the FCC and effectively empowering the latter by disempowering the former, with the FCC usurping the Supreme Court’s constitutional jurisdiction.
The amendment allows the executive to appoint FCC judges and to order non-consensual transfers of high court judges, he bemoaned.
Former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president Muneer A. Malik, who earlier spearheaded the 2007 lawyers’ movement, said he would oppose the controversial 27th Amendment “tooth and nail” and questioned the criteria under which the new judges had been elevated to the FCC.
“This is court-packing of the FCC to gain particularised judgements,” he alleged, asking what significant background some of the appointees possessed that justified their elevation.
At the very least, the names of those under consideration for the FCC should have been floated in advance so that the public could understand the criteria behind the selections, he said.
Mr Malik also questioned whether the chief justices of the respective high courts had been consulted before some of their judges were elevated, terming the entire appointment process “totally non-transparent and absolutely a joke”.
Full court
Despite popular belief, the scheduled full court meeting, presided over by CJP Afridi, did not take up for discussion the resignations of the two Supreme Court judges — Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah — nor the appointment of judges to the FCC or the situation arising after the passage of the 27th Amendment.
Instead, a Supreme Court press release said, the full court gave its final approval to the newly adopted Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
 
 

According to the statement, the participants “unanimously updated the Rules on the recommendation of the committee, comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, constituted under Rule 1(4) of Order I of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, for removal of difficulties arising in giving effect to its provisions”.
The full court also unanimously approved the grant of the status of senior advocate of the Supreme Court to Muhammad Munir Paracha — an advocate of the apex court until now — in terms of Rule 5 of Order IV of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025.
FCC begins work
Separately, the FCC formally commenced on Friday after its chief justice and four judges took the oath.
The newly formed apex constitutional forum has begun work under makeshift arrangements, as its permanent premises have yet to be finalised.
The Ministry of Law and Justice issued notifications appointing six judges to the FCC following presidential approval.
Besides Justices Rizvi, Farooq and Najafi, the appointees include Sindh High Court’s Justice K.K. Agha and Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech. Arshad Hussain Shah has also been appointed after Justice Musarrat Hilali declined to join the FCC, according to sources.
Sources said Justice K.K. Agha’s oath-taking ceremony is scheduled for Saturday (today) at the IHC. The remaining two judges have not yet confirmed their availability, but if they appear on Saturday, they too will be administered the oath.
Initially, the FCC was proposed to be housed in the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) building, but FSC judges strongly resisted relocation to the third floor of the IHC building. Another proposal suggested accommodating the FCC temporarily within the IHC premises; however, sources said the FCC chief justice is seeking to retain courtrooms inside the Supreme Court until a permanent building is allocated. If the Supreme Court administration refused to accommodate the FCC in its premises, the Cons­titutional Court would resume its functions from the IHC from Monday.
Resignations accepted
Meanwhile, President Zardari on Friday accepted the resignations of Supreme Court judges Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah.
The two judges had handed in their resignations a day earlier, hours after the contentious 27th Amendment was signed into law by the president, describing the legislation as an affront to the judiciary and the 1973 Constitution.
In a separate development, 14 prominent lawyers — including Muneer A. Malik, Makhdoom Ali Khan, Faisal Siddiqui and Salahuddin Ahmed — issued a joint statement expressing regret over the resignations.
They declared that Justice Shah and Justice Minallah had “permanently etched their names in the short list of national heroes who prized principles over expediency, but at the demise of the Supreme Court and the extinguishment of the last members of an independent judiciary”.

• Floods in Pakistan affected 9m people, destroyed crops on large scale
ISLAMABAD: Disasters have caused an estimated $3.26 trillion in agricultural losses worldwide over the past 33 years — an average of $99 billion annually, or roughly four per cent of global agricultural GDP — according to a new report released by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) on Friday.
The report, titled Impact of Disasters on Agriculture and Food Security 2025, highlights how digital technologies are transforming the way farmers, governments and communities monitor risks, anticipate impacts and protect livelihoods.
“The global agricultural sector stands at a critical juncture, facing an unprecedented convergence of disasters, while simultaneously witnessing remarkable advances in digital technologies that offer new possibilities for understanding, predicting and managing disaster risks,” it added.
Between 1991 and 2023, disasters wiped out 4.6bn tonnes of cereals, 2.8bn tonnes of fruits and vegetables, and 900m tonnes of meat and dairy. These losses translate to a daily per capita reduction of 320 kilocalories — 13-16pc of average energy needs, the report estimated.
 
 

The FAO report said Asia accounts for the largest share of global losses of 47pc, totaling $1.53tr, reflecting both the scale of agricultural production and the region’s high exposure to floods, storms and droughts.
In Pakistan, monsoon floods affected over 9m people and destroyed 849,000 hectares of crops, coming just one year after the catastrophic 2022 floods from which the country is still recovering. The consecutive flooding events have fundamentally altered Pakistan’s agricultural landscape, with soil erosion, salinisation and infrastructure destruction creating long-term challenges for agricultural recovery.
The report identified digital transformation as a game-changer for agricultural disaster risk reduction. Emerging tools such as artificial intelligence (AI), remote sensing, mobile connectivity, drones and sensors are now enabling hyperlocal, real-time insights that improve early warning, advisory services, risk transfer mechanisms and anticipatory action.
“Digital technologies are already revolutionising how we monitor risks, deliver early warnings and support farmers’ decision-making. From the 9.1m farmers now accessing parametric insurance through digital platforms to the communities using our early warning systems to evacuate 90pc of at-risk populations before disasters strike, we are witnessing a fundamental shift from reactive response to proactive risk reduction,” said FAO Director General QU Dongyu.
Losses in production resulting from disasters correspond to a reduced availability of 320 kcal per person per day globally, with iron losses corresponding to 60pc of requirements for men and critical shortfalls in essential vitamins and minerals that have the potential to disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.
According to the report, disaster impacts on agriculture extend far beyond immediate production losses to include infrastructure damage, market disruptions, financial system failures and ecosystem service degradation that can persist for years after initial events. Current assessment tools must be extended to systematically capture both direct and indirect impacts and take into consideration non-economic values, differentiated effects on vulnerable groups, biodiversity losses and long-term ecosystem disruptions, it said.
Marine heatwaves alone are estimated to have caused $6.6bn in fisheries losses (1985-2022), with 15pc of global fisheries affected and production losses exceeding 5.6m tonnes, demonstrating the severe yet largely unmeasured impacts on aquatic food systems.
