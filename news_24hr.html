Zia, 80, was admitted to a hospital on November 23 with symptoms of a lung infection and is currently undergoing treatment in the intensive care unit, members of her party said.
Mirza Fakhrul Alamgir, from Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), told reporters late on Friday that “doctors have told us that her condition is very critical”.
Several senior BNP leaders and anxious supporters visited the hospital on Saturday to receive updates on her condition.

 

English-language newspaper, The Daily Star, said Zia has “heart problems, liver and kidney issues, diabetes, lung problems, arthritis and eye-related illnesses”.
She has a permanent pacemaker and previously underwent stenting for her heart, the publication reported.
Zia’s eldest son, Tarique Rahman, who is based in London since 2008, requested the people of Bangladesh to pray for his mother’s recovery in a post to social media on Saturday.
“We express our heartfelt thanks and gratitude for all your prayers and love for the highly respected Begum Khaleda Zia,” Rahman, 60, said.
Rahman said he was unable to return to Bangladesh because of circumstances that were beyond his control.
“I share the same deep longing as any child to have my mother’s touch in moments of crisis. However, the decision to return home is neither straightforward nor mine alone to make,” he said.
Zia, who served three terms as prime minister, was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Sheikh Hasina’s government, which also barred her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.↵
She was released last year, shortly after Hasina’s ouster.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus also issued a statement.
“During this transitional period to democracy, Khaleda Zia is a source of utmost inspiration for the nation. Her recovery is very important for the country,” he said on Friday night.







Despite her ill health, Zia has vowed to campaign in elections expected in February 2026, in which BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.</p><small>2025-11-29 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2916001549e2813.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958155/global-airlines-race-to-fix-a320-jets-after-airbus-recall' target='_blank'><strong>Global airlines race to fix A320 jets after Airbus recall</strong></a><br><p>Global airlines scrambled on Saturday to fix a software glitch on their Airbus A320 jets as a recall by the European planemaker temporarily grounded aircraft in Asia and Europe and threatened travel in the United States during the busiest weekend of the year.
The recall of 6,000 planes, covering more than half of Airbus’ global A320-family fleet, is among the broadest in its 55-year history and is a blow for the planemaker weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered model.
Airlines worked through the night to make fixes after Airbus issued the emergency recall to 350 operators around the world, and global regulators directed carriers to remedy the software problem before resuming flights.
That appeared to help head off the worst-case scenario and capped the number of flight delays in Asia and Europe early on Saturday. The US will face high travel demand later in the day after the Thanksgiving holiday period.
“It’s not as chaotic as some people might think,” said Asia-based independent aviation analyst Brendan Sobie, adding that airlines were always prepared for various potential disruptions. “But it does create some short-term headaches for operations.”
Airbus is also now telling airlines that emergency repairs to some of the A320 jets affected may be less burdensome than first thought, industry sources said, with fewer than feared likely to need hardware changes rather than the software fix.
Even so, industry executives said the abrupt action was a rare and potentially costly headache at a time when maintenance is under pressure worldwide from labour and parts shortages.
Fix is simple but necessary
Globally, there are about 11,300 of the single-aisle jets in service, including 6,440 of the core A320 model. The fix mainly involves reverting to earlier software, and although relatively simple, it must be completed before the planes can fly again.
European low-budget airline Wizz Air said early on Saturday that software updates had been implemented overnight on all its affected A320-family jets with no further disruption expected.
Flight tracker data from Cirium and FlightAware showed most global airports operating with good-to-moderate levels of delays.
AirAsia, one of the world’s largest A320 customers, said that it aimed to complete fixes in 48 hours, with engineering teams “working around the clock”.
India’s aviation regulator said 338 Airbus aircraft in the country were affected, but the software reset would be completed by Sunday.
The country’s largest airline, IndiGo, said it had completed the reset on 160 out of 200 aircraft, while Air India said it had done 42 of its 113 impacted planes. Both airlines warned of delays.
Taiwan’s Civil Aviation Administration instructed airlines to conduct inspections and maintenance. It estimates that around two-thirds of the 67 A320 and A321 aircraft operated by the island’s carriers are affected.
The Civil Aviation Authority of Macao said it had asked Air Macau to address the issue, including rescheduling flights to minimise any disruption to passengers.
ANA Holdings, Japan’s biggest airline, cancelled 95 flights on Saturday, affecting 13,500 travellers.
ANA and its affiliates, such as Peach Aviation, operate the most Airbus A320 jets in Japan. Its chief rival, Japan Airlines, has a mostly Boeing fleet and does not fly the A320.
October incident triggered recall, sources say
Industry sources said a sharp loss of altitude on a JetBlue flight on October 30 from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, that injured several passengers had triggered the Airbus recall.
Jetstar, the budget carrier of Australia’s flag carrier Qantas, said some of its flights would be affected.
South Korea’s Asiana Airlines said it does not expect any significant disruptions to its flight schedule. Its domestic rival, Korean Air, said it was working to get 10 of its jets back into service.
South Korea’s Transport Ministry said upgrades to 42 aircraft there were expected to be completed by Sunday morning.
Hong Kong budget carrier HK Express said it had upgraded more than half of its affected aircraft and that flight operations were normal.
The world’s largest A320 operator, American Airlines, said 209 of its 480 A320 aircraft needed the fix, revised down from an earlier estimate, most of which it expected to complete by Saturday.
Other US carriers, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue, and United Airlines, are also among the world’s 10 biggest A320-family operators.
Germany’s Lufthansa and Britain’s easyJet were among other airlines that said they would do the repairs.
Middle East low-cost carrier Air Arabia said it would implement “required measures” across impacted aircraft.
Colombian carrier Avianca said the recall affected more than 70 per cent of its fleet, prompting it to close ticket sales for travel dates through December 8.</p><small>2025-11-29 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/29151456c290d92.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958151/sc-affirms-states-duty-to-protect-right-to-life-prevent-custodial-violence' target='_blank'><strong>SC affirms state’s duty to protect right to life, prevent custodial violence</strong></a><br><p>The Supreme Court, in a case concerning the custodial death of a citizen, upheld that the state has a duty to protect the ‘right to life’ of citizens and to prevent custodial violence and killings, it emerged on Saturday.
The case pertains to the custodial killing of Zaryab Khan, who was detained in 2020 in Punjab’s Dera Ghazi Khan, and later died in police custody. It was alleged that two officials of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) tortured the detainee and caused his custodial death. They were later acquitted by a criminal court but were dismissed from service over misconduct by the regional police officer. Subsequently, they filed an appeal with the SC, arguing that the dismissal is “baseless” if they have been acquitted in the case.
In a seven-page judgment, authored by Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, SC dismissed the petitions and upheld the earlier ruling.
“The Constitution imposes a duty upon the State to protect the right to life of every citizen and to prevent custodial violence and killings.”
The judgment — a copy of which is available with Dawn — is dated August 21.
“The right to life has been categorised as the supreme human right, which is codified in every major human rights treaty,” Justice Mandokhail stressed.
“These Constitutional guarantees against illegal detention, arrest, brutality, torture and extra-judicial killings in any form are bedrock legal and fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution; therefore, illegal detention and torture are neither encouraged nor justified under any circumstances,” he said.
Justice Mandokhail ruled that “torture and other cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment, including outrages upon personal dignity are not permitted in any circumstance, as it is against human dignity and the rule of law.”
He noted that at times “torture led to extrajudicial killings by the police, presuming de facto impunity and as a means of bringing [the] alleged  criminal to justice”.
The judge also called for an “effective, dedicated, external” oversight of the police, terming it “the need of the hour”.
Justice Mandokhail highlighted that, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), “everyone is entitled to rights and freedom without discrimination, including the right to life, liberty, and security of person, and protection from torture, slavery, and degrading treatment”.
Citing Article 4 of the Constitution, the ruling stated that “no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken, save in accordance with law.”
“Protection of law and to be treated in accordance with the law is the inalienable right of every citizen,” Justice Mandokhail ruled.
He went on to say: “Article 10 of the Constitution provides safeguards as to arrest and detention of a person.
“It mandates that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed of the grounds of such arrest and shall be produced before the Magistrate within a period of 24 hours of such arrest.”
Justice Mandokhail, citing Article 14 of the Constitution, further stated that it stipulates that “the dignity of a man, and subject to law, privacy of home shall be inviolable. It further mandates that no person shall be subjected to torture”.
He stressed that the individual must be allowed due process, calling it a “fundamental right”.
Justice Mandokhail noted that the “police force is the custodian of law” and as the custodian, it had a duty to “preserve the framework of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution”.
“It is bound to provide security and to protect life, liberty and the dignity of a person,” he stressed.
“When a government functionary harms a person without following the law, this not only constitutes a fundamental rights violation, but also violates due process of law, guaranteed by the Constitution,” Justice Mandokhail said in the judgment.
However, it highlighted that while “there is no denial of the fact that the police [have] the authority to arrest any person who violates the law, but any such action without adopting the due process provided by the Constitution and law, and treating such person [inhumanely], cruelly and subjecting that person to torture, constitutes not only a criminal act, but also amounts to a misconduct”.
The judge ruled that the police officials had acted in violation of their duty as per law “by detaining Zaryab Khan illegally and subjecting him to torture”.
The act amounted to “misuse of authority” falling within the definition of grave misconduct, defined in sub-rule (iii) of Rule 2 of the Rules of 1975.
In October, former SC judge Justice Athar Minallah had termed extra-judicial killings, custodial torture and the excessive use of force as the most “intolerable crimes” in a democratic society, calling them the “worst form of violation” of the Constitution.
According to data compiled by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), Punjab has witnessed more than 500 alleged encounters since January 2025, resulting in over 670 fatalities — a figure higher than in any other province.</p><small>2025-11-29 11:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636381-nabs-one-click-reform-to-curb-massive-housing-frauds' target='_blank'><strong>NAB's ‘One-Click' reform to curb massive housing frauds</strong></a><br><p>

KHYBER Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and other PTI workers huddled around a fire before ending an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail against the repeated denial of meeting with Imran Khan.—X/PTIOfficial

ISLAMABAD: Dema­nd­ing that the government allow the jailed Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) fou­n­der Imran Khan to meet his sisters and party leaders, the opposition alliance warned the authorities on Friday of countrywide protests if the government did not mend its ways.
“We have stopped Sindhis, Baloch, Pashtuns, and Punjabis from taking to the streets against the government and its policies; otherwise, they would come out and create problems for the rulers,” said Pakhtu­nkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) President Meh­mood Achakzai during a joint press conference with other opposition leaders outside Parliament House.
He said the government had turned parliament into a rubber stamp and that National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq was taking dictation from elsewhere. He said people were being killed in the tribal areas, yet the NA speaker did not allow the opposition to speak on this grave issue.
He questioned why Imran Khan was kept in jail and why he was not being allowed to meet his sisters and party leaders. “The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is sitting outside Adiala Jail, but no one is paying any heed to his request to meet the PTI founder,” he said.
Democracy buried
Speaking on the occasion, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said democracy had been buried in the recent by-elections.
He claimed that the results of a by-election in Haripur, where the wife of former opposition leader Omar Ayub was contesting, had been changed. “The result on Form 47 was different from the one altered on a computer,” he alleged.
Barrister Gohar said the opposition wanted to remain part of parliament and the democratic system, but the alleged rigging in the by-elections had made this difficult.
“As far as I know [Imran] Khan, he will not allow us to be part of parliament anymore,” he added.
Published in Dawn, November 29th, 2025</p><small>2025-11-29 10:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/29122014b078b4a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958148/afghan-forces-open-fire-across-border-to-facilitate-infiltration-of-terrorists-into-pakistan-dg-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan forces open fire across border to facilitate infiltration of terrorists into Pakistan: DG ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General (DG) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry has said that Afghan forces open fire at Pakistani checkposts across the border to facilitate the infiltration of terrorists into the country.
He made the comments during a briefing with journalists on November 25, a video of which was released by the ISPR on Friday evening.
“Borders are always mutually guarded. Both countries [guard] them. Now, on the other side is such a country whose posts first engage your posts through fire, and an exchange begins. And then they have them (terrorists) pass through the gaps in between,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.



The DG ISPR said one would barely find any “administration” on the borders in terrorism-prone areas, except in “hardly five to 10 per cent” of the areas.
“Go to Tirah, Khyber; you will not find any governance. Neither will you find any courts, nor any departments that deal with law enforcement and writ of the government.”
The ISPR chief also pointed out that villages and populations were “divided” across the Pak-Afghan border.
“There are 29 tribes here that are divided, whose population is here (Pakistan) and there (Afghanistan) as well. Right on the border. How will you control the movement there?” he asked.
He noted that many questioned how terrorists could infiltrate the Pak-Afghan border, how smuggling was carried out, and how non-custom paid vehicles were able to pass through if the army and the Frontier Corps were stationed at the border.
The military spokesperson then showed images of border fences. He highlighted that military posts were set up at a distance of about 15-25 kilometres from the border.
Noting suggestions for hermetically sealing the border, the DG ISPR questioned whether even the United States, with its vast resources, was able to do the same to its border with Mexico.
“What you call a fence has no value in military terms if it is not covered by observation of fire, because someone can hold and cut that obstacle to bridge it,” he said.
The military spokesman said building a security post every 2-5km and having drone surveillance would incur a “huge cost”. “You will have to invest in the infrastructure, as well as manpower,” he emphasised.
Speaking on the “terror-crime nexus”, the DG ISPR said cells of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on the Pakistani side provided support to this network.
Similar to the strategy he explained for terrorists’ infiltration, Lt Gen Chaudhry said there were extremely coordinated attacks on the army and FC deployments on the routes. “[They] attack the posts and have smugglers’ vehicles pass from below,” he said.
He further said that non-custom-paid vehicles were a part of this network.
“If there are 0.40-0.45 million non-custom-paid vehicles moving in your province, then why do you not stop them? Who is to stop them […] why are they not stopping it, why are they not checking it, whose responsibility is this?” he asked.
“The non-customs paid vehicles are part of this political-terror-crime nexus, are being used in vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and by these terrorists in their movement,” the DG ISPR said.
‘Afghan side could not deny evidence presented by Pakistan’
On the Pak-Afghan dialogue that broke down earlier this month, Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted that Pakistan’s stance was “absolutely clear”, with Islamabad conveying that the presence of TTP cells, and their funding and functioning from Afghan soil, was not acceptable.
“We presented all kinds of evidence, and they could not deny that evidence. It was absolutely clear to the mediators, as well as to the Afghans there,” the military spokesman highlighted.
He said that Pakistan was even open to a “third-party agreement” that would detail a verifiable mechanism to combat cross-border terrorism.

 

He cited a report by the United States’ Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (Sigar) that said more than $7.2 billion worth of US military equipment had been left behind in the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said the Afghan Taliban had been unable to “convert” themselves into a state after 2021, and were now patronising various non-state actors, including those that were “country-specific and region-specific”.
He noted that Fitna Al Khawarij (TTP), Fitna al Hindustan, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM), the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, Al Qaeda and Daesh were among those groups found in Afghanistan.

 

“We say that you need to act like a state now. […] They had said that ‘we will not allow our soil to be used for terrorism’,” the DG ISPR said, adding that the Kabul regime was not representative of the Afghans.
The military spokesperson recalled the promises made in the 2020 Doha agreement and asserted that Pakistan had been engaging with the Afghan Taliban since 2021.
“Our problem is not with the Afghans. Our problem is with the Afghan Taliban regime,” he added.
“Blood and business cannot go together,” he said, stressing that trade had been halted as Pakistan’s security was paramount.
During the same briefing, Lt Gen Chaudhry also refuted allegations by the Afghan Taliban that Pakistan had conducted overnight strikes in Afghanistan earlier this week.
“In our view, there is only one sort of terrorist which is good, which is a dead terrorist,” he quipped, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists.
The DG ISPR also highlighted statistics for the repatriation of illegal migrants, stating that 971,604 individuals had been sent back this year so far — 239,574 in November alone — compared to 366,704 people in 2024.
‘Delusional India wants to sell defeat as victory’
Lt Gen Chaudhry also spoke about India during his media talk. “We can’t do anything about a delusional mind,” the DG ISPR said, recalling the Indian army chief’s comments on the May conflict being a “trailer”.
“Seven jets were downed, 26 locations were attacked, and the S400 batteries were lost in that ‘trailer’. So, I think now he wants to watch a full horror film,” he said, adding that India wanted to sell its defeat as a victory to its population.
“Any country that provides any kind of equipment to the Afghan Taliban, saying they are giving it to their army, you can consider that it is available to the terrorists.”

 

The military spokesperson also highlighted that there were social media accounts based outside of Pakistan that were involved in inciting violence in the country.
Using social media platform X’s new feature to show the country a user is located in, Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted certain handles that post about Balochistan.
He said the accounts were “doing politics inside Pakistan, and concocting a narrative against the state, against your army, against your leaders”.
‘Seems local population engagement missing in KP’
“All our governments and political parties agree that the solution to terrorism lies in a comprehensive National Action Plan,” the DG ISPR said.
He detailed that there were provincial apex committees chaired by the chief minister with 23 members, a provincial steering committee with 25 members, followed by a division-level monitoring committee, and then a district-level implementation body.
Speaking further on the non-kinetic aspects, Lt Gen Chaudhry said that the administration and the military had 140 engagements per day with the local population, including school visits and jirgas.
“The actual solution to terrorism lies in these, which the provincial and district governments ought to do […] We feel all this is missing in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said.

 

The ISPR chief also noted that 949 projects were underway in 35 districts, and that work was also being carried out on the Green Balochistan Initiative, a part of the Green Pakistan Initiative.
The military spokesman highlighted that the smuggling of Iranian diesel was a huge contributor to the “illegal spectrum, the funding of the terrorists”.
“Before the army, FC and the provincial government started this crackdown, permits were given for 20.5 million litres per day, or it was smuggled. We have brought it down to the current average of 2.7m litres,“ he said.
‘Over 67,000 IBOs conducted since Jan’
Detailing the counter-terrorism efforts, the DG ISPR said 4,910 intelligence-based operations (IBOs) had been carried out since November 4, amounting to 233 IBOs per day.
“The intensity of the kinetic counter-terrorism effort is going up,” he said, noting that 206 terrorists were killed in these operations.
Providing a breakdown of the security situation since January, Lt Gen Chaudhry said 67,023 IBOs had been conducted across the country since then.
Balochistan had the highest number of such operations, with over 53,000, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had over 12,800, and the rest of the country recorded about 850.
The military spokesperson said the country had witnessed 4,729 terrorist incidents since January, with 3,357 in KP, 1,346 in Balochistan and 26 in other regions.

The extreme weather system has destroyed nearly 15,000 homes, sending almost 44,000 people to state-run temporary shelters, the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said.
Director-General Sampath Kotuwegoda said relief operations had been strengthened with the deployment of thousands of troops from the army, navy and air force.
“We have 123 confirmed dead and another 130 missing,” Kotuwegoda told reporters in Colombo.
Cyclone Ditwah was moving away from the island on Saturday and was heading towards neighbouring India to the north, but it had already left massive destruction in its wake.
“Relief operations with the help of the armed forces are underway,” Kotuwegoda said.



Fresh landslides hit the central district of Kandy, 115 kilometres east of Colombo, with the main access road under water at several locations.
“Fibre optic cables have snapped at many places and mobile phones are not working because base stations have been flooded,” a DMC official told AFP.
He said a special unit had been deployed to restore communication lines, as several remote areas remained inaccessible by road after mudslides in tea-growing mountainous regions.
The government issued an appeal for international help and asked Sri Lankans abroad to make cash donations to support nearly half a million affected people
Officials said Prime Minister Harini Amarasuriya had met with Colombo-based diplomats to update them on the situation and seek the help of their governments.
PM says Pakistan ready to extend support
India was the first to respond, sending two planeloads of relief supplies, while an Indian warship already in Colombo on a previously planned goodwill visit donated its rations to help victims.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his condolences over the loss of lives in Sri Lanka and said New Delhi was ready to send more aid.
“We stand ready to provide more aid and assistance as the situation evolves,” Modi said on X.







Meanwhile, Priem Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan was ready to extend “any support in rescue, recovery and relief efforts as a symbol of our solidarity with our Sri Lankan brothers and sisters”.
“Pakistan stands in solidarity with the people and government of Sri Lanka in this hour of grief,” he said.







Flooding in low-lying areas worsened on Saturday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for those living along the banks of the Kelani River, which flows into the Indian Ocean from Colombo.
The Kelani burst its banks on Friday evening, forcing hundreds of people into temporary shelters, DMC said.
Rain had eased in most parts of the country, including the capital, but parts of the island’s north were still experiencing showers due to the residual effects of Cyclone Ditwah.
DMC officials said they expected flood levels to exceed those recorded in 2016, when 71 people were killed nationwide.
This week’s weather-related toll is the highest since June last year, when 26 people were killed following heavy rains. In December, 17 people died in flooding and landslides.
The worst flooding Sri Lanka has experienced since the turn of the century occurred in June 2003, when 254 people were killed.</p><small>2025-11-29 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636356-no-passenger-with-valid-documents-should-be-stopped-from-travelling-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>No passenger with valid documents should be stopped from travelling, says security czar</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes as over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives.
In a post on X, Naqvi said he visited Islamabad airport and met “passengers travelling abroad to hear their concerns directly”.
“Ordered a strict crackdown against visa agents exploiting innocent people. Took serious notice of a passenger’s November 7, complaint about low staffing at immigration and directed an immediate inquiry with a review of CCTV footage,” he said.







“No passenger with genuine and complete documents should ever be stopped from travelling but those attempting to travel on fake or unverified documents will not be allowed under any circumstances, as such actions damage Pakistan’s reputation,” he said.
“Agent mafias playing with people’s futures for money will face zero tolerance,” he said.
On Thursday, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.
The same day, the agency also initiated legal action against those involved in spreading fabricated information on social media regarding the offloading of passengers.
Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar had acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.</p><small>2025-11-29 08:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/291222263d9dea2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957990/with-an-eye-on-t20-world-cup-pakistan-look-to-bag-tri-series-title' target='_blank'><strong>With an eye on T20 World Cup, Pakistan look to bag tri-series title</strong></a><br><p>

RAWALPINDI: A confident Pakistan side take on Sri Lanka in the final of the T20 tri-nation series here at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Saturday.
The Salman Ali Agha-led hosts, who won three out of the four round robin matches of the event that also featured Zimbabwe, will be looking to continue with their good show which was soured by a six-run loss to Sri Lanka on Thursday night at the same venue.
Prior to the tri-series, Pakistan defeated South Africa 2-1 in a three-match home T20 series staged in Rawalpindi and Lahore. This series triumph showed some resurrection for the Green-shirts who lost the T20 Asia Cup decider to arch-rivals India in Dubai in September.
Chasing 185 on Thursday under lights, Pakistan ended at 178-7 with number four batter Salman remaining unbeaten on 63 off 44 balls. Salman had useful partnerships with Usman Khan (33 off 23) and then Mohammad Nawaz (27 off 16) but their efforts proved insufficient in the end.
With just over two months left in the 2026 T20 World Cup, both Pakistan and Sri Lanka will be trying their best to leave the Rawalpindi ground with the tri-series trophy.
Speaking after Thursday’s match, Salman lamented poor start to the chase that he reckoned caused the narrow loss.
“From 40 odd for four you do not win [T20] games many times chasing 180-plus,” Salman said during the post-match talk.
“We had the game [in our hands] but we could not finish it.”
Answering a question, the Pakistan skipper said that the target was achievable.
“It was a gettable target, it was a good pitch and particularly with dew coming, it was always gettable. But we didn’t start well with the bat, losing too many wickets in the powerplay,” he said.
“Same was with [our start in] the bowling, we conceded 50-60 odd runs in powerplay.
He continued, “In T20s, if you don’t start well, in batting or bowling, you will always be chasing the game.”
Replying to a question regarding his own show with the bat in Thursday’s match, Salman said, “I would have been happier, had I finished the game.”
Meanwhile, opener Saim Ayub sounded upbeat about Pakistan’s victory in the all-important final.
“While looking at the morale of our team, we will win the final,” the Saim told reporters after the last league stage match.
Responding to a query, the young player, who could not score big in the four league matches of the tri-series, said that he wanted to play a big role in the decider.
“I would like to play a big innings to make my team win the final,” the left-handed batter, kno­wn for his uniquely belligerent strokes in white-ball cricket, said without saying anything more.
Replying to a query regarding Pakistan’s preparations ahead of the World Cup, Saim said that they were improving
“Looking at the three areas [bowling, batting, fielding] of the team, our graph is showing improvement during the past two, three months, which we along with the coaches discuss after every outing. The execution in all areas is getting better.
“[Therefore] we, the players of the team, are very hopeful to perform very well in the World Cup.”
Sri Lankan captain Dasun Shanaka said that he liked the way his team – who qualified for the tri-series final with back-to-back wins against Zimbabwe and Pakistan – played.
“Really happy [with this victory]. I mentioned the other day [before the last two tri-series matches] that we should not perform like that,” the Sri Lankan skipper said in his post-match comments.
“So, I feel absolutely proud and happy the way bounced back [in the tri-series], the energy, the attitude they showed in the field, particularly today. Everybody contributed [towards the victory].”
Answering a question, Shanaka said that opener Kamil Mishara had shown his ability with the bat. The southpaw cracked a 48-ball 76 on Thursday to make sure Sri Lanka get a total beyond the hosts’ reach.
“Mishara showed his capabilities today. After starting from the ODIs he threw away his wicket, he had a couple of discussions with senior players and coaches to make sure he gets a big score today,” the skipper said.
“[Moreover] Janith Liyanage (24 not out] and Kusal Mendis (40) also chipped in.”
He went on, “When it comes to bowling [pacer] Dushmantha Chameera has always been world-class plus there is [leg-spinner] Wanindu Hasaranga. So, it was an all-round performance by the team.
“And now looking forward to the final.”
Chameera picked up 4-20 to earn the player-of-the-match honours on Thursday.

Police said the first blast occurred near a police checkpoint in the area around Qambrani Road, when unknown motorcyclists hurled a grenade at the post.
A second blast, carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED), took place in the same area as miscreants targeted a CTD vehicle that was heading towards the scene of the first explosion.
However, the vehicle escaped the IED blast and all CTD officials remained safe, police said. Police added that the IED was fixed to a motorcycle, adding that a remote was used to detonate it.

 

The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
Three explosions were reported across Balochistan yesterday, with one person injured in a blast in Kachhi district’s Mach Town. Another two blasts took place at Major Chowk in Mastung, which were followed by an exchange of fire between armed men and security forces.
Earlier this week, the Jaffar Express escaped an armed attack while passing through the Bolan Pass area of Kachhi distr­i­­ct. The incident marked the sixth attack on the train during the past one and a half months.
On September 30, at least 10 people, including four personnel, lost their lives and 33 were injured when a bomb blast ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters.</p><small>2025-11-29 07:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/29110631cb21a47.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958142/hong-kong-mourns-victims-of-blaze-that-killed-128-and-counting' target='_blank'><strong>Hong Kong mourns victims of blaze that killed 128 and counting</strong></a><br><p>Hong Kong on Saturday mourned the 128 people known to have died in a massive fire at a high-rise apartment complex, a toll that is likely to rise with 200 others still unaccounted for days after the disaster.
Authorities have arrested 11 people in connection with the city’s worst blaze in nearly 80 years as they investigate possible corruption and the use of unsafe materials during renovations at the Wang Fuk Court complex.
Rescue operations at the site in the district of Tai Po, near the border with mainland China, concluded on Friday, though police say they may find more bodies as they search the burnt-out buildings as part of ongoing investigations.
The fire started on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly engulfed seven of the eight 32-storey blocks at the complex, which were wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green mesh and layered with foam insulation for the renovations.
Search for bodies continues
Authorities have said the fire alarms at the estate, home to more than 4,600 people, had not been working properly.
Hong Kong leader John Lee, other officials and civil servants, all dressed in black, stood in silence for three minutes early on Saturday outside the central government offices, where flags were lowered to half-mast.
Condolence books have been set up at 18 points around the former British colony for the public to pay their respects.
“Our most heartfelt thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones and with those that are now living with shock and uncertainty,” Britain’s King Charles said in a statement about the “appalling tragedy”.
At Wang Fuk Court, police officers from the disaster victim identification unit, wearing white overalls, helmets and oxygen masks, entered one of the charred buildings to continue their search for remains.
They climbed over mounds of bamboo scaffolding that had fallen during the disaster and around large puddles of water created after firemen doused the buildings for days to try to lower the temperatures inside.
Families and mourners gathered to lay flowers while some faced the grim task of looking at photographs of the dead taken by rescue workers.
Authorities said on Friday that only 39 of the 128 dead had been identified.



Hong Kong’s Lee has said the government would set up a HK$300 million ($40m) fund to help residents, while some of China’s biggest listed companies have pledged donations.
Hundreds of volunteers have also mobilised to help the victims, sorting and distributing items from nappies to hot food.
They formed teams to collect, transport and distribute goods in round-the-clock shifts and have set up a sprawling support camp for displaced residents beside a shopping mall across from the complex.
Domestic workers from Indonesia and the Philippines were also caught up in the tragedy.
Hong Kong has around 368,000 such workers, mostly women from low-income Asian countries who live with their employers, often in cramped spaces.
Indonesia said six of its citizens died in the incident.
The Philippines said one of its nationals is critically injured, another is confirmed missing, and 28 are thought to be residents of the area but their whereabouts are unknown.
Deadliest blaze since 1948
The fire is Hong Kong’s deadliest since 1948, when 176 people died in a warehouse blaze, and has prompted comparisons to London’s Grenfell Tower inferno, which killed 72 people in 2017.
Residents of Wang Fuk Court were told by authorities last year that they faced “relatively low fire risks” after complaining repeatedly about fire hazards posed by ongoing renovation, the city’s Labour Department told Reuters.
The residents had raised concerns in September 2024, including about the potential flammability of the protective green mesh contractors had used to cover the bamboo scaffolding, a department spokesperson said.
Hong Kong’s anti-graft body said it had arrested eight people on Friday, including an engineering consultant, a scaffolding subcontractor and an intermediary.



Earlier, police arrested two directors and an engineering consultant of Prestige Construction, a firm identified by the government as doing maintenance on Wang Fuk Court for more than a year, on suspicion of manslaughter for using unsafe materials, including flammable foam boards blocking windows. Prestige did not answer repeated calls for comment.
Public anger over the fire has so far been muted, a stark contrast to mass pro-democracy protests of 2019 that prompted Beijing to tighten its grip on the city.
Yet some frustrated volunteers handed out flyers near the estate on Friday, demanding proper resettlement of affected residents, an overhaul of government oversight of construction projects, and an independent probe into the blaze.
As with other major fire incidents like Grenfell, analysts say pressure for answers may quickly spread beyond the construction firms to government regulators.
The Hong Kong government has traditionally staged open inquiries into large-scale tragedies, often headed by an independent judge.</p><small>2025-11-29 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/291100288a8174f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958139/egypts-foreign-minister-due-in-pakistan-today-on-2-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Egypt’s foreign minister due in Pakistan today on 2-day visit</strong></a><br><p>Egypt Foreign Minister Badr Ahmed Mohamed Abdelatty will arrive in Pakistan today on an official two-day visit, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.
In a statement, the FO said Abdelatty was undertaking the visit at the invitation of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
“The visit reflects the longstanding and cordial relations between Pakistan and Egypt, grounded in common faith, cultural affinity, and shared perspectives on regional and international issues,” it said.







The FO further stated that the visit “will contribute to further strengthening the strategic direction of Pakistan–Egypt relations and placing them on a broader trajectory, with a focus on political, economic, defence, cultural, and people-to-people cooperation”.
It said that Abdelatty will hold a “tête-à-tête meeting and delegation-level talks” with his Pakistani counterpart.
“The two sides will review the full range of bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and international developments, including the situation in Gaza,” the FO said.
His visit is “expected to reinforce Pakistan–Egypt cooperation and further advance the longstanding partnership between the two brotherly countries.”
In May, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi had reaffirmed Egypt’s desire for stronger bilateral ties with Pakistan in a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
In October, PM Shehbaz, along with FM Dar, had visited Egypt for a crucial peace summit on Gaza in Sharm el-Sheikh, joining a host of world leaders for the signing of the ceasefire agreement.
Later the same month, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir had visited the country and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to improved defence and military cooperation with Egypt.</p><small>2025-11-29 06:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636299-pakistan-reaffirms-support-for-palestinian-self-determination-on-solidarity-day' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan reaffirms support for Palestinian self-determination on solidarity day</strong></a><br><p>

A team of NCCIA produced the journalist before the magistrate at district courts and sought his physical remand for 30 days. The investigating officer said physical custody of the suspect was required for the recovery of social media accounts and completion of investigation.
A counsel for the suspect opposed the remand request, saying the journalist was illegally offloaded and arrested from Islamabad airport when he was going abroad to attend a United Nations conference.
He said the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) told a court in Islamabad that there was no case registered against the journalist. But later he was booked in the cybercrime case.
The counsel argued that there was a delay of 24 hours in the production of the suspect before the court. He said the suspect had not committed any offence. He pointed out that the alleged derogatory remarks were made by PTI activist Sanam Javed, who was a guest in a programme hosted by the journalist for a digital media channel.

 

In his order, Magistrate Naeem Wattoo noted that the record shows that the suspect is nominated in the FIR registered on Aug 5 and an inquiry has been decided against him.
He said the suspect was even declared a proclaimed offender after obtaining arrest warrants from the court.
“Therefore, it cannot be said that this case was registered for justifying his arrest on alleged offloading,” the magistrate held in his order, approving a four-day physical remand of the journalist.
The magistrate directed the NCCIA to produce the suspect again on Dec 2.

According to The Guardian, the autopen, which was patented in the US in 1803, is a robotic device that replicates signatures of a person using real ink.
The decision comes amid a broader political offensive, including renewed attacks on immigration and personal criticism of Biden.
Trump has often sought to drum up outrage over Biden’s alleged use of autopen to sign pardons, executive orders and other documents — accusing Biden of being too senile to govern while in power.
In a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote: “Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92 per cent of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect.”







“The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the United States,” he said.
Trump insisted that “the Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him”.
“I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,” he said.
He claimed that “Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury”.
The autopen is widely accepted in Washington as an administrative tool, but Trump has said their use under Biden proves the then-president was mentally incapacitated and not in control of the White House.
Biden was 82 when he left office, while Trump is 79 and due to leave office in January 2029.
Previous presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gerald Ford to Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden have all used the device for routine correspondence, and in some cases for urgent legislation while travelling.
Obama famously used the autopen in 2011 to sign an extension of the Patriot Act while abroad, and George W. Bush also relied on it extensively for letters, condolence messages, and routine certifications.
For decades, the device has been considered a practical convenience, not a constitutional issue.
In 2005, the US Department of Justice issued a legal opinion confirming that a president’s approval, rather than physical signing, is what validates executive actions.
Legal and political implications
Trump’s declaration challenges long-standing legal precedent.
In US administrative law, the validity of a presidential action rests on intent and approval, not the method of signature. Courts have consistently upheld this principle for decades.
Legal experts say that without concrete evidence that Biden did not authorise the documents, Trump’s blanket cancellation order is likely to face immediate judicial scrutiny.
Federal agencies, still bound by the Administrative Procedure Act, could be caught in uncertainty over which rules remain valid.
If courts rule that autopen signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten ones, many of Trump’s cancellations could be struck down.
Politically, the move reinforces Trump’s effort to delegitimise the previous administration and consolidate power in the Oval Office.
It mirrors his public vow to “take back control from the Deep State” and forms part of a broader strategy to dismantle Biden-era policies on immigration, climate, education, workplace rules, and foreign aid.
Democrats have criticised the move as a manufactured legal crisis, while Republicans argue it corrects a “procedural abuse”.
Congressional Democrats are expected to challenge the decision through hearings and potential legislation.
Impact on foreign relations
The cancellations could also affect US relations abroad, creating uncertainty over the validity of executive actions.
Biden-era commitments — including climate cooperation, refugee resettlement, student visas, trade facilitation, and security coordination — may now face ambiguity.
Diplomatic observers note that foreign governments may seek clarifications about bilateral agreements and cooperative frameworks.
Officials in Washington have expressed concern that retroactively voiding executive actions could undermine long-term confidence in US policy continuity, with implications for allies and partners, including countries like Pakistan, where immigration and visa matters are of direct concern.
Trump’s focus on the autopen highlights the highly personalised and confrontational nature of current US politics.
While the immediate legal effect of his actions remains uncertain, the decision adds to domestic political polarisation and introduces potential disruption in international relations.

Under the new reforms, if any vehicle is repeatedly fined for violations, it will be auctioned.
“Government vehicles involved in the violation of traffic rules will face heavy penalties, as no one is above law,” Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said in a meeting here on Friday.







A briefing was given on a modern traffic management system, road safety measures, and submission of challan reports regarding use of helmet, rooftop passengers, and other violations.
A 30-day grace period was granted to eliminate one-way violations across Punjab.
“U-turns will be redesigned to make roads safer and more organised. It was agreed that compensation (Diyat) must be provided immediately to the families of those who die in accidents.”
Marriage halls will not be allowed to operate without proper parking arrangements, ensuring parking is mandatory.
A decisive crackdown will be launched to end underage driving. “In case of underage driving, the vehicle owner may face imprisonment of up to six months,” the meeting was told.







A province-wide crackdown has been ordered to end the practice of passengers riding on bus rooftops.
“For traffic improvement and public safety, motorcycle rickshaws will be completely banned on five model roads in Lahore.”
The CM gave a 30-day deadline to the traffic department to improve Lahore’s traffic situation.
She said: “Vehicles travelling to other cities will face an action if found speeding to reach destinations faster. The traffic situation must be improved in Lahore and all other cities within a month. No exemptions will be allowed as every offender will have to pay fines. I am giving the traffic police last chance to perform otherwise we will have to create a new department.”
She said traffic violations and persistent chaotic traffic were equivalent to weakening the writ of the state.

Leading the charge on a point of order, Leader of the Opposition Ali Khurshidi of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan decried the heavy traffic fines and demanded that a house committee be formed to address the issue.

 

He said that the decision to impose heavy fines through the faceless e-ticketing system was made in a great haste. “Bike riders are [mostly] poor people; how can they pay challans worth thousands of rupees?” he asked.
He said that Karachi was among the three worst cities in the world with a dilapidated civic infrastructure. “The fines should be reduced,” he demanded.

Home minister agrees to opposition leader’s proposal regarding formation of house body to review hefty challans

Mr Khurshidi also expressed concern over the absence of traffic police on city roads and said that it’s an “organised conspiracy” leading to traffic jams.
Responding to Mr Khurshidi’s point of order, Home Minister Zia Lanjar insisted that the government’s intention was to improve traffic conditions and save lives.
Giving a cautious response over his reservations on heavy fines through e-challan system, he said that the government’s goal was to benefit the people of Karachi and improve traffic conditions.
He said that the new system aimed to reduce accidents and traffic jams. He emphasised the importance of the use of helmet and said that people riding motorcycles without helmet are being fined for Rs2,500.
Mr Lanjar said that the city’s traffic system was improved after the implementation of the new system.
He said that a staggering Rs710 million in pending e-challans remained uncollected. “The government’s stance is clear: first-time offenders can expect leniency with an apology, but repeat offenders will face double the penalty,” he added.
The minister agreed to the opposition leader’s proposal regarding formation of a house committee to address concerns and meet with traffic administration, inviting opposition input.
Call attention notices
In his call attention notice, MQM-P lawmaker Sabir Qaimkhani drew attention to the fact that toll tax was also being collected from local citizens of Hyderabad at the Detha Toll Plaza on Mirpurkhas Road.
Parliamentary Secretary for Works and Services Department Farrukh Shah said that there were orders of the Supreme Court that tax should not be collected from villages within five kilometres of any toll plaza. “If tax is being collected from the residents of local villages, we will take action,” he assured the MQM-P lawmaker.

KARACHI: After going underground in Pakistan as an illegal alien for 18 years, a 65-year-old Sri Lankan woman, will now be able to return home to her children in Colombo, thanks to concerted efforts by Edhi Foundation, Saylani Welfare Trust and human rights advocate Zia Ahmed Awan.
Speaking at a press conference at the Edhi headquarters at Meethadar on Friday, Rashina could not hold back her tears as she thanked all for coming to her aid. “I’m a poor woman. The government of Pakistan had imposed a 22 lac rupees fine on me for illegally overstaying in Pakistan. I didn’t even have money to pay for my return ticket to Sri Lanka, what to say of the heavy fine,” she said. “But God is great. God sent me help in all these people who made it possible for a destitute widow to reunite with her orphaned children,” she said.
Sharing her story, Rashina said that she is a born Muslim from Sri Lanka, who found employment as a telephone operator at a travel agency in Kuwait. It was there that she met Javed Iqbal of Mian Channu, Punjab. “We fell in love and got married. Later, we moved to Saudi Arabia where we lived for some 15 years. We have three children, two daughters, Mumtaz and Aneesha, and a son Mohammed Rafay,” she said.
In Saudi Arabia, later, when her husband lost his job, he desperately tried to find another but being unable to do so he was deported to Pakistan while Rashina was deported to Sri Lanka with their children. “Leaving my children in the care with my family in Colombo, I came to Pakistan on a visit visa to meet my husband in Mian Channu. But his family would not accept me. We left Punjab to come to Karachi where we found a small rented place. I know I should have returned to Sri Lanka when my visa expired but by then my husband had become seriously ill. His liver was failing. Then he passed away. That was in 2007. I have tried to return home to my children since then but I couldn’t without first paying a 22 lac rupees fine imposed on me for overstaying my welcome,” she informed.

Rashina set to reunite with family in Colombo following legal aid and charity support

“Having no place to go I would turn up at Saylani Welfare Trust for meals. There I met a volunteer, Anis Abdul Hafeez, who offered me a place to stay with his family in Surjani Town because I had no place to stay. When I fell sick, I reached out to Saylani again, and their chief trustee Arif Lakhani arranged for my heart bypass surgery. My hospital stay and medical bills were also taken care of by Saylani. They also tried to find me legal help. But we were getting nowhere. Not knowing what else to do, I started protesting outside the Karachi Press Club,” she said.
Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi said: “That was when some journalists alerted my son Saad Edhi about Rashina’s plight. “I then reached out to our regular legal counsel Advocate Zia Ahmed Awan for help,” Faisal Edhi told Dawn.
Advocate Zia Awan said that they reached out to the Ministry of Interior but to no avail. “Hope finally came when we approached the Constitutional Bench of the Sindh High Court which ordered for the Interior Secretary to appear before it. That was when Rashina’s hefty fine was waived and she was ordered to leave Pakistan within 15 days,” the able advocate reported.
As Arif Lakhani of Saylani had already got her Sri Lankan passport renewed, it was only a matter of him buying her a one-way air ticket to Colombo. With that arranged, Rashina is now all set to board her flight back home from Karachi on December 2.
“You are all welcome to Colombo. You will stay with me there. My children, who are half Pakistani, and I will love to have you,” Rashina told Zia Awan, Faisal Edhi, Arif Lakhani, Anis Abdul Hafeez and even the members of the media who had come to cover her story.
Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi and Advocate Awan urged the government to look into waiving off the hefty fines imposed on aliens stuck in this country only because they don’t have money to pay the fines.
“When they want to go home we should also not let such hurdles come in their way,” Faisal Edhi said.

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Imran Shoukat and SSP Serious Crime Investigation Wing Imran Qureshi detailed the successes at a press conference at the Police Lines, emphasising a broad crackdown on crime to protect citizens’ lives and property.
In one major success, the Serious Crime Investigation Wing dismantled an interprovincial gang that stole vehicles from Sindh and brought them to Balochistan, arresting four members and recovering 20 vehicles.
The wing also solved five blind murder cases and arrested suspects in several robberies, seizing stolen goods, cash, weapons, mobile phones and a large quantity of narcotics.
Overall, Quetta police arrested 12 suspects in various murder, theft and robbery cases. The arrests included three suspects in the murder of Imad Kakar: a woman identified as Atiya Rehman, Roman Ilyas and Babar Ali.

The shop from which the unlicensed murder weapon was purchased has been sealed, officials said.
Detailing other operations, DIG Shoukat said police arrested suspects Abdullah and Ibrahim for looting more than Rs20 million from a warehouse after holding a guard hostage in the Sariab area. More than 80 per cent of the stolen goods were recovered.

 

In a separate house robbery case, police arrested Fayyaz Ali, Sabir Ali and Muhammad Salman, recovering over Rs7m in gold jewellery, valuables and cash. In another incident, suspects Najibullah, Janan and Rahmatullah were arrested for snatching Rs11.8m, which was also recovered.
Officials said cases have been registered against all arrested suspects and legal proceedings have been initiated.
DIG Shoukat issued a stern warning against illegal activities, linking them to terrorist financing and vowing to hold his own officers accountable.
“Money generated from drugs and illegal Iranian petrol is being used for terrorism,” Shoukat said, adding that station house officers (SHOs) have been directed to eradicate all illegal activities, including gambling and the sale of Iranian petrol.
“If illegal activities are found during raids, the SHO of that area will be suspended and action will be taken against him.”
Both officials paid tribute to officers who have died in the line of duty and stressed that public support is crucial for lasting security.

The move must be carried out before the next routine flight, according to a separate bulletin to airlines, threatening cancellations or delays during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year in the United States and beyond.
Airbus said in a statement a recent incident involving an A320-family aircraft had revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.
“Airbus acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers,” it said. Industry sources said the incident that triggered the unexpected repair action involved a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on Oct 30, in which several passengers were hurt following a sharp loss of altitude.
Flight 1230 made an emergency landing at Tampa, Florida, after a flight control problem and a sudden uncommanded drop in altitude, prompting an FAA investigation. JetBlue and the FAA had no immediate comment. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency is due to issue an emergency directive mandating the fix, Airbus said.
For about two-thirds of the affected jets, the recall will result in a relatively brief grounding as airlines revert to a previous software version, industry sources said.
Still, that comes at a time of intense demands on airline repair shops, already plagued by shortages of maintenance capacity and the grounding of hundreds of Airbus jets.

“The blast in Ada Mach Bazaar was caused by an explosive device planted by unknown miscreants,” police said, adding that one person was injured and the windowpanes of nearby shops and houses were shattered.
Two blasts
Meanwhile, there were reports about two blasts at Major Chowk in Mastung.
Officials confirmed the two explosions and said no loss of life was reported. After the blasts, an exchange of fire took place between armed men and security forces.

ISLAMABAD: Amid a noisy protest in the Senate for a second day by PTI senators, the government on Friday assured the House that former prime minister Imran Khan was in good health with no threat to his life and blamed Afghan and Indian media for circulating “false” reports about Mr Khan’s health.
The ruckus by PTI lawmakers, alarmed by social media reports about Mr Khan’s condition, dominated the day’s proceedings. They chanted slogans and hit their desks, demanding that family members, doctors and lawyers be allowed to meet with Mr Khan after what they called a “complete blackout for weeks”.
Syed Ali Zafar, the PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate, sought an explanation from the government about the reports.



“The tension level of the public has risen so high that there will be an explosion if the matter was not resolved immediately,” Mr Zafar warned. He added that the party’s senators would not participate in proceedings until a minister provided a clear response.
“We will not become part of the proceedings till the minister concerned comes and responds,” he said before PTI senators staged a walkout.
While the government gave no assurance on allowing visits, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry rejected the social media reports as baseless.

 

Imran Khan “is in good health, facing no threat to his life, and is being provided with all facilities”, Chaudhry said, relaying information from the superintendent of Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where the ex-premier is being held.
The minister claimed Afghan media initially spread the “fake stories,” which he said were then amplified by Indian media.
The minister’s statement failed to satisfy the opposition. “We will not let the proceedings continue,” one lawmaker said. “You cannot threaten like this,” Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani responded.
The proceedings were briefly adjourned when the House was found to be one member short of a quorum. After business resumed, PTI members continued their protest, chanting “release Imran Khan”.
Meanwhile, the government laid the money bill — the Income Tax (Third Amendment) Bill, 2025 — before the House, to make recommendations on it to the National Assembly, as required under Article 73 of the Constitution.
The chair referred the bill to the Standing Committee for Finance and Revenue for further consideration
Later in the session, PTI Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, when called upon to move an item on the agenda, spoke instead on Imran’s health and rejected claims that meetings with the former leader were taking place, saying their leader had been kept behind bars unjustly and on frivolous charges.
The session chairman, Shahadat Awan of the PPP, eventually deferred the remaining agenda items after a minister expressed an inability to respond in the noisy environment. He then adjourned the House to meet again on Monday at 4pm.

• Execution of Palestinians in Jenin termed ‘summary execution’
• E4 condemns settlers’ violence in occupied West Bank
JERUSALEM/DAMASCUS: Israeli military killed 13 people in a raid on a village in Syria on Friday which Damascus called a criminal attack, and in the occupied West Bank it injured three Palestinians in its ongoing operation in a Palestinian refugee camp.
The Israeli military claimed six soldiers were wounded, three of them severely, during an incursion in the village of Beit Jinn.
Israel frequently bombed Syria when it was ruled by Assad and stepped up its military operations in the country after he was ousted, citing goals that include keeping fighters away from the frontier.
Syrian state news agency SANA, which reported 13 people killed and dozens wounded, said Israeli forces shelled Beit Jinn and Israeli troops entered the village. Residents confronted the Israeli forces, which responded, leading to “violent clashes”.

 

Syria’s foreign ministry said the Israeli attack killed more than 10 civilians, including women and children, damaged property and forced residents to flee their homes, accusing Israel of committing a “full-fledged war crime”. Walid Akasha, a local official in Beit Jinn, denied there were any terrorist factions there.
Meanwhile, Najat Rochdi, the UN’s Deputy Special Envoy for Syria, condemned Israel’s incursion as “a grave and unacceptable violation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, further destabilising an already fragile environment”.



Three injured in West Bank
Separately, Israeli continued its military operation in Far’a refugee camp in occupied West Bank, injuring three people on Friday. According to Al Jazeera, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society transported three injured people out of Tubas.
Israeli tank fire injured one child in the Rafah area, according to local Palestinian media reports. Israeli forces have started tearing down homes and buildings in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
The operation follows an earlier warning from the Israeli military that troops would raze 24 structures in the camp, which it said is required for “operational” purposes.
‘Summary execution’
The United Nations said on Friday that the killing of two Palestinians, shot dead in occupied West Bank while seemingly surrendering to Israeli forces, was an “apparent summary execution”.
“We are appalled at the brazen killing by Israeli border police yesterday (Thursday) of two Palestinian men in Jenin,” UN rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told reporters in Geneva, calling the incident “yet another apparent summary execution”.
He said UN rights chief Volker Turk was calling for “independent, prompt and effective investigations into the killings of Palestinians”, and for those responsible for killings and other violations in Israeli-occupied West Bank to “be held fully to account”.







Meanwhile, France, Germany, Italy and UK have demanded Israel to abide by international law and protect Palestinians in West Bank as illegal Israeli settler attacks reached their peak in nearly two decades.
According to Middle East Monitor, the foreign ministers of four countries, commonly known as the E4, in a joint statement strongly condemned the massive increase of settler violence against Palestinian civilians and called for stability in the occupied West Bank.

In a statement issued in Geneva, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society.
Turk warned that the amendments run counter to the separation of powers that underpin the rule of law and safeguard the protection of human rights in Pakistan.
“Under the changes adopted on November 13, a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) has been given powers over constitutional cases, replacing the previous authority of the Supreme Court, which will now only deal with civil and criminal cases,” the statement read.
It added that the systems for appointing, promoting and transferring judges changed in a manner raising “serious concerns about undermining the structural independence of Pakistan’s judiciary”.
Turk noted that the president and prime minister had already assigned the chief justice and the first set of FCC judges.







“These changes, taken together, risk subjugating the judiciary to political interference and executive control,” Turk was quoted as saying.
“Neither the executive nor legislative should be in a position to control or direct the judiciary, and the judiciary should be protected from any form of political influence in its decision-making.
“A core measure of judicial independence is a tribunal’s insulation from political interference by the government. If judges are not independent, experience shows that they struggle to apply the law equally and to uphold human rights for all in the face of political pressure.”
The UN also noted that the 27th amendment establishes lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrest for the president, field marshal, marshall of the air force and admiral of the fleet.
“Sweeping immunity provisions like these undermine accountability, which is a cornerstone of the human rights framework and democratic control of the armed forces under the rule of law,” Turk was quoted as saying.
“I am concerned that these amendments risk far-reaching consequences for the principles of democracy and rule of law which the Pakistani people hold dear.”

 

On November 13, the president signed the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The House first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on November 10 and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate to consider the latest changes.</p><small>2025-11-29 02:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/290713363208540.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958092/cybersecurity-act-essential-to-national-security-says-it-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Cybersecurity Act essential to national security, says IT minister</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Information Technology (IT) and Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja said the Cybersecurity Act 2025 was essential for national security and reflected the government’s whole-of-nation approach to cybersecurity, marking a major reform initiative.
She noted that the Act will establish the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) to lead nationwide incident response and thr­eat intelligence, while exp­ansion of the Pakistan Computer Emergency Res­ponse Team (PKCERT), and the development of secure digital public infrastructure under the Digital Economy Enhancement Project (Deep) will further strengthen national cyber resilience.
Ms Khawaja was add­ressing a gathering at FAST National University, Islam­abad, on the theme ‘Securing Pakistan’s Digi­tal Frontier: CyberShield, Policy & the Future’. The event was hosted by the FAST Public Policy and Res­earch Society (FPPRS).

 

She added that Pakis­tan’s long-term objective is to build a cyber-resilient, innovation-driven dig­ital nation where secure infrastructure, technological excellence, and human cap­ital development adva­nce together.
The minister underscored that Pakistan’s digital transformation is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, bringing with it the critical responsibility of safeguarding national digital infrastructure and citizen data.
She highlighted Pakistan’s Tier-1 ranking in the ITU Global Cybersecurity Index as a reflection of the collective commitment of the government, academia, and youth toward building a secure digital future.
The minister said Pakistan is rapidly advancing toward AI-driven cybersecurity, dark-web moni­toring, and cloud security under the Cloud-First Policy, along with secure digital identity frameworks.
She also referred to the recent Marka-i-Haq, calling it a defining moment in which the armed forces, national institutions, and cyber experts stood united with remarkable resilience.

 

She emphasised that Pakistan’s effective and coordinated cyber warfare response during this period demonstrated exceptional national strength and technological capability, adding that Marka-i-Haq proved the cyber domain is the first line of defence in the modern era, and Pakistan has shown it can safeguard its digital frontiers with confidence and competence.
The minister also toured FAST-NU Islamabad’s IC Design Lab along with Director Dr Waseem Shahzad, Dean Dr Sadia Nadeem, and Fast Public Policy and Research Society (FPPRS) President Zainab Inam Cheema, and met scholars enrolled in Ignite’s flagship training initiative, “Training in IC Design & Verification.”
Under this Ignite-funded programme, 30 young engineers — including seven female participants — are undergoing a rigorous 10-month training course covering IC design, verification, and fabrication processes.
Implemented by FAST-NU, the programme offers hands-on training aligned with global semiconductor industry standards.

ISLAMABAD: With a 256 per cent surge in current account deficit, the government on Friday expressed cautious optimism over the country’s economic outlook with stubborn inflation in 5-6pc range due to pressure on food prices and agriculture production.
In its economic update and outlook for November, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) said the industrial activity continued to strengthen amid implementation of reforms.
However, all major fiscal indicators — FBR collection, non-tax revenue, budget surplus and primary surplus — were down as percentage of GDP. The report showed the tax-to-GDP ratio was slightly lower at 2.96pc in first four months of 2025-26 when compared to 3pc last year. Non-tax revenues were also reported at 2.32pc of GDP against 2.63pc in comparable period.
Fiscal surplus was also down this year at 1.63pc of GDP against 1.65pc last year while primary surplus was reported at 2.7pc this year when compared to 2.8pc last year.
The ministry said the crop outlook showed mixed trend and hoped the ‘adequate input availability and government support measures’ to stabilise supplies as the rabi season progressed.
The current account deficit swelled to $733 million during July-October 2025-26 from $206m recorded last year, showing an increase of 255.8pc, the MoF said but claimed that the current account deficit remained “within the expected range, on the back of steady export growth and strong remittance inflows despite the increase in import demand to meet the production requirements”.
Overall, the economy is projected to maintain its positive momentum, supported by continued structural reforms, digital transition, governance improvements, on the back of ongoing efforts toward fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stabilisation, the report observed.
It said the key indicators were showing improvement as fiscal discipline was maintained through stronger revenue mobilisation and prudent expenditure management. However, the report showed expenditure growth at 11.9pc outpacing revenue growth of 11.4pc.
It said the higher remittances and expanding Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector and IT exports strengthened the economic outlook. Backed by healthy realisation of State Bank of Pakistan’s profits due to record interest rates, the ministry said the public debt declined by over Rs1.371trillion, marking the first quarterly reduction in more than five years.
“This decline reflects strategic use of surplus funds for early retirement of costly debt, thereby reducing refinancing and rollover risks and strengthening macroeconomic stability,” it noted.
Elaborating the mixed agriculture outlook, the report said the sugarcane production for the current season had been estimated to show an increase of 0.6pc to 84.74 million tonnes from 84.24m tonnes last year despite floods.
On the other hand, cotton output is estimated at 6.85m bales, down 3.3pc from 7.08m bales. Similarly, rice production declined by 3.2pc to 9.41m tonnes from 9.72m tonnes and maize production by 6.7pc to 8.43m tonnes from 9.03m tonnes last year.
However, mung and chillies production increased by 14.9pc and 0.5pc to 150,800 and 114,400 tonnes, respectively, from last year.
During 4MFY26, agricultural credit disbursement increased by 18.6pc to Rs845.3bn from Rs712.8bn last year.
The imports of agricultural machinery and implements increased by 23.5pc to $49.3m during from $39.9m in 4MFY25. The LSM output rose 4.1pc during July-September of the current fiscal year with 15 sectors recording positive growth, including textile, wearing apparel, non-metallic mineral products, food, coke & petroleum products, electrical equipment, automobile and tobacco.
On the positive side, service exports grew by 15.9pc to $3bn compared to 12pc import growth to $4.2bn, with a service trade deficit of $1.2bn against $1.1bn. IT exports were up by 19.6pc to $1.4bn.
The report confirmed that during the first quarter of FY26, net federal revenues increased by 2.4pc to Rs4.117tr compared to Rs4.019tr last year. However, the FBR’s collection rose 11.4pc to Rs3.835tr during 4MFY26. On the expenditure side, total outlays increased by 11.9pc during July-September to Rs2.779tr. Consequently, the federal fiscal balance recorded a second time surplus of Rs1.338tr, compared to a surplus of Rs1.536tr. The primary balance also improved in absolute terms, posting a surplus of Rs3.497tr, up from Rs3.202tr in the corresponding period.
Merchandise exports increased by 2pc ($10.6bn) in first four months but were overwhelmingly outpaced by 9.6pc growth in imports ($20.7bn), resulting in a $10.1bn trade deficit, compared to $8.5bn last year, showing a 19pc surge.
Remittances increased by 9.3pc to $13bn, led by inflows from Saudi Arabia (24.2pc share) and the United Arab Emirates (20.7pc). Net FDI inflows declined by 26pc to $747.7m in first four months led by $226.7m from China and $120m from Hong Kong.

Based on existing tax rates, informed sources said the ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) is expected to drop by about Rs3.70 per litre (about 1.4pc), depending on the final calculation, while the petrol rate would also come down by about Rs4.3 per litre or 1.5pc.
Petrol and HSD prices have increased by about Rs12.50 and Rs29 per litre, respectively, since June 1, 2025.
The ex-depot prices of Kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) are also estimated to reduce by Re1 (0.3pc) and Rs6.35 per litre (3.7pc), respectively. The kerosene and LDO rates currently stand at Rs194.34 and Rs170.80 per litre, respectively.
The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs265.45 per litre, which may come down to Rs261.75. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and has a direct bearing on the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-class households.
The ex-depot price of HSD stands at Rs284.44 per litre, which may drop to Rs280 per litre on Dec 1. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD.
Its price is considered inflationary, as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains, and agricultural engines such as trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells, and threshers, which push up prices of vegetables and other eatables. Transporters had already increased their fares by about Rs27 per litre between May and August and have not reversed the increase despite a Rs9 per litre cut.
The government is currently charging about Rs100 per litre on petrol and about Rs96 per litre on diesel. Although the General Sales Tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high-octane products on account of the petroleum development levy and the climate support levy. This also includes Rs2.50 per litre CSL.
The government is also charging about Rs16-17 per litre in customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of whether they are locally produced or imported. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and high-speed diesel are the major revenue spinners, with monthly average sales of about 700,000-800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene demand.
The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY25 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during the current fiscal year.

Imran has been in jail since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence on corruption charges. His family and party members have protested outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding a meeting but have been repeatedly denied despite orders from the courts.
Imran’s sister Aleema Khan filed a contempt of court petition against the Adiala jail superintendent and others over their failure to comply with an earlier Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for the incarcerated former premier.
Speaking on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, Sanaullah said: “There should be permission for meetings and they should definitely take place, but a 90-minute press conference cannot take place after an hour’s meeting; no law allows this.”
He further said that political discussions could also not take place in the meetings, saying that no law allowed a prisoner to lead, plan and guide movements on the outside from jail.
The senator maintained that it was not permitted for family members to hold press conferences outside the prison premises and for a barrage of messages to appear on social media against the state and officials.
Sanaullah argued that the IHC’s order to facilitate meetings was also contingent on similar conditions as he laid out.
“They (Imran’s family and legal team) should sit down with jail authorities and settle matters,” he said, saying that the process of meetings should be better conducted without violations from either side.
Sanaullah later said the meetings were not being allowed because they were not being conducted in accordance with the law. “The meeting should be in accordance with the law,” he maintained, reiterating that there should be no violation from either side.
The contempt petition was filed after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, along with several other PTI members, staged an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. The sit-in was staged as CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the eighth time on Thursday.
Previously, Imran’s sisters, including Aleema, had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI ended its latest sit-in on Friday morning, with the KP CM announcing that they would be approaching the IHC, where Aleema filed the contempt plea.
Meetings not subject to whims or wishes: Barrister Aqeel
Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said meetings could not be held on anyone’s ‘whims or wishes’.
He said meetings could only be held under existing prison rules and the prerogative in this regard rests with the superintendent.
Malik added that the prison administration could curtail a prisoner’s privilege to have meetings “in the public interest” if a necessary cause was found.
However, he did not elaborate on the criteria by which the Adiala jail superintendent decides when to allow meetings or not.
Malik also maintained that the rules prevented any political discussion.
Questioned about the KP chief minister’s threat to launch a protest on Tuesday if a meeting was not allowed, the minister said the government would take the necessary measures in such a situation.</p><small>2025-11-28 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636237-sindh-private-schools-asked-to-relax-uniform-policy-amid-cold-weather' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh private schools asked to relax uniform policy amid cold weather</strong></a><br><p>
