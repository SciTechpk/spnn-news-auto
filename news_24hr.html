• Shares with UN chief concerns about inflammatory remarks by Delhi
• Pakistan returns Indian border guard
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday invited India to a comprehensive dialogue to address all contentious issues, including the Kashmir dispute and the water distribution, between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
The prime minister floated this offer during his visit to the frontline area of Pasrur Cantonment in Sialkot, where he lauded the armed forces for giving an exemplary response to India under the ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ conducted in response to Indian strikes inside Pakistan following the Pahalgam incident. Pakistan had struck 26 Indian military facilities, including its airbases, using jets and missiles.
He said Pakistan’s response to the Indian attack on May 6-7 caused huge losses to the neighbouring country, in which the Pakistan Air Force downed multiple Indian Rafale aircraft. In reference to the Pakistani strikes on 26 military targets, the PM said Pakistan had “avenged” the 1971 war.
“You have taken revenge for the 1971 war…and now the whole nation is standing with you,” PM Shehbaz told troops during his address. He warned Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi against future aggression. “If you again attack us, you will lose everything…,” the PM said in a warning to his Indian counterpart. “We are ready for war and dialogue. Now the choice is yours,” he said.
With reference to PM Modi’s recent address to the nation, PM Shehbaz said: “Do not dictate us. Water is our red line; don’t even think about diverting our water. Yes, water and blood do not flow together. You have also hit our Neelum-Jhelum water project. If the damage was severe, we could have destroyed your major dams, including Baglihar Dam.” PM Shehbaz again asked PM Modi to shun differences and sit for a dialogue. “Let us extinguish this fire. Let us sit together to talk on Kashmir and water,” he added.
After the Pahalgam attack, India put the water treaty with Pakistan in abeyance, prompting a strong response from Pakistan. In an interview with an Indian media outlet last week, World Bank President Ajay Banga said there was no suspension clause in the Indus Waters Treaty.
“There is no provision in the treaty to allow for suspension the way it was drawn up. It either needs to be gone, or replaced by another one, and that requires the two countries to want to agree,” he said. He also said that the bank played no decision-making role and acted solely as a facilitator.
PM Shehbaz said the blatant aggression against innocent civilians  resulting in the martyrdom of children, women and the elderly and  calling them terrorists was utterly shameful and against all  international laws, norms and morality.
According to the PM, despite Pakistan’s offer for a neutral probe, India deliberately evaded this path, as it had nothing to prove, and India launched the offensive based on a false pretext and bloated arrogance and ego, “for which it has got a very befitting response”.
During the visit, the prime minister received a comprehensive briefing on the conduct of the battle and the current operational preparedness of the troops. He met the officers and soldiers actively participating in the military operation, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said.
In a show of continued support for all branches of the military, the prime minister is scheduled to visit various air bases and naval bases in coming days to meet troops of the Pakistan Air Force and Pakistan Navy.
The PM noted that Pakistan had agreed to the ceasefire understanding in the larger interest of peace in the region. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s strong resolve to promote peace in South Asia, while defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.
Concerns shared with UN chief
In his afternoon telephone call with UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the premier expressed his deep appreciation for the UN secretary general’s leadership and diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation in South Asia.
He stated that the UN chief’s continued engagement and preventive diplomacy demonstrated his enduring commitment to the protection of the UN Charter’s principles and purposes, as well as to fostering peace in South Asia.
This was the third phone call between the two leaders in the last two weeks.
He also expressed concern over the continued provocative and inflammatory remarks made by the Indian leadership, which were a threat to the fragile regional peace. He emphasised that the just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, was imperative to ensuring durable peace in South Asia.
The UN secretary general welcomed the ceasefire, while expressing condolences over the loss of civilian lives. He expressed his commitment to continued engagement with both sides to advance regional peace and stability.
Speaks to UAE president
PM Shehbaz held a telephone conversation with Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates. According to a statement, the PM conveyed profound gratitude for the UAE’s diplomatic efforts and constructive role during the recent crisis. He added that the UAE had stood by Pakistan through thick and thin.
PM Shehbaz also met Khazar Farhadov, ambassador of Azerbaijan to Pakistan, in Islamabad and expressed profound gratitude to President Ilham Aliyev for the unwavering solidarity and support during the recent tensions with India.
Indian guard repatriated
Pakistan returned a captured border guard to India on Wednesday, reported AFP. The guard was captured a day after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, which killed 26 people and sparked tit-for-tat missile, drone and fighter jet attacks.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but India blamed Pakistan. Islamabad rejects the accusations and has called for an independent probe. “Purnam Kumar Shaw, who had been in the custody of Pakistan Rangers since April 23, was handed over to India,” India’s Border Security Force said in a statement.

• GDP growth projected at 3.6pc, inflation at 7.7pc
• Revenue collection forecast to increase by Rs1.4tr
• Fiscal deficit targeted at 5.1pc of GDP
ISLAMABAD: As virtual technical-level discussions on the upcoming federal budget begin, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expects Pakistan’s total revenue to grow to nearly Rs20 trillion in the next fiscal year, up from the current estimate of less than Rs17.8tr, with an emphasis on tight expenditure controls to ensure sustainable debt servicing.
After three days of technical discussions through video link, formal policy-level negotiations on budget finalisation are set to begin on Monday (May 19) and continue until Friday (May 23). The agreement between the IMF staff mission and the authorities on next year’s budgetary measures and macroeconomic framework would lead to the announcement of the federal budget on June 2.
The IMF has already put on the table its projections for major economic indicators, including fiscal and monetary policies, envisaging an economic growth rate of 3.6 per cent and average inflation of 7.7pc. This means the inflation rate would be significantly higher than the current year’s average of 5.1pc. The combination of economic growth and inflation is expected to jack up revenue collection by more than Rs1.4tr from the current year’s estimated collection of about Rs12.4tr.
 
 

However, besides the FBR’s revenue collection, a major push for expansion in revenue base is being envisaged to come from provincial governments and agriculture income tax would be a key area for additional efforts.
Overall revenues for the next year are targeted to cross Rs19.9tr or 15.2pc of GDP compared to Rs17.8bn of budget estimates for the current year or 15.9pc of GDP.
The Fund expects Pakistani authorities to continue to focus on expenditure control, trimming it from 21.6pc of GDP in the current year to Rs20.3pc next year.
But even then the expenditures would get close to Rs26.57tr next year compared to budget estimates of about Rs18.9tr. The two sides have yet to work out the final numbers on revenue collection and revised expenditures, particularly those that have arisen recently due to the security situation.
The IMF expects Pakistan to reduce its fiscal deficit from 5.6pc of GDP during the current year to 5.1pc next year, or about Rs6.67tr. The government is also being asked to maintain a primary surplus — revenues minus non-interest expenditures — of around Rs2.1tr, a key condition for improving debt sustainability. Achieving this target is anticipated to bring down the debt-to-GDP ratio from the current 77.6pc to 75.6pc in FY26.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Finance has asked all the ministries and divisions to submit an additional pro forma (Form-III-C) to capture the climate-related component of subsidies to enhance and expand reporting on climate considerations in all allocations of the annual budget.
 
 

“Climate tagging of subsidies is one of the requirements under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) agreed with IMF,” read a circular issued to all government entities and ministries.
The federal budget is required to map climate relevance in three categories of adaptation, mitigation, and transition.
The public expenditure under the running of civil government and public sector development programme is being tagged and the process is now being extended to other expenditures like grants and subsidies to identify the overall climate-related public expenditure.

• Westerly system to hit north on May 19
RAWALPINDI / LAHORE: The country is bracing for its first heatwave of the season, with the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warning that temperatures across much of the country will soar well above seasonal norms from Thursday (today) and persist for three to four days.
According to a PMD advisory, a high-pressure system is likely to grip most parts of the country from May 15 to 20. As a result, daytime temperatures are forecast to remain 4 to 6 degrees Celsius above normal in the southern regions — including Sindh, southern Punjab and Balochistan — throughout the period.
Meanwhile, central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakht­unkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan are likely to experience temperatures 5°C to 7°C above normal from May 15 to 19.
A westerly weather system is also expected to enter the upper parts of the country on the evening or night of May 19. Under its influence, rain, wind and thunderstorms with isolated heavy falls and hailstorms are anticipated in Azad Kashmir, Islamabad, the Pothohar region, northeast Punjab, upper KP and Gilgit-Baltistan on May 19 and 20.
The PMD has urged the public, especially children, elderly citizens and women, to take precautionary measures during the heatwave, including avoiding direct sun exposure and staying well-hydrated.
Farmers have also been advised to adjust their agricultural activities and take steps to protect livestock. The high temperatures in northern areas may accelerate snowmelt, potentially increasing water flow in rivers. Authorities have been requested to remain alert and take preventive action to avert any emergencies caused by the extreme heat.
Emergency instructions
In Punjab, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has also issued a heatwave alert, instructing commissioners and deputy commissioners across the province to remain vigilant.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia directed departments including school education, health, transport, local government and Rescue 1122 to initiate precautionary steps. These include the provision of clean drinking water in public areas and first-aid readiness in hospitals and mobile units.
It advised citizens to take care of children, the elderly and outdoor workers, avoid unnecessary travel during peak afternoon hours, wear light-coloured clothing, and cover the head when outdoors.
The PDMA also stressed judicious water use across sectors and urged citizens to stay informed about further updates.
The National Institute of Health (NIH) had already issued a heatstroke advisory last month, urging both public and private hospitals to prepare for an increase in heat-related illnesses. The advisory noted that climate change and global warming are intensifying the frequency of extreme heat events in Pakistan, leading to a rise in morbidity and mortality.
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has highlighted the impact of climate change on human health, including increased frequency and severity of heatwaves. Pakistan has experienced severe heatwaves in recent years, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.
The country’s healthcare system faces challenges in responding to these events, particularly in rural and underserved areas. Heat-related illnesses can have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, including the elderly, children and those with pre-existing medical conditions.
The NIH said the objective of its advisory is to sensitise health care authorities to take timely, appropriate actions for preparedness and prevention of heatstroke. Infants, elderly persons, individuals with certain comorbidities, athletes, pregnant females and outdoor workers are at high risk for heatstroke.
If a person shows signs of possible heatstroke, professional medical treatment should be obtained immediately. The most critical step is lowering the temperature of the patients. The patients should be moved to a shady area, unnecessary clothing should be removed, and cool, tepid water should be applied to the skin while soaking remaining clothes with water.
If the patient can drink liquids, they should be given plenty of cool water or other cool beverages that do not contain alcohol or caffeine. Intravenous fluids should be maintained and the patient should be hospitalised if required.

According to a press release issued on Tuesday, the award ceremony was held in Rabat, the capital of Morocco.
Anushe Engineer was chosen as the winner from three finalists in her category, surpassing France’s Louis Boulay and the United Kingdom’s Issy Ronald, for her feature,  ‘It’s all or nothing for Arshad Nadeem in Paris’.  The finalists were shortlisted from 37 entries initially selected from the total submissions.
 
 

The award comes with an AIPS Scholarship at a top sporting event.
In the quiet, unobtrusive manner that has become his trademark in the elite men’s javelin, Nadeem stormed the Stade de France field to take a terrific, historic gold at August’s finals at the Paris Olympics with a mammoth 92.97 metres off his second throw.
It was an Olympic record, erasing the existing one of 90.57m, set by Andreas Thorkildsen at Beijing 2008. For the underpowered Pakistan contingent in Paris, this was arguably the country’s greatest moment in decades. His gold is Pakistan’s only gold medal outside of hockey. It is also Pakistan’s first medal of any colour since 1992.
Engineer’s feature focused on the trials and tribulations faced by the athlete in his career leading up to the historic Olympic gold.
The award was presented by jury members Andreas Schirmer and Vincent Amalvy, head of sports at Agence France-Presse, with the latter describing the finalist feature as a “great story”.
Lost for words, Engineer said she did not have an idea of what she was getting involved in upon deciding on the story in 2023.
“I really had no idea what was going on when I set out to do this story and I just went and did it,” she said of the achievement.

Sariab Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Asif Ghafoor told Dawn.com: “The convoy of PPP MP Ali Madad Jatak was attacked with hand grenades and fired upon on Sariab Road in Quetta. The incident took place near Munir Mengal Chowk. Ali Madad Jatak was unharmed in the attack, but his vehicle was partially damaged.”
He said five people were injured in the incident, who were immediately moved to Bolan Medical Complex Hospital and Civil Hospital.
Ghafoor said a heavy contingent of police reached the spot and cordoned off the area to launch an investigation that was under way.
He said Jatak was heading towards a meeting place along with his convoy to attend a victory rally.
However, a statement issued by the Balochistan Health Department said 11 injured were brought to the Civil Hospital Accident and Trauma Centre.
It added that after being provided initial medical aid, the injured were shifted to the trauma centre for further treatment, while one person died during treatment.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti condemned the attack, saying that attacks on public leadership were attacks on the province’s peace.
Bugti said that such cowardly acts could not shake the nation’s collective willpower, adding that strict and fruitful action would be taken against those hostile to peace.
He said that the elements disrupting peace would be exposed, and the people and elected representatives deserved complete protection.
“The elements hostile to the state will be made an example of.”
The Balochistan government also condemned the attack and sought a report.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said the attack was a cowardly act, adding that attacks on elected representatives were tantamount to an attack on the democratic system.
He said the attackers would be brought to justice.
“The suppression of elements active against law and order is inevitable. The government is using all resources to protect the people and representatives, such actions cannot weaken our resolve,” he said.
PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari strongly condemned the attack.
He termed the attempted attack a “cowardly and brazen act of terrorism”, affirming that such desperate attempts would not shake the party’s resolve.
Bilawal expressed hope that the terrorists involved in targeting the convoy would soon be brought to justice. He also prayed for the swift recovery of those injured in the incident and stressed that the best possible medical treatment must be ensured for them.

The provincial government is finalising proposals for the upcoming budget for the next financial year. The federal government will unveil the budget for the fiscal year 2025-26 on June 2.
In two separate meetings at the CM House of the Finance and Planning & Development departments today, the chief minister finalised the Annual Development Programme (ADP), stressing that rehabilitation of flood-damaged infrastructure must be prioritised in the upcoming budget. He also emphasised the need to reduce non-development expenditures while increasing allocations for development projects.
He further instructed that canal and watercourse lining projects be included in the new development schemes, and highlighted the importance of agricultural growth by calling for schemes that focus on improving agricultural output and productivity. “It is time to pay special attention to the agricultural sector,” he said.
Murad reiterated the government’s ongoing commitment to the health sector, emphasising the need to enhance healthcare facilities across the province. Regarding the education sector, he stressed the urgency of upgrading primary schools to the elementary level, and giving focused attention to both formal and non-formal education systems. He also directed to introduce multiple schemes for technical and higher education, and called for projects that promote sports and healthy activities for youth.
The chief minister also called for the introduction of new schemes to expand the ADP and stressed the importance of fiscal prudence. He advocated for cost-saving measures to ensure that savings are redirected towards development activities.
The main projects identified for accelerated funding in the new fiscal year include the K-IV water supply project, the Shahrah-e-Bhutto expressway, a 38.75-kilometre expressway aimed at improving urban connectivity and reducing congestion, and ongoing transport schemes in Karachi.
The chief minister emphasised reducing non-development expenditures while increasing allocations for development projects. He highlighted the government’s efforts to enhance financial resources and expressed optimism that provincial tax collection agencies would meet their targets.
A day earlier, CM Shah had announced that water supply and drainage schemes would be included in the provincial ADP as part of the provincial budget for fiscal year 2025-26.
Chairing a high-level meeting at the CM House, he had said that several development schemes focusing on water supply, drainage, solar energy, and both industrial and agricultural development would be included in the ADP. He also emphasised that reconstruction of the schools damaged by floods would be a top priority in the forthcoming uplift plan.
Highlighting the scale of this year’s development programme, the chief minister recalled that the ADP was worth Rs493 billion, with Rs55bn specifically allocated under the district ADP. He added that there were 4,644 development schemes in progress during the current fiscal year, and it was expected that 1,812 of them would be completed by the end of June 2025.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif earlier said that the government’s priority in the upcoming budget was to provide relief to the common man, stating that all-out resources will be utilised to reduce the financial difficulties of the poor and the middle class.
Chairing a meeting on the preparation of the federal budget 2025-26, the premier directed that the upcoming budget should be prepared with a focus on sustainable export-driven growth and considering the projects to promote industries and increase production.
“The budget should also focus extensively on the creation of jobs, agriculture, information technology, small and medium enterprises, and the housing sector,” he added.
The prime minister said that the government and private sector must work together for development and prosperity. He said that automation and digitisation were being promoted to bring transparency to the government system and facilitate the business community and investors.</p><small>2025-05-14 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/141859583af8a5f.jpg?r=190840' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1911006/islamabad-court-orders-jail-authorities-to-allow-imrans-contact-with-sons-check-up-by-personal-physician' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court orders jail authorities to allow Imran’s contact with sons, check-up by personal physician</strong></a><br><p>A special court in Islamabad on Tuesday instructed the Adiala Jail authorities to allow PTI founder Imran Khan to hold a telephone conversation with his sons abroad and also be allowed a medical checkup by his personal physician.
Last month, Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjum­and  approved two petitions filed on behalf of Imran related to the requests. The court had sought a response from Adiala authorities to provide the facilities.
Today, the judge heard a request by the prison authorities against the court order and dismissed it
A report to the judge from the jail superintendent on Monday had called for the court’s orders on January 10 and February 3 to be reviewed and set aside due to “being inconsistent and contrary to the basic rights and principle of recognition of the inherent dignity and equal inalienable rights of inmates”, arguing that extending the two facilities to Imran would be against the spirit of the Constitution, as well as Pakistan Prison Rules.
A court order issued today, available with Dawn.com, said the judgements passed on Jan 10 and 28 and Feb 3 were passed after taking into account all relevant factors and could not be received without any solid reason and thus, the jail superintendent’s request was turned down.
The order instructed the superintendent to “strictly follow” the three orders in “letter and spirit”. The hearing was adjourned to next Wednesday.
A day prior, Imran’s sons — Suleman Khan (28) and Qasim Khan (26) — had called attention to their father’s incarceration. The two, in a rare public appearance, had appealed for his release, claiming that their phone calls were set up with their father at odd times with limited duration, adding that the failure to miss the calls “meant going a long time before they could talk to him again.”
They had further claimed they spoke to Imran only once every two or three months.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in the £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the May 9, 2023, protests.</p><small>2025-05-14 14:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604477-bomb-exploded-at-mubarak-zeb-residence-in-bajaur-district' target='_blank'><strong>Special assistant to PM's residence targeted in bomb attack</strong></a><br><p>

The cases pertain to the arrest of workers belonging to the PTI for their alleged role in attacks on army installations during the riots that followed ex-premier Imran Khan’s arrest on May 9, 2023.
The Lahore High Court registrar issued the new amended schedule of the trials of the May 9 cases being conducted at Kot Lakhpat Jail.
 


The hearing of May 9 riot cases will now be heard in jail four days a week — Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The jail trials were earlier being held three days a week but have been extended to speed up their disposal.
The ATCs are hearing the jail trials of 14 cases including the Jinnah House attack.
In December 2024, the Pakistan Army announced that the remainng 60 PTI activists have been convicted by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM) for their involvement in the May 9 violent protests.
“The Field General Court Martial has promulgated the punishments to the following remaining 60 culprits after examining all evidence, ensuring the provision of all legal rights to the convicts, completion of due process and the appropriate legal proceedings,” the Inter-Services Public Relations, the military’s media wing, said in a statement.
Those sentenced include Hassaan Khan Niazi, a nephew of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan, and two retired armed forces officers. Days earlier, 25 others were sentenced on the same charges.
The accused were sentenced to between two and 10 years of “rigorous imprisonment”, marking the conclusion of trials for those held in military custody over the attacks on army installations. Overall, 16 individuals were sentenced to 10 years, 11 for nine years, two for eight years, six for seven years, 10 for six years, two for five years, 13 for four years, three for three years, and 22 for two years.</p><small>2025-05-14 13:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604469-at-least-13-mn-afghan-refugees-repatriated-from-pakistan-na-told' target='_blank'><strong>At least 1.3m Afghan refugees repatriated from Pakistan, NA told</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan has grappled with an unprecedented surge in forest fires in recent years. Provinces, including KP and Balochistan, have seen huge wildfires in the past three years.
Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Usman Munir, while speaking to Dawn.com, shared that a man and his wife were burned to death while they were trying to protect the firewood kept near their home from the fire.
The SDFO of the forest department in Alpuri, Zahid Hussain told Dawn.com that the victims — identified as Hakim Zada and his wife Hajiroon — set fire to the bushes near their house. The fire then quickly got out of control due to intense and gusty winds, engulfing the forest.
The wildfire has now been extinguished, and the bodies of the victims have been recovered from the site.
According to Deputy Commissioner Shangla Mohammad Fawad, compensation will be given to the next of kin of the deceased.
In 2024, over 50 wildfire incidents were reported in Shangla, while in June 2022, four people were killed by a wildfire in the Chakesar area of the district.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/14122158ce6db62.jpg?r=122844' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910966/pakistan-receives-second-tranche-of-1bn-from-imf' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan receives second tranche of $1bn from IMF</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has received the second tranche of special drawing rights (SDR) worth $1.023 billion from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, the central bank said on Wednesday.
The amount will be reflected in its foreign exchange reserves for the week ending on May 16, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said in a post on X. It would raise the reserves to $11.355bn.
 






Last week, the IMF had approved the immediate disbursement of about $1bn to Pakistan under the ongoing EFF and allowed an additional arrangement for the $1.4bn Resilience and Sus­tainability Facility (RSF).
In a statement issued last Friday, the IMF had said its Executive Board completed the first review of Pakistan’s economic reform programme supported by the EFF arrangement.
“This decision allows for an immediate disbursement of around $1bn (SDR 760 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to about $2.1bn (SDR 1.52bn). In addition, the IMF Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for an arrangement under the RSF, with access of about $1.4bn (SDR 1bn),” it said.
 


It noted that Pakistan’s policy efforts under the EFF had already delivered “significant progress” in stabilising the economy and rebuilding confidence, amidst a challenging global environment.
“Fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of two per cent of gross domestic product achieved in the first half of FY25, keeping Pakistan on track to meet the end-FY25 target of 2.1pc of GDP.
“Inflation fell to a historic low of 0.3pc in April, and progress on disinflation and steadier domestic and external conditions, have allowed the State Bank of Pakistan to cut the policy rate by a total of 1100 bps since June 2025. Gross reserves stood at $10.3bn at end-April, up from $9.4bn in August 2024, and are projected to reach $13.9bn by end-June 2025 and continue to be rebuilt over the medium term.”
Meanwhile, it said the RSF would support the authorities’ efforts to reduce vulnerability to natural disasters and build economic and climate resilience.
A statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had said PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the approval and “the failure of India’s high-handed tactics” against Pakistan.
“The country’s economic situation has improved and the country is moving towards development. India is plotting a conspiracy to divert attention from our country’s development through unilateral aggression.
“International institutions have responsibly rejected India’s false propaganda. Indian attempts to sabotage the IMF programme have failed,” it quoted the prime minister as saying.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/1415172346e83b0.jpg?r=151756' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910984/pakistan-pulled-off-a-macroeconomic-miracle-report' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan pulled off a ‘macroeconomic miracle’: report</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s market has captured the attention of global investors amid its heightened tensions with India, US publication Barron’s reports.
Over the past two years, the country has seen a “macroeconomic miracle”. While inflation was down from 40 per cent annually to near zero, Eurobonds maturing in 2031 rose from 40 cents on the dollar to 80 cents. The KSE-100 index has also tripled.
The government reached a “stabilisation agreement” with the International Monetary Fund last September with the lender approving a $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF). Over $2bn has already been disbursed.
“Pakistan is a good story,” Genna Lozovsky, a chief investment officer at Sandglass Capital Management, was quoted by Barron’s as saying. “So good it’s not risky enough for us anymore.”’
The media outlet further stated that the recent conflict with India “won’t likely knock Pakistan’s recovery off course” but the “country’s own shaky underpinnings might”.
“Pakistan has been known for boom-and-bust cycles throughout its history,” according to Khaled Sellami, an emerging markets sovereign debt manager at Barings. He said there are some signs that this time could be different.
Pakistan’s period of stabilisation started with a near-default experience in 2022-23 following Imran Khan’s ouster. Alison Graham, chief investment officer at frontier markets specialist Voltan Capital Management stated, “Everyone thought Pakistan would default along with Sri Lanka in 2023.”
Instead, the State Bank of Pakistan hiked interest rates from 10pc to 22pc, putting the country into recession but wringing out inflation.
Last year, the country gained loans from sovereign creditors China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, while the GDP growth bounced back to 2.5pc. “The current account balance is positive, and they have a primary fiscal surplus [excluding interest payments],” Sellami said. “That’s something we haven’t seen in many years.”
Pakistan remains in “relative stagnation” with cotton, apparel and cereals accounting for two-thirds of exports compared to India’s development in advanced industries like IT and pharmaceuticals. Sellami said, “It is belatedly moving into IT outsourcing, foreign sales rising from near nothing to $3bn annually over the past few years,” adding that India was in the $200bn range.
Without a value-added ladder to climb, fate and free-spending election cycles may continue driving Pakistan’s boom and bust, according to Graham. She continued, “Pakistan remains extremely fragile to external shocks.
“When there is a rally, you need to be in early.”
Sellami was more optimistic, being “constructive” on Pakistani Eurobonds. He said that the country’s foreign friends, China and the Gulf states, made it clear in 2022 that they were not writing blank cheques. “The government knows if they deviate from the tightrope they are walking, they won’t have external finance,” he added.
On Monday, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) gained a record 9pc — the restored calm in the market mirroring that in the region after the recent Pakistan-India ceasefire that boosted investor mood. “The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective deterrence against India,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.</p><small>2025-05-14 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604461-two-more-soldiers-injured-in-indian-strikes-martyred-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Indian strikes: Security forces' death toll rises to 13 as 2 more martyred</strong></a><br><p>

He made the comments during a summit between the US and Gulf Arab countries. Trump met Syria’s Ahmed al-Sharaa before the summit. Photos posted on Saudi state television showed them shaking hands in the presence of Saudi Arabia’s crown prince.
Trump also urged Sharaa to normalise ties with Israel, a White House spokesperson said.
Despite concerns within sectors of his administration over Syria’s leaders’ former ties to Al Qaeda, Trump said on Tuesday during a speech in Riyadh he would lift sanctions on Syria in a major policy shift.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan joined Trump and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, also known as MbS, virtually in the meeting, Anadolu News Agency reported.
MbS told the summit Saudi Arabia commends Trumps decision to lift sanctions on Syria.
The lifting of sanctions came despite deep Israeli suspicion of Sharaa’s administration, worries initially shared by some US officials. Israeli officials have continued to describe Sharaa as a jihadist, though he severed ties with al Qaeda in 2016. Israel’s government did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The decision is a major boost for Sharaa, who has been struggling to bring the country under the control of the Damascus government after toppling former President Bashar al-Assad in December.
The challenges were laid bare in March when Assad loyalists attacked government forces, prompting revenge attacks in which Islamist gunmen killed hundreds of civilians from the Alawite minority, drawing strong US condemnation.

Trump is on a four-day visit to the oil-rich Gulf states that includes stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates.
Trump’s first day of a four-day swing through the Gulf region was marked by lavish ceremony and business deals, including a $600 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in US arms sales to the kingdom.
Later today, Trump will fly to the Qatari capital Doha, where he will participate in a state visit with Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and other officials. Qatar, a key US ally, is expected to announce hundreds of billions of dollars in investments in the US.
US ally Israel has opposed sanctions relief for Syria, but Trump on Tuesday said that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who are both close to the US president, encouraged him to make the move.
Former Al Qaeda commander
Sharaa was for years the leader of al Qaeda’s official wing in the Syrian conflict. He first joined the group in Iraq, where he spent five years in a US prison. The United States removed a $10 million bounty on Sharaa’s head in December.
His interactions with Sharaa, who led rebel forces that toppled former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December, will be closely watched as observers gauge how serious Washington is about resetting its relationship with Damascus.

Bajaur District Police Officer (DPO) Waqas Rafique told Dawn.com, “An IED was planted at the main gate of the MNA’s house and it exploded late at night.” He added that Zeb was not at home at the time of the explosion.
The police reached the site and a search operation was under way to “track down the terrorists”, he said.
Zeb said in a statement that his family and neighbours remained safe in the explosion, but it would not affect their resolve through such tactics. “I would continue my martyred brother Rehan Zeb’s mission,” he added.
National Assembly speaker Ayaz Sadiq condemned the incident, expressing best wishes for Zeb and his family.
He directed KP’s relevant authorities to conduct a transparent investigation into the blast, saying the elements involved in the attack must be brought to justice.
 
 

Zeb was one of the PTI-backed independent candidates that the party decided to take action against after they voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment, against their party stance.
Last month, four children were wounded when a mortar shell, fired from an undisclosed location, hit a house in the Lowi Mamund tehsil in Bajaur.

With a reduction of Rs3 to Rs7 per litre in major oil products estimated for the next fortnight, the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) on Tuesday notified a 14pc reduction in the price of RLNG on Tuesday for sales at the transmission stage by the two Sui gas companies for the current month.
The Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL), which serves consumers in Sindh and Balochistan, has seen its system losses at the distribution stage drop from 16.16pc to 10.6pc.
 
 

On the other hand, the Lahore-based SNGPL, which provides gas to consumers in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saw its system losses at the distribution stage drop to 7.47pc from 8.6pc until February this year.
According to a notification, the RLNG’s sale price for SNGPL at the transmission stage has been cut by 12.42pc to $11.026 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) for May against $12.59 per mmBtu in April.

Ogra notifies 14pc cut in RLNG price

The sale price at distribution stage for SNGPL was reduced by 12.51pc to $11.79 per mmBtu for the current month, against $13.48 per mmBtu last month.
On the other side, the RLNG sale price for SSGCL has been decreased at transmission stage by 13.62pc to $9.74 per mmBtu for May, against $11.27 per mmBtu in April. The sale price at the distribution stage for the company was also reduced by 13.64pc to $10.87 per mmBtu instead of $12.59 per mmBtu last month.
The Ogra said the reduction in RLNG price was due to a decline in the delivered price on ship for both companies.
The overall decrease in absolute terms for SSGC’s transmission price amounted to $1.53 per mmBtu, while reduction at distribution stage was $1.72 per unit.
The reduction in RLNG price for SNGPL during transmission was reported at $1.56 per mmBtu and $1.69 per unit for distribution.
Ironically, the RLNG distribution prices for SSGCL $10.87 per mmBtu and $11.79 per mmBtu for SNGPL are almost $2.74 and $3.66 per mmBtu higher than the Pakistan State Oil’s $8.13 per mmBtu average delivered price ex-ship (DES), respectively.
This is mainly because of the fact that both LNG importers — PSO and Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) — and port authorities also charge profit margins on account of retainage and margins at the rate of 3.15pc and 3.1pc of DES price, respectively, on top of 7.4pc losses of SNGPL and 10.6pc losses of SSGCL.
The basket RLNG price was based on a total of 10 cargoes for May, all under two LNG contracts between PSO and Qatar Gas at an average of about $8.13 per mmBtu — six cargoes at $7.24 and four cargos at $9.48 per mmBtu. Pakistan LNG Ltd (PLL) did not import any cargo this month as it deferred cargos for the current month owing to demand crash.
Petroleum prices
On the other hand, the prices of petrol and diesel are estimated to fall by about Rs3.5 and Rs7 per litre for the next fortnight ending May 31, owing to a decline in the international market and a slight ease in import premium on petrol. This relief is, however, subject to unchanged tax rates.
Based on existing tax rates, informed sources said, the ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to go down by about Rs3.5, depending on final calculation on May 15, followed by a Rs7 per litre cut in high speed diesel (HSD).
 
 

The estimates for lower petrol price stem from about $1.5 per barrel decline in international price of petrol and about $3 per barrel in HSD over the past two weeks. The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs252.63 per litre. Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of middle and lower-middle class.
The ex-depot price of high speed diesel (HSD) stands at Rs256.64 per litre.
KE petition
In a formal petition, K-Electric has, however, requested the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) not to pass on entire benefit to consumers, and instead, set aside partial benefit to clear its past claims.
The company has already claimed Rs14.6bn past dues on account of partial load, startup costs, plant degradation and open cycle operations for the period between July 2023 and March 2025. Nepra has already set aside Rs9.4bn by disallowing full benefit of fuel cost reduction to consumers between November 2024 and January 2025.
A public hearing is scheduled for May 22.
Meanwhile, the electricity rates for consumers of K-Electric have also become entitled to Rs5.02 per unit refund next month on account of fuel cost adjustment for March, with a total financial benefit of Rs6.8bn.

• Dismisses appeal against life term for man who killed his wife
KARACHI: The Sindh High Court has expressed concern over the killing of innocent people in the name of so-called honour and ordered the state to stop this “uncivilised, barbaric and abominable practice” and deal with perpetrators sternly.
Terming honour killing a severe type of domestic violence, a single bench of the SHC said that such practice was unabatedly increasing with every passing day and there was a dire need to stop it immediately “before it gets out of hand and creates total anarchy in society”.
Justice Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro of the SHC stated that the offence of “karo-kari” had been declared as Fasad fil Arz (mischief on earth), which is a serious offence under Islamic teachings and described as disobedience to God. “Thus to avoid fasad on earth, perpetrators are required to be dealt with iron hands,” the court said.
 
 

“The honour killing has stained the society where the woman is even not given right of defence to prove her innocence against the false charges of developing illicit relations,” it added.
The bench made these observations while dismissing an appeal against life term of a man who killed his wife in the name of so-called honour.
A sessions court had sentenced accused Ghulam Mustafa to life in prison in September last year for killing his wife on the pretext of honour in Kashmore in April 2023.
Besides maintaining the life term of the appellant, the SHC also sentenced him to 14 years in prison for ‘karo-kari’ and ruled that both sentences would run consecutively since the nature of offence was gruesome and cruel.
The bench in its order noted that the motive behind the murder was the so-called practice of “karo kari” and the reason for growing tendency of such offences was the lack of accountability.
 
 

“The practice of taking the law in their hands by citizens is becoming increasingly common these days. In this part of world thousands of innocent people are being killed every year in the name of family honour on the flimsy ground of suspicion of ‘Karo-Kari’,” the judge wrote in the verdict.
It stated: “It is even observed that in order to settle the scores of enmity with rival man, the woman is killed and the said person is also killed without reasons and thereafter the male members of the community sit together and conduct a faisla declaring that since the murder was committed to save the honour, therefore, the perpetrator should not face its consequences through punishment by the court of law.
“Islamic kaw under any Fiqah does not permit any citizen to take the law into his own hands and obligates the State to protect the life and liberty of every citizen and severely punish the person who does so,” the judge stated.
“This uncivilised, barbaric and abominable practice must be stopped immediately before it gets out of hand and creates total anarchy in society. Under Islamic teachings the Fasad Fil Arz has been treated as a serious offence and has been described as disobedience to God, thus to avoid Fasad on earth, perpetrators are required to be dealt with iron hands,” it noted.
Regarding the merits of the appeal, the bench observed that the trial court had convicted the appellant on a single count of murder under Section 302 (b) read with Section 311 (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code for imprisonment of life as ta’zir.
However, the charge regarding the offence of “karo-i-kari’, which has been declared as Fasad fil Arz, was separately framed since it was an offence in addition to the murder. “Therefore, the conviction for the offence has to be recorded separately and it cannot be compounded or waived,” the bench ruled.
“The sentence of qatl-i-amd was awarded for the charge of murder whereas sentence under Section 311 PPC was awarded for spreading fasad on earth and the prosecution has established the guilt of accused for charge of both the offences in the present case,” it said, convicting the appellant.
“The appellant in the given circumstance is also convicted and sentenced for the charge of offence punishable under Section 311 PPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 14 years and conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court for the charge of offence punishable under section 302 PPC is maintained. Since the nature of offence is gruesome and cruel, therefore both the sentences are ordered to run consecutively,” it concluded.

The home department issued a letter about imposing an immediate ban on the use of rough papers or newspapers containing verses of the Holy Quran for packaging or preserving commodities. 
The order, enacted under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898, aims at preventing potential disturbances to the public peace and tranquility. 
The directive, signed by the home secretary, cites concerns over the misuse of religious texts in everyday trade practices, which could offend religious sentiments. The ban will remain in effect for 90 days across the entire province, starting from May 12. 
The authorities were directed to ensure widespread dissemination of the order through official channels, including the gazette, newspapers and broadcast media. The Punjab Police, divisional commissioners, and deputy commissioners have also been directed to enforce the prohibition strictly.

ISLAMABAD: The government has introduced a landmark bill in the National Assembly aimed at digitally tracking petroleum products from import and production to retail sales in a bid to curb smuggling and adulteration, which cause massive revenue losses estimated at Rs300-500 billion annually besides affecting environment and vehicle engines.
The Petroleum (Amend­ment) Act, 2025 — moved by Pet­roleum Minister Ali Per­vaiz Malik on Monday — seeks to amend the 1934 Petroleum Act. The draft law envisages new clauses for information technology-based tracking of petroleum products to curb smuggling and to initiate strict actions against illegal transportation and decantation of petroleum products, along with actions to be taken against illegal petrol pumps.
All local refineries and major oil marketing companies have been demanding — both individually and from their collective forums — that the government take stringent measures at borders and at domestic locations of production and sale to control smuggling of petroleum products, including LPG, as it negatively affected their businesses and caused substantial revenue losses to the government.
 
 

A 2020 inquiry ordered by the then-prime minister estimated that over Rs250bn worth of petroleum products were being smuggled annually, mostly from Iran. In April 2024, a joint intelligence report revealed that nearly 10 million litres of Iranian petrol and diesel were entering Pakistan daily via land and sea, causing a revenue loss exceeding Rs227bn.
This report entailed complete identities, addresses and contact numbers of 100 black sheep in around a dozen law enforcement agencies, owners and operators of 533 illegal petrol stations across the country, and 105 smugglers of Iranian oil. The report also contained precise information about informal border crossings and routes for trafficking smuggled items throughout Pakistan.
Officials and sources in the oil industry suggest these rep­orts were just the tip of the iceberg and did not cover the business and operations of the adulteration of petroleum products.
The new clauses also empo­wer the government to enable confiscation of petroleum products, equipment, machinery, tra­n­sportation and storage faci­lities by deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners and designated officers under the Customs Act, 1969, before and after conviction to provide for stringent administrative action against illegal activities.
For swift legal proceedings, trial powers for offences under the act will be vested in sessions courts, while administrative enforcement will rest with deputy and assistant commissioners.
Another clause provides a right of appeal in the high court, and yet another binds the Department of Explosives or other respective regulatory authorities to revise, extend, or allow new licences in a given timeframe.
One clause outlines a framework for digital tracking and monitoring of petroleum products using real-time data and coordinated action between government agencies. This includes tracking storage points, petrol stations and transport vehicles using IT-enabled systems.
Under the draft law, any individual found importing, transporting, storing, producing or selling petroleum products illegally would face a fine of Rs1m, rising to Rs5m for repeat offences. Facilities found operating without a valid licence would be sealed, and their machinery, tanks and stock confiscated. The owner would be subject to a Rs10 million fine. Those with expired or cancelled licences would be granted a six-month grace period for renewal. Failure to do so would result in confiscation and a Rs1m fine.
The Department of Explosives will renew the licences within a month upon receiving the required documents and the fee. The owner of a premises or facility involved in the storage or sale of smuggled petroleum products will be liable to closure and all machinery, equipment, mat­er­ials, storage tanks and petroleum products being employed or sold will be confiscated along with a fine of Rs100m. The licence of such facility will also be cancelled. Any means of transportation involved in transporting smuggled petroleum products will also be confiscated.

The drivers were transporting LPG imported from Iran on May 9 when armed men intercepted their trucks in the Ahmedwal area on the Quetta-Taftan highway. The assailants burst the trucks’ tires and abducted the four men at gunpoint before security forces arrived at the scene, according to authorities.
Local residents informed the administration about the bodies, prompting Levies and other law-enforcement agencies to rush to the site. The bodies were taken to the district hospital in Noshki.
Hospital officials confirmed all four men died from multiple bullet injuries after being shot from a close range.
The deceased were identified as Moin and Huzaifa, residents of Pakpattan, and brothers Imran Ali and Irfan Ali, residents of Rahimyar Khan. 
Their bodies were sent to respective hometowns after legal formalities were completed.
An investigation has been launched, officials said. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the killings.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind strongly condemned the killings. “Those behind such heinous acts — enemies of peace — will not be spared,” Mr Rind said in a statement, describing the incident as “barbaric and deeply tragic.” 
“The provincial government is utilising all available resources to ensure the perpetrators are brought to justice.”
Mr Rind extended condolences to the victims’ families and assured them that justice would be served. He noted the victims were from Punjab and said the incident “appeared to be an attempt by terrorist elements to disrupt interprovincial harmony”.
“The Balochistan government is committed to conducting a transparent and thorough investigation. Those responsible will soon be apprehended and dealt with an iron hand,” Mr Rind affirmed. He reiterated the government’s determination to uphold law and order, asserting that “such cowardly acts would not shake the state’s resolve”.

The Wire said that Indian opposition parties asked whether the ceasefire was a result of US mediation, marking a clear departure from India’s longstanding policy of ‘no third-party mediation’.
Opposition parties have demanded to know why Modi remained silent on Trump’s claims, whether India has changed its longtime policy of no third-party mediation and if the US president’s claims of trade being used to end the conflict is true.
In a statement, Congress MP Jai­r­am Ramesh said Modi’s “much-delayed address to the nation was upstaged by President Trump’s revelations”.
“The prime minister was completely silent on them. Has India agreed to US mediation? Has India agreed to a ‘neutral site’ for a dialogue with Pakistan? The prime minister should immediately have a meeting with leaders of all political parties — something he has studiously avoided in the last 20 days,” he said.
Mr Ramesh said the coming months would ‘demand both painstaking diplomacy and a collective resolve’. “One-liners and dialogue-baazi are poor substitutes,” he said, “.
Congress MP Randeep Singh Surjewala earlier also sought to know if the ceasefire with Pakistan was on the basis of mediation by the US.
“Isn’t the Modi government aware that the US president, Mr Donald Trump has issued a statement expressing mediation to solve the Kashmir issue? Is the Modi government going to allow a third-party mediation in Kashmir in absolute derogation of India’s stated policy? If not, why has PM Modi not controverted the same?”
Special session of parliament
Also, Communist Party of India (Marxist) general secretary M.A. Baby reiterated the opposition’s call for a special session of parliament and said the ceasefire announcement by Trump before any Indian official could declare it “has raised serious concerns”.
“It is an avowedly accepted policy of our country that we settle our disputes bilaterally, without allowing any third-party intervention. Therefore, this situation requires clear and authoritative clarification from the highest levels,” he wrote.
Rashtriya Janata Dal MP Manoj Kumar Jha demanded that Modi government make a statement for the US about not undermining India’s stated policy as well as denying Trump’s claim about the mention of trade being stopped.
“The kind of language he [Trump] chose, hits us Indians. I would request the prime minister that you have the country’s mandate, you should give a stern message to the US.”
All India Majlis-i-Ittehadul Musli­meen MP Asaduddin Owaisi said, “We have always been opposed to third party intervention since Simla (1972). Why have we now accepted it? I hope the Kashmir issue will not be internationalised, as it is our internal matter. Why are we agreeing to talk on neutral territory? What will be the agenda of these talks?” He also asked if Indian government’s goal was to get a Trump-brokered ceasefire.

• FO says will closely monitor Indian actions, take necessary measures to preserve rights under Indus treaty
• Security forces jam, seize ‘Indian surveillance drone’ in Lahore
ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan on Tuesday said it rem­ai­ned committed to the current ceasefire understanding with India, but any fut­ure aggression will be met with full resolve, as the Foreign Office lambasted a provocative spe­ech delivered by the Indian prime minister on May 12.
A statement issued by the Foreign Office said that Pakistan rejected “the provocative and infla­mmatory assertions” made by the Indian premier, and the remarks were “a dangerous escalation rooted in misinformation, political opportunism, and a blatant disregard for international law”.
In his speech, PM Modi had accused Pakistan of retaliating with strikes on Indian military and civilian targets, claiming that India’s air defence systems repelled the attacks and inflicted significant losses on Pakistan. He also said Pakistan requested a ceasefire through military channels on May 10 after its ‘failed’ retaliation. India accepted the ceasefire conditionally, PM Modi said, warning that future Indian responses would depend on Pakistan’s behaviour.
Pakistan dismissed this portrayal as “yet another blatant lie” and said that the ceasefire was achieved “as a result of the facilitation of several friendly countries” and any claim to the contrary was “misinformation and propaganda”.
 
 

In light of the ceasefire, the two sides are hammering out its operational details. The first post-ceasefire contact between the heads of military operations from the two countries resulted in an understanding that the two sides would uphold the truce and reduce troop deployment along the international border. Another round is expected soon.
The FO said the Pahal­gam incident was used as a pretext to attack Pakis­tan, “justify military adv­e­n­turism, serve domestic political objectives… and reinforce a manufactured narrative of a perpetual external threat”.
“After the unlawful and unprovoked Indian aggression…India recklessly provoked the situation further by targeting Pakistan’s military bases, risking an uncontrollable escalatory spiral,” the statement said, adding that the Indian actions brought the entire region to the brink of disaster. Pakistan accused India of “justifying the cold-blooded murder of innocent civilians… as the ‘new normal’ for the region”.
According to the statement, Pakistan will monitor Indian actions in the coming days and it will not allow anyone to challenge its sovereignty. “Make no mistake, we will closely monitor India’s actions and behaviour in this regard in the coming days. We also urge the international community to do the same,” it said.
In response to India’s allegations of terrorism sponsorship, Pakistan said, “We are a victim of terrorism, being directly sponsored by India. … Our contributions and sacrifices in the global fight against terrorism are well known.”
The statement also condemned India’s unilateral actions, citing New Delhi’s violation of the Indus Waters Treaty. “Pakistan will take all necessary measures to preserve its rights under the treaty,” it said.
While alluding to the unilateral suspension of Indus Waters Treaty, the Indian premier had said, “India’s stand is very clear… Terror and talks cannot go together… Terror and trade cannot go together…. Water and blood cannot flow together.”
PM Modi, in his speech, declared that India would not tolerate “nuclear blackmail or state-sponsored terrorism,” announcing a new policy that rules out dialogue with Pakistan outside the context of terrorism and Azad Kashmir.
 
 

The Foreign Office countered, saying, “Peace is the true strength. The world is not served by theatrical militarism and grandstanding but by mature leadership, regional cooperation, and respect for international norms.”
The statement reaffirmed Islamabad’s support for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.
“Pakistan is a sovereign nation with resilient institutions, a committed populace, and a globally recognized role in maintaining peace and security,” the Foreign Office said. “Our commitment to peace must never be mistaken for weakness. Any future aggression will also be met with full resolve.”
Indian Ministry of External Affairs, in its reaction to FO statement, said, “The terrorist infrastructure sites that India destroyed were responsible not only for the deaths of Indians but of many other innocents around the world. There is now a new normal. The sooner Pakistan gets used to it, the better.”
Meanwhile, an Indian drone was spotted in Lahore by the security forces, who brought it down near the Lahore airport by using the GPS jamming technology.  Sources in the law enforcement agencies said it was an “Indian surveillance drone” which was launched by the neighbouring country after the ceasefire agreement.

Speaking at the Saudi-US investment forum in Riyadh, President Trump highlighted his role in brokering the weekend ceasefire between the two South Asian rivals and urged them to build on this breakthrough.
“I said, ‘fellas, come on, let’s make a deal. Let’s do some trading. Let’s not trade nuclear missiles, let’s trade the things that you make so beautifully’,” Trump said, without clarifying which Indian or Pakistani leaders he had spoken to or when.
“They’re actually getting along. Maybe we can even get them together, Marco, where they go out and have a nice dinner together,” he said while addressing his Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who accompanied him to Saudi Arabia.

Development comes hours after Trump urges both nations to ‘go out to dinner’ together to resolve their disputes

In Washington, the State Department’s Principal Deputy Spokesperson Tommy Piggott told reporters that the United States was now focused on encouraging direct engagement between the two countries.
“We welcome the ceasefire reached between India and Pakistan this weekend and we commend both prime ministers for choosing the path of peace,” said Piggott. “We also want to encourage direct communication between the parties.”
 
 

When asked whether Pakistan had given any commitments on ‘stopping terrorist activities’ that India accuses it of indulging in, Piggott declined to comment, but reiterated Washington’s support for dialogue.
Islamabad categorically rejects such allegations as unfounded and blames India for using them as an excuse to justify its aggression against Pakistan.
“We have been clear on that. We continue to encourage that direct communication,” Piggott said. “The president has been clear on that and the president has also been in praising both prime ministers for choosing the path for peace and wisdom.”
Responding to a question about the US reaction to India’s refusal to accept a US role in the peace process, Piggott said: “I am not going to speculate on that. What I can say is that we encourage direct communication.”
Asked if the US had sent a team to Pakistan following media reports about radiation leaks from some secure nuclear facilities in Pakistan, Piggott replied, “I have nothing to preview on that this time.”
When pressed on whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s attitude was disappointing for Washington, the spokesperson avoided criticism. “What we are happy to see is a ceasefire. That’s what we are happy to see. That’s where our focus remains. We want to see the ceasefire maintained and we want to encourage direct communication,” he said.
“Our focus is the ceasefire. Our focus is on encouraging direct communication. That’s where our focus is going to remain. The president has spoken on this.”
Piggott was also asked whether President Trump would deserve the Nobel Peace Prize if he helped resolve the Kashmir dispute.
“The president is a peacemaker. He values peace. He is also a dealmaker. And he has shown that again, and again, and again,” Piggott responded. “When it comes to solving conflicts, the president wants to solve the conflicts where he can. Stands ready to help.”
