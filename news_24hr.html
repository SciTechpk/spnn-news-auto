Pakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China which has supported it through many investments and development projects such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), termed as a “lifeline” for the country’s economy.
“In a major milestone for space exploration and technological progress, Pakistan today successfully launched its Remote Sensing Satellite from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre (XSLC) in China,” a statement by the foreign ministry said.
The satellite was launched by Pakistan’s national space agency, the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), in collaboration with the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) and Microsat China, according to the ministry.
According to the statement, the satellite “will provide high-resolution, round-the-clock imaging, significantly strengthening Pakistan’s capabilities in urban planning, infrastructure development, disaster management and mitigation, agricultural monitoring, food security, environmental protection, deforestation tracking, climate change analysis, and water resource management”.
The ministry said that the satellite represented a “cornerstone of an integrated Earth observation system”.
 
 

“With this latest success, Pakistan reaffirms its position among the community of space-faring nations, leveraging innovation to pursue a more secure, sustainable, and prosperous future,” it added.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar commended the dedication of the engineers, scientists, and technical teams from Suparco, CETC and Microsat China for their “exemplary cooperation and unwavering commitment to the mission”.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal also congratulated the nation and the Suparco team on the successful launch of the satellite.
“We are deeply grateful to China for its unwavering support and cooperation in this project,” he said.
He confirmed that the satellite had successfully entered its designated orbit and would soon begin delivering data.
“We are committed to restoring Pakistan’s leadership in space technology,” Iqbal added. “With China’s help, we plan to send a Pakistani astronaut into space next year. By 2035, we will also successfully complete our lunar mission and land on the moon.”
Suparco Chairman Mohammad Yousaf Khan said that the new satellite would serve national priorities and “contribute meaningfully” to Pakistan’s sustainable socio-economic development.
China’s space programme has rapidly advanced over the years, achieving milestones like the Tiangong space station and lunar sample-return missions. Its BeiDou satellite system and reusable rocket development underscore growing technological prowess.
In April, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed Pakistan’s desire to enhance cooperation with China in the field of space technology, adding that China remained the country’s “most reliable and strategic partner”.
In May, Pakistan became the first foreign nation to join China’s space station training programme, sending two astronauts for training under a landmark agreement with the China Manned Space Agency.</p><small>2025-07-31 07:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/31112631ba7fe67.jpg?r=114218' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927780/at-least-3-dead-another-3-injured-in-separate-roof-collapse-incidents-across-kp-amid-heavy-rain' target='_blank'><strong>At least 3 dead, another 3 injured in separate roof collapse incidents across KP amid heavy rain</strong></a><br><p>At least three people died and another three were injured in separate roof collapse incidents due to heavy rains across Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, rescue officials said on Thursday.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
In Lakki Marwat’s Sarai Naurang tehsil, three people were reported dead, including two women and a 15-year-old boy, when the roof of a room in their house collapsed amid heavy rain, according to a Rescue 1122 statement.
The Rescue 1122 team has cleared the debris and recovered the bodies of the deceased from the site of the incident, which were transferred to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Sarai Naurang, said the statement.
Meanwhile, in a separate incident in Bannu, at least two others — including a man and a young boy — were injured when the roof of their house collapsed due to heavy rain, according to a Rescue statement.
“The injured were immediately provided first aid as Rescue 1122 rushed to the site of the incident after the control room received reports of rain-related roof collapse in the Faqirabad Chowk area of Bannu,” said the statement.
The injured were transferred to the nearby hospital, it added.
Bannu Rescue 1122 spokesperson Ikram Wazir, in a statement, said that “rescue teams are on alert to ensure the protection of life and property in case of an emergency.”
In a similar incident, in KP’s Tank district, a 35-year-old man sustained “serious injuries” after the roof of a room in his house caved in as a result of rain, as per a statement issued by the media coordinator of Rescue 1122 in Tank.
“The injured was rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ), Tank,” it added.
On July 26, the Pakistan Meteorological Department had forecasted downpours from July 27 to 31 in KP, while the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) directed district administrations to act immediately, ensuring minimum damage to public life and property.
The advisory cautioned that heavy rainfall, windstorms and lightning could damage weak structures like roofs and walls of mud houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
On July 29, Flash floods triggered by heavy rain swept through Naran in KP’s Mansehra district, where rescue teams had to evacuate 160 stranded tourists.
Last week, 250 tourists and passengers stranded at the Babusar Highway were rescued by the Diamer district administration, volunteers, police, Rescue 1122 and the army, according to a spokesperson.
The national death toll from monsoon-related casualties surged to 234 since late June, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority. Of the 234 deaths, 79 were men, 42 women, and 113 — nearly half of the total — were children.</p><small>2025-07-31 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616625-diplomatic-triumph-pakistan-hails-historic-trade-pact-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>‘Diplomatic triumph': Pakistan hails historic trade pact with US</strong></a><br><p>

Last month, the government introduced new taxes on local and foreign e-commerce marketplaces, which made online shopping costlier for Pakistani customers. The government has also introduced new taxes on goods purchased online from outside Pakistan through the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025.
A notification issued by the FBR on Wednesday, and seen by Dawn.com, said: “The Digital Presence Proceed Tax shall not apply to digitally ordered goods and services supplied from outside Pakistan, by any person, which are chargeable to tax under the said act.”
The Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025, had targeted online marketplaces that sell to Pakistani customers but have little to no physical presence in the country.
Under section 3 of the proposed law, every foreign vendor with a “significant digital presence in Pakistan” would have been charged a tax on goods sold online from outside Pakistan.
Typically, these vendors include online marketplaces such as AliExpress, Temu, and Amazon, among others.
Under the proposed law, customers would have been charged five per cent of the amount paid to the vendor for the purchase of goods from a foreign marketplace.
The tax would have been collected by banks, financial institutions, or payment gateways that facilitate transactions between customers and the online marketplace.
Customs were empowered to ensure that goods purchased online from foreign marketplaces were not delivered to customers unless the courier companies provided evidence of tax payment.</p><small>2025-07-31 06:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/31073008e527a32.jpg?r=073017' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927725/us-makes-deal-to-tap-pakistans-oil-reserves' target='_blank'><strong>US makes deal to tap Pakistan’s oil reserves</strong></a><br><p>• Details remain sketchy despite Trump announcement; no word on tariff rate as Aurangzeb meets key officials
• India slapped with 25pc tariff, punished for buying Russian arms, oil through ‘secondary tariffs’
• Six Indian companies face State Dept sanctions for being part of Iran oil, petrochemical trade
WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that the US has concluded a deal with Pakistan that will allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
The announcement, posted on his Truth Social account, did not specify whether the two countries have also reached an agreement on tariffs.
“We have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive Oil Reserves,” Trump wrote.
“We are in the process of choosing the Oil Company that will lead this Partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling Oil to India some day!”
Although Pakistan has long claimed to have large oil deposits along its coast, this marks the first high-level move towards tapping them.
The reference to India was also particularly poignant, as the US president earlier slapped the country with a 25 per cent tariff on imports, mainly as a punishment for acquiring oil and military equipment from Russia.
“Likewise, other Countries are making offers for a Tariff reduction. All of this will help reduce our Trade Deficit in a very major way,” he wrote, adding: “A full report will be released at the appropriate time.”
In a separate part of his post, Trump mentioned South Korea to illustrate the ongoing tariff discussions, in a way that could also be seen as inviting further offers from countries like Pakistan.
“South Korea is right now at a 25% Tariff, but they have an offer to buy down those Tariffs. I will be interested in hearing what that offer is.”
Pakistani officials have previously offered to reduce the country’s $3 billion trade deficit with the United States by increasing imports of US goods, including oil, rather than accepting higher tariffs.
Aurangzeb holds talks
Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb, who is currently in Washington for what officials describe as final-stage negotiations on a tariff deal, also began meetings with senior US officials on Wednesday.
The Pakistani delegation is keeping the details of the talks under wraps, but one official said, “We hope to sign a deal before the (Aug 1) deadline expires.”
“We hope to conclude a mutually beneficial trade agreement… hopefully in days, not in weeks,” said Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar during a recent event at the Atlantic Council in Washington.
Mr Dar, who was recently in New York to address the United Nations, said a committee had been formed to finalise the terms of the proposed deal.
“As long as we are better than or equal to our peers, we should be fine,” Mr Dar said.
While the exact tariff rate being negotiated for Pakistan has not been publicly disclosed, Pakistani officials have said they’re seeking terms on a par with other recent US trade agreements — particularly those with Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Vietnam, where tariffs are reportedly set between 15pc and 20pc.
Trump ‘punishes’ India
In addition to the 25pc tariffs, Trump also slapped an unspecified additional penalty on India for acquiring military equipment and oil from Russia, starting Aug 1.
However, he later said the US was currently negotiating a deal with India. “They have one of the highest tariffs in the world now, they’re willing to cut it very substantially. But we’ll see what happens,” Mr Trump told reporters.
 
 

In a strongly worded post on the social media platform Truth Social, Mr Trump accused India of imposing excessively high tariffs and maintaining some of the world’s most “strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers”. He also criticised New Delhi’s continued reliance on Russian arms and energy purchases.
“India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25pc, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August 1,” Mr Trump wrote. “While India is our friend, we have done relatively little business with them because of their trade practices.”
The US president made it clear that no further extensions would be given to countries that failed to reach a deal by the end-of-week deadline.
The imposition of a penalty tariff on India for its purchases of Russian oil, if enacted, would be the first use of what Mr Trump has taken to calling “secondary tariffs”, a kind of penalty that would be imposed instead of the financial sanctions typically used against countries that do business with embargoed nations, according to The New York Times.
In response, the Indian government said in a statement that it was studying the implications of Mr Trump’s announcements and remained dedicated to securing a fair trade deal with the US.
“India and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective,” it said, according to Reuters.
The news pushed the Indian rupee down 0.4pc to around 87.80 against the US dollar in the non-deliverable forwards market, from its close at 87.42 during market hours. Gift Nifty futures were trading at 24,692 points, down 0.6pc.
Sanctions on six Indian firms
Separately, the State Department announced sanctions against six Indian firms for “engaging in Iranian petroleum, petroleum products, or petrochemical trade”.
The sanctioned entities include:
Kanchan Polymers, which “imported and purchased over $1.3M worth of Iranian-origin petrochemical products”.
Alchemical Solutions, which imported and purchased Iranian-origin petrochemical products valued at over $84m.
Ramniklal, a petrochemical company that imported and purchased Iranian-origin products valued at over $22m.
Jupiter Dye Chem, which imported and purchased Iranian-origin petrochemical products valued at over $49m.
Global Industrial, which imported and purchased products, including methanol, valued at over $51m.
Persistent Petrochem Private Limited, which imported approximately $14m worth of shipments.
In addition, it also placed sanctions on a number of China and UAE-based companies and several oil tankers.

Continuous monsoon rains and accelerated glacier melting have significantly increased water inflows into major rivers, raising concerns of widespread flooding.
According to PDMA, the Chenab River at Marala is currently experiencing high level, with an inflow of 206,000 cusecs and an outflow of 179,000 cusecs.
Meanwhile, the Indus River has reported low-level flooding at key locations, including Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma, and Taunsa. At Tarbela, the inflow has surged to 286,000 cusecs, with an outflow of 270,000 cusecs. Similarly, Taunsa recorded an inflow of 310,000 cusecs, Kalabagh 300,000 cusecs, and Chashma 345,000 cusecs, indicating rising pressure on the river system.

Rains, glacier melt raise flood threat; urban flooding forecast in Lahore, Gujranwala, Pindi

The authorities warned that the Sutlej, Ravi, and Jhelum rivers, though currently at normal levels, could swell further due to the forecast rains.
The PDMA also highlighted that hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan remain stable for now, but the next 24 hours may see a dangerous surge in water levels.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia has directed district administrations to remain on high alert, particularly in vulnerable areas where flood contingency plans have already been activated. The PDMA control room and district emergency operation centres are operating round-the-clock to monitor developments.
Reservoir levels are also under close watch, with Mangla Dam at 57 per cent capacity and Tarbela Dam at 87pc. Additionally, Indian dams on the Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi rivers are reportedly at 43pc capacity, raising concerns about potential cross-border water releases.
The PDMA urged the public to exercise extreme caution, advising against bathing in rivers or canals and avoiding unnecessary travel during adverse weather conditions.
PDMA also issued a monsoon rain alert in different areas of Punjab for next 24 hours. It forecast heavy rains in Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Mandi Bahauddin, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Gujrat, and Sialkot.
The PDMA also issued an alert to the commissioners and deputy commissioners of these respective districts to take measures and deal with the situation.
The PDMA also forecast urban flooding alert for Lahore, Rawalpindi and Gujranwala. The alert was also issued about rising water levels in rivers Chenab, Ravi and Jhelum. The river flood could also generate high water in canals of these areas.
There is a low level flood situation in the Baein rainwater drain in Narowal. The Sutlej River is also experiencing an increase in water flow at Ganda Singh.
PDMA also released a monsoon rains fact sheet. The Met office recorded 83mm rain in Jhelum, 81mm in Rawalpindi, 49mm in Mandi Bahauddin, 48mm in Mangla, 42mm in Gujrat, 39mm each in Gujranwala and Sialkot, and 33mm in DG Khan.
The monsoon fifth spell will continue till July 31.
During the current year, 162 people lost their lives due to rain in Punjab and 563 others were injured. As many as 214 houses were damaged and 121 cattle also died.
Most of the people lost lives due to roof collapse and electrocution and the government also announced compensation for the families of the deceased persons.
The government also announced financial help for the farmers over their crops damage.

According to a report by Topline Securities, the country will need to arrange a net financing of $10bn, comprising $6bn in principal and $4bn in interest, after accounting for expected rollovers and refinancing.
In a briefing to analysts and researchers after announcing a status quo in the monetary policy on Wednesday, State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmed said foreign exchange reserves are projected to reach $15.5bn by December 2025 and $17.5bn by June 2026. Any proceeds from international bond issuances, such as Eurobonds or Sukuk, would be over and above this target.
The governor added that Pakistan is due to repay $1.8bn in FY26 on account of two maturing Eurobonds — one of $800 million and the other of $1bn.

Islamabad must arrange $10bn net external financing in FY26; SBP says total repayments reach $26bn

Encouragingly, the country’s external debt composition has improved, with multilateral lenders now accounting for 50pc of public external debt (combined State Bank and government holdings), up from 43pc in June 2022. Debt maturity profiles have also seen improvement.
To manage repayments, Pakistan is expected to once again seek rollovers from key partners including China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, as it did in FY25. Analysts remain optimistic about the government’s ability to secure these rollovers, citing a current account surplus and stronger foreign exchange reserves.
Housing scheme
Governor Ahmed also announced that a new Housing Scheme has been finalised in consultation with the SBP. Approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) and awaiting cabinet ratification, the scheme will soon be circulated to banks to stimulate lending and activity in the housing sector.
Topline’s report revealed that the SBP purchased $20bn from the interbank market over the last three years through direct intervention. While no official figure was released for FY25, banking sources estimate the SBP bought around $9bn in the last fiscal year to stabilise reserves.
The governor affirmed that remittance-linked incentives for financial institutions would continue, in line with directives from the Prime Minister. However, the government has decided to rationalise these incentives to banks going forward.
No stimulus for industry
The central bank’s decision to maintain a high policy rate has drawn criticism from the business community. Younus Dagha, Chairman of the Policy Research and Advisory Council (PRAC), said the decision fails to provide the stimulus needed for economic revival.
Despite a disinflationary trend, the real interest rate stands at 7.8pc —among the highest in the region. This is seen as a major constraint on private sector investment, industrial growth, and overall competitiveness. In contrast, regional peers maintain lower real rates: India (3.4pc), China (2.9pc), Bangladesh (1.5pc), Vietnam (0.9pc), and Indonesia (3.4pc).

• Citing arrest fears, Omar Ayub refuses to meet CJP in Islamabad; suggests rendezvous in KP instead
ISLAMABAD: Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz has requested Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi to order a scrutiny of the procedural conduct of all ongoing May 9 trials for adherence to constitutional mandates and principles of natural justice.
In a two-page letter addressed to the CJP, the opposition leader requested the CJP to consider limiting trial court sessions to reasonable hours to prevent fatigue-induced miscarriage of justice and safeguard the right of the accused to engage counsel of their choosing without imposition.
This is the second letter written in a row to the top adjudicator, after Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, Omar Ayub Khan, penned a four-page letter on allegations of police and prosecutorial misconduct in the already concluded May 9 trials.
Mr Faraz requested the CJP to facilitate unhindered media access and public transparency for these proceedings, and initiate an impartial inquiry into allegations of police and prosecutorial malpractices.
The letter asked CJP to reassess and where appropriate, reopen cases concluded under questionable circumstances and preservation of Pakistan’s democratic fabric and the rule of law hinges on your principled intervention.
Omar Ayub refuses to meet CJP
Meanwhile, on Wednesday, Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan refused to meet with the CJP on Supreme Court premises, or in Islamabad, citing the possibility of his arrest due to warrants, which have been issued against him.
According to sources close to Mr Ayub, an official of the Supreme Court contacted him and offered to arrange a meeting with CJP Yahya Afridi.
However, Mr Ayub told the Supreme Court official that since warrants for his arrest are out, he cannot visit Islamabad and the meeting cannot be held in the federal capital.
In response, the official offered a guarantee that no one will arrest him and suggested that he reach the Supreme Court for the meeting.
Mr Omar told him that PTI leaders and workers have been picked up by intelligence agencies personnel from outside the courts a number of times, and declined the offer.
Sources said Mr Omar had suggested that the meeting be held in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but the SC official has not responded to this offer so far.

• Malta also announces intention to recognise Palestine in September
WASHINGTON: France and 14 other Western nations called on countries worldwide to move to recognise a Palestinian state, France’s top diplomat said on Wednesday.
The foreign ministers of 15 countries late on Tuesday issued a joint statement following a conference in New York, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, aimed at reviving a two-state solution between Israelis and the Palestinians.
“In New York, together with 14 other countries, France is issuing a collective appeal: we express our desire to recognise the State of Palestine and invite those who have not yet done so to join us,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot wrote on X.
 






The three-day gathering, convened at United Nations headquarters under UN General Assembly’s Resolution 79/81, ended with the adoption of a resolution urging member states to take concrete steps — without further delay — to implement existing UN mandates on Palestine and support the two-state framework.
While not adopted as a formal resolution, the declaration — titled the ‘New York Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine’ — is being circulated for endorsement by all 193 UN member states ahead of the General Assembly’s 80th session in September, where a progress report on its implementation will be presented.
The United States and Israel boycotted the conference and strongly opposed the two-state solution.
The declaration calls for the establishment of an independent, sovereign Palestinian state alongside Israel, based on the 1967 borders and with East Jerusalem as its capital, accompanied by security guarantees for both parties.
“The war in Gaza must end now,” it states, condemning both the Oct 7, 2023, Hamas attacks on Israel and Israel’s military response, which has killed thousands of civilians and destroyed Gaza’s infrastructure.
The plan urges immediate implementation of a phased ceasefire agreement brokered by Egypt, Qatar and the United States, to halt hostilities, secure the release of hostages and ensure the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza.
 
 

It proposes reunifying Gaza and the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority (PA). Hamas would be required to relinquish power and surrender its weapons. A transitional administrative committee, backed by international partners, would be formed under PA authority, supported by a UN-led stabilisation mission to protect civilians and manage the security and governance transitions.
The declaration received broad backing from participants who chaired the conference’s working groups, including Pakistan, Brazil, Egypt, Japan, Ireland and the EU.
Commitments
Several countries made firm commitments during the conference. President Emmanuel Macron announced that France would formally recognise the State of Palestine in September, becoming the first major Western power to do so.
Malta also confirmed it would recognise Palestine at the same session, with Prime Minister Robert Abela describing the decision as a “concrete step” in support of Palestinian self-determination.
Brunei reiterated support for Palestine’s full UN membership, calling recognition “reflective of international consensus on justice and sovereignty”.
Russia reaffirmed its position, with Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin noting that Palestine has had an embassy in Moscow since 1990.
Meanwhile, the UN’s humanitarian agency said on Wednesday that the conditions for delivering aid into Gaza were “far from sufficient” to meet the immense needs of its “desperate, hungry people”.

• Police say couple moved to Karachi eight months ago
• Investigators suspect woman’s relatives behind brutal killings
• CM, home minister order inquiry and arrest of culprits
KARACHI: A man and his wife, who had married of their own free will in their native town of Lasbela over five years ago, and their minor son were murdered on the outskirts of the metropolis on Wednesday, police said.
They identified the victims as Abdul Majeed, 30, Sakina, 25, and their four-year-old son, Abdul Nabi, and said they were axed to death in their home in the Ghaghar Phatak area within the remit of the Steel Town police station.
Area SHO Aslam Billu told Dawn that an alleged killer phoned Majeed’s brother, Imam Bux, telling him that they had killed the family and that he should go there and bury them.
He said that Imam Bux and Majeed’s other brother, Qurban, had been living with the victims in Karachi but had recently returned to their home in Lasbela for agricultural purposes.
Qurban phoned his friend, Munawar Abro, to visit his brother’s home and ascertain the facts. When Abro reached there, he found the three family members brutally murdered inside their home. He informed the brothers and the police, who arrived at the scene and shifted the bodies to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.
Investigators collected two axes used in the murders and other evidence from the crime scene. SHO Billu said they suspected that the couple and their son might have been given sedatives before the killing, as neighbours told police that they had not heard any cries or sounds.
He said that during the initial probe, it transpired that the couple had married of their own free will in Lasbela a couple of years ago and Sakina’s parents were reportedly against the marriage.
The couple, along with their son, had moved to the city around eight months ago, he said.
The SHO added that there were also reports that Sakina’s family had reached an “understanding” and they had also visited them in the city around a month ago.
He said that Sakina’s brother had also been seen shopping with the couple in the Ghaghar Phatak area on Tuesday.
However, it appeared that the relatives had not truly resolved their differences with the couple as preliminary investigations revealed the triple murder was allegedly carried out by Sakina’s relatives, the SHO said.
The police were awaiting for legal heirs to lodge an FIR and initiate formal legal proceedings.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and ordered an immediate inquiry and the arrest of the killers, said a spokesperson.
Separately, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar also ordered an inquiry to ascertain every possible aspect of the gruesome murder and the immediate arrest of the killers.
The home minister also directed that peace in the area be ensured, the spokesperson added.

These grievances surfaced during a public hearing held by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), on the Central Power Purchasing Agency’s (CPPA) request for a Rs8.7bn refund — equal to 65 paise per unit — to consumers due to lower-than-expected fuel costs in June. Nepra members Amina Ahmed and Anwar Maqsood Khan presided over the session.
Several industrialists, referencing a recent meeting with Field Marshal Asim Munir, lamented that the prime minister’s announcement in March of Rs7.41 per unit tariff relief was not time-bound, yet its impact had dwindled. The actual reduction now stands at just Rs1.15 per unit in base tariff terms. As a result, applicable power rates have surged from around Rs30 per unit to Rs34-35 from July onwards.
Amir Shaikh, a Lahore-based businessman, said a promised Rs1.71 per unit reduction — based on an additional Rs10 per litre petroleum levy — should have remained intact since the levy is still being collected. “Even the gas levy on captive power plants was meant to lower power tariffs, but this hasn’t been implemented,” he said.

Leaders warn of industrial shutdowns as power tariffs rise to Rs35 per unit despite earlier relief promises

He told the hearing that during discussions with the field marshal, the business community had pointed out that power rates fell to Rs29-30 per unit following the prime minister’s announcement, but have since climbed to Rs35. This contradicts the Special Investment Facilitation Council’s (SIFC) commitment to reduce industrial power tariffs to 9 cents (around Rs25 per unit) in the current fiscal year.
“Instead of a reduction from Rs29 to Rs25, rates have risen back to Rs34-35, or 11-12 cents per unit,” said Mr Shaikh. He urged the government to acknowledge this reversal and adopt corrective measures.
He also highlighted that the inclusion of fertiliser subsidies in RLNG pricing was making electricity generation more expensive. “The industrial sector is already on the brink, and these hikes could push it into over-closure,” he warned. He further questioned whether the Power Division’s promise to abolish the 1.5pc electricity duty from July 1 had been officially implemented, though no government representative responded.
A representative from the FPCCI and a Karachi-based industrialist said that falling demand from the national grid — driven by the rapid adoption of solar energy — had improved the financial outlook of distribution companies. As solar generation replaces expensive fossil fuel-based power, it also helps cut transmission losses, especially in high-loss areas.
“The real efficiency gains in Discos are coming from solarisation,” he said, noting that this transition is reducing both fuel costs and technical losses.
Karachi-based businessman Arif Bilwani criticised the government’s failure to follow through on its promises regarding renegotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs). “There was a lot of hype about cheaper electricity from revised IPP contracts, but none of it has materialised,” he said, adding that it appears as though the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum and the 747MW Guddu power plants have been effectively written off.
Responding to the concerns, CPPA CEO Rehan Akhtar said the energy mix in June was broadly in line with expectations and that overall fuel costs were slightly lower than reference projections. He said this minor saving resulted in negative fuel cost adjustments, partly due to the retirement of older, inefficient government-owned plants.
Regarding Neelum-Jhelum, Mr Akhtar confirmed that the plant would remain non-operational for about two years due to technical issues identified in a recent study.
He said the negative fuel cost adjustment reaching consumers would amount to 15 paisa per unit, factoring in the 65 paisa negative adjustment in August, replacing June’s 50 paisa adjustment.
Mr Akhtar added that power consumption in June was 2pc higher than the same month last year and 7.6pc more than in May 2025. Total electricity delivered to distribution companies stood at 13,310 gigawatt hours (GWh), up from 12,367 GWh in May and 13,071 GWh in June 2024.
He said average fuel cost for June 2025 was Rs7.68 per unit, down from Rs9.25 in June last year, against a reference cost of Rs8.33 per unit.

Pakistan is at the epicentre of a climate transformation that is fundamentally altering the nature of monsoon rains and flood patterns across the country. No longer do the monsoons follow predictable patterns, locations, calendar and intensity.
How are the climatic changes redefining Pakistan’s flood landscape? To begin with, research reveals that while the intensity of rainfall has increased exponentially, the number of rainy days during the monsoons has decreased. The changing climate is leading to the geographic redistribution of rain. Monsoons have primarily affected the northern mountainous regions. But recent years show a shift, with greater concentration of intense, heavy rainfall events now occurring in the southern provinces.
This trend marks a departure from the norm where the northern areas received the bulk of the monsoon rains. The southward shift alters the level of flood risks and challenges the existing infrastructure, signalling a transformation in how we experience the weather. It threatens the relevance of some of our flood management institutions, policies and approaches.
Researchers have observed that since 2010, temperatures in Pakistan’s monsoon belt have increased at the rate of 0.18 degrees Celsius annually. This warming has profound implications, as warmer air can hold significantly more moisture: for every 1°C of temperature increase, the atmosphere’s water-holding capacity grows by seven per cent. During the April 2025 heatwave, with temperatures up to 8°C above normal in some places, it translates to a dramatically increased atmospheric moisture capacity, setting the stage for devastating downpours. The intensifying sequence of stronger heatwaves followed by heavy rainfalls has become almost predictable and urgently requires an integrated policy approach.

Climatic changes are redefining the country’s flood landscape.

Let’s review five major trends in recent years:
Non-riverine flooding: The country faces increasing vulnerability to non-riverine flooding. These floods, caused by intense localised rainfall, strike with little warning and overwhelm encroached waterbodies and drainage systems. Recent examples highlight this threat. In 2020, Karachi experienced its worst floodingenter link description here in almost a century when 223.5 millimetres of rain fell in a single day. The 2025 monsoon brought similar devastation as Punjab’s Chakwal district received 400mm in just 10 hours. Urban centres like Lahore and Rawalpindi have seen entire streets turn into rivers.
Addressing non-riverine floods needs a multifaceted approach: enhancing early warning systems, upgrading urban drainage infrastructure and bolstering community disaster readiness. Crucially, the National Flood Protection Plan IV (2015-2025) requires comprehensive revisions to fully integrate cutting-edge climate science, including advanced modelling for the increasing intensity and frequency of precipitation events, to effectively manage these emerging non-riverine flood sources.
Cloudbursts: Sudden, intense rainfall over small areas has become frequent. These extreme events, where rain greater than or equal to 100mm falls hourly, can devastate communities within minutes. Azad Kashmir, KP and Gilgit-Baltistan have seen a rise in flash floods and landslides, triggered by heatwaves in the upper Indus Basin, as seen in the Babusar cloudburst this month. However, some officials, rather than addressing the problem of inadequate infrastructure or limited response capacity, erroneously label all heavy rainfall as cloudbursts, as seen in the case of Chakwal and Islamabad’s Saidpur village. This mischaracterisation undermines credibility and may impede efforts to introduce risk insurance and risk transfer mechanisms.
Koh-i-Sulaiman: This mountain range, separating parts of Balochistan from KP, Punjab and Sindh, has emerged as a deadly source of flash floods. Intense rainfall generates powerful torrents that race into populated valleys, affecting south Punjab’s D.G. Khan and Rajanpur districts. This has led to submerged villages, burst dams and mass displacement, affecting some 700,000 people and inundating over 300,000 acres in D.G. Khan and Rajanpur respectively in 2022. The 2024 torrents recorded flows exceeding 70,000 cusecs. Ironically, these districts offer ideal options to harness floodwaters for nature-based solutions.
Salt Range and barani areas: These areas have seen a notable increase in extreme weather events, including severe floods from intense monsoon rains, frequent heatwaves, hailstorms and occasional higher-elevation snowfall. Together, they underscore growing climate volatility, resulting in greater risks of flash floods, crop losses and community disruptions. While the authorities have responded with emergency measures, local flooding is made worse by the loss of topsoil and the bursting of unregulated private check dams, which damages the ecology.
Urban flooding: Pakistan’s haphazardly growing urban sprawl has become particularly vulnerable to new rainfall patterns. Urban flooding has transformed from occasional inconvenience to regular catastrophe. Cities like Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi and Islamabad face severe flooding as drainage systems prove inadequate. The urban heat island effect intensifies rainfall, while rapid urbanisation reduces natural drainage and overwhelms aging infrastructure, often disrupting economic activity.
In all, the changing rainfall patterns alter how water interacts with the landscape. Heat-induced soil hardening reduces infiltration capacity by 40-60pc, meaning intense rains run off the surface rather than being absorbed. This creates a situation where extreme heat events set the stage for more devastating floods. Heavy rainfall also saturates soil, preventing absorption during subsequent storms and compounding flooding during back-to-back rainfall events.
Preparing for the new normal: Pakistan faces a double jeopardy from floods, amplified by heatwaves. Pre-monsoon heatwaves now trigger calamitous non-riverine floods as a first wave, swiftly followed by traditional monsoon riverine floods swollen by upstream heatwaves in India. This paradigm shift creates stark vulnerabilities across all provinces and regions, where some districts face only non-riverine floods while others endure both.
Historically focused on riverine floods, planning must become climate-smart. Non-riverine floods necessitate new strategies: enabling district disaster management authorities to respond promptly, deploying provincial rapid response battalions for cloudburst-triggered flash floods and implementing local, nature-based solutions in places like Koh-i-Sulaiman, the Salt Range and barani areas. The provinces must invest heavily in urban surface run-off and drainage systems. This demands integrating updated climate projections and prioritising multiple flood risks alongside enhancing conventional river flood defences.

Almost by its definition, such a set-up rests ultimately on a series of compromises made by its constituent parties to reconcile themselves to a simple fact: the country is being run by the bureaucrats with the establishment playing a significant role in ruling it. The political parties have been reduced to little more than a pantomime, to run the ceremonies of power.
With all their defects and problems, the parties are still the only carrier of the people’s aspirations, and today they are in more disarray than they have ever been in the past quarter century. Under these circumstances, the state will only tighten its grip on everything it can get its hands on — the citizenry and the economy — and is not likely to find the will or the inclination to make any changes.
Consider their predicament one by one. Start with the ruling party, the PML-N. This party has the single longest running streak of returning to power after every sort of defeat that Pakistani politics can possibly serve up. Their first government was dismissed by a president, and they dragged him down with them. Their second was overthrown by a general in a coup, who then swore on national TV that he would never allow it to return to power. But the general, later convicted, died in exile while the Noon league ruled in Pakistan. They were torn down by a Supreme Court judgement, their leaders thrown in jail and hounded into exile by the first ‘hybrid’ regime of 2018, only to return to power barely four years later.
This is a formidable legacy, and along the way the party transformed the nature of Pakistan’s economy, even if via a set of reforms that ultimately proved abortive. So what is the problem this time round? The problem is the Noon league itself. They built this legacy with a formula that is resource-intensive. It took economic growth and massive redistributive schemes through which they built their relationship with the trade and business elites of the country as well as the rank and file Punjab voter. But to operate these schemes it took massive infusions of foreign exchange borrowed from every source they could get their hands on — the foreign currency deposit scheme, private markets, bilateral deposits, CPEC lending — that left the country sagging under the weight of an unbearable debt burden. That option is no longer open to them, and they are trying what they can to operate the same model in Punjab, with whatever fiscal envelope they have, thanks to the NFC award, but it can only run so long as their main rival for power, Imran Khan, remains in jail.

Today, the political parties are in greater disarray than they have been in the past quarter century.

Then there’s the PPP, the one party that has taken the heaviest beating by the establishment yet remains a contender to this day. Each time Pakistan made the transition from military rule to civilian democracy, it was under the PPP. This is the party that steered Pakistan out of the crisis that Ayub’s dictatorship brought. It also led the country out of Zia’s wars. But its biggest test was navigating the transition after Musharraf, and the assassination of Benazir. This was the moment that demanded they hold that hottest of all political potatoes in Pakistan’s political history — the ‘war on terror’, which it was their duty to own and tell the country ‘this is our war’. At the same time, they had to deal with the fallout of the Great Financial Crisis that eviscerated the country’s economy, bringing its entire financial system closer to ruin than it had ever come before. And then there was the fallout of the Mumbai incident in 2008, which reverberated till 2020 when Hafiz Saeed was finally convicted in Pakistan. No minor menu of challenges this.
But the party did all this on the back of a strategy that was eventually to prove its own undoing: reconciliation. Benazir was criticised for choosing a negotiated path back to power, but the wisdom of doing so was eventually revealed when the assemblies she fought to bring into being after the elections of 2008 dismissed Musharraf with nothing more than a simple resolution passed by each provincial legislature. But by 2024, the party that once fought for, and whose leaders were willing to die for, democracy, was bargaining for a slice of power in a hybrid set-up. Today it has become a party that will not stand for anything.
Ironically the PTI is the most vigorous carrier of the people’s will at this time, evidenced by the strenuous efforts required to keep it at bay. This is ironic because it is also the party that volunteered to be the wrecking ball that brought down democracy in Pakistan in 2018. Now it struggles to survive in a hybrid wasteland inaugurated by that election, and the only thing keeping it alive is the will of the people. Its own leadership is quarrelling among themselves, its voter does not know who to trust, and its leader languishes in the same jail where he sought to throw his own opponents when he was himself in power.
None of the PTI’s supporters can give you a coherent answer as to why they like Khan so much, but so many of them do say that keeping them away from power took all the strength the state could muster in the form of the 26th Amendment. For reasons nobody understands, them included, the PTI is now riding the tiger of popular aspirations, and learning that the job is not as much fun perhaps as it seems from the outside.
The parties are in disarray now because there is no viable political strategy in the arena for a resurrection of civilian democracy. In the 1970s, there was the Constitution. In 1988, there was the simple demand to hold elections. In 2008, there was the Charter of Democracy. Today, there is nothing. And while that is the case, the hybrid wasteland stretches out to the horizon.

Traders, affiliated with Pakistan-China trade through Khunjerab Pass, have been protesting at the Sost Dry Port and blocking the Karakoram Highway, the land route between Pakistan and China, demanding an end to what they call federal taxes on goods imported from China.
The protests, which have paralysed trade and travel through the Khunjerab Pass, began over what traders describe as discriminatory FBR policies and the non-clearance of consignments imported from China.
Protesters are demanding exemption for GB residents from paying sales tax, income tax, and other federal taxes on goods imported from China.

Pakistan-China trade and travel suspended; thousands of travellers stranded, including Chinese nationals

In response, a notification issued by the FBR announced the committee’s formation to addr­ess the “tax grievances of people of Gilgit Baltistan”.
According to the notification, the committee will “evaluate the grievances of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on the issue of charging of sales tax, income tax and federal excise duty on import of goods from China through Khunjerab Pass for consumption in Gilgit-Baltistan.”
The seven-member committee comprises the member customs (operations), member-IR (policy), director general (R&A), the GB secretary of finance, the chief collector (north) and the chief IR (policy).
The committee’s mandate is to examine the levy of taxes on goods meant for consumption within GB’s territorial jurisdiction.
It is also tasked with devising a “transparent implementation mechanism” for any available exemptions and suggesting “robust checks against misuse of any exemption”.
Additionally, the committee will identify the HS codes and quantify the annual quantities needed for local consumption within GB, keeping in view per capita import of such goods for the rest of the country.
It will also consider mechanisms for clearance of baggage at Sost and enforcement measures at Khunjerab Pass to ensure consumption of exempted goods in GB only.
The committee will consult with local stakeholders to weigh different options, including the collection of duties and taxes on behalf of the GB government, and is expected to submit its report within seven days.
Due to protests, thousands of passengers scheduled to travel to China through Khunjerab Pass remain stranded as transportation via the pass has been suspended for a third day.
Many Chinese nationals who planned to travel to Xinjiang province through Khunjerab Pass have also staged a protest sit-in in Sost town, demanding to be allowed to travel.

That the industry, notorious for wielding its enormous political clout to profiteer, manipulate policy and steal taxes, has pulled this off again is not just scandalous, it also exposes the deeper malaise of governance failure.
The state has yet again failed to regulate the markets and shield the consumers. The AGP’s testimony before the Public Accounts Committee of the National Assembly underlines how the state often acts to protect the interests of the powerful business lobbies — especially when these interests align with those of the ruling political elite.
What makes the already murky business of sugar even murkier is the opacity around the actual ownership of the mills. It is widely known that a major share of the sugar industry is controlled by those who occupy top public offices and sit in parliament or are closely related to them. In certain cases, these interests are fronted by proxies to obscure the actual beneficiaries.
The government’s inability, perhaps unwillingness, to give the committee anything beyond the names of the mills’ directors reinforces suspicions that the decision to permit sugar exports was made to benefit entrenched political interests. Indeed, PAC chairman Junaid Akbar Khan stated that, more than just poor planning, the practice of first exporting surplus sugar and then importing it at a higher price reeks of deliberate policy manipulation to benefit a group of 42 families. The PAC’s demand for full disclosure of ownership of the sugar mills, therefore, is justified. People have every right to know who, especially among the politically exposed, profits at their expense when public policy is formulated to serve private business interests.
While the PAC is to be commended for demanding transparency, this is not the first time the sugar industry has come under scrutiny for its political clout and policy manipulation. The sugar crisis marked by drastic retail price increases and domestic shortages due to exports in 2020 under the Imran Khan administration had led an inquiry commission that came to similar conclusions. The probe had found evidence of manipulation and profiteering within the sugar industry, and the crisis was attributed to policies that subsidised sugar exports. The commission had made recommendations for regulating the sugar trade, but these have remained unimplemented.
Likewise, the Competition Commission has been unable to recover fines it imposed on the industry for cartelisation and price fixing. Can the PAC break the sugar cartel or curb millers’ influence in policymaking? Given the entrenchment of the owners in politics, there is little room for optimism.

Mr Agha said the party had been facing this situation since 2012.
While addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Mr Agha said if the state and government cannot tolerate BNP’s peaceful political struggle, they should officially ban the party instead of “harassing our leaders and their families with false and baseless charges”.
He accused state institutions of using intimidation tactics to weaken the party and said strategies “would not succeed”.
He also criticised the arrest of Baloch Yakjehti Committee leader Dr Mahrang Baloch and her colleagues.
Mr Agha cited the government’s decision to prevent BNP chief Sardar Akhtar  Mengal from traveling abroad for medical treatment as part of a  “targeted campaign” against the party.
He asserted the BNP has always advocated, through democratic means, for the rights and resources of Balochistan.
 
 

Mr  Agha accused the federal government of “worsening the situation” in  Balochistan through “electoral manipulation” instead of resolving the province’s issues.
He held the current government responsible for the “targeted killing of BNP workers” and the arrest of women activists.
“A  government that cannot protect the dignity of its own mothers and sisters and is afraid of a political party’s banner has no right to rule,” he said, adding the BNP would continue its fight for justice and rights.

The committee meeting held on Wednesday was chaired by Senator Attaur Rehman, and featured heated discussions on mismanagement faced during Haj 2024, and the issue faced by Shia pilgrims.
The committee discussed the ban imposed on pilgrims intending to travel by land route to Karbala (Iraq) via Iran to take part in Arbaeen rituals.
MWM Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, who is also a member of the committee, emphasised that the protection of pilgrims’ religious rights is the fundamental responsibility of the government, and that matters of worship fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and not the Ministry of Interior.

Religious Affairs secy says govt exploring options of ‘alternative route’ by sea; panel demands removal of Saudi Arabia-based DG Haj over ‘mismanagement’

He said the interior ministers of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan recently reached an understanding to facilitate pilgrims willing to travel by land and by air to holy places in Iraq and Iran.
Senator Abbas warned that maintaining restrictions on pilgrims’ travel to Iraq by land route would result in the loss of people’s money of at least Rs50 billion.
 
 

The secretary of the Religious Affairs ministry informed the committee that talks were continuing on alternative routes, including via sea, but expressed security concerns over the Afghanistan route. He, however, assured the committee that all possible facilities would be provided to pilgrims.
Senator Abbas opposed the alternative route idea of the secretary of religious affairs, adding that at this stage, if a new alternative route is adopted, it would place an additional burden of Rs48 billion on the pilgrims intending to visit Iraq.
He said the government had not taken the committee into confidence regarding the tour operators’ policy.
In response, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf assured the Senate committee that consultations would be held and that all concerns would be addressed.
Haj mismanagement
The report of sub-committee related to mismanagement during Haj 2024 was presented by the convener of the sub-committee, Senator Aun Abbas.
The report of the sub-committee exposed severe lapses in coordination between the ministry of religious affairs and the Haj Organisers Association of Pakistan (HOAP).
Senator Aun Abbas also expressed concern over the DG Haj’s three-year tenure, alleging that he wielded exceptional authority in the affairs of the pilgrimage.
Senator Bushra Anjum Butt, member of the sub-committee, raised the issue of overseas Pakistanis who were misled by private Haj operators until the departure of the final Haj flight. She condemned this act and said this is damaging the image of Pakistanis abroad.
The third member of the sub-committee, Senator Danesh Kumar, criticised the Religious Affairs ministry for the lapse of quota of 64,000 Haj pilgrims and recommended to fix the responsibility over the culprits.
He termed such acts criminal and demanded strict disciplinary action against people involved in such a heinous activity.
The report also highlighted that the current procurement committee followed a controversial approach in awarding the ‘Mashaer Services’ tender to Al-Rajhi Tawafa Company, instead of adopting a transparent and competitive bidding process and it entered into direct negotiations with Tawafa companies.
The Senate panel recommended the government to immediately remove the DG Haj, based in Saudi Arabia and appoint an Arabic-speaking officer familiar with Saudi systems.
The committee further demanded audit of Al-Rajhi contract by the Auditor General of Pakistan and dissolution of the current procurement committee.

• Ex-mill sugar rate fixed at Rs165/kg, retail price at Rs173/kg
ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Wednesday took several key decisions, including the approval of Haj Policy for 2026, National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy and the Green Building Code of Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif fixed ex-mill rate and retail price of sugar at Rs165 and Rs173 per kilogram, respectively, amid the nationwide shortage of the commodity.
Presided over by PM Shehbaz, the cabinet approved the Haj Policy for the next year, allocating a 70 per cent quota to the government and 30pc to private operators. Notably, private companies that failed to fulfill their responsibilities in the previous year will now be required to accommodate affected individuals in 2026.
The meeting approved third-party validation for all Haj operations, real-time monitoring of payments and application processes under private operators, mandatory minimum of 2,000 pilgrims per private company, 1,000 seats reserved for hardship cases, enha­nced digital tools including Pak Haj mobile app, digital wristbands, and mobile SIMs for better tracking and service delivery, transparent selection of assistants through competitive testing, emer­g­e­ncy compensation mechanisms and upgraded lodging and food arrangements.
National AI Policy
In another major decision, the cabinet unanimously approved the National AI Policy 2025 to create a complete AI ecosystem in Pakistan.
The policy aims to democratise access to artificial intelligence, enhance public services, and open up new employment and innovation avenues.
“Our youth are Pakistan’s greatest asset. Providing them with education, skills, and equal opportunities in AI is a top priority,” said the prime minister.
The AI policy outlines to train 1 million AI professionals by 2030, establish an AI Innovation Fund and AI Venture Fund to boost private sector involvement, create 50,000 AI-driven civic projects and 1,000 local AI products in the next five years, distribute 3,000 annual AI scholarships.
 
 

Additi­onally, it aims to facilitate 1,000 research projects, promote inclusion of women and differently-abled individuals through accessible education and financing, strengthen cybersecurity and national data security protocols, promote global partnerships and compliance with international AI regulations.
However, an AI Council and a comprehensive Master Plan and Action Matrix will oversee the policy’s implementation.
The cabinet also ratified decisions made in earlier sessions of the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and the Committee on Legislative Business, held on July 8, 17, and 25, respectively.
Building codes
The federal cabinet also approved the Green Building Code of Pakistan (GBCP) and the Rainwater Harvesting Provisions for Building Code of Pakistan.
These new national standards will ensure green, energy-efficient and water-conserving buildings.
The GBCP applies to all new buildings, with four plus floors, emphasising energy conservation, solar design, green roofs, energy efficient lighting, and integration of renewable energy sources etc.
 
 

It mandates the use of eco-friendly materials and Building Information Modeling (BIM) for efficient building management, significantly reducing energy consumption and enhancing indoor environmental quality.
The Rainwater Harvesting Code applies to residential, commercial and industrial buildings, mandating systems to collect, filter, and reuse rainwater.
This initiative aims to address Pakistan’s escalating water scarcity by promoting groundwater recharge and reducing dependency on municipal water supplies.
The codes, now approved as Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) Bye-Laws, align with the United Nations Sustainable Devel­op­m­ent Goals (SDGs).
They represent a pivotal move toward sustainable, climate-resilient infrastructure and will be greatly beneficial for a greener, energy efficient and more climate-resilient Pakistan, improving better quality of life for Pakistani citizens as well as the planet.
Sugar price
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif warned that any violation of the agreed sugar prices will lead to severe action as no one would be allowed to exploit the public economically.
The premier, chairing a meeting, underscored the government’s commitment to ensuring fair prices and protecting citizens from economic exploitation.
The PM issued strict directives for the enforcement of the agreement reached between the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and the government.
 
 

According to the agreement, the ex-mill price of sugar is set at Rs165 per kilogram, while the retail price must not exceed Rs173 per kilogram.
The officials also briefed the PM on ongoing operations against those involved in creating an artificial shortage of sugar.
The government reiterated its resolve to continue crackdown on hoarders and manipulators in the market.

According to the GBDMA, flash floods occurred in eight various places in Faizabad and Dadaabad villages.
The authority reported the flash flood completely destroyed 22 homes and 18 shops, while 42 homes were partially damaged and floodwaters entered another 65.
Thousands of kanals of agr­i­cultural land, orcha­rds, and forests suffered da­m­a­ge, alongside two timber factories, a pair of gar­ages, a Jamaat Khana, and the DJ High School building.
Additionally, a two-kilometer stretch of the main road and a three-kilometer water channel serving a powerhouse were affected, as well as numerous livestock, cattle sheds, and 18 irrigation channels.
 
 

The floodwaters also struck eight motorcycles and six cars.  The flood also damaged the water channel for the main power station and disrupted telephone and mobile networks in the area.
Many affected families have been shifted to safer areas while officials have begun assessing the damages.
A complete assessment of the disaster will be possible in the coming days, officials said.
“The communication is cut off; therefore, it is difficult to know the damages,” Yaqoob Tai, a local resident of Ghizer, told Dawn.
Experts said GB has experienced unprecedented disasters this year, noting that the frequency of cloudburst-triggered floods, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and rapid glacier melting has increased.
At least 10 people have died and 12 tourists have gone missing in various recent events across the region.
The Babusar valley and Thore in Diamer have been the worst-hit areas.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Depart­m­e­­nt issued an alert warning of more potential flooding.
The department said a wet spell is likely to affect GB in the current week, with scattered rain, thunderstorms and isolated heavy falls expected.
It warned that the weather increases the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in the region’s vulnerable glaciated areas.
The PMD suggested all concerned authorities “remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation”.

On Tuesday, the Bajaur administration imposed a three-day curfew in several places in the district as an operation against militants was launched in the areas, prompting a fiery response from the CM.
CM Gandapur, who has been opposed to the idea of fresh military operations in the province, said in a heavily-edited video message iss­u­ed after the KP apex committee meeting that the for­ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as “guests” and with respect.
 






He pointed out that militants tend to take shelter in residential areas, from where they targeted the security forces, while retaliation by the forces to root them out results in collateral damage.
“They are doing this to create distrust between the people and the armed forces. This is why we need to expel them from our cities. We will not tolerate their presence in populated areas.”
He said the militants would not be allowed to hide inside residential areas and action would be taken against them and their facilitators. He emphasised that public support was essential in the fight against terrorism and praised the police and the security forces for their role in eradicating terrorism.
Jirgas from Aug 2
CM Gandapur also said that jirgas at the divisional level would start on August 2, with all stakeholders coming together to alleviate people’s reservations and concerns.
“Following these jirgas, there will be a grand jirga, where we will present our policy, a plan and future steps and discuss it with stakeholders and government officials,” he said, while expressing his opposition to any major offensive that could lead to mass displacement. He, however, reiterated that action would be taken in case militants were present in any area. He said their strategy would also ensure that no collateral damage would occur.
 
 

“In order to avoid any damages while eliminating militancy, we will go with the action plan which will not cause any loss to life and property,” he said.
The CM blamed the ‘enemy countries’ for conspiring against Pakistan as well as orchestrating deliberate campaigns to sow distrust between the government, the public, and the security forces, saying the “conspiracy must be exposed and countered”.
‘Concerted efforts’
Separately, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Secretariat read that the meeting agreed that public trust must be secured to effectively counter militancy. The participants underscored the need for enhanced coordination among civil administration, police, security forces, and intelligence agencies to carry out decisive operations.
It read that during the meeting, the participants unanimously acknowledged that militancy had become a threat that could only be eliminated through concerted efforts by the government, the public, and state institutions. They noted that militants were a common enemy and all stakeholders desired their elimination, the statement read.
The meeting, chaired by CM Gandapur, was also attended by Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed, Additional Chief Secretary Abid Majeed, Peshawar’s Corps Commander Lieutenant General Syed Omer Ahmad Bukhari, lawmakers from the merged districts, and senior government officials.
‘U-turn’ on operation
The video statement on Wednesday came in complete contrast to the one issued by CM Gandapur on Tuesday night following a PTI parliamentary meeting, in which he vowed to take stringent measures, such as the withdrawal of the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations 2011.
He had said the KP Assembly would discuss if the armed forces’ presence in the province under the said ordinance had borne fruitful results or harmed trust between people and the armed forces.
“The KP government, workers of founder PTI Imran Khan, stand by the people and we will go to any extent. I direct all the deputy commissioners not to impose curfew unless permitted by the KP home department,” CM Gandapur had said in his fiery video message. He said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district, adding that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces.
 
 

Though the CM took a U-turn, his party, the ruling PTI, denounced the Bajaur operation, alleging that the decision bypassed the constitutionally elected government and it was nothing but a “dangerous replay of past mistakes”.
PTI opposes operation
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a statement on Wednesday, lambasted the government for “squandering” the hard-won peace.
He urged the government to recognise the growing anger and resentment among the people of KP. “This repetition of failed strategies while expecting different outcomes is the height of strategic insanity,” he said, adding, “Such reckless actions will only deepen the alienation of an already traumatised and marginalised population, with catastrophic consequences for both this government and the nation’s stability.”

Dubbed NISAR (Nasa-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar), the pickup truck-sized spacecraft blasted off around 5:40pm (5:10pm PKT) from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on India’s southeastern coast, riding an ISRO Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket.
A livestream of the event showed excited schoolchildren brought to watch the launch and mission teams erupting in cheers and hugging.
Highly anticipated by scientists, the mission has also been hailed by US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a milestone in growing cooperation between the two countries.
“Congratulations India!” Dr Jitendra Singh, India’s science and technology minister, wrote on X, calling the mission a “game changer”.
 






“Our planet’s surface undergoes constant and meaningful change,” Karen St Germain, director of Nasa’s Earth Science Division, told reporters ahead of launch. “Some change happens slowly. Some happens abruptly. Some changes are large, while some are subtle.”
By picking up on tiny shifts in the vertical movement of the Earth’s surface — as little as one centimetre — scientists will be able to detect the precursors for natural and human-caused disasters, from earthquakes, landslides and volcanoes to ageing infrastructure like dams and bridges.
“We’ll see land substance and swelling, movement, deformation and melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets covering both Greenland and Antarctica, and of course, we’ll see wildfires,” added St Germain, calling NISAR “the most sophisticated radar we’ve ever built”.
India in particular is interested in studying its coastal and nearby ocean areas by tracking yearly changes in the shape of the sea floor near river deltas and how shorelines are growing or shrinking.
Data will also be used to help guide agricultural policy by mapping crop growth, tracking plant health, and monitoring soil moisture.
In the coming weeks, the spacecraft will begin an approximately 90-day commissioning phase during which it will unfurl its 12-metre radar antenna reflector.
Once operational, NISAR will record nearly all of Earth’s land and ice twice every 12 days from an altitude of 747 kilometres, circling the planet near the poles rather than around the equator.
Microwave frequencies
As it orbits, the satellite will continuously transmit microwaves and receive echoes from the surface.
Because the spacecraft is moving, the returning signals are distorted, but computer processing will reassemble them to produce detailed, high-resolution images.
Achieving similar results with traditional radar would require an impractically large 12-mile-wide dish.
NISAR will operate on two radar frequencies: L-band and S-band. The L-band is ideal for sensing taller vegetation like trees, while the S-band enables more accurate readings of shorter plants such as bushes and shrubs.
Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and India’s ISRO shared the workload, each building components on opposite sides of the planet before integrating and testing the spacecraft at ISRO’s Satellite Integration and Testing Establishment in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru.
Nasa’s contribution came to just under $1.2 billion, while ISRO’s costs were around $90 million.
India’s space programme has made major strides in recent years, including placing a probe in Mars orbit in 2014 and landing a robot and rover on the Moon in 2023.
Shubhanshu Shukla, a test pilot with the Indian Air Force, recently became the second Indian to travel to space and the first to reach the International Space Station — a key step toward India’s own indigenous crewed mission planned for 2027 under the Gaganyaan (“sky craft”) programme.</p><small>2025-07-30 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/302234125d13041.jpg?r=230029' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927636/pakistan-veterans-team-into-wcl-final-after-indian-players-forfeit-semi-final' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan veterans team into WCL final after Indian players forfeit semi-final</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistani veterans team advanced into the World Championship of Legends (WCL) final on Wednesday after Indian players forfeited the semi-final scheduled for Thursday.
The WCL is an international cricket league where retired, non-contracted international players return to competitive T20 cricket, according to the league’s website. The tournament commenced on July 18 and is being held in Birmingham, England.
Earlier in the month, a group match between the two teams was also cancelled after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan.
In a statement posted on X today, WCL organisers announced: “Taking all factors into consideration, the match between the India Champions and the Pakistan Champions has been called off. As a result, Pakistan Champions will advance to the final.”
 






The WCL said it respected the India Champions’ decision to withdraw from the semi-finals and “we equally respect the Pakistan Champions’ readiness to compete”.
The league organisers added they believed in the power of sport to inspire and bring about positive change in the world; however, “public sentiment must always be respected — after all, everything we do is for our audience.”
The owner of Pakistan Champions, Kamil Khan, said: “We have been given a walkover by the WCL management as their stance was that whoever does not play the semi-final, the opposition will be given a walkover.”
The Edgbaston Stadium management also said that the WCL event organisers had confirmed that tomorrow’s (Thursday’s) match between Pakistan and India was cancelled.
The management said that spectators would receive a 50 per cent refund and that the second semi-final scheduled for later in the day would go ahead as planned.
 






In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day military confrontation — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam attack in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching Operation Sindoor. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.
During the conflict, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for a complete halt to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.
The recent tensions also briefly cast a shadow on this year’s Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. However, the two teams are due to face each other in the tournament in September this year.
However, Indian parliamentarians have also called for a boycott of that match.</p><small>2025-07-30 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30223104bf13ffc.jpg?r=225017' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927638/thousands-honour-ozzy-osbourne-at-uk-hometown-funeral-procession' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands honour Ozzy Osbourne at UK hometown funeral procession</strong></a><br><p>Thousands lined the streets of UK city Birmingham on Wednesday to pay an emotional farewell to hometown hero Ozzy Osbourne as the heavy metal hellraiser was laid to rest.
Black Sabbath frontman Osbourne, who earned the nickname the “Prince of Darkness” and once bit a bat while on stage, died on July 22 at the age of 76. He had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2019 and died 17 days after playing a final gig to a sold-out crowd in Birmingham.
Osbourne’s funeral procession set off at around 1200 GMT (5pm PKT) on a route planned with the rocker’s family through the English city.
Chants of “Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy!” could be heard, with one fan crying out “we love you Ozzy!” as his coffin — sitting in a stately black Jaguar hearse topped with flower arrangements — and other vehicles crawled by.
The procession, which earlier passed the star’s childhood home in the city’s Aston area, was accompanied by a live brass band performance by local musicians from Bostin’ Brass.
Fan Mhairi Larner said it was “overwhelming” and “very emotional” to be part of the city’s farewell to a star who’d been so “proud of his roots”.
“I’ve been a fan as long as I can remember, and I raised my son to do the same,” said the 31-year-old carer who had travelled from the central city of Nottingham. “He was just nuts, a little bit weird, but it’s nice to have someone like this,” she told AFP.
Another fan, Reece Sargeant, came with friends to say goodbye.
“I think it was important to come and pay our respects … Ozzy and Black Sabbath really put Birmingham on the map,” he said.
The 16-year-old described the band’s last concert as “out of this world”.
Osbourne famously once said he wanted his funeral to be a celebration of his life and not a “mope-fest”.
The procession paused at the Black Sabbath bench — an art installation featuring headshots of each member on a bridge also named after the band.
Visibly emotional family members, including his widow, Sharon Osbourne, laid flowers at the bench and read some of the written tributes that have been left there, along with balloons and flowers.
Thousands of fans have gathered at the bridge in recent days, mourning the death of the musician who was instrumental in pioneering heavy metal.
The cortege, led by police motorbikes, then continued its slow journey towards a private funeral service.
‘Tribute’
“Ozzy was more than a music legend — he was a son of Birmingham,” Zafar Iqbal, the lord mayor of the central English city, said in a statement.
“It was important to the city that we support a fitting, dignified tribute ahead of a private family funeral.
“We’re proud to host it here with his loving family in the place where it all began,” Iqbal, who could be seen hugging family members when the procession stopped in central Birmingham, added.
Black Sabbath enjoyed huge commercial success in the 1970s and 80s after forming in Birmingham in 1968. Their eponymous 1970 debut album made the UK top 10 and paved the way for a string of hit records, including their most famous song, ‘Paranoid’.
The group went on to sell more than 75 million albums worldwide and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Osbourne was added for a second time last year as a solo artist.
 
 

Osbourne gained notoriety for his outlandish stunts, many fuelled by his legendary indulgence in drugs and alcohol.
In 1989, he was arrested for drunkenly trying to strangle his wife, Sharon, which he once mentioned in a 2007 interview.
His live performances at the height of his hedonism have gone down in rock folklore, particularly the 1982 gig in the US city of Des Moines when he bit a bat on stage.
Osbourne said he thought a fan had thrown a rubber bat onstage, and it was not until he took a bite that he realised it was real.</p><small>2025-07-30 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616566-pakistans-win-over-india-stunned-world-says-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's win over India stunned world, says PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim, 26 — called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and engaged US lawmakers on the issue of their father’s incarceration.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
In an interview on US media outlet Real America’s Voice shared today, Kasim said, “Right now he’s in really, really poor conditions and it looks like they’re getting worse and worse by the moment. So we’re looking for any way out possible.”
While emphasising that Imran was “incarcerated in a solitary confinement cell”, he said, “The state of the cell he’s in is awful, quite frankly.”
He continued, “He’s showering in muddy water.  I don’t mean unfiltered water. It’s muddy, dirty water,” alleging that 10 people who were incarcerated had died from filthy conditions.
Kasim expressed worry over not being able to see his father and said, “There were moments … he went 10 days without any light in his cell,” calling it a “torture tactic”.
“He gets only two hours a day in daylight. We’re not able to speak to him at all,” he added.
 






Kasim said that he and his brother were “looking to America at the moment” for support, stating, “A lot of the people here have expressed concern. It seems like it might be the only route out at the moment.”
Speaking about meeting US President Donald Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell, he said, “Grennell was very kind to spend some time with us.”
He continued, “We spoke at length and I don’t want to get into details but I’m very, very hopeful from that.”
He said that Imran from a prison cell won the Feb 2024 elections, which went through “vicious rigging”.
“[Despite] the amount of underhand tactics they used before the election to rig it against his favour, [he] still he managed to win.”
Separately, Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan said today that the sons would “definitely” come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicop) and they were “citizens of Pakistan”.
“If anything were to happen to Imran’s sons, it would become an international matter,” she told reporters.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remarked, “Why would the government stop Imran’s sons from coming to Pakistan?”
He told reporters in Islamabad that the government did not want PTI to “resort to any violence”. “The PTI will not be allowed to pull off another May 9 or Nov 26.”
A day earlier, PTI swiftly rubbished media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.
PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram had stated: “The news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib’s children is completely false. Imran Khan sahib has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan.
“I would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan sahib says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.”</p><small>2025-07-30 17:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30212830a8326ba.jpg?r=213128' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927632/trump-pushes-for-release-of-epstein-maxwell-grand-jury-testimony' target='_blank'><strong>Trump pushes for release of Epstein, Maxwell grand jury testimony</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to ease an uproar plaguing his presidency, urged two judges to release testimony to a grand jury that indicted Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges.
In late-night court filings on Tuesday, US federal prosecutors said unsealing the materials would be appropriate given the “abundant public interest” in the case of Epstein, the late financier, and Maxwell, an imprisoned British socialite.
The Republican Trump had promised to make public Epstein-related files if reelected and accused Democrats of covering up the truth. But this month, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said a previously touted Epstein client list did not in fact exist, angering Trump’s supporters.
DOJ first sought court permission on July 18 to make public transcripts of the confidential testimony given by witnesses years ago in the two cases, but Manhattan-based US District Judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer asked the government to flesh out the legal bases for the requests.
Trump has faced pressure to make public documents from the federal investigations into Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, and his longtime girlfriend, Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021.
Even if one or both of the judges allow the transcripts to be made public, it is not clear whether the public would learn anything new or noteworthy.
In the filings, prosecutors said the only witness at Epstein’s grand jury was an FBI agent. That same agent and a New York City Police Department detective were the only witnesses at Maxwell’s grand jury, prosecutors said.
Maxwell’s four-week trial in 2021 included public testimony from alleged sex trafficking victims, associates of Epstein and Maxwell, and law enforcement officers. She is now serving a 20-year prison sentence in Florida and is asking the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. She had pleaded not guilty.
Trump supporters angered
The unsealing requests came after Trump earlier this month asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury transcripts. The president did so after the Justice Department said it concluded that Epstein died by suicide and that there was no incriminating list of his clients.
The Justice Department’s announcement angered some of Trump’s conservative supporters who believe the government is covering up Epstein’s ties to the rich and powerful and that the financier was murdered in jail.
Grand juries are convened by prosecutors and meet in secret to hear witness testimony and decide whether to indict people suspected of crimes. Records of their proceedings usually remain sealed. There are only limited circumstances under which such transcripts can be disclosed.
The transcripts would not represent all previously unreleased material in the government’s possession. Investigators and prosecutors may pursue leads that they cannot substantiate or interview potential witnesses whom they do not ultimately call to testify before a grand jury.
US District Judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida last week denied the administration’s request to unseal records from grand jury probes in 2005 and 2007 in that state into Epstein. The judge said the request did not fall into any of the limited exceptions that may allow for the release of such material.
Democrats use obscure law to seek release of Epstein files
Democrats today moved to force Trump to release files from the investigation into Epstein, invoking an obscure law to keep up the pressure on the administration.
The president raised further questions about his past relationship with Epstein on Tuesday when he told reporters he fell out with his former friend after the disgraced financier “stole” employees from the spa at his Mar-a-Lago resort.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee wrote to the Justice Department asking for the materials under a section of federal law known as the “rule of five”.
The measure — introduced a century ago but rarely used — requires government departments to provide relevant information if any five members of the Senate’s chief watchdog panel request it.
It is not clear if it could be enforced in court, but even if the effort fails, it keeps the spotlight on an issue that has upended Trump’s summer, dividing Republicans and leading to the early closure of the House of Representatives.
Trump has urged his supporters to drop demands for the Epstein files, but Democrats in Congress, with limited Republican support, have been seeking a floor vote to force their release.
House Oversight Committee Democrats, backed by some Republicans, approved a subpoena last week for the Justice Department to hand over the documents, although the demand has yet to be sent.
Lawmakers have also been seeking testimony from Maxwell, whose lawyer has said she would speak to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee if granted immunity for her testimony.
“The Oversight Committee will respond to Ms Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony,” a spokesman for the panel said.
Democrats have also sought to attach votes on the Epstein files to unrelated bills multiple times, prompting Speaker Mike Johnson to send lawmakers home for the summer a day early last week rather than risk them succeeding.
“Donald Trump promised he would release the Epstein files while he was on the campaign trail. He made that promise, and he has yet to do it,” Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-07-30 17:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30123616acc66ae.png?r=125151' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587/trump-says-india-to-pay-25pc-tariff-from-aug-1-with-additional-penalty-for-russian-energy-purchases' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says India to pay 25pc tariff from Aug 1 with additional penalty for Russian energy purchases</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India starting August 1, along with an unspecified penalty for buying Russian weapons and oil, potentially straining relations with the world’s most populous democracy.
The US decision singles out India more severely than other major trading partners, and threatens to unravel months of talks between the two countries, undermining a key strategic partner of Washington and a counterbalance to China.
In posts on his social platform Truth Social, he said the US had a “massive trade deficit” with India.
In another post, he said: “Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the world and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers of any country.
“Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of energy, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine — all things not good! India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25pc, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August 1st.”
 


White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Trump has been frustrated with how trade talks with India are progressing and believes his 25pc tariff announcement will help the situation.
Trump and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will have more information “shortly” on the additional penalty, Hassett told reporters at the White House.
In response, the Indian government said in a statement that it was studying the implications of Trump’s announcements and remained dedicated to securing a fair trade deal with the US.
“India and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective,” it said.
India said it attached the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of its farmers, entrepreneurs and small businesses.
“The government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements,” it said.
The White House has previously warned India about its high average applied tariffs — nearly 39pc on agricultural products — with rates climbing to 45pc on vegetable oils and around 50pc on apples and corn.
Russia continued to be the top oil supplier to India during the first six months of 2025, making up 35pc of overall supplies.
The US currently has a $45.7 billion trade deficit with India.
The news pushed the Indian rupee down 0.4pc to around 87.8 against the US dollar in the non-deliverable forwards market, from its close at 87.42 during market hours. Gift Nifty futures were trading at 24,692 points, down 0.6pc.
Earlier, he said a trade deal with India had yet to be finalised and warned of possible higher tariffs ahead of an August 1 deadline to seal an agreement.
His comments followed a Reuters report that India was preparing to accept higher tariffs of 20-25pc on its exports to the US in the absence of a trade deal, as it holds off on offering fresh concessions ahead of Friday’s deadline.
“India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs, almost more than any other country,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, adding that it would come to an end.
Asked about the Reuters report, Trump said a trade deal had not been finalised and India could face steeper tariffs.
 


India plans to resume broader trade talks with the US in mid-August when a US delegation is due to visit, hoping to seal a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement by October, Indian officials said.
“Talks are progressing well,” an official said, adding Trump could issue a tariff order in a “worst-case scenario”. The official declined to be identified without authorisation to speak to the media.
“But, we assume it would be (a) temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place. A deal will soon be worked out,” the official said.
Trump also reiterated his claim that he helped broker a ceasefire to the conflict between India and Pakistan earlier this year, saying both sides accepted his request.
“That was great,” he said describing his friendship with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India disputes Trump’s claims that he brokered the ceasefire.
Analysts say Trump’s remarks on the India-Pakistan conflict have cast a shadow on trade negotiations.
 
 

On Monday, Trump said most partners that do not negotiate separate trade deals would soon face tariffs of 15-20pc on their exports to the US, well above the broad 10pc tariff he imposed in April. His administration will notify some 200 countries soon of their new “world tariff” rate.
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that the India talks require more time, noting Trump wants good deals, not fast ones.
India has shown “strong interest in opening portions of its market” though its trade policy had long focused on protecting domestic interests, Greer said.
 


Piyush Goyal, India’s trade minister, told Reuters last week India was making “fantastic” progress in US trade talks.
Indian officials said New Delhi had offered tariff cuts on a wide range of goods and was working to ease non-tariff barriers.
However, agriculture and dairy remain no-go areas, with India unwilling to allow US imports of genetically modified soybean or corn, or to open its dairy sector.
Total bilateral goods trade reached about $129bn in 2024, with India posting a surplus of nearly $46bn.
Officials said India was calibrating its strategy amid broader US tariff threats targeting Brics nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and others), including India, over issues such as de-dollarisation and Russian oil purchases.
“We remain hopeful of securing a deal that gives Indian exporters preferential access compared to our peers,” a second Indian government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Contentious issues
“Higher tariffs for India compared to countries it competes with, for exports to the US, are going to be challenging,” said Ranen Banerjee, a partner of economic advisory services at PwC India.
India’s commerce ministry, which is leading the trade talks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
US and Indian negotiators had held multiple rounds of discussions to resolve contentious issues, particularly over market access into India for US agricultural and dairy products.
Despite progress in some areas, Indian officials resisted opening the domestic market to imports of wheat, corn, rice and genetically modified soybeans, citing risks to the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers.
The US had flagged concerns over India’s increasing and burdensome import-quality requirements, among its many barriers to trade, in a report released in March.
The new tariffs are expected to impact India’s goods exports to the US, estimated at around $87bn in 2024, including labour-intensive products such as garments, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, and petrochemicals.
India now joins a growing list of countries facing higher tariffs under Trump’s “Liberation Day” trade policy, aimed at reshaping US trade relations by demanding greater reciprocity.
The setback comes despite earlier commitments by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump to conclude the first phase of a trade deal by autumn 2025 and expand bilateral trade to $500bn by 2030, from $191bn in 2024.
Indian officials have previously indicated that they view the US as a key strategic partner, particularly in counterbalancing China. But they have emphasised the need to preserve policy space on agriculture, data governance and state subsidies.
Hopes for a deal
It was not immediately clear whether the announcement was a negotiating tactic. While Trump railed against Japan in a June 30 Truth Social post and said there would likely be no deal with the North Asian nation, a deal was agreed on July 22.
An Indian government official told Reuters that New Delhi continued to remain engaged with the United States to seal an agreement.
Economists, too, remained hopeful.
“While the negotiations seem to have broken down, we don’t think the trade-deal haggling between the two nations is over yet,” said Madhavi Arora, an economist at Emkay Global.</p><small>2025-07-30 17:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616545-kp-govt-police-and-security-forces-to-work-jointly-to-restore-peace-says-cm-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt, police, security forces to work jointly to restore peace: CM Gandapur</strong></a><br><p>

“The Karachi CTD and a federal intelligence agency jointly carried out an IBO [intelligence-based operation] at Drigh Road Station in Karachi and arrested four suspects,” according to a CTD press statement issued on Wednesday.
“They were arrested at a time when they were coming from Punjab to Karachi by train,” the press release added.
During interrogation, the suspects confessed that they had gunned down a man identified as Abdul Rehman  in Matli on May 18, 2025, where a case was registered under terror charges.
“The weapon used in the murder has also been recovered from their custody, which has been sent to the police’s forensic science lab for investigation purposes,” the press release added.
The suspects also admitted that they had stayed at a hotel in Hyderabad for five days for the purpose of carrying out a targeted killing of their victim.
“They continued reconnaissance of Abdul Rehman till May 13 and when they got an opportunity on Sunday (May 18), they targeted the man outside a barber shop.”
The suspects were wanted in different cases in Punjab.
As per the statement, the investigation of the murder case was handed over to the CTD Karachi on the application of the complainant.
“The CTD assessed the case, obtained evidence from the crime scene in Matli and with the help of technical evidence and intelligence, traced the suspects and arrested them,” the statement added.
The Sindh police chief has announced a cash and appreciation certificate for the CTD team for arresting the suspects, according to the department’s spokesperson.
On Monday, three terrorists, including the mastermind behind the November 2024 attack on Chinese engineers, were killed during a counterterrorism operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area, CTD officials had said.
In June, the Sindh government made a hefty allocation of Rs179.7 billion for law and order, including security, law enforcement and prisons in Sindh for the financial year 2025-26.
In April, the CTD and an intelligence agency arrested a suspected militant belonging to the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in a raid in Karachi’s Lee Market.</p><small>2025-07-30 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/302013244ec9cfd.png?r=203545' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927615/multan-police-arrest-suspect-for-molesting-minor-girl-in-viral-video' target='_blank'><strong>Multan police arrest suspect for molesting minor girl in viral video</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Police on Wednesday said they arrested a man suspected of molesting a minor girl in Multan district after a video of the incident went viral online.
The video of the incident did the rounds on social media earlier in the week and generated intense criticism with calls for the suspect to be arrested, particularly as it came after the police arrested a man after footage showing him allegedly molesting a minor girl in Kasur district also went viral online.
A statement issued by the Multan Crime Control Department (CCD) today said: “The man who attempted to sexually assault a girl was arrested in an ‘injured’ condition.”
The incident occurred on July 15 in Mustafa Colony, Rashidabad area, with the limits of Bahauddin Zakaria Police Station when “an unknown person tried to sexually assault a girl in the street and fled from the scene”, according to the statement.
A case was registered under Section 377B (unnatural offences with a minor) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) at the BZ Police Station and the investigation of the case was handed over to the CCD.
The statement said the police received a tip-off about the suspect’s whereabouts and conducted a raid at an undisclosed location to arrest him.
“The suspect attempting to evade arrest opened fire on the police team and in a hurry, accidentally fired and injured himself,” the statement said, adding that he was taken to Nishtar Hospital for medical treatment.
“Police identified him through the Criminal Record Office that he was the suspect who molested the minor girl,” the statement added.
It added that the suspect’s criminal record revealed that he was nominated in a case for killing his brother in 2023. The case was registered under Section 302 (punishment for murder) at the BZ Police Station.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country last year, according to a civil society report. The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.
In January 2018, police recovered the body of six-year-old Zainab Amin from a heap of trash in Kasur, five days after she went missing. A postmortem examination suggested that she may have been raped before she was strangled to death.
The case sparked outrage across the nation and forced the government into action in finding the serial rapist and killer. The culprit, identified as Imran Ali, was convicted of the rape and murder case and sentenced to death. He was hanged to death in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Central Jail on Oct 17, 2018.
More than two years after the Zainab case, the National Assembly passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.</p><small>2025-07-30 15:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616537-pakistani-businessman-laundered-37-million-court-told' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani businessman laundered £37m, court told</strong></a><br><p>
