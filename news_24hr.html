According to police sources, the case was registered on the report of a constable, Muhammad Owais, who says the hakeem was running a clinic, where he installed secret cameras in the examination room.
He says the hakeem, in connivance with his two accomplices, sexually assaults the women patients visiting the clinic, on the pretext of examining them and records their videos.
The suspects would later extort money, jewellery and other valuables from these women by blackmailing them.
He said the suspects also uploaded obscene videos of some of the women patients on social media.
Acting on the complaint, Allappa police registered a case against the suspects who are yet to be arrested.
WOMAN TORTURED: A man, along with his brother, allegedly tortured his wife and forcibly cut her hair in Mailsi city on Thursday.
According to police, the suspect Usman had strained relations with his wife and he would subject her to torture.
On Thursday, the couple again quarrelled at their house, and Usman, with the help of his brother Kamran, overpowered his wife, subjected her to torture and cut her hair. Both suspects later fled.
Mailsi city police registered a case against the suspects, who have not been arrested so far.
MURDER CASE SOLVED: Mailsi police claimed to have solved a murder case in which the victim’s wife and her friend turned out to be his killers.
At a press conference, Mailsi DSP Saeed Ahmed Sial told the media that Asif, a labourer and a resident of 271/WB village married Sara a few years back.
He said that after her marriage, Sara contacted another man, Adnan Riaz, on social media and both became friends.
During their frequent contacts on social media, they decided to eliminate Asif and get married.
In July, Sara, with the help of Adnan, strangled Asif to death. Later, Sara claimed that Asif died of a heart attack.
The DSP said that the police developed suspicion and got conducted the postmortem examination of the victim, which revealed he was strangled.
He said that when Sara was interrogated, she confessed to her crime.
The DSP said that Mailsi Saddar police registered a murder case against Sara and Adnan and after locating them through geofencing, arrested both. He added that Sara was arrested from Lodhran and Adnan from Rawalpindi.

He chaired the meeting on the sidelines of the fifth session of the plastic pollution treaty negotiations taking place in Geneva. Billed as the most important environmental deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord, the 10-day summit brought delegates from 185 countries to finalise a global treaty to control plastic pollution.
“Pakistan led a regional dialogue with Bangladesh, Egypt, Tajikistan, Malaysia, and Sudan for an interactive briefing,” according to a statement posted by Malik’s team on X.
“Minister Musadik called for a fair Global Plastics Treaty and equitable green financing, so support reaches nations most impacted by pollution and climate challenges,” the statement added.
 






At the meeting, the climate minister noted, “those responsible for the highest levels of plastic consumption are often the largest beneficiaries of green financing.” However, he added that the world’s poorest nations are often left to fend for themselves in the fight against climate change.
“Developing nations carry the heaviest burden of their environmental and socio-economic impacts,” APP quoted him as saying.
In a bid to rally the region towards fair and equitable green financing at the global plastics talks, the minister called for the treaty to take into consideration and prioritise “countries most affected by climate change and plastic pollution”.
Malik was of the opinion that “without fair access to resources and technology, developing nations cannot meet the environmental goals set by the global community”.
“By pushing for a united regional stance, Pakistan aims to strengthen the negotiating position of developing countries and ensure that the treaty addresses both environmental and economic fairness,” APP reported.
On Wednesday, Dr Musadik Malik had floated the idea of setting up a ‘global plastic fund’ for a marketplace to buy and sell plastic credits, receiving quite a few nods and thumbs up from delegates at the talks.
“Once we have enough countries agreeing to this, the [UN Environment Programme] secretariat will be forced to put it on the agenda,” said the climate minister.
World plastic pollution treaty talks collapse with no deal
Talks aimed at striking a landmark global treaty on plastic pollution fell apart on Friday without agreement, as countries failed to find consensus on how the world should tackle the ever-growing scourge, AFP reported.
Negotiators from 185 nations worked beyond Thursday’s deadline and through the night in an ultimately futile search for common ground between nations wanting bold action, such as curbing plastic production, and oil-producing states preferring to focus more narrowly on waste management.
The talks in Geneva — called after the collapse of the fifth and supposedly final round of talks in South Korea late last year — opened on August 5.
Several countries voiced bitter disappointment as the talks unravelled, but said they were prepared for future negotiations — despite six rounds of talks over three years now having failed to find agreement.
“We have missed a historic opportunity, but we have to keep going and act urgently. The planet and present and future generations need this treaty,” said Cuba.
A cluster of mostly oil-producing states calling themselves the Like-Minded Group — including Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Russia, Iran, and Malaysia — want the treaty to have a much narrower remit.
“Our views were not reflected… without an agreed scope, this process cannot remain on the right track and risks sliding down a slippery slope,” said Kuwait.
Bahrain said it wanted a treaty that “does not penalise developing countries for exploiting their own resources”.</p><small>2025-08-15 09:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/15120926413032d.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931033/at-least-43-dead-14-injured-across-kp-as-heavy-rains-wreak-havoc-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>At least 43 dead, 14 injured across KP as heavy rains wreak havoc: PDMA</strong></a><br><p>At least 43 people died and 14 were injured in rain-related incidents in various districts across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Friday.
Since late June, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country — especially KP and northern regions — by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
At least 325 people, including 142 children, have died and 743 others have been injured since June 26 in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan, according to updated daily data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).
Bajaur was the most-impacted district due to recent flash floods, with 18 deaths and eight others injured, according to a PDMA daily situation report issued today, which was seen by Dawn.com.
Fifteen people lost their lives in Battagram; five were killed and four were wounded in Lower Dir; four deaths were reported in Swat; while one casualty and two injuries were recorded in Shangla.
 


In Bajaur earlier today, there were “reports of several people injured in flash floods”, which were caused by a cloudburst (heavy rainfall) in Salarzai tehsil’s Jabrarai village“, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi told Dawn.com.
“Rescue 1122 personnel, with the cooperation of residents, have so far recovered 16 bodies and rescued three injured from the rubble and rainwater,” Faizi confirmed.
The injured were taken to a hospital after receiving immediate medical aid in an ambulance. Disaster management, medical and diving teams were involved in the rescue efforts.
A search and rescue operation was underway under the supervision of Bajaur District Emergency Officer Amjad Khan as seven people remained missing, Faizi said, citing locals.
DEO Amjad Khan and the station house in-charge were personally supervising the operation, the Rescue 1122 official added.
In Battagram, at least 10 people died and 16 others were missing after torrential rains and flash floods wreaked havoc in the district’s Neel Band area, Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Khan said, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
AC Saleem told the media that five houses were destroyed last night due to a lightning strike in Neel Band village, which is located on the border of Battagram and Mansehra districts.
“So far, 10 bodies have been recovered from the stream at the Shimlai Mandrawali location, while rescue teams from Rescue 1122, police, and local volunteers are engaged in ongoing relief and search operations,” the APP report stated.
Earlier today, AC Saleem told Dawn.com that six men, two women and a girl were among the deceased.
The deluge affected villages located on the border areas of Neel Band, Sarim and Malkal Gali, according to a statement issued by Battagram Rescue 1122 spokesperson Aziz Khan.
“The ongoing rescue efforts are facing challenges due to intermittent rain and a near-total loss of mobile network coverage, severely impacting communication,” the statement explained.
Separately, five people died and four were wounded when the roof of a house in the Suri Pao village of Lower Dir’s Maidan area collapsed due to heavy rain, Faizi said.
Detailing the hurdles, the rescue official said: “The rescue team reached the scene after walking for three hours despite heavy rain, flooded rails, difficult and bad roads.”
 


Yesterday, over a dozen people were killed as rains and flooding ripped through the country’s northern parts, including Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
 
 

In Muzaffarabad, a massive landslide in Sarli Sacha village hit a home, leaving six members of a family buried and feared dead. Torrential rains claimed the lives of two more women in AJK’s Bagh and Sudhnoti districts.
In GB, flash floods killed at least eight people, with two still missing in the Ghizer district, while also devastating villages in the Khalti, Ishkoman and Yasin areas.
Similarly, a spell of heavy downpour lashed various parts of Abbottabad district yesterday, triggering flash floods that severely disrupted traffic flow and caused damage to infrastructure.

You can’t just come here like that … it’s an invitation. You’re handpicked.”
Arbaeen marks the 40th day after Ashura — the day Imam Hussain embraced martyrdom. Every year, over 20 million people make their way to Karbala at this time, making the journey one of the largest, if not the largest, pilgrimages in the world.
My journey to Iraq wasn’t exactly planned. I’ve been to over 43 countries around the globe, but Arbaeen, specifically, was purely based on luck — the opening of a random Instagram DM.
 

A mural in Baghdad featuring the message ‘have a blessed ziarat’.

One fine day, I received a message from a kind follower who insisted that I should make the journey to Iraq. We exchanged numbers, got talking, and one thing led to another; by then, I had given him my passport details.
He disappeared for weeks, only to return with a confirmation receipt. As it turned out, he had paid for my entire pilgrimage.
“I don’t understand. This is a lot. I don’t even know you. Why?” I asked him. “Because I think you should go. May God be with you. Allah Hafiz. Have a great journey.
“The tour leader will get in touch with you soon,” he replied.
And that’s literally how it happened. The next thing I knew, I was on a flight to Baghdad. Throughout the flight, pilgrims would sporadically break into hymns and chants, culminating in the final euphoric “Nara e Haidari; Ya Ali”. This was one of the biggest sojourns of their lives.
Being Imam Hussain’s guest
The Baghdad airport welcomed me with chaos, packed to the brim. You can’t blame it, though — after all, it is the gateway to one of the largest pilgrimages in the world. This realisation, and the patience that came with it, was not mine alone but was also shared by fellow pilgrims, none of whom lost their cool despite the mayhem. All of us waited for nearly eight hours until our caravan was finally stamped out.
The first pit stop of the pilgrimage was at Kadhmiya, aka Kazmain. It’s home to the shrines of the 7th and 9th Shia Imams, Musa Kadhim and Muhammad Al Jawad, respectively. It was at this point that the gravity of the pilgrimage finally dawned upon me.
 

The shrines at Kazmain.

After the long flight and subsequent chaotic immigration, emotions were running high, and so the first glimpse of the shrines — a short walk away from our guesthouse — brought tears to everyone’s eyes.
I didn’t exactly feel the same way, though. For perspective, I was raised in a Sunni Muslim household, and so I couldn’t exactly comprehend the scale and magnitude of the occasion or the place until I got there. This was, after all, a predominantly Shia pilgrimage.
Naturally, I was unfamiliar with the significance of this stage of the pilgrimage, and also overwhelmed. Seeing the very visible confusion on my face, one of my roommates asked: “Are you feeling okay, my friend? You seem a bit lost.”
 

Pilgrims pay respect at the shrines in Kazmain.

I didn’t know how to respond. Do I just tell him up front that I am not Shia? How do I say it? How will he respond? What is the right way to do it? There was a barrage of thoughts in my mind. And so I just blurted it all out.
To my surprise, he didn’t flinch one bit. In fact, very quickly, the news spread amongst the caravan that I am not Shia. But did that mean people from other faiths or sects were not welcome here? By the end of the journey, I had my answer: No, not at all.
In fact, I was welcomed with open arms by everyone in my caravan. Oftentimes, I even felt that they treated me better than other Shia pilgrims. “You’re Imam Hussain’s guest; that means you’re our guest,” they would say.
 

Making friends with pilgrims along the journey to Karbala.

This warmth was not just restricted to the people in my caravan — in Iraq, kindness and hospitality know no bounds. Everyone I met extended the same generosity. One of them was a friend in Najaf, whom I had been trying to connect with for years.
When I finally met him, he was adamant that I go back with something special. “You can’t leave Najaf without getting a Dur-e-Najaf ring. Please take this as a gift from me for being here,” he insisted.
Dur-e-Najaf, also known as Durr al-Najaf, is a highly prized gemstone, specifically a type of clear quartz, found exclusively in Najaf, as the name suggests. It is believed that the stone has blessings from God and is used for prayers, healing and spiritual strength.
The 1,452-poles-long walk
Najaf is the next pitstop after Kadhmiya, and is home to the shrine of Imam Ali (AS) — a sprawling complex crowned with an iconic golden dome. This is also where the walk to Karbala commences, from Imam Ali’s Shrine to Imam Hussain’s, from father to son. Both of their fates were written in tragedy.
In total, the journey is about 80km long. Along the route are a series of poles, each numbered to help you pace yourself and keep track of the long walk comprising 1,452 poles.
 

First glimpse of the tomb of Imam Ali.

The biggest shocker for me here, though, was how you don’t have to worry about food, water or accommodation throughout the journey. Everything is free.
Humanitarians from across the globe congregate here to set up their Moakibs — rest shops. They are all laid out along the route from Najaf to Karbala, ranging from sober establishments to full-fledged multi-storey air-conditioned complexes, serving as resting stops for pilgrims.
 

Food provided to pilgrims, who carry the flags of their country.

Since it was the middle of summer, I would begin walking after sunset, when the temperature outside cooled, and continue until sunrise. On the walk, I met all kinds of people — rich, poor, young and old; the newly born; the politically and religiously charged; the apolitical and irreligious looking to find God.
There’s a firm belief amongst the pilgrims that if you’re a guest of Hussain, nothing will happen to you. If you’re lost, you’ll be found; if you’re sick, you’ll be tended to; if you’re thirsty, you’ll be quenched.
 

Walking along the highway to Karbala.

This is the land of the Tigris and Euphrates, two blessed and heavily contested rivers, both of which have been mentioned in the Bible and the Quran. Prophets have passed through this land, and many people have laid down their lives on these very routes.
They say that angels, martyrs and djinns are walking with you along the way, guiding you to your final destination. So even if you’re a sceptic like me, somewhere along the way, you start to feel the power of this place, its significance, its magnanimity, and its pain.
A divine invitation
On my last day of walking, I was very close to giving up. It was past midnight, and I had stopped to sit down for some time, when an old man took a seat beside me. We got talking and soon he was passing a series of dad jokes.
I don’t recall how long we sat there, but what I do clearly remember is that by the end of our conversation, I felt much better and was back on my feet to continue the journey.
 

Meeting pilgrims from across the world in Karbala.

“I hope you see the world, Bilal. Good luck with your journey. Try your best to finish it,” the man bid me farewell. I didn’t pay much attention to his words at that moment, but a few metres later, it suddenly hit me. I never mentioned my name to him, nor did I tell him I loved to travel.
I was at a loss for words. What had happened? Where did he come from? Why was he there at the very moment I was going to give up? Serendipity? Chance? Fate?
I always consider myself to be a relatively fit person, but as I kept moving forward, one step after the other, none of that truly mattered. After all, this journey was an invitation from the skies and what exists beyond that.
 

An aerial view of the shrines of Imam Hussain and Imam Abbas.

Throughout the journey, I kept thinking: What did I do to deserve to be here? Before coming to Iraq, I didn’t know much about the gravity of our shared Islamic history, but walking all alone in the thick of the night brought a lot of time for quiet contemplation.
What was it like for Bibi Zainab to walk back to Karbala, broken, to mourn her family? She was Imam Hussain’s sister after all, and a living witness to the entire tragedy. If she could do it 1,300 years back without all the luxuries that we have now, I surely can too.
The blisters on my feet, the back pain, the sunburn, the sweat that congealed on my t-shirt into salt; none of it seemed to matter because somewhere along the way, I realised that I was doing this out of sheer love for one man: Imam Hussain.
 

Finally, reaching Karbala.

It is love at the end of the day that gets you to the end. There is no other plausible explanation.
I made it to the Shrine complex just as dawn was about to break; the golden dome of Imam Hussain’s shrine was gleaming as the first rays of daylight caressed it. In that moment, the words I had heard the most in all these days rang through my ears, accompanied by a quiet realisation — I really was handpicked for this journey.

The Federated States of Micronesia are an island nation located in the western Pacific Ocean that joined the United Nations in 1991, according to the UN’s website.
Both countries’ permanent representatives to the UN signed an agreement at a ceremony in New York, the Pakistan Mission to the UN said in a press release on Thursday.
“Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, and Federated States of Micronesia’s counterpart, Ambassador Jeem S. Lippwe, signed a joint communiqué to formalise the relationship between the two countries,” the Pakistan Mission said.
 






Addressing the ceremony, Ambassador Ahmad noted: “The relations would open up avenues for cooperation in the field of human resource management, capacity building and climate change.”
Both Missions would “work closely on key matters, especially promotion of international peace and security” at the UN, the envoy highlighted.
He praised that the development came on Pakistan’s Independence Day anniversary and that it was the 100th country to forge ties with Micronesia.
Ambassador Lippwe “expressed his happiness on the start of a new chapter in bilateral relations”, according to the Pakistan Mission statement.
While thanking Pakistan for extending support to his country, the ambassador said he “looked forward to working closely with his Pakistani counterpart to strengthen [the] bond of friendship”.
The Mission statement noted that Ambassadors Ahmad and Lippwe held a brief meeting before the ceremony, where they discussed “matters of mutual interest, including possible areas of cooperation both bilaterally as well as at the UN”.
The signing ceremony was attended by the two countries’ diplomats, including  Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Usman Jadoon.
 






In Dec 2024, Pakistan joined a coalition spearheaded by small island Pacific states to push for a new treaty focused on managing an equitable phase-out of fossil fuels and financing a global just transition away from the threat of coal, oil and gas production.
Pakistan was the first South Asian state to engage with this group to “understand the contours of the proposal for a Fossil Fuel Treaty, aimed at fairly winding down fossil fuel production”.
The 16-strong group has members across four continents, including Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Tonga, Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Niue, Antigua and Barbuda, Timor-Leste, Palau, Colombia, Samoa, Nauru, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Pakistan, and the Bahamas.</p><small>2025-08-15 08:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1512501908577cd.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931047/afghan-taliban-mark-4th-year-in-power-buoyed-by-official-recognition-from-russia' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan Taliban mark 4th year in power, buoyed by official recognition from Russia</strong></a><br><p>Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities marked the fourth anniversary of their takeover on Friday, buoyed by Russia’s first official recognition of their government, a step they hope other countries will follow.
Parades were planned in several cities, including in central Kabul, where helicopters were set to drop flowers and the white-and-black flags of the Taliban’s “Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan” fluttered across the city to mark their capture of the capital on August 15, 2021.
Taliban members gathered on Thursday night at a square near the shuttered US embassy — seat of their enemy during their 20-year insurgency — waving flags and setting off fireworks, an AFP journalist said.
The military parade held last year with much fanfare at the Bagram airbase, once the linchpin for US-led operations, was cancelled this year, without public explanation.
The Taliban government remains largely isolated on the global stage over restrictions imposed under their interpretation of Islamic law, targeting women in particular.

The International Criminal Court issued in July arrest warrants for two senior Taliban leaders, accusing them of crimes against humanity over the persecution of women and girls, who are banned from most education and work, as well as parks, gyms and travelling without a male guardian.
But the authorities scored a victory in early July when Russia became the first country to officially recognise their administration.
Kabul also enjoys close ties, despite lacking official recognition, with countries including Central Asian states, China and the United Arab Emirates.
On the Western front, the Taliban government reported talks in Kabul with officials from Norway, Britain and the United States, among others.
 
 

The authorities face almost no internal opposition, though steep challenges stem from economic fragility, international aid cuts and the influx of four million Afghans expelled from neighbouring countries.
Independent experts appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday called on the international community not to normalise relations with the Taliban authorities and to reject their “violent and authoritarian rule”.
“Operating without legitimacy, the Taliban enforces an institutionalised system of gender oppression, crushes dissent, exacts reprisals, and muzzles independent media while showing outright contempt for human rights, equality and non-discrimination,” the experts said in a statement.</p><small>2025-08-15 07:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/15115042a381421.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1931040/rescuers-scour-debris-as-toll-from-occupied-kashmir-flood-rises-to-60' target='_blank'><strong>Rescuers scour debris as toll from occupied Kashmir flood rises to 60</strong></a><br><p>Rescue teams on Friday dug through mud searching for victims, a day after the latest deadly flood to crash through a village in India-occupied Kashmir’s Kishtwar district killed at least 60 people.
Dozens more are missing, including Hindu pilgrims who were visiting a shrine, after torrents of water and mud driven by intense rain tore through the village in the Himalayan region.
Officials said a large makeshift kitchen in Chisoti village, where more than 100 pilgrims were completely washed away by what Chief Minister Omar Abdullah reported was a sudden “cloudburst” rain storm.
Heavy earthmovers were brought to the disaster area overnight to dig through deep mud, huge boulders and rubble that the flood brought down the mountainside.
The army’s White Knight Corps said its troops, “braving the harsh weather and rugged terrain, are engaged in evacuation of injured”.
Emergency kit, including ropes and digging tools, were being brought to the disaster site, with the army supporting other rescue teams.
One survivor told the Press Trust of India news agency that he had heard a “big blast” when the wall of water hit the settlement. “We thought it was an earthquake”, the shocked eyewitness said, who did not give his name.
Mohammad Irshad, a top disaster management official, told AFP today that “60 people are recorded dead”, with 80 people unaccounted for. “The search for the missing has intensified,” Irshad told AFP.
Around 50 severely injured people have been taken to hospitals.
Floods and landslides are common during the June-September monsoon season, but experts say climate change, coupled with poorly planned development, is increasing their frequency, severity and impact.
Floods on August 5 overwhelmed the Himalayan town of Dharali in India’s Uttarakhand state and buried it in mud. The likely death toll from that disaster is more than 70 but has yet to be confirmed.
 
 

The UN’s World Meteorological Organisation said last year that increasingly intense floods and droughts are a “distress signal” of what is to come as climate change makes the planet’s water cycle ever more unpredictable.
Roads had already been damaged by days of heavy storms. The area lies more than 200 kilometres by road from the region’s main city Srinagar.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the spate of disasters in his Independence Day speech in New Delhi today.
“In the past few days, we have been facing natural disasters, landslides, cloudbursts, and many other calamities”, Modi said in his public address.
“Our sympathies are with the affected people. State governments and the central government are working together with full strength.”</p><small>2025-08-15 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1511091472ea4d2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930904/over-53000-tourist-vehicles-enter-murree-against-capacity-of-5000' target='_blank'><strong>Over 53,000 tourist vehicles enter Murree against capacity of 5,000</strong></a><br><p>RAWALPINDI: More than 53,000 tourist vehicles arrived in Murree on Independence Day, despite the hill station having parking space for 5,000.
The tourist influx continued on Thursday.
A spokesman for the traffic police said that more than 53,000 tourist vehicles had entered Murree so far, compared to its capacity for only 5,000 vehicles.
The city traffic police have been taking all possible measures to facilitate tourists.

More than 200 traffic police personnel perform duty on Independence Day

He said that more than 200 traffic police personnel were on duty on Independence Day to assist visitors. Although 53,000 vehicles have entered Murree so far, many of them have left at the same time.
Therefore, between 6,000 and 9,000 vehicles were present in Murree at a given time, the traffic police spokesman told Dawn.
Driving licences are being checked at entry points and checkpoints to ensure tourist safety, while motorcyclists without helmets are not being allowed to enter Murree.
Entry to Mall Road without family is banned on Independence Day, the traffic police spokesman said.
CTO Waseem Akhtar and Traffic Officer Murree Sohail Shahzad have been personally supervising traffic arrangements in Murree, the spokesman added.
All roads in Murree are open for traffic, and movement is smooth. Awareness pamphlets are also being distributed among tourists for safe travel, the spokesman said.
However, there was unusual traffic pressure due to the rush of pedestrians at GPO Chowk, he said, adding that tourists should follow traffic rules to make their journey safe and enjoyable.
He advised tourists to park only in designated areas provided by the traffic police.
He urged tourists to avoid creating double lanes and to refrain from illegal parking, as officers are continuously patrolling to prevent violations and ensure smooth traffic flow.
Meanwhile, in view of the monsoon rains, the City Traffic Police Murree has issued a special traffic advisory for visitors.
Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Waseem Akhtar directed the traffic police that, since Murree is a mountainous area, they should check the driving licences and fitness certificates of public service vehicles entering the town, in accordance with the SOP.
He further advised tourists to choose suitable vehicles for travelling to Murree, keep wipers and lights in perfect working condition, avoid speeding on slippery roads and dangerous turns, and refrain from violating one-way traffic rules or overtaking wrongly.
All roads in Murree are two-way, so double lines should be avoided.
The CTO said vehicles should not be parked on the road to take pictures, as this affects the flow of traffic.
Tourists should follow the instructions of traffic wardens, who play an important role in ensuring safety and making journeys easier.

In videos that went viral on social media, Mr Tessori was heard as telling a big crowd that recently gathered at the Governor House to attend an Independence Day concert that “Mein bar bar keh raha hoon, tumharay bhai wapas aa rahay hain… tumharay bhai, Karachi ko theek karnay,” [I am repeatedly saying that Bhai is making a comeback, your Bhai, to get Karachi fixed]. And the crowd roared in the affirmative when he asked whether they wanted “old MQM”.
 
 

Earlier, Mr Tessori had talked about the “return of old MQM to revive past glory” during a media interaction after his visit to Bhit Shah. When asked what he was alluding to, he said he would not reveal everything, but hastened to add: “Apkay hosh urr jaey gey jo honay ja raha hay” [You would be shocked to see what is going to unfold].
The governor’s back-to-back statements not only came as a surprise to senior MQM-Pakistan leadership, which parted ways with Mr Hussain following his August 22, 2016 incendiary speech, but also to the powerful circles behind an undeclared ban on the MQM-London.
An MQM-P source told Dawn that some elements within the party conveyed their concerns to certain quarters about the “wrong message the governor’s remarks were sending across the party and the masses”.
As a result, in yet another media interaction, the governor clarified his remarks and said that he was bound to follow the policy of the MQM-P, which had openly dissociated itself from Mr Hussain.
“Altaf Hussain sahab has nothing to do with the politics of MQM Pakistan [and] its leadership is not going to accept him [in their fold] as they openly parted ways with him,” he said, adding that he could not understand why such an impression his remarks were creating.
“There is no policy [regarding Mr Hussain’s comeback] and I cannot talk against the policy of the MQM-P,” he said.

The defendants are accused of forcing both children and adults into grueling labour under threat and coercion, highlighting vulnerabilities in low-wage service industries across the United States.
“This case is about a family business built on human exploitation,” said US Attorney Susan Lehr for the District of Nebraska. “The defendants allegedly profited by compelling vulnerable victims, including children, to work for little or no pay under threat and coercion.”
The five accused — Kentakumar Chaudhari, Rashmi Ajit Samani, Amit Prahladbhai Chaudhari, Amit Babubhai Chaudhari, and Maheshkumar Chaudhari — allegedly ran hotels where undocumented individuals were forced to work in “unclean, unsafe conditions, sometimes in the very hotels where they were forced to work,” according to the DOJ.

27 victims, including 10 children, made to work long hours in unsafe, unclean hotels for little or no pay

Victims were reportedly required to work “long hours, seven days a week, in exchange for little or no pay” and were “threatened with arrest, deportation, and harm to their families if they refused to work.”
Federal raids
On Aug 12, federal, state, and local officers executed search warrants at the Nebraska hotels, including AmericInn, Omaha, The Inn (formerly Super 8), Omaha, The New Victorian Inn and Omaha, Roadway Inn, Bellevue.
 
 

The DOJ said these properties were “used as part of a conspiracy to commit forced labour” and that the defendants “conspired to harbor undocumented non-citizens for the purposes of commercial advantage and private financial gain.”
A total of 27 victims were rescued: “Ten minor children under the age of 12 from the forced labour scheme, and 17 adult victims from the same criminal conspiracy.”
Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division emphasised: “No child should ever be forced into labour. We will use every tool available to bring to justice those who exploit the most vulnerable members of our society.”
The Nebraska arrests come amid a wider push by US authorities to dismantle trafficking networks.
India on Tier 2
The US 2024 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report placed India on Tier 2, noting that the government “does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking” but is “making significant efforts to do so.” The report highlighted persistent concerns about “forced labour, sex trafficking in religious and tourist destinations, and the exploitation of children, including in the context of child sex tourism.”
Experts in Washington stress that the Nebraska case underscores the global nature of trafficking. Indian authorities have increasingly coordinated with US counterparts to investigate potential exploitation networks affecting Indian nationals abroad, especially in low-wage labour sectors.
The five Nebraska defendants now face federal charges that could carry decades in prison if convicted, and the investigation remains ongoing.

He said the decision would depend on the outcome of President Donald Trump’s meeting with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday.
“We’ve put secondary tariffs on Indians for buying Russian oil. And I could see, If things don’t go well, then sanctions or secondary tariffs could go up,” Bessent said in an interview to Bloomberg TV on Wednesday.
 
 

Earlier this month, Trump imposed a 25 per cent penalty on India in addition to 25pc tariffs for buying oil and weapons from Russia. The US has been trying to mediate a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, and on Wednesday, Trump warned of “severe consequences” if Moscow did not agree to a peace deal.

Russian oil made up 35-40pc of India’s oil imports in 2024, up from 3pc in 2021

Trump and Putin are set to meet in Anchorage on Friday to discuss how to end the war in Ukraine.
“President Trump is meeting with President Putin, and the Europeans are in the wings carping about how he should do it, what he should do. The Europeans need to join us in these sanctions. The Europeans need to be willing to put on these secondary sanctions,” Bessent said.
Delhi’s increased imports of cheap Russian crude since the Ukraine war have strained India-US relations and disrupted ongoing trade talks with Washington. Russian oil made up 35pc to 40pc of India’s oil imports in 2024 — up from 3pc in 2021.
Delhi has defended its purchases of Russian oil, arguing that as a major energy importer, it must buy the cheapest available crude to protect millions of poor Indians from rising costs.
Bessent’s comments come after he called India a “bit recalcitrant” on trade negotiations in an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday. Trump says his tariffs are part of his administration’s plan to boost the US’ economy and make global trade fairer.
He has repeatedly called India a tariff abuser and is keen to trim a $45bn (£33bn) trade deficit with Asia’s third largest economy. Trade negotiations between Delhi and Washington have been under way for several months, and are set to renew with US negotiators expected to arrive in India on August 25.
 
 

But experts say India’s refusal to reduce duties on agriculture and dairy products has been a major thorn in the negotiations.
Trump’s new 50pc tariff rate on India is set to come into effect on August 27, which some experts have said is akin to an embargo on trade between the two countries. It makes India the most heavily taxed US trading partner in Asia and is expected to severely hamper its exports focused industries like textiles and jewellery, and could drag India’s growth down by as much as half a percent.

A senior government official told Dawn that the National Assembly passed the Petroleum (Amendment) Act 2025 on Wednesday, empowering authorities to deploy information technology-based systems for continuous monitoring of petroleum products. The law aims to coordinate the efforts of various enforcement agencies to regulate storage, transportation, and sale, both jointly and independently.
 
 

The new legislation amends the nearly century-old Petroleum Act 1934, introducing provisions for digital tracking and granting enforcement powers to deputy commissioners, assistant commissioners, and designated officers under the Customs Act 1969, allowing them to seize smuggled or illegally stored fuel and related infrastructure before and after conviction.
The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), along with market stakeholders, has been working for months on the technical side of the rollout to ensure smooth implementation. The system will cover monitoring at petrol stations, en route transportation, and designated storage facilities.

New law introduces real-time tracking of petroleum products from import to retail, aims to curb Rs300-500bn in annual losses

Local refineries and oil marketing companies have long pushed for stricter controls on smuggling — particularly at borders and key domestic points — citing severe damage to their businesses and the resultant loss of government revenue. The illicit trade of petroleum products, including liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), remains a persistent issue.
 
 

A 2020 inquiry, commissioned by then-Prime Minister Imran Khan, revealed oil smuggling worth over Rs250bn annually from Iran and exposed the absence of oversight in the sector. A more comprehensive intelligence report submitted in April 2024 noted that around 10 million litres of Iranian petrol and diesel were being smuggled into Pakistan daily, resulting in a revenue loss of over Rs227bn.
The report also identified the involvement of 533 illegal petrol stations, 105 known oil smugglers, and complicit personnel in more than a dozen law enforcement agencies. It detailed informal border crossings and established smuggling routes across the country.
The amended law introduces severe penalties for violators. Individuals involved in the illegal import, transport, storage, sale, refining, or blending of petroleum products will face fines of Rs1m, with repeat offenders subject to Rs5m penalties. Facilities operating without valid licences will face closure and the confiscation of all machinery, storage tanks, and petroleum products. Owners of such facilities will be fined Rs10m.
For facilities with expired or cancelled storage licences (issued under Form K by the Department of Explosives), a six-month grace period has been granted for renewal or restoration. Failure to comply will result in the sealing of the facility, confiscation of assets, and a fine of Rs1m. The Department of Explosives is required to renew licences within 30 days of receiving complete documentation and payment.
In cases where premises are found storing or selling smuggled fuel, the law mandates immediate closure, confiscation of assets, and a fine of Rs100m. Furthermore, the Depart­ment of Explosives must cancel the operating licence of such a facility.
Vehicles involved in smuggling activities will also be confiscated under the provisions of the Customs Act 1969. Any seized goods will be handed over to customs officers for further action under applicable laws. Importantly, confiscation proceedings can begin before any conviction.
Additionally, the law vests the trial of accused individuals with the Sessions Court, while administrative powers will be exercised by deputy or assistant commissioners. Aggrieved parties will retain the right to appeal to the High Court within 30 days of receiving a decision.
The reform is seen as a long-overdue step to bring order to Pakistan’s petroleum supply chain, reduce environmental and engine damage from adulterated fuel, and plug significant leakages in public revenue.

• Registration begins for displaced families; each household offered Rs75,000
BAJAUR: As security forces claimed to have eliminated nine terrorists in an ongoing ‘targeted operation’, the district administration on Thursday ordered residents of 26 areas in the restive Lowi and War Mamund tehsils to evacuate their homes by Aug 16 for the ‘planned targeted operation’ against militants in Bajaur.
Sources claimed nine militants had been killed during the ongoing operation in Bajaur’s mountainous areas. They claimed that the operation, based on credible intelligence, involves both ground and aerial assets to neutralise the terrorist presence and was conducted in the Damadola area.
Official sources said militants tried to hide bodies in caves and hideouts, but security forces have systematically cleared these areas. However, the military’s media wing, ISPR, has not issued any statement in this regard so far.
 
 

Residents of 26 areas in both Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils, including Malangi, Sapary, Dawowgi, Mena Sulman Khail Khoorchai, Zagai, Gat, Agra, Gondai, Zari, Nakhtat, Mula Kalley, Bakaroo, Gohati, Chimialoo, Lar Kalan, Bar Kalan, Choohtra, Damadola, Inam Khoro Chinagi and Agra, have been told to evacuate their homes by 10am on Aug 16 for a short period to ensure their safety during the targeted operation against terrorists, according to a notification posted on the deputy commissioner Bajaur’s official Facebook page.
The notification, seen by Dawn, asked the residents of the specified areas to move to several relief camps in Khar using official transport arranged by the district administration. The notification added that the decision was intended to clear their areas of militants permanently.
Protest
Meanwhile, scores of people attended a demonstration on Thursday, calling for the protection of civilians in the ongoing operation in Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils here.
People from all walks of life, including political and social activists, participated in the gathering held at Umary Chowk on the Inayat Kallay-Laghari road.
A number of senior political figures and members of the Bajaur Aman Jirga also took part in the demonstration, held two days after the death of a woman and her two children following a mortar shell allegedly hitting the house of a resident in the Erab area of Lowi Mamund tehsil on Tuesday. The attack also wounded two children from the affected family.
The participants, some of whom were carrying black flags, also chanted slogans for peace and against the offensive. Bajaur Aman Jirga chief Sahib Zada Haroon Rashid, PTI local MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman, former MNA Gul Zafar Khan, ANP district president Gul Afzal Khan, PTI senior activist Najibullah Khan Mamund, Malik Khalid Khan and Irfan Janbaz addressed the gathering.
They expressed their deep anger over Tuesday’s incident in the Erab area of Lowi Mamund, which left a woman and her two children dead and wounded two children.
They called on the authorities to investigate the incident and to take special care of the civilian population during the offensive to prevent such incidents in future.
The gathering, which continued for a couple of hours, ended after Dr Hamidur Rehaman informed the participants that the authorities had assured them of investigating the Tuesday incident.
He claimed that the authorities had also agreed with them to ask the residents to evacuate their homes days before the operation. In addition, he mentioned that the authorities also agreed to provide compensation for property damage to residents during the operation.
Registration to begin today
Authorities are set to initiate a registration process for displaced persons affected by the ongoing operation in Bajaur district, starting today (Friday), to provide them with financial support.
Talking to the media on Thursday, Additional Deputy Commissioner (Planning and Finance) Saeedullah Jan said all arrangements had been finalised to start the process from Friday.
 
 

He mentioned that a registration centre has been established at the Utman Khail complex in Qazafi, equipped with 10 counters and five mobile verification units. He said it is a joint initiative of Nadra and the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to offer a financial package of Rs75,000 to each displaced family from the provincial government.
Mr Jan said that under the package, each family would receive Rs50,000 for their arrival and Rs25,000 for transportation to facilitate their return. He said that displaced people from about 27 areas of Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils would be paid digitally, regardless of whether they were staying in relief camps or with relatives.
According to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, the provincial cabinet had approved Rs5 billion in relief funds for people displaced by the military operation in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils.
Also on Thursday, the district administration provided non-food items to displaced people staying at relief camps in Bajaur, including the Bajaur Sports Complex in Khar.

Addressing a public meeting at Paharpur Sports Stadium after leading a large rally from Al-Amin House, CM Gandapur said the Constitution and law gave them the right to reclaim their mandate and that they were ready to “take bullets on the chest” in their struggle.
The rally, organised as part of PTI’s protest movement on August 14, consisted of hundreds of vehicles and was welcomed at various points  along the route to Paharpur.
In his fiery speech, the chief minister accused the state of  “oppression” since May 9, 2023, adding that PTI supporters had endured arrests and violence but kept the party’s flag flying. “We will not commit suicide, we will fight. Those who shoot at us will face the same,” he  declared.
 






He criticised the state for waging “war against its own people” and said that peace was essential for development. “If people have taken up arms, the state also bears responsibility,” he said, adding that while terrorism must end, the government should not oppress its citizens.
Highlighting cultural ties with Afghanistan, he called for better bilateral relations. He also announced that Paharpur would be granted district status.

The result is intellectual stultification, and, what Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz called a ‘logocracy’, or a society where the narrative is manipulated to fit the regime’s propaganda. Troublesome people, inconvenient facts and awkward aspects of journalistic probe must be removed from public life. In such dispensations, the deep state calls the shots.
After years of watching Pakistan “suffocate under the weight of its democratic collapse”, I have come to understand what former US ambassador to Hungary David Pressman felt. He said that “the real danger of a strongman isn’t his tactics; it’s how others, especially those with power, justify their acquiescence”.
 
 

A pliant silence prevails in the corridors of power. Some even rue the fact that our democracy is too fragile to withstand a strongman. Institutions like parliament, the judiciary, bureaucracy and police have capitulated, tacitly admitting that they cannot maintain their independence or stay above the fray. Even a large section of the media, which is supposed to hold the government to account, has fallen silent.
Many politicians, including former self-identified defenders of civilian supremacy, are skirting their moral responsibility to take a stand in support of democratic principles. Some have even aligned themselves with and praised the hybrid governance paradigm. Unfortunately, it is a “self-aggrandising myth and a potent tool of self-deception”.
Metaphorically, they could not outfox the fox and have ended up welcoming it to their henhouse. They think it is a savvy strategy of appeasement. They are mistaken. History has the unsavoury habit of repeating itself. Subjugation can eventually result in humiliation.
The black-coat revolution stood defeated the day the bold stance of a few judges of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) against the machinations of the powers that be was not supported by their seniors in the apex court, and lawyers, by and large, chose the path of least resistance. That choice, unfortunately, strengthened the autocratic state machinery that uses fear to suppress dissent. This is the climate of menace that prevails.
Now that we have celebrated the 78th anniversary of our independence, it is high time we reflected upon the follies of our successive military and civilian rulers and decided to “choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong”. The harder right is never easy. Balochistan is a case in point.
 
 

Last year, after my annual visit to Quetta, I had written an article for this paper on Aug 24, asserting that the state was fast losing its writ over vast swathes of its ungoverned areas and that Dr Mahrang Baloch had captured the imagination of the Baloch youth who felt alienated and ignored by both the federal and provincial governments.
It was time to genuinely redress their grievances related to the issue of missing persons, and grant them their political, social and economic rights, creating, above all, a sense of ownership in the future of Pakistan as a federation. That write-up proved to be a cry in the wilderness. No one in the corridors of power took notice.

It is high time we made a decision to ‘choose the harder right instead of the easier wrong’.

Last month, I visited Quetta again and came back deeply disappointed and disillusioned as the situation in the province is utterly bleak and despondent. The security agencies have detained Baloch women activists, including Mahrang and a few of her companions.
While I was there, she was produced in the anti-terrorism court, Quetta, for extension of her physical custody. She addressed the judge calmly, and, with a smirk, asked him to announce the decision as dictated to him by the powers that be. She accepted her further custodial remand, and calmly walked away. Her sister, along with some other young activists of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), are yet again in Islamabad, seeking justice and suitable legal remedies to the issue of missing persons.
 
 

The state has resorted to the ultimate insult to the Baloch code of honour, by showing disrespect and detaining their daughters. This kind of indignity evokes deep anger and disaffection against the state. It could have been avoided. What is the result? Public transport is not allowed to ply at night on the vast road network of the province as the threat of militant attacks is so great. Even daytime travel for pilgrims going to Iran and Iraq has been discontinued by road.
My sentiments stand endorsed by a recent HRCP fact-finding report on Balochistan’s crisis of trust. In the light of its findings, 13 key recommendations have been made to the state “to address the human rights, governance and political challenges currently facing Balochistan”.
While all the recommendations are important, the following need urgent attention. One, “demilitarise the province and create conditions conducive to meaningful dialogue with all genuine political stakeholders to rebuild public trust…”. Reconciliation was a key point of the counterterrorism National Action Plan, originally launched in 2015 and reinforced in 2021.
While relentless kinetic measures may be taken against proscribed militant organisations like the BLA, including the Majeed Brigade, and BRA and BLF, the government must undertake constructive engagement with the BYC that represents the angry Baloch youth. They should not be deprived of their political, social, economic and legal rights.
 
 

Two, “immediately cease the practice of enforced disappearances”. The issue of the missing persons must be resolved in the light of recommendations made by the IHC-designated commission headed by Akhtar Mengal. A constitutional and legal framework under ATA 1997 is a viable way to heal this festering wound in the province’s body politic.
Three, “ensure transparency, fairness and accountability in all electoral processes”. Only a legitimate and truly representative government can earn the trust of the public and deal effectively with militancy.
Four, end “reliance on paramilitary forces for civilian law enforcement”. Highly professional, accountable and rights-compliant policing is critical to gaining public trust. Above all, give respect to the Baloch: they may break but will not bend.

•  Flea markets have become vital for low-income groups as new branded goods become unaffordable
KARACHI: Pakistan’s imports of second-hand clothing have surged to an all-time high of 1.137 million tonnes worth $511 million in the previous fiscal year, surpassing the previous record of 990,266 tonnes ($434 million) in FY24.
This sharp rise reflects both the growing demand for affordable clothing and the country’s deepening poverty crisis.
A significant number of people, unable to afford locally made branded goods, have turned to second-hand clothing markets known as landa bazaars or flea markets.
These markets, such as those in Shershah and Banaras, have become a lifeline for lower-income groups, where used clothing, shoes, and other items are sold at a fraction of the price of new, branded goods.
According to the World Bank’s latest report, nearly 45 per cent of Pakistan’s population now lives below the poverty line, with the new threshold set at $4.20 per person per day, up from $3.65.
This increase has pushed the poverty ratio for lower-middle-income groups to 44.7pc, up from 39.8pc under the previous threshold.
Muhammad Usman Farooqui, General Secretary of the Pakistan Second Hand Clothing Merchants Associa­tion (PSHCMA), attributed the rise in second-hand clothing imports to escalating poverty.
Mr Farooqui noted that many families, especially from lower and middle-income brackets, are increasingly dependent on affordable used goods.
Farooqui has called on the government to reduce various taxes and duties on these imports.
These include a 10pc regulatory duty, 5pc customs duty, 6pc advance income tax, and approximately 5pc sales tax, which, he said, make second-hand clothing unaffordable for those who need it most.
Traders involved in the purchase and sale of used clothing also face additional taxes, including a 5pc sales tax on the difference between their sale and purchase prices. Domestic traders are also liable to pay income tax if their annual income from the business exceeds Rs 600,000.
In the Finance Bill 2024, second-hand clothing importers were designated withholding agents, requiring them to collect advance tax at 0.1pc from distributors, dealers, and wholesalers.
However, if the parties involved are not registered with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), the withholding tax increases to 2pc or even 2.5pc for non-compliant retailers.
According to Farooqui, many individuals working in the used clothing trade are not registered with the FBR, and often do not have fixed business locations or proper records, making it difficult for them to comply with these tax regulations.
Despite the government’s efforts to stabilise the economy, Farooqui argued that the benefits of this recovery must be transferred to the masses.
He called for the removal of the regulatory duty and tax exemptions for used clothing imports to ease the financial burden on people with low incomes.
Used clothing is primarily imported from European countries, the USA, Japan, Korea, China, and Canada. Within Pakistan, exporters in special zones hold a dominant share of 60-70pc of the imports. These units sort through unsorted clothing to extract higher-quality items, which are then re-exported, with only 10-20pc sold locally.
Import duties on used clothing stand at Rs 36 per kg, while shoes are taxed at Rs 66 per kg at the import stage. Farooqui stressed that reducing these taxes could provide much-needed relief for Pakistan’s disadvantaged segments.
Market surveys reveal the high prices of second-hand clothing.
Imported used jeans cost between Rs300-400, while a second-hand shirt is priced around Rs250-300. In contrast, new sports shoes made in Lahore are priced between Rs2,500-3,500, while branded shoes made in Vietnam or China can go for Rs4,000-5,500. However, used sports shoes are available for Rs600-800, making them more accessible for many consumers.
With the rising demand for affordable second-hand goods, landa bazaars have become essential in offering an alternative to increasingly unaffordable new items. While Pakistan’s economy continues to struggle, these flea markets are proving to be crucial for the lower-income population, struggling to make ends meet amidst a growing poverty crisis.

• Kremlin says Russian, US presidents to hold ‘one-on-one’ talks in Alaska
ANCHORAGE: US President Donald Trump on Thursday acknowledged his high-stakes summit with Vladimir Putin may fail, and said any Ukraine deal would come through a future three-way meeting with Kyiv to “divvy things up”.
Russian President Vladimir Putin flies to Alaska on Friday at the invitation of Trump in his first visit to a Western country since he ordered the 2022 invasion of Ukraine that has killed tens of thousands of people.
The Kremlin said that the two presidents planned to meet one-on-one, heightening fears by European leaders that Putin will cajole Trump into a settlement imposed on Ukraine.
Trump, on the eve of the summit, insisted that he would not finalise any deal with Putin and that he would include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in any decisions.
“This meeting sets up the second meeting, but there is a 25 per cent chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting,” Trump told Fox News Radio.
 


“The second meeting is going to be very, very important, because that’s going to be a meeting where they make a deal. And I don’t want to use the word ‘divvy’ things up. But you know, to a certain extent, it’s not a bad term,” Trump said.
Zelensky has refused any territorial concessions to Russia, which has ramped up attacks and made sharp gains on the battlefield just ahead of the summit.
Secretary of State Marco Rubio said any future deal needed to ensure Ukraine’s security. “To achieve peace, I think we all recognise that there’ll have to be some conversation about security guarantees,” Rubio told reporters in Washington, adding that he was “hopeful” about the summit.
Trump has previously ruled out letting Ukraine join Nato and backed Russia’s stance that Kyiv’s aspirations to enter the transatlantic alliance triggered the war.
Ukraine and most of its European allies reject Putin’s narrative and point to his remarks denying the historical legitimacy of Ukraine.
Putin welcomes US efforts
Meanwhile, Putin on Thursday welcomed US efforts to end the conflict and said that talks could also help yield an agreement on nuclear arms control.
“The US administration… is making quite energetic and sincere efforts to end the fighting,” Putin told a meeting of top officials in Moscow.
The talks are set to begin at 11:30am (1930 GMT) on Friday at the Elmendorf Air Force Base, a major US military installation in Alaska that has been crucial in monitoring Russia.
 
 

“This conversation will take place in a one-on-one format, naturally with the participation of interpreters,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Moscow.
He said that delegations would continue discussions over a working lunch and that Putin and Trump would hold a joint news conference.
The White House has not confirmed any plans for a joint press appearance.
Trump faced heated criticism over his joint news conference after his 2018 summit with Putin in Helsinki where he sided with Russia over US intelligence in accepting Putin’s denials of interfering in the 2016 US election to help Trump.
European support for Zelensky
Zelensky, who will not join Friday’s summit in Alaska, on Thursday met British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, after talks a day earlier in Berlin.
Starmer greeted the Ukrainian leader with a warm hug and handshake on the steps of his Downing Street residence and later voiced solidarity.
 


European leaders expressed relief after a call with Trump on Wednesday, saying he appeared focused on a ceasefire rather than concessions by Ukraine.
A day before the summit, Ukraine fired dozens of drones at Russia, wounding several people and sparking fires at an oil refinery in the southern city of Volgograd.

• US urged to pressure Tel Aviv to stop settlement building; EU opposed to territorial change
• 17 more killed as Gaza bombardment intensifies
MAALE: Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced work would start on a long-delayed settlement that would divide the West Bank and cut it off from East Jerusalem, a move his office said would “bury” the idea of a Palestinian state.
The Palestinian government, allies and campaign groups condemned the scheme, calling it illegal and saying the fragmentation of territory would rip up peace plans for the region.
Standing at the site of the planned settlement in Maale Adumim on Thursday, Smotrich, a settler himself, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump had agreed to the revival of the E1 development, though there was no immediate confirmation from either.
“Whoever in the world is trying to recognise a Palestinian state today will receive our answer on the ground. Not with documents nor with decisions or statements, but with facts. Facts of houses, facts of neighbourhoods,” Smotrich said.
Israel froze construction plans at Maale Adumim in 2012, and again after a revival in 2020, because of objections from the US, European allies and other powers who considered the project a threat to any future peace deal with the Palestinians.
 


Restarting the project could further isolate Israel, which has watched some of its Western allies condemn its military offensive in Gaza and announce they may recognise a Palestinian state.
Palestinians fear the settlement building in the West Bank — which has sharply intensified since the 2023 Gaza war — will rob them of any chance to build a state of their own in the area.
In a statement headlined “Burying the idea of a Palestinian state,” Smotrich’s spokesperson said the minister had approved the plan to build 3,401 houses for Israeli settlers between an existing settlement in the West Bank and Jerusalem.
In Maale Adumim, Smotrich told Reuters that the plan would go into effect on Wednesday.
Breaking the Silence, an Israeli rights group established by former Israeli soldiers, said what it called a land grab “will not only further fragment the Palestinian territory, but will further entrench apartheid”.
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, the Palestinian president’s spokesperson, called on the United States to pressure Israel to stop settlement building.
“The EU rejects any territorial change that is not part of a political agreement between involved parties. So annexation of territory is illegal under international law,” European Commission spokesperson Anitta Hipper said.
Bombardment of Gaza
Meanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 17 people were killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes as the military intensified its bombardment of Gaza City.
The dead included six civilians who had been waiting for humanitarian aid, said civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal. “The Israeli occupation forces are intensifying their raids in the Zeitun area” of Gaza City, he said.
“For the fourth consecutive day, the area has been subject to a military operation, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries,” said Bassal.
 


“Since dawn today, we have received 28 calls from families and residents of this neighbourhood, some of whose children have been killed. Many people cannot leave these areas due to artillery fire,” the spokesperson added.
Maram Kashko, a resident of Zeitun, said the strikes had increased over the past four days. “My nephew, his wife and their children were killed in a bombardment,” he said.
An AFP videographer said their bodies were taken to Al-Ahli Hospital in Gaza City and buried shortly afterwards at the Sayyid Hashim cemetery.
On Wednesday, the head of the Israeli military said he had approved a new plan for operations in the Gaza Strip aimed at freeing all hostages and defeating Hamas.

According to a report from Safeguarding Health in Conflict Coalition (SHCC), 39 incidents of violence or obstruction targeting healthcare services were reported in 2024.
By comparison, there were 12 such cases reported in 2023 and 16 in 2022.
 
 

The SHCC, a coalition of over 40 organisations safeguarding health  workers and services in conflict zones, attributed the rise in threats  to broader instability and growing violence.
Regarding fatalities, the report noted that at least 15 health workers lost their lives last year, a significant increase from three in 2023 and five in 2022.

• Kurram SHO slain during operation; FC man martyred in South Waziristan
PESHAWAR: Six police personnel were martyred and eight others injured as militants targeted police at five different locations, including the outskirts of the provincial capital.
The deadliest assault occurred in Upper Dir, which claimed the lives of three police personnel, while other attacks occurred in Lower Dir and Shangla districts.
Late on Wednesday night, a police official deputed at Hassan Khel Police Station informed senior officers of an ongoing attack.
Superintendent of Police for Sadar Division Raza Muhammad said the police station is surrounded by dense natural forest, adding that the exchange of fire continued for almost three hours, and the police responded bravely.
Hassan Khel Police Station, located around 40 kilometres south of Pesh­awar, is situated on the border between districts Peshawar and Kohat.
This area has been a hotspot for intelligence-based operations aimed at dismantling militant groups. Recent attacks in the area have claimed the lives of several law enforcement officers.
While the attack on Hassan Khel was underway, police at the Adezai Post, located five kilometres north, successfully repelled a similar attack. “The exchange of fire lasted 10 minutes, but the militants had to retreat due to the intense response from the Adezai police,” said SP Raza.
Further attacks were thwarted the same night.
Militants opened fire on a police post at Sakhi Pull in the Nasir Bagh area, but the attack was successfully repelled.
In Kurram, Qaisar Hussain, the Station House Officer of Roza Police Station, was martyred in an exchange of gunfire during an intelligence-based operation targeting Abid Hussain alias Tehran Turi, a notorious militant leader.
Turi, a trained fighter who allegedly fled to Syria after the 2007 sectarian clashes in Kurram, played a leading role in the Bagan incident in November last year.
Dir attacks
Separately, four policemen were martyred and seven others injured when militants carried out coordinated attacks on a Quick Response Force (QRF) van in Upper Dir and multiple police posts in Lower Dir late on Wednesday night, officials and police sources said.
They said that the gunmen, in a midnight attack, ambushed a QRF van in Upper Dir’s Panakot area, which left three police officials, including Akbar Hussain, Nasr Minullah and driver Ismail martyred on the spot.
Six others, including policemen and Frontier Constabulary personnel identified as Jalal, Rahimullah, Niaz, Abdul Ghaffar, Rahim and Riasat Khan, sustained injuries and were shifted to the hospital.
 


Police said the attackers targeted the vehicle with automatic weapons, but the elite force personnel travelling in a separate vehicle remained unharmed. All units in the area were placed on high alert following the assault.
In Lower Dir’s Maidan subdivision, militants attacked three police posts in Lajbok, Shadas, and Kolal Dherai, in separate incidents during the night.
One constable was martyred in the Lajbok attack, which occurred around midnight. Another constable sustained minor injuries in the assault on Shadas post at about 1:15am. The third attack, on Kolal Dherai post around 2:30am, was repulsed without casualties.
S. Waziristan
Separately, a Frontier Corps official was martyred when a patrolling party of the paramilitary force came under attack in Lower South Waziristan. Sources said that the security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation.
In Shangla, a militant attack was thwarted by law enforcement personnel near Dambra Chowk on Chawga-Shekoli Road. Police said the attack took place at 1:23 am on Thursday when militants opened fire, adding that police responded immediately.
They said that the attackers took cover behind stacks of construction blocks. At around 1:40am, the militants, while dragging away two injured accomplices, retreated towards Shekoli Road.
Attack foiled in Lakki
Meanwhile, police in Lakki Marwat also claimed to have thwarted a late-night militant attack on a police post in the Mazanga area of Bannu district.
A police official said that a group of militants attacked the post with light and heavy weapons in an attempt to seize the building. He added that the exchange of fire lasted for some time, causing the assailants to flee.
Separately, a police officer and a cook sustained injuries when unidentified militants threw a grenade at the Bamkhel police post in Swabi district on Thursday.

• Eight killed, seven missing in Gilgit-Baltistan
MUZAFFARABAD / GILGIT: Over a dozen people were killed on Thursday as rains and flooding ripped through the country’s northern parts, including Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, while in Punjab, authorities remained on high alert as water levels in rivers and nullahs started rising.
In Muzaffarabad district, a massive landslide in Sarli Sacha village hit a home, leaving six members of a family buried, and feared dead.
A cloudburst sent a wall of water surging down Jhugiyan Nullah, destroying summer homes and livestock. In the same area, a raging flood in Machhiara Nullah obliterated a major bridge.
In Sudhnoti district, Misbah Ashfaq, 26, died after being swept away by a stream. Deputy Commissioner Mumtaz Kazmi said 34 houses in his district were partially or completely damaged.
In Bagh district, Akhtar Begum, 57, was killed when her home collapsed.
The northeastern Neelum Valley also faced major disruptions, where tourists were shifted to safety.
More than 600 tourists camping at the Ratti Gali lake base were advised to remain in place after the link road was damaged. The floods also washed away two connecting bridges over Lawat Nullah, and the swollen Jagran Nullah tore away a bridge in Kundal Shahi. A scenic riverside restaurant and at least three houses in the area were also swept away.
In the Jhelum Valley, a cloudburst over Palhot unleashed a flash flood that damaged part of the road and left dozens of vehicles stranded. In Nardajiyan village, a raging torrent swept away six shops.
With the Neelum River rising rapidly, authorities issued a flood warning and plan to relocate vulnerable riverside families.
The Muzaffarabad–Mansehra highway remains blocked at Lohar Gali due to a landslide.
Damages in GB
In Gilgit-Baltistan, flash floods killed at least eight people and with two still missing in the Ghizer district, devastating villages in the Khalti, Ishkoman and Yasin areas.
“Daen Area of Ishkoman Tehsil, Khalti of Gupis Tehsil and Thoi, Barkulti and Taus areas of Yasin Tehsil have received short but heavy rains, which devastated many villages and infrastructure,” said provincial spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.
 
 

In the Khalti valley, a house with at least seven people inside was struck by heavy debris, Additional Deputy Commissioner Mir Afzal said. Only two bodies and one injured girl were recovered.
An elderly man in Barkulti also died after being caught in the floods, Afzal said.
The floods damaged more than a dozen houses, several vehicles, schools and health units, while blocking major arteries including the Karakoram Highway and Baltistan Highway at several points.
In Diamer, flash floods triggered submerged parts of Babusar Road.
Punjab on high alert
Authorities across Punjab were on high alert on Thursday as monsoon rains battered cities and villages, causing water levels to swell in rivers and nullahs.
PDMA said Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala was flowing at 64,554 cusecs on Thursday evening, crossing the low-flood mark of 18 feet. The rising waters prompted a rescue in Shakargarh, where four men were stranded in the surging Nullah Bain.
 
 

The Met Office and PDMA predicted scattered to very heavy rainfall across upper Punjab from August 18-21, with Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sialkot and Narowal.
Alerts were issued for the River Jhelum at Mangla Dam, the Indus River at Chashma, and the Chenab River at Marala Barrage. Over two dozen villages, including Bhikiwind, Mahiwala and Kalanjer, are at risk of being submerged.

• Official says flood damaged homes built in riverbed
TWO weeks after a flood that washed away their houses, crops, and cattle, locals living along the banks of the Indus in Layyah district are still reeling from the ongoing ordeal — bracing for another river surge even though the previously-flooded fields have yet to be drained.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, the water level is rising in the Indus River at Tarbela, Kalabagh, and Chashma, and the flow is expected to rise to “medium to moderate levels” within the next 24 hours.
On July 28, more than 23 union councils in the district had submerged after a protective dyke built to support the newly constructed Layyah-Taunsa Bridge buckled under the raging floodwater. Now, the river flows through the areas once protected by this protective dyke.
The bridge, which connects the cities of Layyah and Taunsa, is 2km long, while the riverbed spans a width of app­roximately 24km. The government approved Rs10 billion for its construction in 2017. The area also has a ferry service, which takes a little over an hour to reach the other side.
A visit to the area showed that roads leading to the bridge had been swept away, and three to four feet of water was standing in fields of sugarcane and sesame. The locals, without any help from the government, were preparing for another eventuality — shifting their belongings from damaged houses to other places, saying the land and their houses were damaged by the river daily.
 
 

According to them, the river water did not enter their villages in the past and they blamed the ‘flawed bridge’ that altered its course and directed the water towards settlements. They feared that if the river further swelled, their houses and farmland would be permanently lost.
A resident of Dulu Nashaib, Ameer Muhammad, told Dawn that there were about 40 homes in Kumharan Wala village. “All houses were washed away and they could not take away their belongings,” he said, adding that the river was flowing through the now-vanished village. “Hundreds of acres of sugarcane crop and dozens of houses were completely washed away and became part of the river,” he lamented.
A resident of Chandhar village, Muhammad Iqbal, said they managed to retrieve some of their belongings before they were washed away by the floodwater after the dyke collapsed. They lost their crops in 2005 and 2010, but in this flood, all their belongings were gone. He claimed substandard material was used for the construction of the dyke and the contractor of the bridge and its connecting roads fled soon after the dyke was swept away.
Ruined harvest
A government report revealed that 47 villages were affected, 75 houses were fully destroyed, and 29,788 acres of crops vanished in the flood. Besides the death of a person and four head of cattle, entire crops were damaged in some areas, including Mirani Paka. Sumra Nashaib, Dulu Nashaib, Lohanch Nashiab, Mirani Paka, and Mosan Shah now stand in ruins, with mud and brick houses reduced to debris.
With their harvest ruined, farmers stare at drowned fields in disbelief. Like others, Riaz Hussain was also sifting through the rubble of his house, hoping to salvage something.
“The river never flowed here before the bridge,” said one villager, echoing widespread anger. “We warned them, and now we are paying the price.”
Villages like Sehmal Nashaib lost 92 per cent of their crop, but compensation is still awaited. As many as 75 families in Karor tehsil alone, whose homes were ‘fully damaged’ have yet to receive help. The locals demanded immediate reconstruction of the dyke and flood barriers and compensation for crops, houses, and livestock, as well as a judicial inquiry into the bridge’s design and approval process.
Pervaiz Dulu, who runs a ferry service between the two cities, told Dawn that even after two weeks, the 800-foot-wide breach had still not been plugged by the government.
On the other hand, a local PPP leader claimed that the bridge’s construction went on despite legal challenges.
Dr Javed Kunjal told Dawn that he had challenged the construction of the bridge and also filed a writ petition before Lahore High Court, but no one listened. He said that they had pointed out flaws in the design and mentioned that it would erode the human settlements. He said that the natural path of the river was obstructed by the bridge and its supportive dykes.
“How can a 24km wide river… be covered by a two kilometre bridge? The remaining part of the river was closed to build supportive dykes and roads for the bridge,” he said.
“Despite legal challenges questioning the bridge’s engineering, construction was allowed to proceed,” he claimed.
According to Punjab Irrigation Department Layyah XEN Abdul Rauf, the flood entered villages after the protective dyke washed away under the pressure of 400,000 cusecs of water. He said that the settlements were established in the floodplains, which always flooded during the high-flow season.
“Locals should not be allowed to build houses and infrastructure there.” However, he did not address why the government was building roads in the riverbed.
He assured that the flooded river did not pose any threats to Layyah and Karor Lal Esan cities because their protective embankments were still 10km away. Meanwhile, the government allocated over Rs150 million for the construction of new and existing dykes to protect the area from flooding.

• Top judge says move might affect unity among judges, expose court to public comment
• Insists Article 184 petitions must go to Constitutional Bench, not full court
• SC Rules 2025 published, aim to modernise court procedures
ISLAMABAD: Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi ignored a decision made last year by a committee to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment of the Constitution before the full Supreme Court, according to minutes of the communication exchange between CJP and two senior judges of the apex court.
CJP argued that such a move would dampen the much-needed spirit of collegiality among judges, besides exposing the court to public comment, as in the recent past.
The committee, which met on Oct 31, 2024, under the Practice and Procedure Act (PPA) 2023, was convened by senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar. In response, CJP Afridi, who chairs the committee, said he did not find it appropriate to call for a full court hearing. He also mentioned receiving the letters from the two senior judges late in the afternoon.
 
 

CJP explained that he had been compelled to send the committee’s decision and his response in sealed envelopes to the secretary of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) for safekeeping until the JCP meeting, which was convened on Nov 5, 2024.
In his reply, the CJP expressed his intention to request the JCP to nominate additional judges to join him on the Constitutional Bench. This would enable the committee, as envisaged under Article 191A (3a) of the Constitution, to bring the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment before the full court.
He observed that convening the committee to form benches under PPA or constituting the full court would violate the Constitution’s provisions.
He also asked the JCP Secretary to present his response, along with the letters from the two judges, for due consideration at the upcoming JCP meeting.
CJP Afridi asserted that the constitutional mandate regarding the jurisdiction of any bench to hear petitions under Article 184 of the Constitution was clear. Under Article 191A, petitions filed under Article 184 must be placed before the Constitutional Bench. He further noted that the constitution of benches to hear such petitions is solely within the purview of a three-judge committee of the Constitutional Bench, not the PPA committee.
He recalled how he consulted all 13 judges of the Supreme Court. Nine of them agreed that petitions challenging the 26th Amendment should be placed before the Constitutional Bench, not the full court.
In separate minutes dated May 20, 2025, Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah stressed the need for meaningful consultation, which he stated was the core purpose of the PPA. Justice Shah noted that delegating powers to the Supreme Court’s registrar was not covered by the act.
He suggested finding a permanent solution for urgent matters and proposed that the next senior judge should attend committee meetings in the absence of a member, but only if the CJP was unavailable.
The committee discussed Justice Shah’s proposals and agreed with his view on non-delegation of committee powers but differed with the rest of his assertions. The committee directed the registrar to revise the draft and resubmit it.
SC Rules 2025
Meanwhile, the apex court on Thursday formally published the Supreme Court Rules 2025, replacing the Supreme Court Rules 1980.
Framed under Article 191 of the Constitution, the new rules replace outdated provisions and bring court procedures in line with contemporary legal, constitutional and technological developments that have emerged immediately.
To carry out this revision, CJP had formed a committee comprising Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi. The committee engaged with judges, the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association and other bar associations. The final draft was placed before the full court and approved after detailed deliberation.
The Supreme Court Rules 2025 consist of seven parts, 38 orders and six schedules, with around 280 provisions amended (including 160 from the schedules), 60 new provisions added, and five outdated provisions deleted.
Key highlights of the new rules include that all petitions and paper books must be filed electronically, and notices, orders and certified copies will be issued digitally. Pleadings, hearings and affidavits may be conducted via video link, and judicial documents sent by post will no longer be entertained.
The rules update court fees for the first time in decades, with special provisions for criminal petitions, fees for petitions submitted from jail and fee exemptions for habeas corpus and Article 184(3) petitions. Counsel fees have also been increased, and the registrar may appoint advocates at state expense in death penalty cases.
Intra-Court Appeals have been introduced for orders under Article 184(3) and contempt proceedings, with one review petition allowed per judgement. Frivolous reviews will incur penalties, and the security deposit has been increased.
Appeals from interlocutory orders must be heard by a bench of at least two judges. The registrar is empowered to recall ex parte orders and enforce compliance with procedural formats.
The registrar is granted authority to oversee staff and exercise procedural powers, and procedural failures will not invalidate proceedings.

Under the 1960 IWT, three rivers that flow westwards were awarded to Pakistan, with India getting three eastern-flowing rivers. In 2023, Pakistan brought a case to the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague over the design of Indian hydropower projects on rivers that were awarded to Pakistan under the treaty.
The court, in its ruling that was posted on its website on Monday, said it had jurisdiction over the dispute and ruled the treaty “does not permit India to generate hydro-electric power on the Western Rivers based on what might be the ideal or best practices approach for engineering” of these projects. Instead, the design of these projects must adhere “strictly” to the specifications laid down in the treaty, the court said, adding that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
The government had welcomed the decision and Attorney General Mansoor Usman had said the court had accepted Pakistan’s position.
Questioned about the matter today in his weekly press briefing, Indian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said: “India has never accepted the legality, legitimacy, or competence of the so-called Court of Arbitration. Its pronouncements are therefore without jurisdiction, devoid of legal standing, and have no bearing on India’s rights of utilisation of waters.”
He said India stood by its decision to hold the treaty in abeyance.
 






Responding to the MEA spokesperson’s stance, the water minister told Dawn.com: “India wants to run away from this agreement (IWT). Under any article of the agreement, India or Pakistan cannot terminate this agreement.”
He said India’s claim was “baseless and wrong”, adding that Pakistan rejected it.
“The court has already said that it has the power to decide. India had made this claim before, which the court has rejected.”
He said a letter by India earlier in the year seeking modification in the treaty had no legal cover and the country could not unilaterally take a decision regarding the IWT.
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
A supplemental award by the PCA in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions.
International lawyer Ayesha Malik said India’s stance was a “testament to the extent to which India has departed from being a responsible, law-abiding state”.
She said the PCA award rested on India complying with its obligations under the IWT as well as international law.
“India is choosing to ignore the fact that it cannot merely suspend a treaty like the IWT and act like those obligations are no longer incumbent upon it. Furthermore, it is entirely incorrect for India to say that ‘New Delhi has never recognised the legitimacy of the court’, having entirely recognised its legitimacy in the Kishenganga arbitration of 2013.”
She said the PCA’s appeal for dialogue between the parties in its ruling had “fallen on deaf ears”.
“An increasingly bellicose India under [Narendra] Modi’s Hindutva regime seems to be repeatedly eschewing cooperation in favour of confrontation. While legal wins are good for Pakistan, it seems that its belligerent neighbour does not want the matter settled in a courtroom in The Hague, but by force.”</p><small>2025-08-14 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/14190600189a313.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930867/civil-and-military-leadership-martyrs-of-marka-i-haq-honoured-with-independence-day-awards' target='_blank'><strong>Civil and military leadership, martyrs of Marka-i-Haq honoured with Independence Day awards</strong></a><br><p>Military and civilian leadership, as well as the martyrs of “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth), were presented with national honours as part of celebrations to mark Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day on Thursday.
In July, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said this year’s Independence Day would be marked as “Marka-i-Haq”. The term is used by the state to name the conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the end of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with a ceasefire on May 10.
In an earlier message today, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari said the day served as a reminder of courage, unity, and sacrifices that led to the creation of Pakistan and paid homage to the founding father Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the workers of the Pakistan Movement for their struggle and sacrifices.
The awards, including both wartime and peacetime honours, were conferred by President Zardari and PM Shehbaz during a ceremony at the Presidency in Islamabad. Awards were conferred upon senior military and civilian officials, members of the PM’s war cabinet, as well as the delegation that presented Pakistan’s case to the world in the wake of the military confrontation with India.
According to Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), eight Sitara-i-Jurat (Star of Courage), five Tamgha-i-Jurat (Medal of Courage), 24 Sitara-i-Basalat (Star of Valour), 45 Tamgha-i-Basalat (Medal of Valour), 146 Imtiazi Asnad (mentioned in the Dispatches of senior commanders), 259 COAS Commendation Cards and one Tamgha-i-Imtiaz (Military) (Medal of Excellence) were awarded to both officers and enlisted men.
Field Marshal Asim Munir was presented with the Hilal-i-Jurat (Crescent of Courage), Pakistan’s second-highest wartime gallantry medal.
“During a difficult time, he was engaged in a battle with India from April 22 till May 10, leading the war effort,” according to the citation. “In light of your unquestionable courage, military prowess, firm belief and unshakeable patriotism, the president awards you the Hilal-i-Jurat.”

Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu received the Hilal-i-Jurat for his command during the air battle on the night of May 6-7 and Marka-i-Haq.
“You brought the air force’s motto, ‘second to none’ to reality,” the citation read.
Naval Chief Admiral Naveed Ashraf was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “making Pakistan’s naval defence a reality and forcing the Indian Navy to withdraw.
“For your service in Pakistan’s naval defence, you are awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz.”
Meanwhile, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, was also awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz (military) for “performing the role of an adviser on military affairs during the difficult days of Marka-i-Haq”.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz — Pakistan’s highest civilian honour — for “exposing India’s one-sided diplomatic attacks on the international stage and presenting Pakistan’s stance to the world to ensure regional peace”.

According to state broadcaster PTV News, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif was also awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for his “exceptional leadership and strategic contributions during the recent India-Pakistan war and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”.
 






The broadcaster also reported that Information and Broadcasting Minister Attaullah Tarar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “effectively and successfully presenting the national narrative on an international level during the recent Pakistan-India tensions.
“During the tense situation between Pakistan and India, Attaullah Tarar ensured complete coordination in the dissemination of information by civil and military institutions, successfully countering India’s propaganda and powerfully highlighting Pakistan’s stance on international forums,” PTV News wrote in a post on X.
 






Similarly, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar was awarded the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “using legal means to serve the nation and challenge the illegal suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, as well as the illegal killing of Pakistanis”, while Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi was presented the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for “ensuring national unity and keeping the peace in the face of intense attacks on civilians”.
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was presented the Nishan-i-Imtiaz for leading the delegation that travelled to New York, London and Brussels to present Pakistan’s stance at international fora.
The delegation members — Dr Musadik Malik, Senator Sherry Rehman, Khurram Dastigir, Senator Sherry Rehman, Hina Rabbani Khar, Senator Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janua and Jalil Abbas Jilani — were all awarded the Hilal-i-Imtiaz (Crescent of Excellence).
“For presenting Pakistan’s stance across the world against India’s one-sided narrative, the members of the diplomatic delegation are awarded the Hilal-i-Imtiaz,” the citation stated.
Rehman posted a photograph of herself with the award on X, writing, “Deeply grateful to [President Zardari] and [PM Shehbaz] for honouring me with my second civilian award today.
“Already have been humbled with the highest Nishan-i Imtiaz earlier in service to my motherland, Pakistan,” she wrote.
 






Awards were also conferred to personnel martyred during Marka-i-Haq by PM Shehbaz. Those personnel awarded honours posthumously were:

The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.</p><small>2025-08-14 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618839-scp-issues-new-supreme-court-rules-2025' target='_blank'><strong>SCP issues new Supreme Court Rules 2025</strong></a><br><p>
