The petition, on which the court had reserved its verdict earlier today, was filed by JUI-F leader Maulana Lutfur Rehman yesterday. Rehman, who was among the four contenders for the KP CM post, had requested the court to “set aside” Afridi’s election and declare it null and void.
At today’s hearing, which was presided over by  Justice Arshad Ali and Justice Waqar Ahmad, Barrister Yaseen appeared on behalf of Rehman against PTI’s Salman Akram Raja.
Addressing the court, Raja pointed out that the JUI-F petition at hand “has become ineffective in light of yesterday’s PHC order.”
Responding to his comments, Justice Ali said, “Yes, we are aware of the order, but let’s hear the petitioner’s argument.”
Barrister Yaseen told the court, “How was a new chief minister elected if the resignation of the former CM had not yet been accepted and the seat remained occupied?”
Citing Article 105 of the Constitution, the petitioner’s counsel pointed out that only the Governor has the right to advise the CM,“ adding that “Gandapur’s resignation was sent by post; he did not submit it himself.”
To this, Justice Ali responded, saying, “I understand your point — the post will remain vacant until the resignation is accepted.”
The petitioner’s lawyer further argued that the “election was unconstitutional and should not have taken place.” He cautioned that “electing a new chief minister while there already was a chief minister in place could create a constitutional upheaval.”
“If the resignation had been accepted, then it would have made sense to hold the election and all respective parties would have taken part in it,” he added.
“The cabinet has not yet been dissolved; it is still in place,” he noted, to which Justice Ali said: “ When the chief minister (Gandapur) is not in his position any more, how are we talking about the cabinet?“
“Yes, that is exactly what I am saying — Ali Amin Gandapur is still the chief minister,” Yaseen said, in response to the judge’s comments.
Justice Ali, addressing the petitioner’s lawyer, said, “Have you read yesterday’s order from the chief justice”?
“Yes, I have read it,” he said, alleging that PTI had filed an incorrect application.
Justice Ali offered the petitioner’s legal counsel two options: “to either withdraw the petition or let the case be heard on merit.”
“Decide on the merit,” barrister Yaseen said.
Subsequently, the court reserved its decision in the matter and later dismissed the petition.
The plea
Yesterday, JUI-F’s Rehman filed a petition in the PHC, requesting that the election of Afridi as the KP chief minister be “set aside” and declared null and void.
Rehman was one of the four people in the race for the KP CM office, along with Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP and PTI’s Afridi.
In the petition, Rehman named six respondents, including the KP government, Governor Kundi, the KP Assembly through Speaker Swati, the secretary of the provincial assembly, Gandapur and Afridi.
He requested the court to set aside the election and declare it “ab initio void” as it was “wholly unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, without jurisdiction, coram non judice.”
Rehman asked the court to halt any further proceedings in the matter until the governor had “lawfully received and verified” the resignation of Gandapur.
The petition called for a fresh election “in accordance with the Constitution and the assembly rules, after lawful confirmation of vacancy.”
KP CM crisis
Afridi’s election on Monday was held amid uncertainty about the status of Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation from the provincial chief executive’s position, prompting the opposition to boycott the election.
On Monday, before the election, two resignations submitted to KP Governor Kundi by Gandapur — who stepped down on party founder Imran Khan’s directive — were returned over “disparate signatures”, and Kundi summoned him on October 15 (today) to settle the matter.
By that time, KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati had already convened an assembly session to elect a new leader of the house. And the PTI maintained that under Article 130(8) of the Constitution, a chief minister’s resignation did not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
The opposition, however, disagreed and walked out of the session held for the CM election. Following its boycott, candidates fielded by the JUI-F, the PPP and the PML-N received zero votes while Afridi won the race with 90.
At yesterday’s hearing at the PHC, Chief Justice (CJ) S.M. Attique Shah issued the directive to the Governor to administer the oath to CM-elect Afridi, instructing that the KP Assembly speaker should administer the oath if the governor did not.
The court’s decision came on a PTI application seeking the nomination of the assembly speaker or any other person “considered appropriate” in place of the governor to administer the oath to Afridi.
Following the court’s decision, Kundi said while speaking to the media in Karachi that he had been saying he would abide by the Constitution. “I never said that I would not administer the oath,” he added.</p><small>2025-10-15 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15155311d8bb4cd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949096/internet-services-restored-after-repair-of-submarine-cable-ptcl' target='_blank'><strong>Internet services restored after repair of submarine cable: PTCL</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Tele­commu­nications Limited (PTCL) on Wednesday said the international cable consortium had completed the repair of a repeater installed in the submarine cable, which had affected internet speeds across the country.
Yesterday, internet users, already facing disruptions in parts of upper Punjab and the federal capital due to law and order situation, experienced slow connectivity.
PTCL had said that a maintenance activity was planned on one of the company’s submarine cables to repair a faulty repeater by the international cable consortium.
“The repair process began at 11 am on October 14 and has been successfully completed,” PTCL spokesperson Amir Pasha said in a statement today. “Internet service speed and connectivity have been restored across the country.”
The state-owned PTCL manages three undersea optical fibre cable networks that provide international internet connectivity to Pakistan.
The combined capacity of all six submarine cable systems serving the country, including three PTCL cable systems, two submarine cable systems of Trans World Associates (Pvt) Ltd and PEACE cable of Cyber Internet Services, stands at 13Tbps, while national usage currently ranges between 7 and 8 Tbps.</p><small>2025-10-15 11:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/151549184ced292.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949076/26th-amendment-case-justice-ayesha-asks-whether-article-191a-means-full-court-cannot-be-formed' target='_blank'><strong>26th Amendment case: Justice Ayesha asks whether Article 191A means full court cannot be formed</strong></a><br><p>Justice Ayesha Malik wondered on Wednesday whether Article 191A of the Constitution meant that a full court could no longer be formed as the Supreme Court’s (SC) Constitutional Bench (CB) heard petitions against the 26th Amendment.
Article 191A was an addition to the Constitution made under the 26th Amendment to form constitutional benches in the Supreme Court to specifically deal with cases pertaining to constitutional matters, with its judges nominated by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP).
The Amendment was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.
The legislation, which altered judicial authority and tenure, has been a lightning rod for debate, with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s independence.
The tweaks took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.
The bench hearing the pleas is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Mazhar, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
Senior lawyer Abid Shahid Zuberi, also a former Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) president, continued his arguments for the fourth consecutive hearing today. The hearing was adjourned till October 20 (Monday).
 


Thus far, Zuberi, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan, Balochistan High Court Bar Association (BHCBA)’s counsel Munir A. Malik, and petitioner Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed have presented their arguments.
They have sought the formation of a 16-member full court as per the number of judges present in the SC in Oct 2024, when the Amendment was passed. Judges have questioned whether the CB has the power to issue orders for the constitution of a full court, as requested by petitioners.
Today’s hearing
At the outset of the hearing, petitioner Advocate Akram Sheikh brought up the matter of a “good judicial environment”.
At this, Justice Mandokhail, referring to his exchange with Justice Ayesha yesterday, said: “What happened yesterday should not have happened.”
Sheikh also urged the bench to fix a duration for lawyers to present their arguments, at which Justice Aminuddin noted that time restrictions applied to everyone.
Assuring the bench that he would conclude his arguments today, Zuberi said he would cite past court orders that define the difference between a bench and a full court.
Justice Hilali then asked whether judges will have to stop calling a full court a bench, to which Zuberi replied in the affirmative. Citing several rulings, the lawyer said constituting benches was the Practice and Procedure Committee’s power.
Zuberi reiterated that he was requesting a full court, adding, “You can [only] form a bench.”
Justice Mazhar noted that the verdicts cited by Zuberi were from before the 26th Amendment was passed, when Article 191, under which the CB was formed, was not present.
Justice Mazhar said, “The Constitutional Bench can hear the case of the 26th Amendment. If needed, all judges of the Constitutional Bench can be included.
“But you are saying that so and so judges should be part of it, and not the others, so this is strange,” he added.
Zuberi then replied that there were no restrictions on the CB forwarding the matter to the CJP. Justice Aminuddin remarked, “It is one thing to refer a matter to the chief justice, and another to pass a judicial order.”
Zuberi was then told to read out Sections 3 and 5 of the Constitution’s Article 191A. Justice Ayesha asked, “Does any rule prevent this bench from issuing a judicial order to form a full court? What is stopping us from ordering the Judicial Commission to nominate all judges as a judge of the Constitutional Bench?
“Are we saying that the Judicial Commission ranks above the Supreme Court?” she asked.
At one point during the hearing, Justice Ayesha remarked, “Does Article 191A mean that a full court can never convene now? Can decisions of a larger bench no longer be overturned?”

According to a statement by the ISPR, Afghan Taliban “resorted to cowardly attack[s] at four locations in [the] Spin Boldak area” in the early hours of Wednesday. “The attack was effectively repulsed by Pakistani forces,” the statement said.
It added that as Pakistani troops repelled the attack,15 to 20 Afghan Taliban were killed and several others were injured.
“The situation is still developing. There are reports of further buildup at staging points of Fitna-al-Khwarij and [the] Afghan Taliban,” the statement said.
Fitna-al-Khwarij is the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The ISPR said that the attack from the Afghan side was “unfortunately […] orchestrated through divided villages in the area, with no regard for [the] civil population”.
“The Afghan Taliban also destroyed the Pak-Afghan Friendship Gate on their side, which clearly displays the mindset with regard to mutual trade and easement rights of the divided tribes,” it added.
The statement by the military’s media affairs wing underlined that the incident in Balochistan was an isolated event.
“On [the] night of October 14/15, Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khwarij tried to attack Pakistani border posts in Kurram Sector in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“These attacks were effectively repulsed, causing heavy losses to Afghan posts. Eight posts, including six tanks, were destroyed in the effective yet proportionate response of Pakistani troops. Twenty-five to thirty Afghan Taliban and Fitna-al-Khwarij fighters were suspected to have been killed,” the ISPR said.
The ISPR further stated, “The insinuations that the attack was initiated by Pakistan are outrageous and blatant lies, just like the claims of capturing Pakistani posts or equipment. The propaganda of [the] Taliban regime can be debunked with basic fact checks.”
The statement also reaffirmed that the “armed forces stand resolute and fully prepared to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan. All acts of aggression against Pakistan will be responded to with full force”.
Before the ISPR’s statement today, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabiullah Mujahid also posted on social media platform X about the incident at the border in Balochistan.
He alleged that Afghan forces were “forced to retaliate” after attacks by Pakistani forces in the Spin Boldak district of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province.
Mujahid claimed that more than 12 civilians were killed and over 100 were injured in the attacks carried out by Pakistani forces with the use of “light and heavy weapons”. The Afghan government spokesperson also claimed heavy losses on the Pakistan side, including the capture of posts and weapons, as well as fatalities.
President, PM laud security forces
Following the incident in Balochistan, a statement on the PPP’s X account said President Asif Ali Zardari had “strongly condemned” the cross-border attacks from Afghanistan.
“Attacks from Afghanistan are a blatant violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty,” the statement quoted him as saying, adding that he also paid tribute to the armed forces for their “courage and professional expertise”.
The president said the Afghan Taliban government was continuously “violating” the 2020 Doha agreement — a deal signed between the US and Afghan Taliban that included guarantees from the Taliban that it would prevent militant groups from using Afghan soil to threaten the security of the US and its allies.
President Zardari accused the Afghan Taliban of “providing safe havens to Taliban terrorists”, who he said were a threat to other countries in the region. The president said such measures were destabilising the entire region, including Pakistan.
“The Afghan government is deviating from its promise to establish a broad-based representative government,” he further stated.
On the incidents along the border in Kurram and Balochistan, he said the Pakistan Army had “effectively repelled the attacks” in those areas.
He called on the Afghan authorities not to let their soil be used for terrorism and anti-Pakistan activities.
“Such attacks harm the peace and friendly relations in the region,” the president said, adding that Pakistan wanted peaceful ties based on cooperation with all its neighbours.
“Any aggression against Pakistan will be met with a strong and unequivocal response,” he asserted.
 






A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) today said premier Shehbaz Sharif had expressed concern over “incitement” by the Afghan Taliban, Fitna-al-Khwarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan (the term designated by the state for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan) at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.
He also paid tribute to the security forces for repelling the attack by the Afghan Taliban in the Kurram sector, the statement said. It further quoted the PM as observing that the Pakistan Army had given a “strong” response to the Afghan Taliban’s “unprovoked aggression”.
“National integrity will be defended at all costs. The use of Afghan soil for incidents of terrorism in Pakistan is condemnable,” he added.
Tense ties
Today’s border clash in Balochistan is the third major skirmish between Pakistan and Afghanistan within a week, following the incident in Kurram last night and earlier skirmishes that began on Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning at several locations.
According to the ISPR, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 injured in the incident that began with Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border. The military’s media affairs wing also said that credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment showed that “more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher”.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself.
The weekend clash took place against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
The issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries and the ties seem to have nose-dived with recent increase in hostilities at the border.
On Monday, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said while speaking on on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’ that there were “no ties” between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he had said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister had also said that hostilities between the two sides could resume “at any time”.

This is a developing story that is being updated as the situation evolves. Initial reports in the media can sometimes be inaccurate. We will strive to ensure timeliness and accuracy by relying on credible sources, such as concerned, qualified authorities and our staff reporters.

In the latest global ranking issued on October 7, Pa­­kistan’s travel docum­ent was placed at 103 in the list — tied with Yemen — and ranked higher than only those of Iraq (104), Syria (105) and Afghanistan (106).
Per the ranking, Pakistan and Yemen’s passports permit visa-free access to 31 countries only out of 227 travel destinations, Iraq’s allows travel to 29, Syria’s gives access to 26 destinations, and Afghanistan’s travel document only affords the bearer access to 24 destinations without a visa.
Pakistan’s passport has been declared the world’s fourth worst since at least 2021 on the Henley index, which calculates countries’ “visa-free score” — the number of destinations travellers can access without a prior visa, or with a visa on arrival.
The travel document placed 100th on the list in 2024 and 2023, 109th in 2022 when it allowed entry into 32 countries sans a prior visa, and 107th in 2021 with the same visa-free score.
 
 

The top spot yet again belonged to Singapore, as its passport provides citizens visa-free access to 193 destinations, followed closely by South Korea in second place with a visa-free score of 190, and Japan ranking third with 189 destinations its citizens can visit without a visa.
Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and Switzerland rank fourth, with visa-free access to 188 locations.
Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland and the Netherlands rank fifth with a visa-free score of 187.
Also notable was that for the first time since the Henley Passport Index was created 20 years ago, the United States has fallen out of the world’s top 10 most powerful passports.
“Once unrivalled at No.1 in 2014, the American passport has now slumped to 12th place, tied with Malaysia, with visa-free access to only 180 of 227 destinations worldwide,” Henley said in a press release.
Similarly, the British passport has slipped to its lowest-ever position on the index, dropping from sixth to eighth since July, despite also once holding the top spot in 2015.’
The United Arab Emirates’ passport, which entered the top 10 for the first time last year, hiked one spot, moving to eighth with a visa-free score of 184.
China’s passport, which ranked 59th last year with 85 destinations accessible without a visa, dropped to 64th with its visa-free score lowering to 82.</p><small>2025-10-15 10:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1515201430a9cfc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949083/apple-lobbies-india-to-change-tax-law-seen-hindering-its-expansion-report' target='_blank'><strong>Apple lobbies India to change tax law seen hindering its expansion: report</strong></a><br><p>Apple is lobbying India’s government to modify its income tax law to ensure the company is not taxed for ownership of high-end iPhone machinery it provides to its contract manufacturers, an issue seen as a hurdle to its future expansion, sources say.
The push coincides with Apple’s growing India presence as it diversifies beyond China. Counterpoint Research says iPhone’s share in the Indian market has doubled to 8 per cent since 2022. And while China still accounts for 75pc of global iPhone shipments, India’s share has quadrupled to 25pc since 2022.
India is the world’s second-largest mobile market. Apple’s contract manufacturers Foxconn and Tata have pumped in billions of dollars to open five plants, but millions of those expenses go into acquiring pricey machines for iPhone assembly.
Experts say Apple potentially faces billions of dollars in additional taxes if it changes its business practices without convincing New Delhi to change a 1961 law covering foreign ownership of equipment used in India.
 
 

In China, Apple procures the machines used to make iPhones and gives them to its contract manufacturers, and is not subject to tax even though it still owns them.
But that’s not possible in India as the Income Tax Act would consider such ownership by Apple as a so-called “business connection”, making the US firm’s iPhone profits liable for Indian taxes, said a senior government official and two other industry sources.
Apple executives have held talks with the Indian officials in recent months to tweak the law, as it fears the current legislation could hamper its future growth, said the sources.
“Contract manufacturers cannot put up money beyond a point,” said the first industry source. “If the legacy law is changed, it will become easy for Apple to expand … India can become more competitive globally.”
Reuters is the first to report Apple’s concerns and lobbying efforts on the law.
Apple did not respond to Reuters questions, and neither did India’s IT and finance ministries, which are involved in the discussions.
India cautiously reviewing Apple request
Smartphone manufacturing is a key plank of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s agenda, and India’s deputy IT minister last year privately said China and Vietnam could race ahead as major smartphone export hubs due to their lower tariffs on phone parts.
A senior Indian official said “discussions on taxation rules impacting Apple are ongoing”, but New Delhi is cautious as any changes to the law could diminish its sovereign right to tax a foreign company.
“It’s a tough call,” said the official, who highlighted that Apple’s increased investments are equally important.
“India needs investments. We have to find a solution.”
 
 

Apple has since 2023 opened a handful of directly-owned retail stores in India, though it also sells its products through online and offline distributors.
Foxconn and Tata have, over the years, invested more than $5 billion in setting up Apple manufacturing.
Specialised equipment can cost billions
One precedent of Indian law often cited by tax experts involves UK-based Formula One. India’s Supreme Court held in 2017 that even though F1 did not own a circuit near New Delhi, it was liable to pay tax on profits for the days when it exerted full control during its Grand Prix India event.
If Apple were to own machines inside Indian iPhone factories, it would amount to exerting control under current laws, experts said.
“If the activities of Apple constitute a business connection, then the global revenue may be used as a basis to compute the income attributable in India, leading to billions in tax exposure,” said Riaz Thingna, a partner at Grant Thornton Bharat LLP.
Taiwan’s Foxconn is Apple’s largest contract manufacturer in India, having shipped products worth $7.4bn this year by August, compared to $7.5bn in all of 2024, commercially available customs data shows.
 
 

The income tax law, however, does not bother Apple’s South Korean rival Samsung, as almost all of its phones are made in its own Indian factories.
The India Cellular & Electronics Association (ICEA), which backs Apple, has, in a confidential representation to the government, called for changes to the law, saying tax certainty is “paramount for businesses seeking to expand and scale.”
“Typical CMs (contract manufacturers) are unable or unwilling to invest in such large quantities of specialised equipment … The cost of the equipment can rise to billions of dollars,” ICEA said, without naming any company.
“In certain cases, [it] may also be supplied … free of cost.”</p><small>2025-10-15 10:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15145844a0a6673.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949087/suparco-to-launch-pakistans-first-hyperspectral-satellite-on-oct-19' target='_blank'><strong>Suparco to launch Pakistan’s first ‘hyperspectral satellite’ on Oct 19</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s space agency on Wednesday announced the upcoming launch of the country’s first hyperspectral satellite (HS-1) from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in China, scheduled for October 19.
Hyperspectral imaging is a type of advanced camera technology used in satellites to study the Earth and space, according to a study published in the Journal of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience. Unlike regular satellite cameras that capture only a few colours (like red, green, and blue), hyperspectral cameras capture hundreds of very narrow colour bands. This means they can detect tiny differences in light that the human eye, or even normal satellites, can’t see.
Because of this, scientists can use hyperspectral images to identify materials, detect changes in vegetation, find minerals, monitor pollution, or even study the atmosphere in much greater detail than before.
According to a statement from the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), the launch is a “landmark mission [which] represents a transformative milestone in Pakistan’s national space programme, propelling the country into a new era of advanced space-based applications in agriculture, disaster management, urban development, and environmental monitoring.”
It said that in the agriculture sector, HS-1 will enable precision farming through high-resolution hyperspectral data acquisition and calibration.
“The satellite will provide detailed insights into crop health, soil moisture, and irrigation patterns, enhancing yield estimation by 15 to 20 per cent and contributing significantly to food security,” it added.
The statement further said that the satellite’s “cutting-edge sensors” will help monitor environmental changes, map infrastructure, and assess urban growth patterns for urban development.
“By capturing unique spectral signatures of man-made structures, HS-1 will support sustainable city planning, land-use assessment, and efficient resource management,” said Suparco.
The space agency detailed that HS-1 will serve as a “vital tool” for early warning and rapid response in environmental monitoring and disaster management.
The satellite’s “advanced imaging capabilities” will aid in flood prediction, landslide tracking, and geo-hazard assessment, particularly across the Karakoram Highway and northern Pakistan, it said.
Moreover, per the statement, the satellite will also enhance post-disaster assessment, transportation network analysis, and water resource modelling, providing timely data on floods, earthquakes, deforestation, and land degradation.
The integration of HS-1 into Pakistan’s expanding remote sensing fleet, comprising PRSS-1 (launched in July 2018), EO-1 (launched in January 2025), and KS-1 (launched in July 2025), will “significantly strengthen the nation’s space-based infrastructure”, said Suparco.
“The mission aligns with the National Space Policy and Suparco’s Vision 2047, which aims to position Pakistan at the forefront of space technology and innovation for sustainable national development.”
Last month, a senior official from Suparco said the agency was integrating space-based applications into its disaster risk management framework, “paving a path anchored in science and international collaboration to better prepare for natural calamities”.
In July, the foreign ministry announced the successful launch of a remote sensing satellite from China, which aimed to “strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities”.</p><small>2025-10-15 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15143722ab1f892.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948887/time-for-reorientation' target='_blank'><strong>TIME FOR REORIENTATION</strong></a><br><p>AIR pollution in Pakistan represents a multifaceted environmental and public policy challenge, stemming from a variety of sources that collectively degrade air quality and public health across the nation.
Key contributors include vehicular emissions from an expanding fleet of ill-maintained vehicles, industrial discharges from sectors like textiles and cement, dust from construction activities and unpaved roads, emissions from brick kilns that rely on low-quality fuel, and seasonal practices such as stubble burning. These factors interact with meteorological conditions, such as temperature inversions in winter, to trap the pollutants and create dense smog layers.
 
 

Among these, stubble burning emerges as a particularly hazardous issue during the autumn months, when farmers in Punjab incinerate crop residue post-harvest, releasing vast quantities of particulate matter and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that exacerbate the already bad pollution levels.
Stubble burning is deeply intertwined with the agrarian evolution of South Asia, particularly the rice-wheat cropping system that dominates Punjab.

Time is surely up for stubble burning as a routing agricultural practice in Pakistan. However, top-down solutions are bound to fail just as they have failed every single time we have tried.

This intensive rotation with rice sown in the monsoon (June-October), followed immediately by wheat in the dry winter (November-April) has its genesis in the Green Revolution of the 1960s. High-yielding varieties promised food security, but they came with a hidden cost: shorter crop durations and mechanised harvesting that left behind tall, dense stubble residue difficult to manage manually. In Pakistan, where Punjab’s 80 per cent mechanised rice harvest mirrors India’s, farmers face a mere 15-20-day window to clear the fields for wheat sowing, lest yields plummet owing to delayed planting. Similarly, in India’s northwestern states, the same Green Revolution dynamics have led to widespread mechanisation, amplifying the regional pollution footprint.
To the farmers, burning offers a swift solution.
 


It sterilises soil against pests, releases short-term nutrients like phosphorus and potassium, and costwise it is far cheaper than other methods that add up to 30pc to labour expenses. A 2019 emission inventory spanning 2000-14 reveals how this practice scaled with agricultural intensification: annual rice residue production hit 8.5 million tonnes, with 3.6-5 million tonnes burned between October and January to expedite wheat planting. In India, parallel trends show even larger scales, with over 23 million tonnes of rice stubble burned annually in Punjab and Haryana alone, contributing significantly to transboundary emissions that drift into Pakistan’s airspace during prevailing westerly winds in autumn.
Colonial-era land policies favoured monocropping, and post-independence subsidies for water and fertilisers further cemented this trend. In south Punjab villages, a 2019 study found that 85pc of the respondents viewed burning as a cultural norm, inherited from generations who saw it as essential for survival amid labour shortages and rising input costs. Yet, as climate variability shortens monsoons and intensifies winters, what was once adaptive has become maladaptive. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) attributes 20pc of Pakistan’s air pollutants to this source, a figure that underscores how historical expediency feeds an ongoing crisis. Comparable figures in India attribute up to 30pc of Delhi’s winter PM2.5 to stubble fires from neighbouring states, highlighting the shared historical roots and cross-border ramifications of this practice.
The smoke from stubble fires does not dissipate; it infiltrates lungs, soils and skies, weaving a web of health hazards. An analysis estimates that incinerating 63 million tonnes of South Asian stubble annually results in 1.2 million tonnes of particulate matter, 0.6 million tonnes of methane, and 91 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2)-equivalents that spike PM2.5 levels by 40-60pc during harvest peaks. In Pakistan, this manifests as winter smog, where thermal inversions trap pollutants, turning Air Quality Index (AQI) in urban centres, such as Lahore and Multan, to hazardous levels and beyond. Across the border, Delhi experiences analogous spikes during the same period, as satellite data reveals plumes from Indian Punjab merging with those from Pakistani Punjab to form a regional haze.
The cost to human health is staggering. The Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) reports that crop burning shaves 4.3 years off average life expectancy in polluted hotspots, with over 20,000 premature adult deaths and 160,000 disability adjusted life years lost annually in Pakistan alone. Infants and children bear the brunt, as is evident from a study that appeared in the journal Nature. It highlights how across India and Pakistan in-utero PM2.5 exposure from stubble burning results in 24-26 additional infant deaths and 30-36 child deaths per 1,000 births. Respiratory ailments surge, while cardiovascular and neurological diseases affect thousands more. In Lahore, where 14 million residents inhale this hazardous air, hospital admissions for pollution related illnesses triple during the smog season, costing the exchequer significant sums in lost productivity. In Delhi, similar surges overwhelm healthcare systems, with studies estimating 10,000-30,000 annual deaths attributable to stubble-related pollution.
 
 

Environmentally, the fallout erodes the very foundation of our breadbasket. Burning volatilises nitrogen (75pc loss), phosphorus and sulphur, slashing soil fertility by 25-30pc and microbial diversity, which hampers water retention and increases erosion. Black carbon, the second-largest warming agent after CO2, accelerates glacial melt in the Himalayas, threatening downstream water and food security for 1.9 billion South Asians. Economically, air pollution devours 6.5pc of GDP, up to $12 billion yearly, through diseases, absenteeism and dips in crop yield owing to acid rain and ozone formation.
A bureaucrat incentive experiment, discussed in the aforementioned Nature study, serves as a caution against relying solely on command-and-control mechanisms to address the issue. Analysing 18 million grid observations (2012-22) across India and Pakistan, it found that when winds blow smoke into a particular district, officials slash fires by 10-13pc via targeted penalties. In Lahore, a similar order reduced fires by 9pc in monitored blocks, as per satellite data. Yet, spillover effects persist. The study reveals that the incidence of stubble burning rose by 15pc when winds favoured neighbours, highlighting enforcement’s jurisdictional blind spots. This transboundary dynamic is reflected in India-Pakistan interactions as well, where Indian fires increase when winds direct smoke towards Pakistan.
 
 

To effectively address the persistent challenge of stubble burning in South Asia, policymakers should prioritise a holistic environmental policy framework. Such an approach will integrate key facets of environmental communication, emphasising stakeholder engagement over reliance on traditional command-and-control measures, like bans and fines, which have not been sustainable. A communication centred approach could foster voluntary adoption by reframing the issue from a mere regulatory burden to a shared health and economic imperative. Use of vivid, localised narratives in campaigns that depict the direct impacts of smog on family health can go a long way in facilitating this. This framing could build empathy and urgency, drawing on psychological tools like future-self visualisation exercises where farmers imagine the degraded land inheritance for their children, ultimately yielding higher compliance rates than punitive measures alone. A compelling global parallel is Indonesia’s Pertamina Corporate Social Responsibility programme for peatland fires, where corporate communication reframed fire-prone practices as community threats through targeted narratives on health and economic losses.
Building on this, policy recommendations should include audience segmentation and targeting to tailor messages for diverse groups, ensuring relevance and overcoming the ‘one-size-fits-all’ pitfalls of command and-control strategies. A more holistic policy would segment communications, delivering Punjabi language podcasts on bio-decomposers to frontline farmers, workshops for community unions, and datadriven briefs for policymakers. Besides, participatory dialogue and co-design should be embedded in policy to co-create solutions with stakeholders, contrasting sharply with the top-down enforcement of measures.
Transboundary policy options are essential given the cross-border flow of pollution. Establishing a joint Pakistan-India task force under frameworks like the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) could harmonise air quality standards, share real-time satellite monitoring data on fire incidents, and co-develop incentives for alternatives to burning, such as cross-border subsidies for specific machinery.
Bilateral agreements could include mutual enforcement protocols through ‘smog diplomacy’ initiatives. Such regional approaches, supported by international bodies, would amplify national efforts and mitigate the blame-game that hinders progress.
Southeast Asia’s haze mitigation efforts offer direct lessons here. In particular, the Asean Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution (2002, revised 2014), has curbed recurrent peatland fires in Indonesia and Malaysia via regional monitoring networks, early warning systems and joint suppression teams. The result has been reduced haze episodes by up to 70pc in compliant years, and fostering trust through annual ministerial meetings and public awareness drives that depoliticise the issue.
Finally, robust evaluation and feedback loops should underpin these policies to ensure iterative improvement.
By integrating satellite verification in farmer apps, annual reports on health benefits, like reduced child mortality, and goal-setting for zero-burn villages, policies can effectively refine long-term strategies. Addressing complex environmental and public policy issues, such as air pollution, through command and control or siloed approaches has not worked. Hence, what is required is a sea change in our thinking that places collaboration before conflict and collective human wellbeing before shortsighted political goals.

Set a daunting 277-run target for victory, the visitors and World Test champions were bowled out for 183 on day four.
Man of the match Noman finished with 4-79 and 10-191 in the match for his third haul of ten wickets or more in Tests.
 






With the weary Gaddafi Stadium pitch taking sharp turn and low bounce, the 39-year-old Noman exploited the conditions well despite a stubborn 73-run stand between Dewald Brevis and Ryan Rickelton in the morning.
In all, spinners from both sides took 34 wickets, with just six going to fast bowlers.
South African left-armer Senuran Muthusamy took 11-174 in the match.
Pakistan made 378 in their first innings, with South Africa scoring 269 in reply.
On a deteriorating surface, the hosts collapsed in their second-innings 167 but
it proved enough.
On Wednesday, with the tourists 137-6 at lunch the writing was very much on the wall, then Sajid Khan dismissed Muthusamy for six soon after the break.
Pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi dismissed Kyle Verreynne (19), Prenelan Subrayen (eight) and Kagiso Rabada (nought) to finish with 4-33.
The victory gives Pakistan an ideal start to the World Test Championship, having come last in the previous edition.
The second and final Test starts in Rawalpindi from Monday.
In the morning, Brevis took the fight to the Pakistan spinners and had reached an aggressive career-best 54, with six fours and two sixes, when Noman bowled him with a sharply turning delivery.
Opener Rickleton’s dogged resistance was broken by Sajid just before lunch for a gritty 45.
Pakistan struck in the first over of the day through fast bowler Shaheen, who trapped Tony de Zorzi for 16 without any addition to the overnight total of 51-2.
Tristan Stubbs struggled to cope with the sharp turn and was on two when a premeditated reverse sweep off Noman safely landed in Salman Agha’s hands.
Brevis reached his second Test half-century with a six off Noman before becoming the spinner’s fourth victim.
Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated the team on their win — which he said was a result of teamwork — and hoped for the team’s continued success in the second Test.
“Pakistan played excellently against South Africa in every department,” Naqvi said.

It is ignored by budgets, buried under stigma, and wheeled out only for glossy, pink PR campaigns led by men in boardrooms without a single woman at the table.
At the same time, maternal mortality remains stubbornly high. Periods are treated as shameful interruptions. Cervical cancer, which can easily be caught early, is still the third most common cancer in the country.
There is every reason to be horrified — the prognosis for women’s health in Pakistan is bleak. After years of accumulating unnecessary death tolls and losing ground to misplaced public health priorities, many women have stopped waiting to be rescued. Across the country, they are taking matters into their own hands. Entrepreneurs are building homegrown solutions, designed by Pakistani women for Pakistani women — innovations forged from lived experience and sharpened against the cultural and systemic barriers that define their reality.
The superwoman
When Sadaf Altaf was a young girl, she learned the unspoken rule: don’t talk too much about periods. The topic was soaked in shame before she even understood what it meant. It’s a story far too many of us share. Sanitary pads are still being handed over in brown paper bags, and schoolgirls continue to miss classes, caught between their own unpreparedness and schools unequipped to support them. Surveys reveal the scale of this silence: nearly half of Pakistani girls had no idea what was happening when their first period arrived, and 79pc women admit they don’t even want to talk about it.
Altaf’s answer to that silence was Superwomen.pk, an e-commerce platform built around education and advocacy. One of its most striking initiatives is Pakistan’s first period comic book, tracing a girl’s journey from childhood to menopause — turning what was once a hushed subject into a story told openly. Alongside it, Superwomen runs awareness sessions in schools and offices, weaving menstrual health into everyday conversation instead of leaving it buried in embarrassment.
Her work has also meant showing up in moments of crisis. During the 2022 floods, when millions were displaced, Altaf and her team distributed thousands of sanitary pads and cotton underwear in relief camps — items rarely included in official aid lists but essential for women’s health and dignity.
For Altaf, the mission is clear: to pull menstruation out of the shadows and place it firmly alongside any other health concern. “This is my work. I need to do this,” she says, undeterred by the criticism she continues to face from friends and family.
Building local
For Madeeha Malik, the shock came in her own ancestral village. When she asked local women what they used during their periods, one replied that she relied on cow dung.
At the time, Malik was a professor of pharmacy. She resigned, emptied her savings, and set out to build what would become Fempure. Today, the company produces biodegradable sanitary pads on locally engineered machines, distributes reusable kits, and certifies workplaces as “period positive.” Its accompanying app offers education, menstrual disorder screening, and discreet product delivery.
Only 17pc of Pakistani women have access to sanitary napkins, while counterfeit and poor-quality products flood the market. Even genuine pads are still taxed as luxury items. For Malik, though, the goal was never just to put another product on the shelf. “We wanted to go from root to stem — from product quality to stigma to policy,” she said.
Bringing the test home
Menstrual health is not the only area where women are left to improvise. The same neglect is visible in how Pakistan handles diseases that are easily prevented elsewhere. Cervical cancer, for instance, is rarely fatal in countries where pap smears and the HPV vaccine are routine.
CerviTest was born out of the recognition that Pakistan needed a different approach to cervical cancer prevention. The logic is simple: if cultural barriers prevent women from visiting hospitals, the test should be brought to their homes. The kit can be collected from a pharmacy, used in private, and returned for results delivered discreetly by text.
It is not without roadblocks — rural logistics, low literacy, and strained lab capacity all pose challenges. But co-founders Bushra Zafar and Nadia Kellman argue it is a step Pakistan cannot afford to delay. “In the West, home testing is about convenience,” Kellman said. “Here, it is about life or death.”
Supporting pregnant women
When the system looks away, it is women who are left to pick up the pieces — whether it’s a late-stage diagnosis or the fog of postpartum. Goud emerged as a response to unspoken struggles of motherhood. For co-founder Ummam Baig, pregnancy itself was manageable; it was the weeks after birth that left her reeling. Postpartum depression, breastfeeding struggles, and family pressures left her feeling invisible.
Consequently, she and her co-founder Meesha Baig decided to build what was missing: a pregnancy tracker and postpartum support app tailored to Pakistan. Unlike global apps that assume nuclear families and Western lifestyles, Goud speaks to the reality of joint households, cultural taboos, and the absence of structured maternity leave.
Its WhatsApp circles connect women navigating the same stage of pregnancy or motherhood. They trade advice, vent frustrations, and validate one another’s struggles. One woman called the support “finding heaven.” Another credited the app with saving her marriage.
The model is simple: medically vetted advice, delivered with cultural sensitivity. But what it truly offers is rarer — solidarity and information in a country where both are in short supply.
Smashing the glass ceiling
What binds Superwomen, Fempure, CerviTest, and Goud is urgency. Each venture carries the imprint of lived struggle, the determination to turn personal scars into collective solutions. For years, such efforts existed in silos, each fighting for breath in a system stacked against them.
The Femtech Innovation Hub, built by the Center for Economic Research in Pakistan (CERP) with LUMS and backed by the Gates Foundation, has begun to change that story. By bringing 35 women’s health startups into a single cohort, it has unlocked mentors, pilot projects with hospitals and NGOs, and provides crucial access to policymakers. It is early work but what were once isolated fixes are now converging into a movement — one that urges entrepreneurs to think bigger and tackle problems long considered untouchable.
By meeting needs that budgets overlook and stigma suppresses, these founders are making a radical claim: women’s health is not a side note to public health, but its foundation. In Pakistan, where a woman’s body has too often been cast as a burden, they are reframing it as the country’s greatest chance at healing itself.

In a statement issued by the Sindh CM House, Shah expressed deep sorrow and grief over Durrani’s passing. Murad called Durrani “a sincere, loyal and principled leader of the party, saying he played an important role in strengthening the Sindh Assembly and stabilising democracy.
“Agha Siraj Durrani made public service the axis of his politics,” he said, expressing his condolences to the bereaved family.
“The services of the late Agha Siraj Durrani will always be remembered,” he said.
President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed “deep sorrow” over Durrani’s passing.
“The president paid tribute to his political and public services, noting his role in strengthening democracy and serving the people of Sindh,” said a post by the Presidency on social media platform X.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also paid tribute to the late Durrani for his services as the Sindh Assembly speaker, saying that his contributions to politics and public welfare would “always be remembered”, APP reported.
Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in a post on X, also expressed his sorrow at Durrani’s passing, calling him an “honourable man who stood by the PPP and the leadership during the toughest of times”.
 






National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said Durrani was a “wise and astute politician”, saying that his services for the promotion and strengthening of democracy would be remembered.
“The void created by the passing of Agha Siraj Durrani will not be filled for a long time,” Sadiq added.
 






Born in 1953, Durrani completed his matriculation from Karachi’s St. Patrick’s School in 1971, and subsequently received his Bachelor of Commerce degree from Karachi and his LLB degree from Karachi’s Sindh Muslim Law College.
 
 

Along with his older brother Agha Salahuddin, he had contested the 1985 party-less elections, held under General Ziaul Haq, from Shikarpur and lost. In 1990, he was arrested on charges of embezzlement in several cases during Nawaz Sharif’s first government and remained in jail for some time.
He had served two consecutive terms as the Sindh Assembly speaker, from 2013-2018 and from 2018-2023.</p><small>2025-10-15 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628677-imran-directs-cm-elect-afridi-to-collaborate-with-all-stakeholders-on-anti-terror-strategy' target='_blank'><strong>Imran directs CM-elect Afridi to collaborate with all stakeholders on anti-terror strategy</strong></a><br><p>

The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked with Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
After New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, Pakistan said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat, later raising the tally to seven. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after its three air bases were targeted.
However, Indian political and military leadership have continued to make aggressive statements, repeating terrorism allegations that Pakistan has repeatedly refuted.
Yesterday, Indian Army’s Director General Military Operations (DGMO) Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai claimed that the Indian Navy was fully prepared during ‘Operation Sindoor’, the term New Delhi used for its May 7 strikes on Pakistan. He further said that any further hostilities by Pakistan could have been “catastrophic for it”, Times of India reported.
Lt Gen Ghai claimed that more than 100 Pakistani soldiers were killed during the May conflict along the Line of Control, according to The Hindu. The Indian officer also reiterated India’s claim of inflicting major damage on Pakistani airbases and destroying its air assets on the ground, the report said.
Without taking any names, a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said: “The contradictions in the Indian Army presser are so evident that they should not be dignified with a response. Evidently, the Indian leadership is attempting to mould history to its liking by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts.
“It appears that [the] Indian army and the political leadership have not been able to reconcile with the idea that they have been decisively beaten in Marka-i-Haq, and that their falsehoods have been fully exposed,” it added.
 
 

The military’s media affairs wing noted with grave concern that five months after the May conflict, “in the run-up to elections in Bihar and West Bengal, Indian military leadership has started parroting the same delusional, fabricated and provocative propaganda that they regurgitate before every state election in India”.
“It is saddening to see the military leadership of a nuclear-armed country issuing irresponsible statements under immense political pressure. The lies being fed to the Indian public and international audience have turned the Indian military machine into a laughing stock,” the statement said.
The ISPR cautioned that “any professional soldier would know that unnecessary chest thumping and unwarranted statements might initiate a cycle of jingoism and lead to serious consequences for peace and stability in South Asia”.
It asserted that the world now recognised India as the “true face of cross-border terrorism and the epicentre of regional instability, bent upon adventurism and hegemonism to the detriment of its people and its neighbours”.
 
 

The ISPR stressed that the “Indian armed forces and its political masters must realise that Pakistan’s people and its armed forces are fully capable and committed to defend every inch of our territory with full resolve”.
“Every act of aggression will be dealt with a swift, resolute and intense response that will be remembered by posterity,” it said.
Last week, the military’s top brass had warned India that any “imaginary new normal” its leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.</p><small>2025-10-15 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/15092631279083b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949031/imran-says-pti-answerable-to-people-of-kp-will-never-act-against-their-interests' target='_blank'><strong>Imran says PTI answerable to people of KP, will never act against their interests</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan said on Tuesday that his party had been given a mandate by the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and would not act against their interests.
Imran’s remarks come after Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry on Friday vowed the country would not ‘mortgage’ the security of its people with any country.
He said “appeasement of terrorists and their facilitators was not and never would be a policy”, while addressing KP’s security situation in Peshawar. Responding to Imran’s call — from jail — for talks with the Afghan Taliban to end bloodshed, the DG ISPR said the state and forces would not be swayed by political distortions.
He added that no single person — “most responsible for bringing terrorism back to KP” — could dictate national security. He also cited “governance gaps” in the province’s infrastructure and counter-terror funding.
In a post on Imran’s official X account last night — which he does not operate himself — the PTI founder congratulated KP MPAs on the transition in governance after Sohail Afridi’s election as the new chief minister.
“The way members of the KP Assembly voted for my nominated chief minister, without any ifs or buts, is commendable,” he said.
He also paid tribute to outgoing Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, who resigned “not once but thrice” without any hesitation.
 






He also gave a special message to the new KP chief minister, calling him his “opening batsman” and telling him to play as such.
“The PTI is the largest political party in Pakistan. Branding people associated with the party as traitors just because they do not agree with a certain policy is an extremely dangerous act,” Imran said, calling for an end to the practice of labelling people as “anti-state”.
“As a politician, it is my right to criticise any policy that is against the interest of the people, the country’s integrity and democracy. I have and will continue to oppose every policy against national interests,” the ex-premier said.
“The PTI has been given a mandate by the people of KP and we are answerable to them, not the DG ISPR. Therefore, we will never go against the interests of the people of Pakistan and the province,” he added.
Imran asserted that he did not have an enmity with the army, saying: “The army is mine, the country is mine and its people are also mine.”
 
 

He went on to say that several members of his family were part of the armed forces, adding that he felt sorrow when soldiers were martyred while fighting against terrorism.
“But unrest still persists and our people are killed on both sides,” he said.
“History has proven that military operations alone are not the solution for terrorism. Our principled position is that military operations in KP are unacceptable because innocent people are martyred in the name of ‘collateral damage’ and are displaced from their areas,” Imran said.
“For decades, military operations are being conducted but this scourge still remains. Every year, precious blood is being spilt; sometimes army and police personnel are martyred, other times innocent civilians lose their lives in terrorist incidents,” he added.
“I have always said that in order to completely eradicate terrorism, an effective, comprehensive strategy based on political insight is needed instead of decisions taken behind closed doors,” he said. The PTI founder further said that any policy made without the input and consultation of political representatives and the KP government was unacceptable.
Imran asserted that all relevant stakeholders should be taken on board when formulating a policy against terrorism, be it local tribes in the province, the KP government, the federal government or the Afghan government.
“The issue of terrorism cannot be solved without dialogue with the Afghan government,” he said. The PTI founder then directed the new KP government to talk to relevant stakeholders and formulate an effective and comprehensive strategy against terrorism to ensure long-term peace in the province.
Imran’s statement comes after Afghan Taliban forces launched an unprovoked attack on posts situated on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. The ISPR said 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.

“You should go to KP. I will ask the Sindh chief minister to lend you his plane so you can reach KP and fulfil your constitutional and legal responsibility in accordance with the court’s order,” said the PPP chairman while addressing a seminar in Karachi.
The Peshawar High Court (PHC) directed Kundi today to administer the chief minister’s oath to Afridi tomorrow by 4pm. The court’s decision, which was reserved earlier today, came on a PTI application seeking the nomination of the assembly speaker or any other person “considered appropriate” in place of the governor to administer the oath.

In an apparent dig at the Punjab government, Bilawal stated that the PPP is competing internationally and not with any city or province of Pakistan.
Bilawal said the Khairpur Special Economic Zone, established during the tenure of former Sindh chief minister Qaim Ali Shah, had earned international recognition.
He noted that Financial Times had also included the special economic zone among the world’s leading export zones in its Global Free Zones of the Year 2025 awards.
“In the Asia-Pacific category, while the Freeport Area of Bataan was ranked first, Khairpur’s zone was named the runner-up,” he said, adding that “our competition is not with any other city or province, we are competing with the world.”
The PPP scion also noted that the success of the economic zone was not an isolated case, adding that Sindh had also led the way in introducing the concept of public-private partnerships in Pakistan, an idea first outlined in the PPP’s 1993 manifesto by Benazir Bhutto.
 






“At that time too, our competition wasn’t with any city or province in Pakistan, it was with the world. This is your success, and this is Pakistan’s success,” he added.
The PPP and PML-N were engaged in a war of words over flood relief as  Bilawal asserted that the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) was the “sole method” of providing relief to those affected by the recent floods in the country, while PML-N’s Maryam Nawaz accused his party of “politicising” the issue.
Giving further examples of the progress made in Sindh, Bilawal said the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD), which provides free treatment, performs the highest number of cardiac procedures in the world.
He added that even in the case of cancer treatment, “In this very city, we offer free cancer treatment, something that is among the costliest procedures in the world. Yet, it is available for free only here, in Karachi. This too is Pakistan’s success,” he said.
Talking about BISP, Bilawal said, “When I was the foreign minister and met leaders from various countries from Africa to Egypt and beyond, they would tell me they were replicating the BISP model,” Bilawal said.</p><small>2025-10-15 05:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1508222297b8e6c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948975/gloves-come-off-as-hearing-on-26th-amendment-turns-heated' target='_blank'><strong>Gloves come off as hearing on 26th Amendment turns heated</strong></a><br><p>• Justice Mandokhail’s observation that both amendment and SC Rules are silent on ‘full court’ stirs hornets’ nest
• Justice Hilali, attorney general advise bench not to debate internal matters in open court
ISLAMABAD: Divergent positions during the hearing of challen­ges to the 26th Amendment before the eight-judge constitutional bench on Tuesday stripped away the usual veneer of collegiality among judges, exposing simmering tensions within the Supreme Court.
At the heart of the disagreement were discussions surrounding the adoption of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, and the formation of a full court to hear the constitutional challenges.
Senior counsel Abid Shahid Zuberi, representing former presidents of the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA), argued that the full court should comprise all 16 judges who were part of the apex court when the 26th Amendment was passed by parliament.
However, members of the eight-judge bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, repeatedly questioned how they could order the formation of a full court, when neither the constitutional amendment nor the newly adopted court rules provided guidance on such a matter.
The proceedings grew heated, prompting Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan to intervene, urging the court not to air its internal judicial matters in open court.
Debate over composition
Tensions first surfaced when Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, addressing the counsel, asked him to clarify his position, since he was advocating for a full court while also insisting that it should comprise only 16 judges, even though the present strength of the Supreme Court stands at 24 judges.
“The counsel should propose a way forward — how can this bench order the constitution of a full court?” Justice Mandokhail remarked.
When Justice Ayesha A. Malik in­­terjected and recalled previous ju­­d­gements, which held that when a par­­ticular constitutional provision was under challenge, it could be disregarded until its legality was determined, Justice Mandokhail retor­t­­ed, “Let the counsel respond to the query.”
Citing the Practice and Procedure judgment, Mr Zuberi explained that the current constitutional bench comprised eight judges, while its total sanctioned strength was 15. Consequently, the right of intra-court appeal against a decision of the current bench might not be available, since at least nine different judges would be required to hear such an appeal.
Justice Malik observed that the Practice and Procedure ruling had provided a mechanism — empowering the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to decide whether to grant or deny the right of appeal. “If the Commission wishes to allow it, it can nominate additional judges to enhance the bench’s strength. And if it does not agree, the right can be withheld,” she explained.
Justice Mandokhail, however, disagreed, asserting that even if a full court of 16 judges were constituted, the right of appeal would still not apply to its decisions.
Mr Zuberi said that it had been held in the Practice and Procedure case that when the entire court sits en banc, no appeal was necessary as the collective wisdom of all judges was already represented.
Adoption of SC rules
Justice Mandokhail said both Ar­­ticle 191A of the Constitution and the Supreme Court Rules 2025 were silent on the precise composition of a full court. He noted that when the full court, on the administrative side, approved the new rules, the requirement of collective decision-making had already been fulfilled.
The observation, however, stirred controversy.
Justice Malik said no discussion had taken place when the rules were approved, rather they were adopted through circulation, and her dissenting note was on the record. She suggested that the minutes of the process be called to verify how the rules had been passed.
However, Justice Mandokhail insisted that bench formation would proceed strictly in accordance with the new rules.
 
 

Mr Zuberi referred to Order 11 of the SC Rules, arguing that the three-judge committee under the Practice and Procedure Act was responsible for constituting benches. Justice Mandokhail, however, pointed out that nowhere in the rules was it stated that benches would be formed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), adding that the rules were finalised in the presence of all 24 judges.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar agreed with Justice Malik’s observation that the rules had been app­r­oved through circulation. Justice Ma­­­ndokhail maintained that all judges had been asked to give their input. “Are you calling for the reco­rds or not?” Justice Malik asked, turning towards the head of the bench.
Sensing the growing tension, Justice Mussarat Hilali advised her colleagues to lower their voices and move forward calmly.
“This case will not proceed further until it becomes clear how the rules were adopted,” Justice Mando­khail remarked sharply. “If I am being contradicted, I will place everything before the entire nation.”
Justice Hilali replied humorously that the “entire nation” was not watching since the live-streaming of the hearing was unavailable. Justice Mazhar then instructed court staff to fix the technical fault immediately.
The tense exchanges prompted the attorney general to return to the rostrum, urging the judges to refrain from debating internal court matters in open proceedings. Later, the court staff informed the bench that live-streaming had been restored.

If approved, the IMF will provide Pakistan $1bn under its Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and $200 million under its Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF), bringing total disbursements under the two arrangements to about $3.3bn.
Last week, an IMF mission led by Iva Petrova had concluded talks with Pakistani authorities on the second review of the EFF — agreed in 2024 to shore up the economy after a severe financial crisis — and the first one for the RSF climate loan.
The mission had left Pakistan without signing a staff-level agreement. However, the Fund had said “significant progress” had been made towards reaching the deal. A day earlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb — who is currently in Washington — had expressed the hope that the agreement would be reached this week.
In a statement issued early on Wednesday by the Fund, Petrova stated that the staff-level agreement remained subject to approval by the IMF Executive Board.
“Supported by the EFF, Pakistan’s economic programme is entrenching macroeconomic stability and rebuilding market confidence,” she said.
“The recovery remains on track, with the FY25 current account recording a surplus — the first in 14 years, the fiscal primary balance surpassing the programme target, inflation remaining contained, external buffers strengthening, and financial conditions improving as sovereign spreads have narrowed significantly,” she said.
However, the IMF official added, the recent floods had weighed on the country’s outlook, particularly of the agriculture sector, bringing down the projected FY26 gross domestic product (GDP) to about 3.25-3.5 per cent.
“The floods underscore Pakistan’s high vulnerability to natural disasters and substantial climate-related risks, and the continuing need to build climate resilience,” Petrova said.
She also said that the Fund wanted to express its sympathy to those affected by the recent floods, adding that it was “grateful to the Pakistani authorities, private sector, and development partners for many fruitful discussions and their hospitality throughout this mission”.
‘Pakistan reaffirmed commitment to maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing reforms’
The IMF official also noted progress on Pakistan’s policy priorities, saying: “The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to the EFF and RSF-supported programmes, and to maintaining sound and prudent macroeconomic policies while advancing ongoing structural reforms.”
She said that authorities remained committed to meeting the FY26 budget primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP, anchored in sustained efforts to mobilise revenue through tax policy and compliance measures, and “stand ready to take necessary actions should revenue shortfalls risk program targets”.
“At the same time, the authorities are assessing the flood damage and are providing urgent flood relief support in the affected provinces via reallocations in the provincial and federal budgets,” Petrova said.
She also noted that social protection remained a key pillar of the EFF-supported programme and authorities were working on enhancing the generosity, coverage and administrative capacity of the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).
“They are also committed to scaling up non-BISP health and education spending at both the federal and provincial levels to support inclusive growth and safeguard vulnerable populations,” she said.
She further said that efforts were underway to enhance revenue mobilisation, broaden burden-sharing between federal and provincial governments, and strengthen public financial management.
“In particular, recognising the provinces’ vital role in domestic revenue mobilisation, the federal authorities will continue deepening collaboration with provincial counterparts.
“The authorities are also making important progress in strengthening tax policy design, with the newly established tax policy office, which will lead medium-term reforms to simplify the tax code and reduce reliance on ad hoc measures,” she said.
The IMF official noted that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was committed to a prudent monetary policy stance, guided by incoming data, including the impact of recent floods and the evolving economic recovery, to ensure inflation remains durably within its target range of five to seven per cent.
“While the floods are likely to have a temporary impact on prices, the SBP stands ready to adjust its policy stance should price pressures intensify or inflation expectations become unanchored. While the sustained buildup of international reserves is welcome, further steps are needed to deepen the foreign exchange market to facilitate transactions, support price discovery, and cushion external shocks,” she said.
On the issue of circular debt, she said that Pakistan remained committed to preventing its accumulation through timely tariff adjustments that ensure cost recovery and maintaining a progressive tariff structure.
“Structural reforms continue to focus on enhancing the performance, efficiency, and governance of distribution companies, including through privatisation; upgrading the transmission system; privatising inefficient generation companies; and completing the transition to a competitive electricity market,” Petrova said.
She further said that authorities were making progress in delivering structural reforms aimed at boosting productivity, strengthening governance, and improving the business environment to support private sector development.
“Further effort is needed to advance the state-owned enterprise reform agenda and scale back the state’s footprint in the economy. The authorities are also planning reforms to reduce government intervention in commodity markets to foster a productive, diversified, and internationally competitive agricultural sector that meets food security needs. Efforts to boost international trade continue, including with the implementation of the new national tariff policy,” she said.
Petrova went on to say that the recent floods and those of 2022 had underscored the need for building Pakistan’s climate resilience.
“Policies supported by the RSF and aligned with national commitments are helping to strengthen resilience, including recently implemented reforms to promote green mobility and transport decarbonisation,” she noted.
“The authorities remain committed to advancing future reforms, including strengthening the climate information architecture and financial risk management, improving water system resilience, establishing a framework for coordinated disaster risk financing, and aligning energy sector reforms with national mitigation commitments,” she added.</p><small>2025-10-15 04:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/68eebcd761a3b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948940/transgender-community-decries-police-led-evictions-in-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Transgender community decries ‘police-led evictions’ in KP</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Leaders of transgender persons on Tuesday accused the police of evicting their community members from various districts of the province.
They also complained about the police’s failure to act against extortionists, kidnappers and the killers of transgender persons across the province.
Addressing a press conference at Peshawar Press Club, Transgender Community Organisation president Farzana Riaz condemned “persecution” of her community.
Accompanied by vice president of the organisation Mahi Gul, she said that despite numerous appeals for justice, the killers, extortionists and kidnappers of transgender persons were roaming free, often under police protection, but the police were busy evicting her community members from their homes.

Complains about lack of action against kidnappers, killers of its members

“Transgender persons have repeatedly been targeted with death threats and extortion calls, and those who refused to pay were killed.
“We are not asking for charity or police ration packages; we are demanding our legitimate right to live,” she said.
Farzana Riaz lamented that despite court cases, police officers and influential people had joined hands to forcibly remove transgender persons from Swabi, Nowshera, Charsadda and other areas in the province.
“It seems as we are citizens of an enemy country, so we’re being treated like that,” she said.
The organisation leader said when her community’s members approached the relevant government offices for support, they’re turned away.
She, however, said the Peshawar High Court heard the community’s plea and stopped forced evictions.
“The court had sought an explanation from the provincial inspector general of police and the capital city police officer but the latter have yet to submit a response despite multiple hearings, with the court granting them time until November 4,” she said.
According to Farzana Riaz, police officials in multiple districts held meetings with local elders and clerics, encouraging them to drive transgender persons out of their communities.
“In places like Swabi, transgender women such as Naseema were given 15 days to leave their homes and were physically assaulted before being expelled,” she said.
 
 

She said such incidents were reported in Charsadda, Mingora, Haripur, Buner and Nowshera as well.
Farzana Riaz alleged that police often demanded participation in their events or private functions, and those who refused faced harassment and eviction.
 
 

“We approached every institution but justice remains elusive,” she said.
Farzana Riaz complained that six years ago, the PTI government announced special hospital wards for transgender persons but they continued to be examined in general wards for men.
She added that the government didn’t keep its promise of providing jobs to her community on the pretext of data unavailability.
Mahi Gul said that the Peshawar High Court had ordered police not to evict any transgender person and ensure their basic human rights.
“We only seek dignity and humanity,” she said.
She condemned announcements from mosques for targeting transgender persons.
Mahi Gul said her community helped police eliminate drug trafficking and other crimes but even then, it was subjected to eviction.
She demanded intervention of the provincial police chief to check violation of her community’s rights in Swabi and Nowshera.

PHC Chief Justice (CJ) S.M. Attique Shah issued the directive, further instructing that KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati should administer the oath if the governor did not.
The court’s decision, which was reserved earlier today, came on a PTI application seeking the nomination of the assembly speaker or any other person “considered appropriate” in place of the governor to administer the oath to Afridi.
Afridi’s election on Monday was held amid uncertainty about the status of Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation from the provincial chief executive’s position. The two resignations submitted to KP Governor Kundi by Gandapur — who is also from the PTI and stepped down on party founder Imran Khan’s directive — have been returned over “disparate signatures”.
 
 

But, the PTI maintains that a chief minister’s resignation does not require the governor’s approval under the Constitution. With this contention, the party elected Afridi in a session boycotted by the opposition.
The same day, in a pre-emptive move, it approached the PHC with the request pertaining to Afridi’s oath-taking.
In its written order on the application released today, the court noted that Gandapur had “unequivocally affirmed” on the floor of the provincial assembly that he had tendered his resignation on Oct 8. “In light of the certified copy of the transcript of the speech, […] it is manifest that the office of the chief minister stood vacated with effect from” Oct 8, the order stated.
It further said that consequently, a new chief minister was elected in accordance with the procedure laid down in the Constitution.
Citing Article 130(5) of the Constitution, the court observed that it required a newly elected CM to be sworn in by the governor before assuming office.
“Correspondingly, it is the constitutional obligation of the worthy governor to administer the oath of office to the newly elected chief minister without delay or obstruction.
“Certainly, upon his failure to administer oath to the newly elected chief minister within a reasonable time, it would be construed that such circumstances have arisen rendering the administering of oath to the newly [elected] chief minister impracticable in terms of Article 255 of the Constitution,” the order read.
It further stated that keeping in view the assurance given by Additional Attorney General (AAG) Sanaullah, who was representing the governor, the court expected that Kundi “shall fulfil his constitutional obligations” and administer the oath to Afridi in accordance with the Constitution without further delay.
“This forum further trusts that no impediment shall be caused in the administration of oath, and that the process will be completed without any further delay.”
It added that if the governor failed to administer the oath to the CM-elect by 4pm tomorrow, in terms of the authority conferred under Article 255(2) of the Constitution, the PHC chief justice was nominating the KP Assembly speaker to administer the oath to Afridi tomorrow.
“This direction is issued to uphold the sanctity of the Constitution, to ensure continuity in governance, and to prevent the constitutional vaccuum in the Province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the order said.
Court proceedings
The court had directed AAG Sanaullah yesterday to confirm whether the KP governor had received the summary related to Afridi’s oath-taking from the assembly secretariat and submit a reply today.
The AAG informed the court today that the governor was out of city. He said the governor had told him that his flight to Peshawar was scheduled for tomorrow. “He said he does not have a private plane […] and the provincial government could send him helicopter to arrive in the city today.”
Moreover, the advocate general requested the court to nominate a person to swear Afridi in and ensure that the oath-taking took place today.
Counsel for the PTI Salman Akram Raja and the KP governor’s lawyer, Amir Javed, also presented their arguments.
Raja contended that why did the governor want to verify Gandapur’s signatures. Accusing the opposition of intending to “create difficulties”, he argued that after a CM’s election, matters could not be delayed any further.
CJ Shah, who was presiding over the proceedings, observed that Article 255 of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of oath of office, had been amended to address issues as the one presently under consideration.
For his part, Kundi’s counsel Javed informed the court that he spoke to his client multiple times over the phone yesterday. The lawyer told the court that the governor stated that he would decide on Gandapur’s resignation if legal conditionalities were met.
The chief justice then enquired whether the opposition parties had not participated in the election. He observed that the opposition had boycotted the election at the last minute.
Javed requested the court to wait until 3pm tomorrow on the matter.
At that, the PHC CJ observed that under Article 255, a chief minister’s resignation did not require any approval.
Then, addressing Javed, he asked: “Can you guarantee that the governor will be present tomorrow and administer the oath?”
He went on to observe that the governor had raised objections over Gandapur’s signatures on his two resignation letters. “[Even though], Ali Amin Gandapur confirmed on the assembly floor that he had resigned.”
Arguing further on this, Javed cited multiple provisions from the Constitution.
He said “everything is clear” in Article 130(7), which states: “The chief minister shall hold office during the pleasure of the governor, but the governor shall not exercise his powers under this clause unless he is satisfied that the chief minister does not command the confidence of the majority of the members of the provincial assembly, in which case he shall summon the provincial assembly and require the chief minister to obtain a vote of confidence from the assembly.”
Moreover, he said the governor’s powers were also made clear in Article 48 (president to act on advice, etc.).
He assured the court that the governor would make a decision tomorrow in accordance with the Constitution.
At that, the CJ asked, “Who is running the province at the moment?”
He also enquired whether the election schedule for the CM’s post had been challenged.
Saturday and Sunday were off days for the court, which was why the schedule wasn’t challenged, Javed replied.
Eventually, the court reserved its decision on the matter and later ruled that the KP governor should administer the oath to Afridi by 4pm tomorrow.
Kundi says never refused to administer oath
Following the court’s decision, Kundi said while speaking to the media in Karachi that he had been saying he would abide by the Constitution. “I never said that I would not administer the oath,” he added.
Kundi said he was in Karachi on an official engagement, and “as governors don’t have special planes, I have requested the [Sindh] chief minister for one.”
Asked whether he would reach Peshawar tonight, he replied: “God willing, I will reach any time tonight.”
PTI hails ‘great news’
Meanwhile, PTI leaders hailed the court decision, with party Chairperson Barrister Gohar Ali terming it “great news from [the] judiciary”.
In a post on X, he expressed the hope that the transition would be completed tomorrow and the new KP government would “stay focused on public issues”.
 






Speaking to the media outside Adiala Jail, he said the chief minister’s election was a democratic process and the PTI’s mandate in KP should be respected with the process completed smoothly.
He said the PTI delegation met Imran for the first time since the transition in KP, adding that the PTI founder appreciated the fact that everyone showed unity throughout the process.
PTI MNA Asad Qaiser said every child in the province knew the chief minister’s election was in accordance with the law and the Constitution.
“In the current situation, we want everyone to move forward together, but if someone thinks that they will snatch our mandate from us, it would be their wishful thinking,” he said on X. “No matter how much they try, they cannot break a single worker of Imran Khan.”
 






Speaking to the media outside the PHC, he said democracy and the law had won today.
He thanked the PHC chief justice for serving “justice”, saying that if the courts would issue rulings with such “courage”, the entire nation would stand with them.
 






Plea filed in PHC against chief minister’s election
Earlier today, JUI-F leader Maulana Lutfur Rehman also filed a petition in the PHC, requesting that the election of Afridi as the KP chief minister be “set aside” and declared null and void.
Rehman was one of the four people in the race for the KP CM office, along with Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, and Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP and PTI’s Afridi.
In a petition filed today, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Rehman named six respondents, including the KP government, Governor Kundi, the KP Assembly through Speaker Swati, the secretary of the provincial assembly, Gandapur and Afridi.
In his petition, he requested the court to set aside the election and declare it “ab initio void” as the it was “wholly unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, without jurisdiction, coram non judice.”
Rehman questioned how an election could be held if Gandapur’s resignation had not yet been accepted. Citing Article 130(8) of the Constitution, he stressed that elections for the post can not be held unless it was vacant.
Article 130(8) states that “the Chief Minister may, by writing under his hand addressed to the governor, resign his office”, and is the same clause that the PTI has been citing to contend that the CM’s resignation does not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
Rehman’s petition further asked the court to declare decisions taken by the assembly and the speaker with regard to the chief minister appointment as “without lawful authority, void, and of no legal effect.”
 


The petition further urged the court to “declare all consequential notifications and actions, including the impugned notification, as illegal, arbitrary, capricious, without jurisdiction and having no legal effect.”
Rehman requested the court to halt any further proceedings in the matter until the governor had “lawfully received and verified” the resignation of Gandapur.
The petition called for a fresh election “in accordance with the Constitution and the assembly rules, after lawful confirmation of vacancy.”
It concluded by requesting the PHC to suspend the election result in order to “prevent chaos and ensure preservation of the rule of law.”
Speaking to the media outside the court, Rehman reiterated the opposition’s stance over the validity of the elections.
“We said this yesterday as well that the former chief minister’s resignation has not been accepted yet, and the governor has summoned him on Oct 15.
“Until the seat becomes vacant, the election can not be held,” he said.
Responding to a question that why the opposition chose to field candidates for the CM election if it believed the election was not in line with the law, he said, “At first, we were under the impression that the resignation had been finalised, but then the governor’s letter came to light, detailing that the resignation had not yet been finalised.”
From resignation to election
Prior to the PHC’s decision today, the barely two-year-old KP Assembly seemed to be facing a constitutional crisis, which originated from events following Imran’s decision on October 8 to change the command at the helm in the province.
 
 

In line with his directive, Gandapur resigned from his role on Oct 8 while the party’s general secretary confirmed that the party had picked Afridi as his potential replacement.
The resignation letter, shared by Gandapur on X, was typed on his official letterhead and signed at the bottom. However, this initial resignation letter had apparently gotten lost in red tape, with the Governor’s House initially denying ever receiving it.
But, a copy of the letter seen by Dawn showed that it was received by the governor’s staff.
Subsequently, Gandapur sent another handwritten resignation to the governor, which was acknowledged by Kundi on Oct 11. He said in a post on X that the Governor House had received a handwritten resignation letter from Gandapur. “After thorough scrutiny and legal formalities as per the constitution [and] relevant laws, subject resignation will be processed in due course of time,” he added.
Late at night the next day, Governor Kundi returned the two letters submitted by Gandapur over “disparate signatures” and summoned him on October 15 (tomorrow) to settle the matter.
For his part, Gandapur responded to Kundi’s post on X, stating: “Finally, the resignation submitted on October 8, previously denied by the Governor Office, also acknowledged.”
He further said that both resignations submitted by him bore his “authentic signatures”.
By that time, Swati had already convened an assembly session to elect a new leader of the house. And the PTI maintained that under Article 130(8) of the Constitution, a chief minister’s resignation did not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.
The opposition, however, disagreed and walked out of the session held for the CM election yesterday. Following its boycott, candidates fielded by the JUI-F, the PPP and the PML-N recieved zero votes while Afridi won the race with 90.</p><small>2025-10-15 03:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/1508155051e81d4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949000/ajk-information-minister-pir-mazhar-saeed-resigns-from-cabinet' target='_blank'><strong>AJK information minister Pir Mazhar Saeed resigns from cabinet</strong></a><br><p>MUZAFFARABAD: A cabinet member in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) on Tuesday announced that he had resigned from his position, citing “some unavoidable reasons”.
Pir Mazhar Saeed, the minister for information in the Chaudhry Anwar­­ul Haq-led coalition government, also shared a copy of his handwritten resignation letter addressed to the prime minister during a press conference at the Press Information Department. He was flanked by PID directors Am­­­jad Hussain Minhas and Mirza Bashir.
The outgoing minister expressed gratitude to the media fraternity acr­oss the state for extending full cooperation during his tenure. He asserted that he had made every possible effo­­rt to discharge his duties in accordance with national priorities and public interest.
“Despite numerous challenges, I st­­rived to make the Information Dep­a­rtment active and effective,” he said. “Whether it was the Bunyan al-Marsous issue or last November’s campa­ign (by a civil society alliance), we suc­­ceeded on every front by the grace of Allah.”

Pir Mazhar Saeed cites ‘some unavoidable reasons’ for the decision

He said that during his tenure he not only worked on internal fronts but also highlighted the Kashmir issue at the international level. “I presented the case of both Gaza and Kashmir before audiences in 45 countries and also participated in the Global Samud Flotilla, where I raised my voice for the people of Gaza,” he said.
He also thanked officers and staff of PID for their cooperation throughout his tenure, adding that several important initiatives had been achieved through the teamwork. He said his decision to step down was personal and made after due consideration, but vowed to continue his efforts for the national interest and public service in future.
Mr Saeed was elected by PTI lawmakers against a special Legislative Assembly seat reserved for religious scholars. When the PTI government plunged into crisis following the disqualification of then-prime minister Sardar Tanveer Ilyas in April 2023, he joined the party’s so-called forward bloc.
In May last year, he was inducted into the cabinet as minister for information after serving as chairman of the prime minister’s inspection and implementation commission.
Recently, a seven-member federal negotiating committee had signed an agreement with the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee, which, among other things, pledged to reduce the size of the AJK cabinet from 36 to 20 members as part of steps to curb “elite privileges”.
Rumours are also rife that Mr Haq may be replaced by a PPP lawmaker with the support of the PML-N.
It was being speculated that Mr Saeed resigned in anticipation of a possible change in the government or a downsizing of the cabinet. Though he arrived at the press conference in a private car, there was no immediate word from the government regarding the acceptance of his resignation.
However, a senior official at the Prime Minister’s Office told Dawn that the resignation had been “received but not yet accepted”.

• Anti-terrorism court issues non-bailable arrest warrant for Aleema Khan
ISLAMABAD: The legal team of former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi is likely to conclude its final arguments before the Special Court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) in the Toshakhana case related to the alleged unlawful retention of a Bulgari jewellery set, after the prosecution wrapped up its arguments on Tuesday.
Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand resumed the hearing at Adiala jail, where Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi and defence counsel Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry were present.
Special Prosecutor Syed Zulfiqar Abbas Naqvi and Barrister Umair Majeed completed the prosecution’s final arguments following the recording of statements by the PTI founder and his wife under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The court adjourned the proceedings till Wednesday (today), when lead counsel Barrister Salman Safdar is expected to conclude the defence’s arguments. The prosecution may then seek brief time for a rebuttal, after which the court could either reserve or announce its verdict.
Earlier, the prosecution had closed its evidence after presenting 20 witnesses, including the PTI founder’s former military secretary, whose testimony was described as “damaging”. The court later summoned Mr Khan and his wife to record their statements before the conclusion of proceedings.
The case concerns the alleged unlawful retention of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set — comprising a necklace, earrings, bracelets and rings — reportedly gifted by the Saudi royal family. The couple allegedly acquired the set at a nominal price, causing a loss to the national exchequer.
According to the prosecution, the jewellery set, valued at around Rs80 million, was retained after paying only Rs2.9m. The former military secretary testified that Mr Khan had instructed him not to deposit the set in Toshakhana, in violation of official rules.
During his statement under Section 342, Mr Khan had denied all allegations, terming the case “fabricated, malicious, and politically engineered” to disqualify him from politics. He said the case was politically motivated and violated due process.
Mr Khan argued that he did not qualify as a “public servant” under the Pakistan Penal Code and maintained that even as prime minister, he was unaware of the specific details of the gift, which he claimed was presented to his wife. He said the jewellery set was lawfully retained under the Toshakhana Policy 2018 after proper valuation and payment.
Rejecting allegations of undervaluation, he said neither he nor his wife had influenced any official appraiser and described prosecution witnesses — including former comptroller Syed Inamullah Shah and appraiser Sohaib Abbasi — as “unreliable and politically compromised”.
Mr Khan also challenged the jurisdiction of both NAB and the FIA, asserting that the investigation was “extra-legal” and that the FIA had acted merely as a conduit for NAB. He questioned the admissibility of evidence obtained from abroad, including from Bulgari Italy.
In her separate statement, Bushra Bibi also pleaded not guilty, denying charges of illegal retention and undervaluation of the same jewellery set. She said the gift was declared, assessed, and retained according to Toshakhana rules. She too challenged the jurisdiction of NAB and FIA and termed the proceedings “political victimisation”.
Arrest warrant
Meanwhile, the Special Anti-Terrorism Court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Imran Khan’s sister, Aleema Khanum, in the Nov 26 protest case registered at the Sadiqabad police station.
The court noted that Ms Khanum had failed to appear twice and directed the Sadiqabad police to arrest and produce her before the court by Wednesday. The court rejected her counsel’s plea for exemption from personal appearance, observing that Ms Khanum was to be charged with criminal offences in connection with the protest.

• Global growth forecast to slow to 3.2pc in 2025, 3.1pc in 2026
ISLAMABAD: Without accounting for the yet-to-be-finalised losses from the recent floods, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday estimated Pakistan’s economic growth rate at 3.6 per cent for the current fiscal year, along with higher inflation and widening current account deficit.
The Fund’s growth projection — following its recent two-week review of Pakistan’s economy — is notably higher than the 2.6pc GDP growth and 7.2pc inflation projected by the World Bank earlier this month, which were based on its own estimates of flood-related damages.
In its flagship World Economic Outlook (October 2025) report, released at the outset of the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank, the international lender projected global economic growth to slow from 3.3pc in 2024 to 3.2pc in 2025 and 3.1pc in 2026. While this represents an improvement over the IMF’s July estimates, it remains 0.2 percentage point below the forecast made in October last year — before the recent shifts in global trade policies. “On an end-of-year basis, global growth is projected to slow down from 3.6pc in 2024 to 2.6pc in 2025,” the report stated.
The IMF projected Pakistan’s CPI-based average inflation rate to rise to 6pc this year from 4.5pc last year, and the current account balance to shift from a 0.5pc surplus last year to a 0.4pc deficit next year. However, the Fund clarified that its projections “do not yet reflect the impact of flooding in summer 2025, whose impact is still being assessed”, making the estimates tentative.
World trade volume
The WEO forecast growth of about 1.5pc for advanced economies in 2025-26, with the United States slowing to 2pc, while emerging market and developing economies are expected to moderate to just above 4pc. Global inflation is projected to decline to 4.2pc in 2025 and further to 3.7pc in 2026.
The world trade volume is forecast to grow at an average rate of 2.9pc in 2025-26, boosted by front-loading in 2025 but still slower than the 3.5pc growth rate in 2024, as persistent trade fragmentation continues to limit gains.
“Risks to the outlook remain tilted to the downside,” the IMF said, warning that prolonged policy uncertainty could dampen consumption and investment. It said further escalation of protectionist measures, including non-tariff barriers, could suppress investment, disrupt supply chains, and stifle productivity growth.
The report also highlighted that larger-than-expected shocks to labour supply — particularly from restrictive immigration policies — could reduce growth, especially in economies facing ageing populations and skill shortages. Fiscal vulnerabilities and financial market fragilities could interact with rising borrowing costs, increasing rollover risks for sovereigns.
The IMF also noted that an abrupt repricing of tech stocks could be triggered by disappointing results in earnings and productivity gains related to artificial intelligence, potentially marking an end to the AI-driven investment boom.
 
 

The Fund advised member countries to address strains on public finances.
“With lower growth prospects, higher real interest rates, elevated debt levels, and new spending needs — such as defence and national security — the fiscal equation is becoming more challenging to solve and leaves countries vulnerable should a large external shock occur,” the IMF warned.
Reduced aid flows
It added that low-income countries were even more vulnerable due to reduced official aid flows. For a growing number of nations, the lack of job opportunities could quickly lead to rising social unrest, particularly among unemployed and disenfranchised youth. The WEO also noted mounting pressure on policy institutions such as central banks — including in Pakistan.
“Should these pressures succeed, many of the hard-won credibility gains achieved in policymaking over many decades could be lost,” it cautioned. “Trust in central banks and in their ability to deliver price stability allows inflation expectations to remain well anchored, even when the economy is hit by large shocks such as during the recent cost-of-living crisis.”
The IMF advised that policies should aim to restore confidence and predictability, stabilise trade relations, reduce uncertainty, and rebuild fiscal space credibly. Monetary policy, it said, should remain independent yet transparent, with a key objective of maintaining price stability.
Over the longer term, the Fund emphasised that economies should invest in innovation, productivity, and multilateral cooperation, empowering private enterprise and favouring broad-based policies such as education, infrastructure, and smart regulation over costly sectoral subsidies.

• European and Arab nations, Canada and US appear willing to help fund $70bn reconstruction plan, says UN
JERUSALEM: Israel will only allow half the agreed number of aid trucks into Gaza starting Wednes­day, in a setback to hopes food and supplies would be quickly ramped up to ease famine in the enclave.
COGAT, the Israeli military arm that oversees aid flows into Gaza, also notified the UN that no fuel or gas will be allowed into the enclave except for specific needs related to humanitarian infrastructure.
It blamed Hamas for the slow release of deceased prisoners’ bodies for the decision to limit aid trucks, but the group maintains that locating the bodies is difficult.
 
 

So far, Hamas has handed over four coffins of dead hostages, leaving at least 23 presumed dead and one unaccounted for still in Gaza. The group informed mediators it will begin transferring four more bodies to Israel later on Tuesday.
Tel Aviv has also delayed plans to open the southern Rafah border crossing to Egypt.
“We are still witnessing only few trucks coming in, and large crowds approaching these trucks in a way that does absolutely not conform to humanitarian standards,” ICRC spo­­kesperson Christian Cardon told reporters in Geneva on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Hamas tightened its grip on Gaza’s ruined cities, launching a crackdown and executing alleged collaborators, even as President Donald Trump warned that Hamas will be disarmed, even if it means violence.
A Palestinian security source in Gaza told AFP that Hamas’s security body, a recently established unit whose name translates as “Deterrence Force”, was conducting “ongoing field operations to ensure security and stability”.
“Our message is clear: There will be no place for outlaws or those who threaten the security of citizens,” he said.
 
 

For many Palestinians rebuilding their homes and lives Tuesday amid Gaza’s rubble, the sight of Hamas patrols was reassuring.
“After the war ended and the police spread out in the streets, we started to feel safe,” said 34-year-old Abu Fadi Al-Banna, in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza.
“They began organising traffic and clearing the markets, removing the street vendors who were blocking the roads. We felt protected from thugs and thieves.”
Separately, European and Arab nations, Canada and the US appear willing to contribute to the estimated $70 billion needed to rebuild Gaza, a UN official said on Tuesday, adding that the two-year war there had produced rubble equal to 13 times the pyramids of Giza.“We’ve heard very positive news from a number of our partners, including European partners… Canada” regarding their willingness to help, he told a press conference, adding that there were also discussions with the US.

• FIA says outfit’s financiers will be placed on stop list
• Punjab police register over 20 FIRs against TLP leadership, say Rizvi escaped during crackdown
• Mufti Muneeb, HRCP call for probe into ‘excessive force’ against protesters
LAHORE: The authorities have launched a money-laundering investigation against Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan chief Saad Rizvi after “huge sums” of foreign currency were allegedly recovered from his residence in Lahore during a raid by the law enforcement agencies.
The Punjab police said the raid was conducted by the provincial police, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), adding that all items, including the gold ornaments, were confiscated. The raid at the residence of the TLP chief came after the crackdown on the outfit’s march on Sunday night. Police said Mr Rizvi had escaped during the crackdown in Muridke.
A senior police official said the law enforcers were shocked to find such a large amount of foreign currency, gold, and silver at the residence, as the TLP chief did not run any business before the formation of the radical outfit.
In light of these findings, the authorities expanded the scope of their investigation to acquire details of bank accounts operated by the TLP chief, his son, and other family members to assess the total movable and immovable assets he had obtained under the TLP banner.
The total currency allegedly recovered from the residence amounted to Rs110 million, including 50,000 Indian rupees.
In a separate statement, the FIA said it has initiated legal and financial actions against a religious group involved in anti-state protests and violent activities, adding that the accounts and assets of several important officials and workers of the religious group were being examined based on evidence.
According to the statement, “The FIA has frozen several bank accounts that were allegedly being used to fund violent protests.” Similarly, key individuals involved in fundin­g the TLP were being placed on the stop list.
TLP headquarters ‘no-go’ area
According to a police official, who shared initial findings with Dawn, the TLP purcha­sed dozens of properties in the vicinity of its headquarters — the hub of its activities — on Multan Road, making it a ‘no-go area’ for the LEAs and the general public. He said that the TLP chief had created a team of his loyal extremists and accommodated them by purchasing various houses at throwaway prices.
 
 

“Several streets connected to the TLP’s main office have become a hub of the organisation’s trusted workers/supporters,” he said, adding that a separate team of the TLP was provided an office equipped with the latest gadgets to run and handle social and regular media campaigns. He said a dedicated team of highly trained activists was made available by the TLP to respond quickly to police operations. The Punjab police officially shared the detailed inventory of recovered valuables from the TLP chief’s residence.
They included 1.92kg of gold, 898g of silver, 69 branded wristwatches, 28 gold bangles weighing 445g, 12 bracelets (490g), 24 necklaces, chains, and lockets, and 46 gold rings (355g). Similarly, the raiding team also recovered one silver crown and 32 silver rings from the house.
22 FIRs against TLP
On the other hand, the Punjab police lodged at least 22 FIRs against TLP chief Saad Rizvi and his violent supporters across the province on various serious offences. In the primary FIR, Muridke police booked over 300 suspects on serious charges, ranging from terrorism to murder.
Besides Mr Rizvi, his brother Anas Rizvi and many central leaders were also booked for inciting hate and instigating workers to raise anti-state slogans. The FIR said Ins­p­e­ctor Shahzad Nawaaz was allegedly kidna­p­ped and thrashed by a TLP mob, leaving him injured. It also accused Saad Rizvi of shooting the inspector in his abdomen, leaving him critically injured. The police officer later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital.
 
 

It said that the TLP mob attacked the policemen with clubs, iron rods and sharp-edged weapons containing nails and injured several, adding that the TLP supporters were armed with lethal weapons and they opened indiscriminate fire at policemen, injuring many of them.
As per the reports, the Pakpattan, Sahiwal, and Chichawatni police lodged three cases against Mr Rizvi, his supporters and workers under the anti-terrorism law and other offences. Another FIR alleged that Mr Rizvi’s speech, broadcast live via social media from Burawla Chowk, incited his followers to block roads, shut down markets, block traffic, and disrupt public order.
Separately, the Gujrat police also booked at least 120 TLP activists on terrorism char­ges. The FIR was lodged with the Reh­m­ania police on the report of SI Aftab Rasool.
Calls for probe
Meanwhile, renowned cleric Mufti Mun­eebur Rehman urged the formation of a judicial commission, led by a serving superior judge, to investigate the crackdown on the TLP to disperse the protesters.
“There is a growing demand that a judge of the high court or the SC should lead a thorough and independent investigation into this heart-wrenching and brutal incident. The aim is to identify those responsible and to recommend appropriate punishments based on the findings,” he said while reading out a joint declaration issued at the conference of clerics in Karachi. He also urged the Punjab government and administrations across the province to hand over the bodies of the deceased TLP workers to their families and to cease raids on the homes of its activists.
Mufti Muneeb also urged the TLP leaders to reconsider their strategy and refrain from resorting to violence, instead focusing on securing their rightful place through the democratic parliamentary system. The Human Rights Comm­ission of Pakistan said the it was deeply concerned by the events that had unfolded since Oct 8, culminating in violent cla­shes between security forces and the TLP, causing multiple deaths and casualties among protesters and policemen.
 
 

“We are equally concerned by the lack of transparency and credible, independent infor­mation surrounding the operation, providing which was the government’s responsibility. While state authorities have neglected to address the TLP’s consistent role in promoting hate speech and inciting mob viole­nce against individuals and groups, particularly religious minorities, this does not justify the alleged use of excessive force,” it said.
Both the Constitution as well as international law mandate that security forces, even when dispersing violent assemblies, use the minimum necessary force, it said.

“Afghan Taliban and Fitna al-Khawarij opened unprovoked fire in Kurram. Pakistani Army responded with full force and intensity,” reported state broadcaster PTV News, quoting security sources on X.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
It added that Taliban regime posts suffered heavy damage and a tank caught fire after being hit, with Taliban fighters fleeing from their posts.
 






In a subsequent post, PTV said: “Another post and tank position of the Afghan Taliban destroyed in Kurram sector.’’
 






PTV added that a fourth tank position at Shamsadar post was destroyed. “There are reports of the killing of an important commander of Fitna al-Khawarij in this important operation of the Pakistan Army.’’
 






Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said that Foreign Secretary Ambassador Amna Baloch gave a ‘‘comprehensive briefing’’ to resident ambassadors in Islamabad on recent developments along the Pak-Afghan border.
‘‘She underscored Pakistan’s legitimate security concerns and its unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity and national security.’’
 






Afghan Taliban forces launched an unprovoked attack on posts situated on the Pak-Afghan border over the weekend. The Inter-Services Public Relations said 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad has not confirmed whether it was behind the air strikes but maintains that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
Islamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan, however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.
US President Donald Trump and China offered to help de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and Kabul, even as Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the environment between both countries ‘hostile’, amid lingering tensions over cross-border terrorism.
Speaking on Geo News, Asif had said a day ago that there were ‘no ties’ between Islamabad and Kabul. “It’s a stalemate right now. You can say there are no active hostilities, but the environment is hostile,” he said, adding: “There are no ties, direct or indirect, as of today”.
The minister also said that hostilities between the two sides can resume “at any time”. “We can not rule that out, but there is certainly a lull in hostilities.”
Asked if Islamabad would negotiate with Kabul, Asif replied that if Afgha­nistan wants negotiations while threatening Pakistan at the same time, “then they should act on their threats and we’ll negotiate after[wards]”. “This is a natural thing. If you are attacked, you instantly have the right to react and target wherever the attack is originating from,” the defence minister explained.</p><small>2025-10-14 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/14232100d06d3c7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948914/action-similar-to-may-9-will-be-taken-againt-tlp-talal' target='_blank'><strong>Action ‘similar to May 9’ will be taken againt TLP: Talal</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Tuesday that the government has decided to take a firm stand against the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), and that action against the protesters will be taken in a manner similar to that of May 9.
Speaking to Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, the state minister said that since the formation of the current administration under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, TLP has attempted to march on Islamabad twice.
“In every march, the government signed agreements with them; many of the terms of were not favourable for the state,” he said.
However, he added, the state has taken a decisive stance.
“We have to move forward and learn from past mistakes. We will not be blackmailed anymore. Those who bring extremism and violence into politics, whether it’s May 9, November 26, or the TLP dharnas, will not be tolerated. Action against them will be similar to what was taken after May 9,” he said, referring to the 2023 protests following Imran Khan’s arrest.
The minister maintained that the state had exhausted all peaceful options before acting against the group.
“They say no dialogue was held, but backdoor channels were open. One of Pakistan’s major political and religious leaders was involved in those talks; they embarrassed him, too. Even when they stayed for two days, they were given a way to withdraw peacefully, and women and children who had been arrested were released.”
Rejecting claims that the protests were about Gaza or Palestine, he termed the TLP’s actual demands as “shocking”.
“They wanted money, demanded government positions for their clerics, and called for the release of their members convicted in criminal cases,” he said.
He accused the group of emotionally exploiting religious sentiments and trying to weaken the state at a time when Pakistan was “fighting on both its eastern and western borders”.
“Even when Afghanistan attacked, they did not call off their sit-in,” he said.
Responding to reports that he had received over 1,700 threats online, Chaudhry said state institutions were taking legal action.
“Cybercrime, FIA, and police are all active. Around 2,800 people have been barred from travelling,” he said, warning that fake news was again being spread in a manner similar to the November 26 events.
Talal also mentioned that a large number of TLP members had been deported from Saudi Arabia for misconduct. “They are ruining the name of both the country and religion abroad,” he said.
Law enforcement agencies launched a sweeping pre-dawn operation on Monday to dismantle the religious party’s protest camp in Muridke, triggering violent clashes, widespread chaos and dozens of arrests.
The operation, which began around 3:30am, quickly spiralled into one of the most serious confrontations between police and TLP in recent months, continuing for nearly six hours.
According to officials, some 1,500 police personnel in full anti-riot gear, supported by four armoured personnel carriers and water cannons, surrounded the protest camp along the GT Road.
By morning, authorities said they had detained hundreds of demonstrators, though exact figures remained unclear.</p><small>2025-10-14 19:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/142231151c87ab8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1948908/pakistan-elected-to-unhrc-for-2026-28-term-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan elected to UNHRC for 2026-28 term: FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has been elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the 2026-2028 term, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Tuesday.
The United Nations General Assembly also announced 13 other countries for the term beginning on January 1, 2026, namely: Angola, Chile, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, India, Iraq, Italy, Mauritius, Slovenia, South Africa, United Kingdom and Viet Nam.
 






“My profound gratitude to all UN Member States for their support!” FM Dar said on X. “Pakistan’s election is a recognition of its strong credentials and contributions in strengthening the global human rights framework.”
 






 






Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to work with the international community on the basis of “TRUCE”, i.e., tolerance, respect, universality, consensus-building, and engagement.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed delight at the development, saying it reflected Pakistan’s effective and active role at the United Nations.
“We reaffirm Pakistan’s strong commitment to play an active role in the council for the promotion and protection of human rights across the globe,“ he added.

“The two countries have maintained high-level strategic mutual trust and close communication on major issues concerning each other’s common interests. From what I’ve learned, the two countries have been in communication on Pakistan-US mining cooperation,” said spokesperson Lin Jian.
US Strategic Metals, which signed a memorandum of understanding with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country, rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation, includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
Pakistan also exports nearly $1.2 billion worth of copper ore to China annually and is expanding cooperation in the mining and mineral sectors as well with the close ally. China produces over 90 per cent of the world’s processed rare earths and rare earth magnets. The 17 rare earths are vital materials in products ranging from electric vehicles to aircraft engines and military radars. Exports of 12 of them are restricted after China’s commerce ministry added five — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium — more last week, along with related materials.
Lin Jian, spokesperson of China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was asked about the mineral shipment to the US and its alleged link to China’s curbs.
He stated that Islamabad and Beijing have been in communication regarding the mining activities and “Pakistan stressed that its interactions with the US will never harm China’s interests or its cooperation with China”.
Furthermore, in an apparent reference to a photograph circulating on social media that showed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir displaying an open case containing minerals samples to US President Donald Trump, the spokesperson said: “The samples that the Pakistani leaders showed and gave to the US leader are gem ores purchased by staff in Pakistan. The reported stories that you mentioned are either misinformed or invented, or even designed to drive a wedge between China and Pakistan. They are just baseless.”
The photograph was released by the White House, after a September meeting in the US, and showed Field Marshal Munir pointing to the contents of the case and Trump looking at them.
The spokesperson said China’s recently released export control measures on related rare earth items “have nothing to do with Pakistan”.
“It is a legitimate action by the Chinese government to refine its export control system in accordance with laws and regulations. It aims to better defend world peace and regional stability and to fulfill non-proliferation and other international obligations,” he added.
He reiterated that China and Pakistan were “all-weather strategic cooperative partners” whose iron-clad friendship “has stood the test of time’’.
Last week, China expanded its export controls over rare earths and related technology in a move to further tighten its grip and dominance on the critical minerals key to the energy transition.
Five more medium to heavy rare earth elements — holmium, erbium, thulium, europium and ytterbium — and related material will be added from November 8, China’s commerce ministry said.
The rare earths will join over twenty elements and related materials already listed, in each case forcing exporters to apply to Beijing for licences before selling overseas. China has also separately banned exports of gallium, germanium and antimony to the United States.</p><small>2025-10-14 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/628605-jui-f-chief-fazl-offers-to-mediate-pak-afghan-tensions-again' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F chief Fazl offers mediation between Pakistan, Afghanistan amid tensions</strong></a><br><p>
