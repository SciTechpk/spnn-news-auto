Mr Gandapur’s petition requested that Dr Asim Yousaf, Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Samina Niazi be permitted to conduct the monthly check-ups and that the reports be submitted to the court and given to Mr Khan’s family.
It cites concerns over possible health complications for the 72-year-old founder of the party, who has reportedly lost weight during his detention.
 
 

The petition, filed through Advocate Raja Zahoorul Hassan, noted that Khan’s complete medical history is maintained at Shaukat Khanum Hospital.
It named the Punjab government, the inspector general of prisons, Adiala Jail Hospital, and Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital as respondents.

The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) along with other groups held a protest at the site of the demolished Madni mosque near Rawal Dam Chowk. The protesters also uprooted the saplings planted by the CDA on the place. The mosque had been demolished late Saturday night.
The JUI-F Member of National Assembly, Naeema Kishwar, also submitted a resolution condemning the demolition of Madni mosque.
 






Addressing the protesters, JUI-F Islamabad chapter Emir Mufti Owais Aziz announced that legal proceedings would be initiated against the demolition of the mosque. He said the government was planning to raze 50 mosques in Islamabad and vowed to resist the move.
He said the religious groups have unanimously agreed to get an FIR registered against Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and other officials under blasphemy laws.
“If the police refuse to register the case, we will consider them enemies of Islam,” Mufti Owais Aziz said, adding that razing mosques overnight was an act of hostility towards Islam.

He further said the Frontier Corps was illegally occupying greenbelts along Embassy Road and Margalla Road.
“While the mosques are being demolished in the name of beautification, no action was taken against the illegal occupation by FC on these prime roads,” he questioned.
As tension flared, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, along with commissioner Islamabad, inspector general of Islamabad police and deputy commissioner held negotiations on Sunday night with a delegation of clerics led by Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haidari. The delegation also included the leader of the Islamabad chapter of the proscribed Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan.
The statement issued by the JUI-F said it had been agreed that further progress would require 48 hours, and a final decision would be made after meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
Amid threats of violent protests by the clerics, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said spreading baseless rumours about madressahs and mosques was incorrect.
In a statement, he said the madressah located on Murree Road was relocated with the consent of its administration.
“A modern-style facility has been constructed on the new site at a cost of Rs40 million, which provided high-quality accommodation, meals and religious education to around 200 students,” the minister said in a statement.
He emphasised that any relocation of madressahs or mosques situated on greenbelts or unauthorised land would only be carried out in consultation with religious scholars and the administration.
Meanwhile, fire band cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz has issued a call for jihad and announced the launch of a civil disobedience movement against the government in response to the demolition of the mosque.
A video statement released by the Maulana showed him sitting inside Lal Masjid with a gun on his lap, hurling threats at the government.

During a debate on the law and order situation in the province with Speaker Babar Saleem Swati chairing the session, Mr Baz of the opposition Awami National Party insisted that the people displaced from his district due to a military operation against terrorismfaced multiple problems due to the government’s failure to cater for them.
He said that neither the provincial government nor the federal government had made any arrangements to meet the needs of displaced residents.
Mr Baz urged authorities to lift curfew to enable people to shift to safety.

Opposition demands end to curfew to help residents move to safety

“Almost the entire population is literally hostage to the curfew, which halted their migration. It’s astonishing why the government has imposed curfew in a situation when the people were relocating to safe areas,” he said.
The opposition lawmaker said that the displaced people were making arrangements on the self-help basis, with help coming in from some local political parties.
He complained that the government’s machinery was not visible in the critical situation. Mr Baz also said thatthe residents were struggling to move to safety due to a shortage of transport vehicles.
Mr Baz said thatthe displaced people had taken shelter in schools, while some had installed tents.
He complained that those residents lacked access to basic facilities, including food. He asked the provincial government on whose direction the curfew was imposed.
Ahmed Karim Kundi of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party said thatthe provincial government should clarify its position on the claim of interior minister Mohsin Naqvi that Chief MinisterAli Amin Gandapur was “giving extortion money”to terrorists.
“If terrorists are receiving extortion money from the chief minister, what will be the state of the common man’s security in this province?”
The opposition member said thatthe provincial government should reveal where it had utilised Rs700 billion received for fighting terrorism since 2010. He said thatthe province would getRs130 billion for the same purpose in the current financial year.
Mr Kundi said that the province’s people had lost trust in the chief minister about the law and order situation, especially in Bajaur district, as he had changed his statements about it multiple times.
“The chief minister issues one statement during meetings with those at the helm of affairs but releases another when in public,” he said.
The opposition lawmaker demanded that the chair forma house committee with representation from both treasury and opposition benches to make recommendations on the law and order situation after consulting all stakeholders.
Housing minister Dr Amjid supported the idea and said thatits recommendation should be taken up with Peshawar’s corp commander and the premier intelligence agency sector commander, who should also be called to the provincial assembly for a briefing on the security situation in the province.
Member of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-InsafMalik Adeel Iqbal said thathis party always opposed military operations in the province because it made people stand against security forces.
He said that all controversial issues should be resolved through the traditional jirga system and talks. The chair later adjourned the session untilTuesdaydue to a lack of quorum.

Pakistan’s basmati rice exports have witnessed steady growth in recent years. According to the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP), the country exported approximately 772,725 tonnes of basmati rice in FY24, generating $876.9m — up from 595,120 tonnes worth $650.4m in the previous fiscal year. The average export price per tonne also increased from $1,092.93 to $1,134.86.
Data from Volza’s Global Trade platform shows that between November 2023 and October 2024, the United States accounted for 24pc of Pakistan’s total basmati exports through 1,519 shipments. Italy and the United Kingdom followed with shares of 14pc (908 shipments) and 11pc (716 shipments), respectively.
 
 

Together, these three markets consumed nearly 49pc of Pakistan’s basmati rice exports. Pakistan currently exports basmati rice to over 110 countries, with other key destinations including Australia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Canada, the Netherlands, and Germany.

Basmati exports rose 35pc in FY24 to 772,725 tonnes, earning $876.9m

According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), rice imports in the US have grown steadily over the past three decades — from 7pc of the domestic market in 1993/94 to over 25pc by 2022/23. Over 60pc of these imports consist of aromatic varieties from Asia, mainly jasmine from Thailand and basmati from India and Pakistan.
While the US produces some aromatic rice domestically, these differ in quality and aroma from their Asian counterparts. The USDA projects continued growth in demand for aromatic rice imports in the coming years.
The tariff dispute emerged from US punitive measures targeting India’s trade and energy ties with Russia, resulting in broad tariffs on several Indian exports, including basmati rice, pharmaceuticals, and electronics. Although some sectors later received exemptions, basmati rice remained subject to the full 50pc tariff. In contrast, Pakistani basmati rice continues to face a lower tariff of 19pc, giving it a distinct pricing advantage in the US market.
Indian media reports suggest that the tariff hike could reduce India’s basmati exports to the US by 50-80pc, with prices climbing to nearly $1,800 per metric tonne. Pakistani basmati, by comparison, remains priced at around $1,450 per metric tonne, making it more competitive for US importers and retailers.
Retailers across the US are already reporting increased interest in Pakistani basmati rice. Khan Mohammed, a salesman at Super Halal grocery in Springfield, Virginia, noted: “Pakistani rice is already popular.

• World’s most populous nation is a key market for US goods
NEW DELHI: From McDonald’s and Coca-Cola to Amazon and Apple, US-based multinationals are facing calls for a boycott in India as business executives and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s supporters stoke anti-American sentiment to protest against US tariffs.
India, the world’s most populous nation, is a key market for American brands that have rapidly expanded to target a growing base of affluent consumers, many of whom remain infatuated with international labels seen as symbols of moving up in life.
India, for example, is the biggest market by users for Meta’s WhatsApp and Domino’s has more restaurants than any other brand in the country. Beverages like Pepsi and Coca-Cola often dominate store shelves, and people still queue up when a new Apple store opens or a Starbucks cafe doles out discounts.
Although there was no immediate indication of sales being hit, there’s a growing chorus both on social media and offline to buy local and ditch American products after Donald Trump imposed a 50 per cent tariff on goods from India, rattling exporters and damaging ties between New Delhi and Washington.
McDonald’s, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Apple did not immediately respond to Reuters queries.
Manish Chowdhary, co-founder of India’s Wow Skin Science, took to LinkedIn with a video message urging support for farmers and startups to make “Made in India” a “global obsession,” and to learn from South Korea whose food and beauty products are famous worldwide.
“We have lined up for products from thousands of miles away. We have proudly spent on brands that we don’t own, while our own makers fight for attention in their own country,” he said.
Rahm Shastry, CEO of India’s DriveU, which provides a car driver on call service, wrote on LinkedIn: “India should have its own home-grown Twitter/Google/YouTube/WhatsApp/FB — like China has.”
 
 

To be fair, Indian retail companies give foreign brands like Starbucks stiff competition in the domestic market, but going global has been a challenge. Indian IT services firms, however, have become deeply entrenched in the global economy, with the likes of TCS and Infosys providing software solutions to clients world over.
On Sunday, Modi made a “special appeal” for becoming self-reliant, telling a gathering in Bengaluru that Indian technology companies made products for the world but “now is the time for us to give more priority to India’s needs.” He did not name any company.
Public rallies
Even as anti-American protests simmer, Tesla launched its second showroom in India in New Delhi, with Monday’s opening attended by Indian commerce ministry officials and US embassy officials.
The Swadeshi Jagran Manch group, which is linked to Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, took out small public rallies across India on Sunday, urging people to boycott American brands.
“People are now looking at Indian products. It will take some time to fructify,” Ashwani Mahajan, the group’s co-convener, told Reuters. “This is a call for nationalism, patriotism.” He also shared with Reuters a table his group is circulating on WhatsApp, listing Indian brands of bath soaps, toothpaste and cold drinks that people could choose over foreign ones.
On social media, one of the group’s campaigns is a graphic titled “Boycott foreign food chains”, with logos of McDonald’s and many other restaurant brands.
In Uttar Pradesh, Rajat Gupta, 37, who was dining at a McDonalds in Lucknow on Monday, said he wasn’t concerned about the tariff protests and simply enjoyed the 49-rupee ($0.55) coffee he considered good value for money.
“Tariffs are a matter of diplomacy and my McPuff, coffee should not be dragged into it,” he said.

The investigating officer of the case brought the suspect before Judicial Magistrate (Central) Farman Ali Tager and sought his custody for 14 days for interrogation.
He informed the court that as per initial inquiry the suspect did not possess a licence to drive a heavy vehicle. He said he only had the licence to drive light transport vehicles (LTV) and that too had expired in 2016.
The IO asked for more time to get information regarding the owner of the dumper — involved in the accident — as well as need to verify the documents of the suspect.
After hearing the IO, the court remanded him in police custody for two days and directed him to submit a progress report at the next hearing.
Body formed to probe arson attacks
A high-powered committee was formed to investigate arson attacks, where miscreants torched seven dumpers after the fatal accident.
According to an order issued by Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho, DIG-West Irfan Ali Baloch will head the team comprising Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi, West SSP Tariq Illahi Mastoi and Investigation SSP Anam Tajjamul.

In the past week or so, a three-day operation was announced in Bajaur but it came to an abrupt halt because of pressure from the people. Taking to the streets in large numbers, they sent a powerful message. Such was the pushback that the operation was halted. Following this, negotiations were carried out by the community notables with the TTP.
Among other things, the objective was to convince the TTP to retreat from the area, so there would be no need for the operation. The negotiations carried on, even though most experts were not too hopeful. The negotiations failed, and another operation became imminent. As this piece was being written, a three-day curfew was announced for parts of the district. Social media is filled with heartbreaking images of belongings piled onto various vehicles that are packed with people: young men holding on to the sides of a luggage-carrying van or an old woman sitting in the boot of a car. There are children too. These are images that will probably not make it to mainstream media because there is an unspoken consensus about ignoring the human costs of such decisions.
Indeed, this story of displacement is hard for mainstream Pakistan to understand, especially for the privileged.
Threatened by the spectre of terrorism reaching their streets in Islamabad and Lahore, those residing in these big cities, with regular jobs or businesses and comfortable savings, cannot understand what these displacements mean for those living in the former Fata agencies, who have already suffered this cycle. To see a safe and home-like environment become alien and hostile, and then being displaced and having to leave homes and livelihoods behind to live in camps, and finally to return to an area where houses and markets have been damaged extensively is an experience the rest of us cannot even begin to comprehend.

The story of displacement is hard for mainstream Pakistan to understand.

The residents of many parts of KP have lived through this and now they are expected to go through it again. No wonder they are now equally wary of both sides of this conflict. This is why in the past couple of years, most political parties, including the ones that supported the post-2008 operations, have also spoken against operations — they have recognised the mood on the ground. The chief minister of KP is no different; one day he rails against the imposition of curfews and the next he explains the importance of rooting out terrorism. The Jekyll and Hyde performance is to appease both the people and the powerful who ensure his job and government.
But with this public mood, most energies are focused on keeping the news of the sentiment from reaching the rest of the country. And there is little to no debate on the alienation of the people and whether or not there are ways of tackling terrorism without losing public support. Instead, we block the news, the government says there is no operation other than intelligence-based operations, while curfews are imposed and people pack their belongings — delulu is the solulu.
Indeed, since the issue first reared its head in the mid-oughties, from ‘elimination’ to now re-em­ergence, the only surface-level consensus allo­wed to be debated is that Pakistan can’t afford to not eradicate terrorism. No one is willing to look de­­e­ply into the issue. How successful was the first effort? Very! Was there any room for improvem­ent or change? Of course not, because who tinkers with what was very successful in the first place?
There are few questions or answers about how the TTP managed to escape to Afghanistan, only to return once the government in Kabul changed. Or how we will avoid a similar journey this time around. Neither do we discuss how many times we will repeat this cycle of displacement.
It appears that in parts of KP, we are back at the ‘clear’ stage of the ‘clear, hold and build strategy’ of COIN; a strategy that fell apart in the country next door. But how will the ‘hold and build’ stages work this time around? No one knows. And how will ‘clear’ ensure that the TTP doesn’t just escape across the border again?
This should be of great importance. Especially because, in the aftermath of the previous phases of displacement, the anger of the local populace increased after they returned. The check posts, the questioning, the complaints about compensation, the missing people — all of these issues and more continued to haunt the people on their return. And it is worth remembering that these issues, in the aftermath of the post-2008 operations led to the emergence of the PTM around 2018.
It was a movement that made those in power so uncomfortable (then and now) that its coverage was simply not allowed. And while the movement seems to have fizzled out since, the alienation of the people is more than evident. The public gatherings in Bajaur recently, or Tirah valley or even Bannu last year all point to the anger of the people — in Tirah and Bannu, as in Bajaur, crowds gathered spontaneously to push for peace and against conflict. But in all these cases, the crowds seemed to be as wary of the state as they were of the militants. And this is a cause for concern.
That is not all. From the street power of the PTM to these public gatherings in recent times, the worrying trend is of people opting for street protests or direct negotiations over electoral and parliamentary politics. The PTM expressed a lack of faith in parliament publicly, but recent protests have also indicated this, even if it is not being expressed as such.
Instead of acknowledging this and trying to find solutions, we are back to repeating history, with no clarity on how and why it will end differently this time around. Because accepting mistakes and learning from them is just too difficult.

Given the acrimony that surrounded the last attempt to tinker with the Constitution, one wonders if it will be any different this time. Much has changed since the last amendment was forced through the legislature.
The last time the Constitution was being amended, the government did not have the votes to get its bill passed. Lawmakers had to be roped in from the opposition benches to cobble together a two-thirds majority. Some came willingly, after cutting deals. Others had no choice. It did not matter. It was clear from the beginning that the law had to be passed.
Even allied lawmakers did not have full knowledge of what they were voting for, and the law minister is said to have simply been handed a draft with clear instructions.
To be clear, there is nothing concrete that is known about the ‘27th Amendment’. For now, it seems merely to be a topic of discussion within the PML-N and its coterie of legal advisers. No proposal has been shared with the party’s allies, nor is there a draft that may be debated.
 
 

Still, it has remained a topic of discussion ever since the government inherited a two-thirds majority courtesy of the Constitutional Bench that the 26th Amendment had helped set up. The two-thirds majority might be the main reason why the government does not seem too fussed. This time, there will not be a need to abduct, bribe or coerce opposition lawmakers.
Nor will any party not already allied to the regime be able to blackmail its way into receiving concessions, or to force the government to rethink its agenda. Indeed, the amendment will be seen through without any hiccups even if the regime were to decide that it must be passed tomorrow.
It is said that the government may be seeking more ‘fixes’ for the judiciary. The 26th Amendment apparently did not fix it enough.
But it would be deeply unfortunate if the amendment being debated is also focused heavily on a narrow agenda. Pakistan faces several deep-rooted issues that require urgent legislative intervention. These include matters like the possibility of a new province in south Punjab; the need to revisit the role and authority of caretaker governments; addressing the inability of the ECP in fulfilling its intended purpose; and the management of the growing burden of the NFC award, among many others.
If the government decides to take all stakeholders on board, especially the opposition, the new amendment could become an opportunity to build bridges where the 26th sowed divisions. Now virtually unchallengeable, the regime would benefit by showing some grace. With power comes responsibility, and it must start to demonstrate some.

A change would require nationwide street- and village-level mobilisation, which is a big ask for the current state of the opposition. The revelations about the election commission’s involvement in preparing fraudulent electoral rolls that evidently helped the BJP win successive elections is reverberating across the country.
Everyone other than Narendra Modi’s handpicked election commission and core supporters of BJP is convinced that Rahul has found a treasure trove of evidence that Hindutva’s rise as a fascist threat to India was about rigged elections and not mass support as many feared. Fascism rides on popular support, which Narendra Modi does not have, contrary to the myth circulated by the media with the help of suspect elections. Modi may remain a challenge as an autocrat, but the stories of his popularity are now shown to have been excessively cooked up. That is the evidence Rahul Gandhi and his core team of experts have found from a mountain load of polling lists they secured from a grudging and hand-picked election commission.
In one flourish, Gandhi may have helped dissolve widespread fears of a religio-fascist takeover of India. Fascism is a terrifyingly popular phenomenon as Europe witnessed close to a century ago. Men and women — workers, capitalists, intellectuals, soldiers — and even schoolchildren were smitten by Hitler’s charisma. There was no need to manipulate EVMs or draw up false voters’ lists. It’s the autocrats on the other hand that need rigging, and that threat remains intact in India.
That the exposé came at the time of jubilations for Indian cricket, which triggered a nation’s reaffirmation of its waning legacy of multi-religious, multilingual and multicultural plurality is what this piece is about.

In one flourish, Gandhi may have helped dissolve widespread fears of a religio-fascist takeover of India.

Cricket and cinema have had an influence beyond the ordinary on politics in India. Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh venerated their movie actors and scriptwriters who doubled as political leaders to determine the course of power and governance in the southern states. Bollywood has produced many MPs, elected and nominated. Of course, cricketers like Chetan Chauhan, Kirti Azad and Mohammed Azharuddin have also been members of the Lok Sabha by popular vote, for this or that party.
It was thus that Mohammed Siraj, India’s new bowling sensation and Shubman Gill, the young classy batsman and skipper of India’s cricket squad did something unknowingly together with their teammates at the end of the Test series in England that no one has done for the country before them. They reaffirmed faith not just in India’s cricketing prowess, which has gained respect since the days of M.A.K. Pataudi, Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev. The young duo and their cheering teammates may not have realised that they had helped set back the fascist project for the Hindu rashtra for the foreseeable future. Siraj, the lion-hearted pace bowler, played all five Tests against England and bowled his heart out. His grabbing a win from the jaws of defeat with the last ounce of energy on the last day of the final Test at the Oval is now etched in the public psyche as a turning point for the future of Test cricket. Gill was declared the man of the series.
What made their contributions crucial for Indian democracy was the timing of it. Rahul Gandhi’s revelations, and the joy of seeing the players toast their colleagues, though unrelated, melded into a heart-lifting reality. Siraj is the son of a Muslim auto-driver from Hyderabad, and Shubman’s father is a Sikh farmer who wanted to become a cricketer himself but never could. Both players had faced trolling amid calls to remove them from the team on their lean day. We don’t have to go over the calumny and invectives that in recent years have been heaped on their respective communities by the majoritarian forces of the Hindu right, forces that form the backbone of India’s current ruling dispensation.
When the Sikh farmers were protesting their stolen rights, Sikhs were dubbed terrorists by Modi’s loyal media. When the 2024 elections were in full swing, Modi described Muslims as thieves, stealing Hindu women’s mangalsutra and their cattle. The cricket team would have none of that as they embraced and delighted in the glorious game as one team.
The duo captured the love of a billion-plus compatriots at a time when Rahul Gandhi had put his political career at stake and, many say, his life on the line to dissolve the worst fears Indians were confronted with in recent years — the fear of religious fascism supplanting democracy.
Modi changed the law recently about the nomination of the election commissioner. The PM, the leader of the opposition and the chief justice of India would select the chief election commissioner. He has done away with the chief justice in the process and appointed his home minister in the judge’s place. It gives him two-thirds control of the selection.
Gandhi’s questions to the election commission have not elicited a mea culpa. Instead, the poll body has embarked on a drive to delete hundreds of thousands of legitimate names from the voters’ list in Bihar, of those bearing officially recognised ID cards.
TV journalist Karan Thapar highlighted the dangers inherent in the special intensive revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls presently underway in Bihar. The election commission has released the draft rolls confirming that 6.56 million names have been deleted, nearly nine per cent of those who lived there before the exercise began. “This is already disturbing,” wrote Thapar.
Given Bihar’s high fertility rate it’s odd that the total number of registered voters should fall rather than increase in 2025, says Thapar. That’s one more proof should one be needed, that Hindutva has failed to conquer the imagination of Indians, and it needs to rig elections.

Former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi are already facing imprisonment in connection with the same case.
The auction took place at the Patwar office in Bhara Kahu, overseen by an auction committee in the presence of Assistant Commissioner Secretariat Uzair Ali. The agricultural land, measuring 405 kanals and three marlas, located in Mohra Noor, was auctioned for Rs3.42 million per kanal.
In contrast, investors showed no interest in land owned by another absconder in the case, Farhat Shehzadi alias Farah Gogi. Her property, also located in the revenue estate of Mohra Noor in the Bani Gala area, remained unsold.
Earlier in the day, rumors circulated regarding the possible auction of Imran Khan’s Banigala residence. PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja tweeted at 11:50am about the alleged auction, expressing concern that if the news was true, it would have been a secretive process. He promised to verify and share accurate information.
 






Two hours later, at 2:15pm, Mr Raja tweeted an update, stating that according to information gathered by PTI’s legal team regarding NAB reference 19/2023 — the state vs. Imran Khan in the Al-Qadir Trust case — the auction was related to the properties of other accused who have been declared absconders. “Our legal team is keeping an eye on this issue,” he added.
 






Despite repeated efforts, Dawn was unable to confirm the identity of the successful bidder for Ali Riaz Malik’s land at the time of filing this report. At least two government officials contacted said they were unaware of the buyer’s name. “I have no idea who the successful bidder is, as the transfer deed is yet to be completed,” one official stated.
Recently, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) also conducted a public auction of six commercial properties linked to Malik Riaz and Bahria Town, as part of efforts to recover unpaid amounts related to the Al-Qadir Trust case.
These properties included five in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad. Of the six, three were successfully auctioned: Rubaish Marquee sold for Rs508m, while Corporate Office-I and Corporate Office-II received conditional bids of Rs876m and Rs881.5m, respectively.

• PTI stages walkout after Gohar, Asad not allowed to raise points of order
• House adopts resolution for Milad celebrations, inclusion of Jinnah’s speech in curricula
ISLAMABAD: As the series of convictions of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) leaders and the subsequent disqualification of its lawmakers continued, members of the opposition party staged a vociferous protest in the National Assembly on Monday.
The protest started when PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaiser were denied permission by the chair to raise points of order during the question hour.
Carrying portraits of ex-premier Imran Khan and other convicted PTI leaders, the opposition members chanted slogans denouncing the convictions and disqualifications, while demanding release of the incarcerated founder of the party.
The lawmakers tore up copies of the day’s agenda, threw the pieces into the air, and gathered near the speaker’s podium before staging an undeclared walkout.
Soon after their exit, PTI legislator Iqbal Afridi pointed out a lack of quorum. However, a headcount confirmed the House was in order.
On the other hand, Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari during the question hour told the House that electricity charges for households consuming up to 200 units per month had dropped by around 60 per cent over the past nine months.
 






He said that out of total 35 million electricity consumers, around 18.3 million already benefited from subsidies — 90 per cent for those using up to 100 units and 70pc for those consuming between 100 units and 200 units.
However, he pointed out that expanding the 200-unit slab to households using up to 300 units would require an additional Rs275 billion in subsidies, which was unaffordable under the current fiscal constraints. Still, the government was bearing a substantial subsidy burden for low-use consumers, he added.
No power subsidy for crypto mining
Responding to another question, the federal minister clarified that no subsidised electricity had been provided to any cryptocurrency mining project in Pakistan, nor had any tariff, rate, or legal framework been approved for such ventures.
He also outlined an incremental electricity package for the entire industrial sector —without subsidies — to enhance competitiveness, particularly for export industries.
He claimed that 7,500MW of surplus power was available, and talks were underway with development partners and the International Monetary Fund to use it for grid stabilisation.
On the remarks of MNA Syed Hafeezuddin that mock drills should be arranged for citizens of Karachi to prepare them for any eventuality considering that the city was located in a seismically active tectonic zone, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Cha­u­dhry assured the House that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), in collaboration with provincial authorities, would continue to raise public awareness about natural hazards.
Milad, Minorities Day resolutions adopted
The National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution urging the federal and provincial governments to celebrate the 1,500th Eid Milad-un-Nabi (Peace Be Upon Him) in a befitting manner.
 






Moved by Pir Syed Fazal Ali Shah Jillani, the resolution called for Milad programmes at the highest level and illumination of both public and private buildings, while highlighting the importance of promoting the teachings of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
In connection with National Minorities Day, another resolution was passed to include in the national curriculum the historic address of August 11, 1947 by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah to the first Constituent Assembly.
In that speech, Pakistan’s founder declared, “You are free to go to your temples, mosques, or any other places of worship in this country.
You may belong to any religion, caste, or creed — that has nothing to do with the business of the State.“ The resolution was moved by PPP lawmaker from Multan, Naveed Aamir Jeeva.

The mortar shell, fired from an unknown location, landed and exploded in the Gomazai area of Tump as the three children were returning home from a seminary, according to security officials.
One of the injured children, identified as Muhammad, succumbed to multiple injuries after being taken to a hospital.
The other two were identified as Abdullah and Muhammad Fazil.
Security forces have launched an investigation to find the location from which the shell was fired.
 
 

In a separate incident in the same area, authorities found the body of Yousaf Faith, a young poet and musician who, according to his family, had been missing. Levies recovered the body, and said hospital officials confirmed Faith had been badly tortured.
Human rights activists expressed serious concern over the death and demanded “a transparent and independent probe into the incident”.

The meeting of Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakista­nis and Human Resource Deve­l­o­pment was held to discuss problems being faced by under-trial/convicted Pakistanis in different countries of the world. Senator Zee­­shan Khanzada chaired the meeting.
Of the total, 17,236 are in jails in the Middle East countries whereas 85 Pakistani prisoners are being held in Afghanistan. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs failed to provide details about the nature of crimes for which these Pakistanis are detained in prisons of different countries of the world.
 
 

Expressing serious displeasure over the non-provision of this critical information, the Senate panel told the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to produce comprehensive data within 15 days of all overseas Pakistanis convicted or under-trial worldwide, including the nature of their crimes.

Foreign ministry told to produce data within 15 days

It also directed the ministry concerned to submit within 15 days a list of countries that have policies to inform Pakistani authorities about such cases, as well as those that withhold such information.
Community Welfare Attachés (CWAs) from various postings briefed the committee on the status of under-trial and convicted Pakistanis in their respective jurisdictions. The CWAs from Dubai, Doha, and Kuala Lumpur reported 3,523, 619, and 499 detainees, respectively.
The chairman of the committee directed the ministries of overseas Pakistanis and foreign affairs to expedite efforts to finalise prisoner transfer agreements with various countries to help repatriation of innocent Pakistanis trapped in legal cases abroad.
The committee reviewed the status of overseas Pakistani prisoners and called for immediate enactment of consular protection bill to enable the jailed Pakistanis to serve their remaining sentences in Pakistani jails.
Senator Nasir Mehmood recommended verification of the citizenship status of the 85 Pakistanis being held in Afghanistan.
The committee reviewed the functioning of CWAs and directed the ministry concerned to submit evaluation procedures for assessing their performance, along with detailed information on all convicted and under-trial Pakistanis in each jurisdiction.
Senator Shahadat Awan expressed concern over incomplete information provided in the working papers submitted by ministries concerned. He stressed the need for presenting complete and accurate information in a professional manner before such a prestigious forum.
 
 

The chairman of the committee also observed a significant lack of coordination and data sharing be­­tween ministries of foreign affa­irs, interior and overseas Pakis­ta­nis. He emphasised the importa­n­­ce of improving inter-ministerial cooperation for the welfare of overseas Pakistanis.
The chairman stressed the urgent need for the enactment of a consular protection act to safeguard the rights of Pakistani prisoners abroad.
The committee was also briefed on the performance and upcoming programmes of the National Voc­a­tional & Technical Training Com­mission (NAVTTC). The chair­man appreciated NAVTTC’s efforts and directed the commission to align its programmes with international standards to enhance overseas em­­ployment opportunities for Pakistanis.
The meeting was attended by senators Raja Nasir Abbas, Nasir Mehmood, Shahadat Awan, Saeed Ahmed Hashmi and Khalida Ateeb.

“Australia will recognise the state of Palestine at the 80th session of the United Nations General Assembly in September, to contribute to international momentum towards a two-state solution, a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of hostages,” Prime Minister Ant­h­ony Albanese said in a statement.
The conflict raging in Gaza since Oct 2023 has revived a global push for Palestinians to be given a state of their own.
The action breaks with a long-held view that Palesti­nians could only gain statehood as part of a negotiated peace with Israel.
 
 

At least 145 of the 193 UN members now recognise or plan to recognise a Palest­inian state, including Fra­nce, Canada and Britain.
Here is a recap of the Palestinians’ quest for statehood:
1988: Arafat proclaims state
On Nov 15, 1988, during the first intifada, Palesti­nian leader Yasser Arafat unilaterally proclaimed an independent state with Jerusalem as its capital.
He made the announcement in Algiers at a meeting of the exiled Palest­inian National Council, which adopted the two-state solution as a goal, with independent Israeli and Palestinian states existing side by side.
Minutes later, Algeria became the first country to officially recognise an inde­pendent Palestinian state.
2011-2012: UN recognition
In 2011, with peace talks at a standstill, the Palestinians pushed ahead with a campaign for full UN membership.
The quest failed, but in a groundbreaking move on Oct 31 of that year, the UN cultural agency Unesco voted to accept the Palestinians as a full member, much to the dismay of Israel and the United States.
In Nov 2012, the Palestinian flag was raised for the first time at the United Nations in New York after the General Assembly overwhelmingly voted to upgrade the status of Palestinians to “non-member observer state”.
New push
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza over the last two years has boosted support for Palestinian statehood.
Four Caribbean countries (Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados and the Bahamas) and Armenia took the diplomatic step last year.
So did four European countries: Norway, Spain, Ireland and Slovenia, the latter three EU members.
Within the European Union, this was a first in 10 years since Sweden’s move in 2014, which resulted in years of strained relations with Israel.

In a report by correspondents in Islamabad, New Delhi and Washi­ngton, the FT described what it called an “unexpected resurgence” in relations between Islamabad and Washington. The newspaper said Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir has twice been received in high-level settings in the US this summer,  most recently in Florida, where he attended the retirement ceremony of Gen Michael Kurilla, head of US Central Command.
According to the  FT, Munir also met President Trump in June for a two-hour private lunch,  just a month after Pakistan and India experienced their bloodiest confrontation in decades. The meeting was notable given Mr Trump’s  earlier public criticism of Pakistan.
Michael Kugelman, a non-resident senior fellow at the Asia Pacific Foundation, told the FT:  “What’s happening in US-Pakistan relations is a surprise. I would describe the relationship now as one that’s enjoying an unexpected resurgence, even a renaissance. Pakistan has very successfully  understood how to engage with such an unconventional president.”
The FT attributed the change in tone to a diplomatic strategy by senior Pakistani officials, combining counterterrorism cooperation, outreach to individuals in Mr Trump’s business network, and agreements involving energy, mineral resources and cryptocurrency. These moves, it said, were accompanied by positive messaging towards the White House.
A key development cited in the report was the March arrest and transfer to US  custody of an ISIS-K suspect alleged to have organised the 2021 Kabul airport bombing. Mr Trump publicly commended Pakistan for the arrest in his State of the Union address.
 
 

The newspaper also detailed an April agreement between World Liberty Financial, a Trump-backed cryptocurrency initiative, and Pakistan’s crypto council. One of the venture’s co-founders remarked during a visit to Pakistan on the scale of the country’s mineral resources.
 
 

On the regional response,  the FT said India reacted with “deep irritation” to the warming of ties,  particularly after facing a US tariff increase to 50 per cent, while Pakistan’s rate was set at 19 per cent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi  disputed Mr Trump’s assertion that the US had mediated a May ceasefire between the two countries, with New Delhi emphasising that the agreement had been reached through direct channels between their armed forces.

LAHORE: The ruling PML-N senior leadership discussed upcoming by-poll, local bodies elections in Punjab and overall performance of the federal and provincial governments at a huddle in Murree hill station.
PML-N president Nawaz Sharif presided over the meeting at his Murree residence in which Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif, Dep­uty Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, federal cabinet mem­bers Rana Sana­ullah, Ahsan Iqbal, Kha­waja Asif, Azam Nazir Tarar, Dr Tauqeer Shah and Ameer Muq­­am, Sen­ator Pervaiz Ras­hid, Kha­waja Saad Raf­ique, Mur­taza Javed Abbasi, Anusha Rehman and retired Capt Muh­ammad Safdar were present.
“The meeting discussed upcoming by-polls and local body elections. Suit­able candidates will be finalised once the schedule of all by-election is anno­unced. The huddle was told that the local body election had already been delayed and now it’s time to conduct it,” PM’s a­dviser and PML-N Punjab president Rana Sanaullah told Dawn after the meeting.
Twelve opposition Paki­stan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) lawmakers in Punjab have been disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following their conviction in the May 9, 2023 cases.
The disqualified lawmakers comprise eight National Assembly and four Punjab Assembly legislators. The NA-129, Lahore, fell vacant after the death of MNA and former governor Mian Azhar. PTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan has barred his party from contesting the by-polls except on NA-129 where Azhar’s son Hammad Azhar is likely to be the party’s candidate.
“We will not field any candidates in the by-elections for the seats of our unjustly disqualified members. These individuals stood firm with PTI despite extreme challenges. Therefore, the party will completely boycott these by-elections,” Imran Khan had said in a post on X.
 






When asked after the PTI’s boycott, the PML-N has been given a ‘walkover’ in the by-election, therefore, why the leadership felt the need to discuss it in the huddle in which all the party heavyweights were present, Rana Sanaullah said: “We have information that the PTI is not boycotting the by-poll, therefore, it featured in the meeting.”
Mr Sanaullah further said he told the meeting that the party workers would be mobilised once the schedule of the local government election was announced. “However, before the announcement of its schedule, there is a need to amend the local government law regarding delimitations,” he added.
To a question about ‘reconciliation’ between CM Maryam and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif in the meeting over the issue of the arrest of Sialkot’s additional deputy commissioner revenue, Sanaullah said: “There has been no issue between them as it was only played up by the media.
Regarding the proposed 27th amendment, he said it did not come under discussion.
According to sources, discussion on the “smooth functioning” of the federal and Punjab governments was also discussed in the meeting.
Khawaja Asif says Maryam is like his daughter
The defence minister uploaded a clip of his talk with a digital media platform on his X account clarifying the reports about his reported conflict with CM Maryam over the arrest of a bureaucrat of his native town, Sialkot. “Maryam Nawaz is like a daughter to me. She is our future leader. I pray for her like my own daughter. There has been no issue [between us] at all .”
Meanwhile, the Punjab government has cautioned the PTI from staging a protest on the Independence Day.
“The nation will celebrate Independence Day with great fervour and will also mark the success of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos while a disruptive faction, PTI, is conspiring to create unrest on this national occasion which will not be allowed,” Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari said in a statement.
 
 

“Protesting on a national day is not the agenda of any patriotic political party. This is the same group that emerged from the 2014 sit-ins and has since made agitation and protests their hobby. The PTI has no regard for national events as its politics revolves solely around creating division and chaos.” Issuing a strong warning, Bokhari said the law would take its course if anyone tried to stage violent protest.
Advising the PTI leadership, she urged it to call off their planned protest on Aug 14.

• Jirga leader censures admin for not consulting residents, demands facilities for displaced families
• More than 300 families flee restive tehsils ahead of curfew; displaced people to be housed in schools
BAJAUR: A “targeted military” operation to eliminate militants in Bajaur’s Lowi Mamund tehsil resumed on Monday as the provincial government imposed a curfew in several areas of the restive tehsil for three months — a move that attracted criticism from the residents.
The offensive, named ‘Operation Sarbakaf’, was initially launched on  July 29, but it was postponed the next day after peace talks between the Bajaur Amn Jirga and local militant commanders inched forward.  However, talks for the relocation of militants to Afghanistan, after multiple rounds of negotiations, fell through on Friday evening due to a stalemate on some issues.
On Monday, the security forces reportedly assisted by helicopter gunships and artillery, pounded militant hideouts in Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils, located about 20km from Khar, the district headquarters. However, no loss of life was reported on the first day of the operation, which continued till sunset.
The army’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, did not issue a statement.
Due to the curfew announced by the district administration, several major roads and trade centres remained closed, and the restrictions in over two dozen villages of Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils would remain in place till Aug 14.
 
 

The notification was posted on the Deputy Comm­issioner’s official Facebook page around 2am on Monday. According to the notification, the district administration said that with the approval of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Home Department, it has imposed a 12-hour curfew on several key roads in the district, including the Khar-Munda road, Khar-Nawagai Road, Khar-Pashat Salarzai Road, and Khar-Sadiqabad-Inayat Kalley Road. “The restrictions on these roads, which commenced at 11am on Monday, will remain in place until 11pm the same night,” said the statement.
The notification said that the three-day curfew had been imposed in around 27 areas of Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils, in addition to the mentioned roads, to ensure public safety and security during the “targeted operation” against terrorists.
The under-curfew areas include Laghari, Gohati, Ghanam Shah, Bad-i-Siah, Gat, Kitkot, Regai, Daag, Ghundi, Amanato, Zagai, Garigal, Niaag, Damadola, Sultan Big, Chowtra, Gaang, Jawar, Inam Khooro Chinagai, Aanga, Safari, Bar Gatki, Kharki, Shakroo, Shinkoot, and Bakaroo.
“We appeal to the people to abide by the restrictions and stay indoors, suspending all activities until 10:30am on Monday, while failure to comply with [this] may result in unpleasant consequences, for which they would be responsible,” the directive concluded.
As the curfew took effect in the morning, the police sounded sirens and directed traders to shut their shops. Subsequently, major roads and bazaars across the district, including Khar, Inayat Kalley, Sadiqabad, Nawagai, Raghagan, Pashat, Laghari, Yousafabad, and Loe Sam, were shut down.
Inconvenience to residents
The restrictions in the district, particularly in the urban areas of the Khar tehsil, caused inconvenience to residents and attracted flak from several political figures, including Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, head of the Bajaur Amn Jirga.
At an emergency news conference at the Bajaur Press Club in Khar, Mr Rashid accused the district administration of failing to take the residents on board before imposing the restrictions. Alongside the jirga members, he criticised the provincial government and district administration for not providing adequate arrangements for transportation and accommodation to the people displaced by the anti-militant action. He sought immediate measures to address the accommodation needs of the displaced people.
Exodus continues
According to estimates, more than 2,000 families, including 300 families on Monday, have fled their homes since Saturday in light of the military operation in the restive Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils. There is no official figure about the displaced families, and these estimates have been based on interviews with local NGOs and residents.
Khalid Khan, executive director of the Siraj Uddin Khan Foundation, told Dawn that about 300 more families fled their homes ahead of the curfew imposed in the morning. He said some people moved to the shelters set up by his organisation, while others chose to stay with their relatives and friends.
In order to accommodate the influx of displaced people, the district administration has announced accommodation facilities in 449 public schools across the district. The decision was made during a meeting of the local education department officials with Khar Assistant Commissioner Dr Sadiq Ali.
A statement issued after the meeting said that 309 boys schools and 140 girls schools would house the displaced people. In addition, 113 private schools will also be used to accommodate the displaced people

Last year, Pakistan proscribed the Majeed Brigade, which is the BLA’s dedicated suicide squad. The BLA itself was proscribed in 2006, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Authority’s list of proscribed organisations.
Pakistan has previously requested that the Majeed Brigade be listed as an international terrorist organisation. In 2019, the State Department labelled the BLA as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), making it a crime for anyone in the US to assist the militants, but did not designate the Majeed Brigade at that time.
FTO designations are made by the Secretary of State, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”. SDGT designations, meanwhile, target individuals and groups under Executive Order 13224, even if they are not part of a formally recognised organisation.
According to today’s press release, the Department added the BLA to the FTO list, while adding the Majeed Brigade as an alias to the BLA’s previous SDGT designation.
“BLA was designated as an SDGT in 2019 following several terrorist attacks.  Since 2019, BLA has claimed responsibility for additional attacks, including by the Majeed Brigade,” the press release read. 
 
 

“In 2024, BLA claimed it had committed suicide attacks near the airport in Karachi and the Gwadar Port Authority Complex.  In 2025, BLA claimed responsibility for the March hijacking of the Jaffar Express train travelling from Quetta to Peshawar, killing 31 civilians and security personnel and holding hostage over 300 train passengers.”  
The State Department said that the designation demonstrated US President Donald Trump’s commitment to counter-terrorism.
“Terrorist designations play a critical role in our fight against this scourge and are an effective way to curtail support for terrorist activities,” the press release stated.  “Today’s actions are taken pursuant to section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, and Executive Order 13224, as amended.” 
 
 

Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti welcomed the State Department’s designation in a post on X, lauding the federal government and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir for presenting Islamabad’s case to Washington.
“We welcome the US decision to designate BLA and its alias Majeed Brigade as terrorist outfits,” Bugti wrote. “These groups have long shed innocent blood under the false cover of ethnicity and rights.
“Terrorism is terrorism; no cause justifies killing civilians. The world must unite to end this menace.”
 






Talking to Geo News, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry termed the development a fruit of Pakistan’s successful diplomacy and a “great win” for the country. He said the groups were “proxies” of India that were sponsored by the neighbouring country and others.
“The day is not far when their sponsors will also be on the list of terrorists. This will not only strengthen Pakistan against fighting terrorist organisations, but the stronger Pakistan is against terrorism, the safer the world will be from terrorists,” he said
Chaudhry said the development showed the world stood with Pakistan’s stance and the country in the fight against terrorism.
“We are winning this fight every day and such uplifting news and successes will quickly bring this fight to its logical end.”
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed BLA, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
In April, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel, particularly in Balochistan.
Last month, the Foreign Office (FO) reaffirmed Pakistan’s stance against terrorism, saying that the country has “effectively and comprehensively dismantled” terrorist outfits.
“Pakistan condemns terrorism in all forms and manifestations; zero tolerance, and international cooperation against terrorism are cornerstones of our policy,” the FO said in a statement.
The FO’s statement came in the wake of the State Department designating The Resistance Front — the little-known group responsible for the Pahalgam attack on April 22 — as an FTO and a “front and proxy” of the banned Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
The Pahalgam attack — which resulted in the deaths of 26 people — sparked a military confrontation between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan as New Delhi blamed it on Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation.
The BLA’s designation comes as relations between Islamabad and Washington are improving.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir completed a visit to the US on Sunday, terming the trip — the second in just one-and-a-half months — a “new dimension” in ties between both nations.
The COAS engaged in high-level interactions with senior political and military leadership, as well as members of the Pakistani diaspora, the military’s media wing said.
He also visited the US in June on a five-day official visit, where he met with Trump over luncheon, becoming the first serving army chief to have a face-to-face meeting with a sitting US president.
Also in June, United States Central Command (Centcom) chief Army General Michael Kurilla praised Pakistan as a “phenomenal partner in the world of counter-terrorism”, citing the nation’s struggle against terrorism in Balochistan and against terrorist groups like the Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K).

“Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said.
Gen Kurilla noted that there have been 1,000 terrorist attacks in “the western area” of Pakistan since the start of 2024, noting that they “are in an active counter-terrorism fight right now”.</p><small>2025-08-11 18:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618387-us-labels-bla-majeed-brigade-as-terrorist-groups-after-deadly-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>US labels BLA, Majeed Brigade as terrorist groups after deadly attacks</strong></a><br><p>

The Republican leader said he would place the city’s Metropolitan Police under federal government control while also sending the National Guard onto the streets of the US capital.
The overwhelmingly Democratic city faces allegations from Republican politicians that it is overrun by crime, plagued by homelessness and financially mismanaged — although violent offences are down.
“This is Liberation Day in DC, and we’re going to take our capital back,” Trump said.
 


Trump — a convicted felon who granted blanket clemency to nearly 1,600 people involved in the 2021 US Capitol riot in Washington — has complained that local police and prosecutors aren’t tough enough.
He said 800 DC National Guardsmen — “and much more if necessary” — would be deployed to the city of 700,000.
As Trump was speaking at the White House, several dozen demonstrators gathered outside.
“There is absolutely no need for the National Guard here,” said 62-year-old retiree Elizabeth Critchley, who brandished a sign with the slogan “DC says freedom not fascism.”
“It’s all for show. It’s just a big theatre,” she said.
Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was among several cabinet officials flanking Trump, said “other specialised” National Guard units could also be deployed.
“They will be strong, they will be tough, and they will stand with their law enforcement partners,” he said.
The new approach echoes Trump’s immigration policies that have effectively sealed the southern border amid mass deportations while deploying active-duty troops against protesters in Los Angeles.
New York, Chicago next?
The president told reporters he planned to roll out the policy to other cities, spotlighting New York and Chicago.
Unlike the 50 states, Washington operates under a unique relationship with the federal government that limits its autonomy and grants Congress extraordinary control over local matters.
Since the mid-1970s, the Home Rule Act has allowed residents to elect a mayor and a city council, although Congress still controls the city’s budget.
Data from Washington police shows significant drops in violent crime between 2023 and 2024, although that was coming off the back of a post-pandemic surge.

Trump posted on social media ahead of the news conference that he also wants to tackle homeless encampments, after signing an order last month making it easier to arrest homeless people.
He promised individuals “places to stay,” but “far from the Capital”. Trump said criminals would be jailed and that it would all happen “very fast”.
Federal law enforcement has already increased its presence after a former Department of Government Efficiency staffer was beaten during an attempted carjacking.
“Last week, my administration surged 500 federal agents into the district, including from the FBI, ATF, DEA, Park Police, the US Marshals Service, the Secret Service and the Department of Homeland Security,” Trump said.
“You know a lot of nations, they don’t have anything like that … They made dozens of arrests.”
A Gallup poll in October found that 64 per cent of Americans believed crime had risen in 2024, although FBI data shows the lowest levels of violent crime nationwide in more than half a century.
“Let me be crystal clear — crime in DC is ending, and it’s ending today,” said Attorney General Pam Bondi.
Landmark trial kicks off over Trump’s use of US military in policing role
Separately, a landmark trial kicks off over the Trump administration’s use of National Guard forces to support its deportation efforts and quell protests in Los Angeles, in a legal challenge to the US president’s break from long-standing norms against deploying troops on American streets.
The three-day non-jury trial before San Francisco-based US District Judge Charles Breyer will determine if the government violated a 19th-century law that bars the military from civil law enforcement when Trump deployed the troops in June, as the state of California claims in its legal challenge.
Los Angeles experienced days of unrest and protests sparked by mass immigration raids at places where people gather to find work, like Home Depot stores, a garment factory and a warehouse.
The administration denies that troops were used in civil law enforcement and plans to show that they were protecting federal property and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents.
Many of the troops have been withdrawn, but California’s Attorney General Rob Bonta said on Monday that 300 National Guard members are still going on immigration raids and restricting civilian movements in the state.
“The federal government deployed military troops to the streets of Los Angeles for the purposes of political theatre and public intimidation,” Bonta said in a statement. “This dangerous move has no precedent in American history.”
California and Gavin Newsom, the state’s Democratic governor, have asked Breyer to prohibit the troops from directly participating in domestic law enforcement activities. California and Newsom say the National Guard is accompanying ICE agents on raids and assisting in arrests, in violation of the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 and other laws that forbid the US military from taking part in civilian law enforcement.
The Republican president ordered 700 Marines and 4,000 National Guard troops to Los Angeles in June against Newsom’s wishes. California’s lawsuit ultimately seeks a ruling that would return its National Guard troops to state control and a declaration that Trump’s action was illegal.
The trial before Breyer will have a limited impact, however, on Trump’s plan to deploy hundreds of National Guard troops to Washington.
A ruling against the administration could restrict the actions of those troops and constrain Trump if he deploys such forces to police other American cities.
Trump said his efforts to fight crime will go beyond Washington, and he mentioned Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Baltimore.
Trump’s decision to send troops into Los Angeles prompted a national debate about the use of the military on US soil and inflamed political tensions in the second-most-populous US city.
A US appeals court has allowed Trump to retain control of California’s National Guard during the legal challenge.</p><small>2025-08-11 17:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/112153368ac0574.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930221/complete-3-day-curfew-imposed-in-kps-bajaur-miranshah-amid-operation-home-dept' target='_blank'><strong>Complete 3-day curfew imposed in KP’s Bajaur, Miranshah amid operation: home dept</strong></a><br><p>The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Home Department on Monday announced that a three-day curfew was being imposed from today until August 14 (Thursday) amid an operation against militants in the areas.
At the end of July, security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a three-day curfew in the region.
The operation was paused after both sides agreed to a ceasefire until the conflict was completely resolved thro­ugh dialogue; however, peace talks between militant commanders and the Bajaur peace jirga fell through.
 
 

Today’s statement said that the curfew would be imposed from 11am today  until 11am on August 14, in order to ensure the safety of the public during the anti-terror operation.
“A complete curfew will be imposed … in which movement on the roads and leaving houses will be prohibited,” the statement read.
It listed Laghari, Guati, Ghanam Shah, Bad Siya, Kamar, Amanta, Zagai, Gut, Gunde, Gadigal, Niag Kali, Rigi, Daag, Damadola, Sultan Beg, Chautra, Shenkot, Gang, Jeewar, Inam Khoro, Chengai, Anga, Safri, Bar Gatki, Kharki, Shukro and Bakro as areas in which the curfew would be in effect in Bajaur.
Khar Munda Road, Khar Navagi Road, Khar Pusht Salarzai Road and Khar Sadiqabad Inayat Kalay Road were also listed as off limits under the curfew.
“The public is requested to end their activities by 10:30am and return to their homes during the curfew; otherwise, they will be at risk of any untoward incident,” the statement added.
Meanwhile, Adviser to the KP Chief Minister on Information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said in a statement that the curfew was limited only to Bajaur and Miranshah, rubbishing rumours that it had been imposed across KP.
“Rumours of a curfew across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are completely false,” the statement read. “Life in the province is going on as usual. There is no curfew except for specific areas in Bajaur and Miranshah.
“News of a curfew is political propaganda and an attempt to mislead the public,” Saif was quoted as saying. “The rumour-mongering mafia wants to spoil the province’s journey of peace and development.”
Saif urged people to avoid listening to rumours and implored them to only pay attention to information from official sources, reiterating that movement in the province was normal.
“Those who create fear by lying about the curfew are enemies of the people,” the statement read. “Action will be taken against those spreading false information on social media. The people of KP know that propaganda will fail.”
Meanwhile, according to Khar Assistant Commissioner Dr Sadiq Ali, people displaced by the operation have been housed in 100 government schools and colleges.
“Right now, we have 435 schools. More than 100 private schools are also vacant,” he told Dawn.com. “A form has been issued for the registration of victims, and it is also being done through Nadra (National Database and Registration Authority).
MPA calls for a stopping operation
In a speech in the KP assembly today, Awami National Party Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA) Nisar Baz Khan raised questions about whether the home department was under the control of the provincial government.
“At midnight, the provincial home department ordered that curfew be imposed across Bajaur. Is the home department under the provincial government or not? If so, who imposed this curfew and under what authority?” he asked.
 
 

“On the one hand, millions of people are homeless and on the streets, with no place to hide, and on the other hand, the government is blocking their routes by imposing a curfew. If there is no transport arrangement, how will people leave?”
Nisar said appeals were made and jirgas were held to halt the operation, but it started anyway.
“Now, it should be clarified whether this operation is being carried out with the permission of the chief minister or with the permission of the prime minister,” Nisar said. “I clearly say that the operation in Bajaur should be stopped and the curfew should be lifted immediately. Emergency relief should also be provided for IDPs (internally displaced persons).”</p><small>2025-08-11 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1120155251abc64.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930219/govt-hails-hague-courts-award-saying-india-must-let-flow-waters-of-western-rivers-for-pakistans-unrestricted-use' target='_blank'><strong>Govt hails Hague court’s award saying India must ‘let flow’ waters of western rivers for Pakistan’s ‘unrestricted use’</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Monday welcomed the decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in The Hague to issue an “Award on Issues of General Interpretation of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)” in the Indus Waters case, stating that India must generally “let flow” the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s “unrestricted use”.
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
A supplemental award by the PCA in June held that India could not unilaterally hold the treaty in abeyance. India, in response, said it did not recognise the court or its decisions.
A press release issued today by the PCA said it rendered an award on Friday in an arbitration initiated by Pakistan against India on August 19, 2016, pursuant to Article IX and Annexure G to the IWT.
“This arbitration concerns the interpretation and application of the IWT to certain design elements of the run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India is permitted by the treaty to construct on the tributaries of the Indus, Jhelum and Chenab Rivers.”
Regarding the overall approach to Article 3 (provisions regarding western rivers) of the IWT, the award said: “The general rule is that India shall ‘let flow’ the waters of the western rivers for Pakistan’s unrestricted use.
“There are certain specified exceptions to this rule, including in relation to the generation of hydroelectric power, but these exceptions must be strictly construed: the design and operation of run-of-river hydroelectric plants must hew strictly to the requirements in the treaty, rather than to
what India might consider an ‘ideal’ or ‘best practices’ approach.”
It further noted that questions relating to the balance between the parties’ respective rights and obligations in this regard were to be identified and addressed through the treaty’s procedures for notification, objection and dispute resolution in furtherance of the treaty’s objective and its obligations of mutual cooperation.
 






The PCA said that to date, India had not participated in the arbitration proceedings and had repeatedly objected to the court’s competence of the court, adding that it had addressed the issue on various counts before.
“Throughout these proceedings, the court has ensured that India is fully informed in respect of the
proceedings and that the opportunity to participate remains open to it. Notwithstanding this, the court
has endeavoured to ascertain, understand, and consider India’s views, drawing on available materials,
including the records of the commission, correspondence between the parties, and/or submissions by
India in previous dispute resolution proceedings under the treaty,” the PCA said.
It added that it had also taken steps to test the accuracy of Pakistan’s claims, including by requesting further written submissions from Pakistan, by questioning Pakistan both before and during the hearing on the merits, by requesting that Pakistan produce historical evidence concerning the operation of the IWT and the Permanent Indus Commission, and by considering publicly available materials and jurisprudence not presented by Pakistan.
The PCA explained that the Aug 8 award addressed questions concerning the treaty’s overall interpretation and application, including in relation to Article 3 and Paragraph 8 of Annexure D (which concerns new run-of-river hydro-electric plants that India may construct on the western rivers).
“The award also addresses a related question on the legal effect of decisions issued by dispute resolution bodies under the treaty (namely, courts of arbitration and neutral experts),” the PCA press release said.
“The award is binding on the parties and without appeal,” the press release stated.
A statement from the Foreign Office (FO) said Pakistan welcomed the award.
“The award carries special significance in the wake of India’s recent announcement to hold the IWT in abeyance, and its earlier decision to boycott the proceedings of the Court of Arbitration. It is an endorsement of Pakistan’s historical stance on the afore-stated issues.
“Pakistan remains committed to full implementation of the IWT. It also expects India to immediately resume the normal functioning of the treaty and faithfully implement the award announced by the Court of Arbitration.”
 






Award’s details
Among its 10 findings, the court said the awards of a court of arbitration were final, binding on the parties and had a controlling legal effect on subsequent neutral experts, subsequent courts of arbitration and the court that issued the award.
Further, it pointed out that to the extent that a court of arbitration and a neutral expert were operating at the same time on related matters, it was incumbent on both to pay attention to decisions of the other that had a binding or otherwise controlling effect.
The court said that the decisions of a neutral expert on matters within their competence were “final and binding” on the parties and any court of arbitration, in respect of the particular matter on which the decision was made.
“Due to the vulnerability of Pakistan as the downstream riparian of a critical but shared nature resource, and the potential for serious conflict between India and Pakistan in this regard, the object and purpose of the treaty, as it relates to the western rivers, is to delimit the two states’ respective rights and obligations, in conjunction with mutual cooperation and effective dispute resolution procedures for whenever questions as to the interpretation and application of these rights and obligations arise,” the court reiterated about the treaty’s objectives and aims.
The award said Paragraphs 8(d), 8(e), and 8(f) of Annexure D, on low-level outlets, gated spillways, and intakes for the turbines respectively, contained specific directions about their existence, size and/or location (addressed below), which might depart from engineering best practices that sought to maximise efficiency or power output.
“These limitations were of central significance in the treaty negotiations for addressing Pakistan’s
concerns as to India’s ability to release virtually all the water in dam reservoirs, along with
sediment, and to withhold a large volume of water when refilling the reservoirs,” the court said.
On maximum pondage, the award said that the pondage required for firm power was
to be calculated based on the water accumulated over a seven-day period at the minimum mean
discharge (a historically low flow rate), taking into account the daily and weekly downstream
release requirements set out in Paragraph 15 of Annexure D and a “realistic, well-founded, and
defensible projection of the plant’s installed capacity and anticipated load”.
It noted that maximum pondage should not be “more than twice this amount”.
The court further said that when designing a run-of-river plant, India was only entitled to freeboard the vertical distance in the dam wall from the full supply level to the top of the dam of a height necessary to address the safety of the dam as a whole from overtopping, with reference to internationally recognised standards.
“For each of the components of dam design indicated above, the parties must cooperate from an early stage of planning by India for a new hydro-electric plant on the western rivers, such that India’s designs can be modified as necessary in light of valid concerns raised by Pakistan in relation to these components. Ultimately, India bears the burden of establishing that its designs are treaty-compliant,” the award’s findings concluded.
However, the award clarified that the court did not address the application of its findings to the specific circumstances of the Kishenganga Hydro-Electric Plant or Ratle Hydro-Electric Plant — the two Indian
projects presented in Pakistan’s arbitration request.
“The court remains seized of issues raised in the request for arbitration and not yet decided, and will determine the next steps in the proceedings after seeking the views of the parties,” it said.</p><small>2025-08-11 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618372-pakistan-welcomes-arbitration-courts-order-saying-india-to-let-flow-western-rivers' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan welcomes Arbitration Court's order saying India to 'let flow' western rivers</strong></a><br><p>

Field Marshal Munir on Sunday completed his second high-profile trip to the US in less than two months. Like his previous visit, he engaged with both political and military leadership in the host country. In Tampa, Florida, the army chief attended the US Central Command’s (Centcom) change of command ceremony.
His most closely watched appearance came later at a black-tie dinner hosted by Adnan Asad, Pakistan’s honorary consul in Tampa. The event was attended by about 150 guests, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh, embassy officials, and prominent members of the diaspora.
Comments Field Marshal Munir reportedly made at the event were later picked up and, according to the FO, distorted by Indian media outlets. Responding to Indian media reports, the MEA had said earlier today: “Our attention has been drawn to remarks reportedly made by the Pakistani COAS while on a visit to the US. Nuclear sabre-rattling is Pakistan’s stock-in-trade.
“The international community can draw its own conclusions on the irresponsibility inherent in such remarks, which also reinforce the well-held doubts about the integrity of nuclear command and control in a state where the military is hand-in-glove with terrorist groups.”
The MEA had also said that it was “regrettable” that the alleged remarks were “made from the soil of a friendly third country”.
 






In a terse response to the Indian MEA’s statement, the FO said: “Pakistan strongly rejects the immature remarks made by the Indian MEA earlier today, which is yet another demonstration of their chronic tendency to distorting facts and twisting statements out of context.
“The Indian narrative of an alleged ‘nuclear blackmail’ is a misleading and self-serving construct. Pakistan remains firmly opposed to the use or threat of use of force. India’s sabre-rattling and warmongering whenever confronted, invite unfounded allegations bereft of rationality.”
The FO said Pakistan was a responsible nuclear-weapon state with an “elaborate command and control structure under full civilian control” that had always exercised “discipline and restraint” while dealing with issues of such importance.
 






“Pakistan’s sustained and credible counterterrorism efforts are internationally acknowledged. Our security forces remain the bulwark against terrorism. The Indian MEA’s spurious insinuations are irresponsible and without a shred of evidence.
“We also note with concern a pointless reference to the third countries, in a bid to exert pressure on Pakistan. This not only reflects India’s lack of diplomatic confidence but also constitutes a futile attempt to unnecessarily involve other countries.”
The FO said that “contrary to India’s belligerent and jingoistic approach”, Pakistan would continue to act as a responsible member of the global community.
“However, any act of Indian aggression or violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will be met with an immediate and matching response. The onus of any ensuing escalation will rest squarely with the Indian leadership,” it warned.
The two countries had entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, and the PAF downed six Indian jets in its response. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks. Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the US in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.  Trump also hosted the army chief at the White House in the weeks following the conflict.
By declaring the Indian economy dead in the water, Trump has put Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead end as Trump last week imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods, citing New Delhi’s continued imports of Russian oil in a move that sharply escalated tensions between the two nations after trade talks reached a deadlock. The new import tax, set to come into place in three weeks, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50pc — among the highest levied on any US trading partner.</p><small>2025-08-11 15:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1116193318bf2a7.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930196/lahore-atc-acquits-qureshi-in-2-more-may-9-cases-convicts-dr-yasmin-ejaz-chaudhry-and-others' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC acquits Qureshi in 2 more May 9 cases; convicts Dr Yasmin, Ejaz Chaudhry and others</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Monday acquitted PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in two more cases related to the May 9 riots, while sentencing Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudry, Omar Sarfraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Rashid to 10 years in prison.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, following which thousands were arrested.
 
 

The ATC had reserved its verdict in the two cases on Saturday related to the May 9 riots — the Shadman police station attack and burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House — after completing proceedings at Kot Lakhpat jail. The judge concluded the hearings inside the jail in two sessions during the whole day.
ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill announced the judgments today and convicted Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema and Rashid in both cases.
PTI leaders Aliya Hamza and Sanam Javed were also sentenced to five years in prison in the Shadman case.
Advocate Rana Mudassar confirmed today’s sentencing to Dawn.com.
Speaking to Dawn.com, Hamza said that the PTI leaders did not fear punishment and would not take one step back.
“We are standing with the PTI founder and will continue to stand with him,” she said. “I was in government custody when I was sentenced.”
She continued: “Maryam Nawaz was convicted because of corruption, while I was convicted because of loyalty. I have already served 16 months in prison, I am not afraid.”
Hamza stated that she was already consulting with her lawyers to file an appeal against the sentence with the Lahore High Court (LHC).
In the Shadman police station case, the court indicted 25 accused out of 41 nominated in the challan and recorded statements of 45 prosecution witnesses. At least 15 accused have been declared proclaimed offenders in this case.
In the police vehicles torching case, the court indicted 17 accused, declared seven proclaimed offenders and recorded statements of 65 prosecution witnesses.
Last month, the Lahore ATC had acquitted Qureshi while sentencing Dr Yasmin, Chaudhry, Cheema, Rashid and others to 10 years in prison over a May 9 riots case related to violence on Sherpao Bridge.
Sarwar Road police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers on charges of ransacking and burning public property at Sherpao Bridge in the Cantonment area during the violent protests.
Chaudhry had filed two petitions in the LHC on Saturday, pleading with the court to suspend his sentence and conviction, along with ordering his release on bail. He further requested the court in the second petition to set aside his conviction and acquit him in the case in the “interest of justice”.
PTI’s Gohar blasts convictions
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan assailed the convictions, saying: “We’ve said before that if injustice is allowed to thrive, then the voice of the people will be silenced.”
Lamenting that the PTI’s mandate was stolen, Gohar said that the government did not have the people’s respect or vote and did not have the people’s trust.
“Yet we sat [in parliament] so that we could move forward and protect the nation, save democracy, free the courts and ensure the supremacy of order.
“If this blade of injustice doesn’t stop, the nation will suffer a great loss,” he warned.
“We condemn the judgments and reject them,” Gohar added. “Justice has been killed.”
The PTI chairman further said that the party condemned the riots on May 9, stating that they should not have happened and should not happen again. However, he added that the party submitted a petition requesting a hearing on the allegations.
“That hearing has not happened, our petition was ignored and no decision was made,” he stated.
“Because the courts didn’t grant us justice, political tensions and instability rose. We don’t get justice and it keeps getting killed,” Gohar emphasised.
He said that Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai was saying the right thing: “People need to rise up, their voice cannot be silenced.
“We will carry on our movement until the true leader of the world’s 6th biggest party is released.”
Referring to those convicted in today’s hearing, Gohar said that the party members were voices who were representatives of the state who did not condone violence against it.
“If their voices are silenced, if the knife of injustice plunges deeper, then there will be a lot of division. This needs to end,” Gohar emphasised.
According to Gohar, the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) summoned the party leadership, who requested a meeting with Imran. “He (the CJP) said he is pursuing judicial reforms and would allow us to meet Imran in Adiala,” Gohar recalled.
“It’s been six months and there has been no meeting. We submitted a privileged motion to meet Imran, but there has been no action on it.
“We even submitted requests and raised the issue in parliament, but nothing happened,” he added.</p><small>2025-08-11 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618370-fo-denounces-immature-india-for-distorting-facts-twisting-coas-munirs-remarks' target='_blank'><strong>FO denounces 'immature' India for distorting facts, twisting COAS Munir's remarks</strong></a><br><p>

On July 8, the government had approved plans to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have risen sharply since January.
TCP had last week issued a fresh international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, after a previous one for 50,000 tonnes of sugar in July reportedly received no offers.
The lowest price offered in the tender was believed to be $539.00 a tonne, cost and freight (c&f) included, according to traders. They said offers were still being considered and no purchase had been reported yet.
The lowest offer was said to have been submitted by trading house ED&F Man for 50,000 tonnes of fine-grade sugar sourced from any origin.
There were reportedly three other participants in the tender.
Dreyfus was said to have offered $580.75 a tonne c&f for 25,000 tonnes of fine-grade sugar from any origin, while Al Khaleej Sugar offered $586.00 a tonne c&f for 30,000 tonnes of medium-grade sugar sourced from the United Arab Emirates.
Trading house Bare offered $555.00 c&f for medium-grade and $550.00 c&f for fine-grade sugar, both from Brazil.
Reports reflect the assessments so far from traders, and further estimates of prices and volumes are still possible later.
 
 

No purchase was reported in a previous tender for 100,000 tonnes on July 31, with the lowest price offer also $539.00 a tonne c&f.
The new tender seeks small/fine- and medium-grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel.
The sugar shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20, traders said.
Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1 to September 15 for 50,000 tonnes, while the rest can be shipped from September 10 to September 25. Sugar in ocean shipping containers can also be shipped between September 1 to 20.
Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government’s sugar trade policy.
During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.
The government has vowed strict monitoring of sugar stocks and also placed some unidentified mill owners on the Exit Control List in a bid to stabilise rates.
A cartelisation case involving 79 sugar mills and the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) is also being heard by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP).</p><small>2025-08-11 14:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1119482504f6ab1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930218/bangladesh-court-hears-graft-case-against-ex-pm-sheikh-hasina' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh court hears graft case against ex-PM Sheikh Hasina</strong></a><br><p>A court in Bangladesh on Monday heard cases brought by the anti-corruption organisation against ex-leader Sheikh Hasina and her family, including her daughter who has served as a top UN official.
Three officials from the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) read out testimonies in three separate cases over an alleged land grab of lucrative plots in a suburb of the capital Dhaka.
Hasina, 77, fled Bangladesh by helicopter on August 5, 2024, after weeks of student-led protests against her autocratic rule.
She has defied orders to return from India, including to attend her separate and ongoing trial on charges amounting to crimes against humanity, over the deadly crackdown on the uprising.
Hasina has been named in six corruption cases, along with her US-based son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, and her daughter Saima Wazed, who has been serving as the World Health Organisation’s Southeast Asia chief in New Delhi.
“If found guilty, Sheikh Hasina, her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy, and Saima Wazed could face up to 14 years in prison,” ACC lawyer Khan Mohammad Mainul Hossain told AFP.
Wazed is on leave from the WHO and a new official has taken up a post as “officer-in-charge”.
In total, six cases have been filed of alleged corruption connected to Hasina.
Among those named in other cases, some slated to be heard later in August, are Hasina’s sister, Sheikh Rehana, and her children — including British lawmaker Tulip Siddiq.
Tulip Siddiq resigned as the UK government’s anti-corruption minister in January, denying any wrongdoing after being named in multiple probes in Bangladesh.
Siddiq’s lawyers have said the allegations against her are false.</p><small>2025-08-11 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618359-pakistan-calls-for-israels-accountability-after-idf-airstrike-kills-civilians-in-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls for Israel's accountability after airstrike kills civilians in Gaza</strong></a><br><p>

The credibility of elections has rarely been questioned in recent decades in the world’s most populous democracy. Some analysts say the opposition accusations could damage Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he navigates one of the toughest periods of his 11 years in office.
The opposition members were taken into custody midway while marching from the parliament to the Election Commission of India (ECI) headquarters in New Delhi as they protested the roll revision, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
Nearly two hours later, Congress lawmaker Kishori Lal Sharma said Gandhi and other opposition leaders had been released.
“The police detained us but now we have been released,” he told the media, adding that the police had not allowed them to go to the ECI as promised, and instead took them to the police station.
“We are now heading to the parliament,” he added.
 






As the police attempted to thwart the protest by around 300 opposition members, some MPs climbed up to the barricade — set up by the police ahead of the march — and chanted slogans against the ECI and Modi’s government. The protestors carried placards alleging “vote theft”, PTI said.
A statement posted on Gandhi’s X account shortly after he was detained said: “The truth of vote theft is now before the country.
“This fight is not political — it is a fight to protect democracy, the constitution, and the right to ‘one person, one vote’,” he added.
“The united opposition and every voter in the country demands a clean and transparent voter list,” the Congress leader added.
 






Gandhi and Congress have alleged that voters’ lists in states where the party lost are corrupted, with voters’ names deleted or included more than once to rig elections in favour of Modi’s BJP.
Opposition parties have also criticised the ECI’s decision to revise the voters’ list in the key northern state of Bihar just before state elections due later this year, saying it aims to disenfranchise large numbers of poor voters.
The BJP and the ECI have rejected the accusations.
In June, the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the voter rolls was announced ahead of the upcoming polls in the eastern state of Bihar. The move, which required that all potential voters provide proof of citizenship by July 25, sparked nationwide fears of disenfranchisement among India’s minorities, including Muslims and Dalit communities.
 
 

According to PTI, other protesting lawmakers detained included Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi, Samajwadi Party’s Akhilesh Yadav, T. R. Baalu of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray), and Derek O’Brien of the Trinamool Congress.
Parliamentarians from other opposition parties, such as the Rashtriya Janata Dal, were also taken into custody, the report added.
‘State of anarchy’
The ECI has said that changes in voters’ lists are shared with political parties and all complaints are investigated thoroughly.
It has also said that voters’ lists need to be revised to remove dead voters or those who have relocated to other parts of the country, among others. Many voters in Bihar have told the BBC that the draft rolls have wrong photos and include dead people.
“The new draft rolls have 72.4 million names — 6.5 million fewer than before,” the BBC report published today said.
Congress and its allies have fared poorly in two state polls that they had expected to win after an impressive show in last year’s general elections, which saw BJP losing its outright majority and remaining in power only with the help of regional parties.
 
 

Congress has also complained about electronic voting machines and said the counting process is not fair, charges rejected by the election panel.
The BJP said opposition parties were trying to create a “state of anarchy” by sowing seeds of doubt about the electoral process.
“They are in a state of bankruptcy because of their continuous losses,” Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan of the BJP told reporters on Monday.
 






As per the PTI report, Congress leader Jairam Ramesh had written to the ECI earlier and asked them to hold discussions over the electoral rolls’ SIR, among other issues.
“Thereafter, the MPs wish to collectively meet with the commission on a host of issues, including but not limited to Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls being undertaken in Bihar and proposed to be undertaken in other states as well,” the PTI quoted him as saying.
“We look forward to meeting with the commission, which will be in keeping with the highest tradition of our parliamentary democracy,” he said, according to PTI.</p><small>2025-08-11 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/11174901100527b.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930203/suspect-in-lawyer-khawaja-shamsul-islams-murder-arrested-from-kp-police' target='_blank'><strong>Suspect in lawyer Khawaja Shamsul Islam’s murder arrested from KP: police</strong></a><br><p>Police have arrested a suspect from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in connection with the recent killing of senior lawyer Khawaja Shamsul Islam, Karachi South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said on Monday.
Islam was shot dead while his son was injured as they were leaving a mosque in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on August 1. Darakshan Police registered a case the next day against eight nominated suspects under terrorism and murder charges.
DIG Raza told Dawn.com that the vehicle in which the suspect fled the scene of the murder was also recovered by police.
“Investigators have mapped the suspect,” the DIG said. “According to the evidence we gathered, he fled on a motorcycle alone.
“Police have also unearthed a bungalow in DHA being used by the suspects. CCTV footage obtained from the bungalow showed their activities before and after the lawyer was killed.”
According to the South police chief, investigators have so far obtained 30 pieces of CCTV footage of the suspects.
“With the help of human intelligence, police raided the residences of the suspects’ relatives in Karachi and detained several people for interrogation,” he added.
“With the help of Hotel-ID, the suspects were spotted in Hyderabad, from where their relatives were also detained. Through technological sources, police found that the suspects had fled to KP, from where one suspect was arrested,” said the DIG.
DIG Raza said that of the eight suspects nominated in the murder case, one was already in jail.
“The police have requested the court to investigate the imprisoned suspect,” he said. “Police are in constant touch with the family of the deceased lawyer, while guards have been deployed at their residence in DHA for security.”
This was not the first time that the lawyer was attacked by the prime suspect, as in November last year, he allegedly attacked the lawyer with 15-20 other accomplices.
According to the lawyer’s brother, Islam was shot twice and tortured. The case was registered with Clifton police under terror and other charges.</p><small>2025-08-11 13:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/11162110a6ca15b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930195/indian-top-court-orders-roundup-of-stray-dogs-in-delhi' target='_blank'><strong>Indian top court orders roundup of stray dogs in Delhi</strong></a><br><p>India’s Supreme Court on Monday ordered the removal of tens of thousands of stray dogs from the capital, citing public safety concerns after a surge in dog bites.
India is home to millions of stray dogs and deadly attacks, particularly on children and the elderly, are regularly reported by the city’s media.
At least 60,000 stray dogs live on the streets of Delhi, according to India’s Livestock Census of 2012, the most recent data available. Some suggest that number to be now far higher, with large rival dog packs patrolling parks and residential neighbourhoods across the city.
The country accounts for more than a third of global rabies deaths, according to the World Health Organisation, a crisis exacerbated by a lack of sterilisation programmes and legal restrictions on canine culling.
The court asked city authorities to set up dog shelters within eight weeks, and maintain daily records of the canines captured.
“What is important, and without which the entire exercise would go futile, not a single stray dog should be released,” it said, which applies to Delhi and its satellite suburbs, a megacity home to some 30 million people.
The court warned of action against animal activists who obstruct the removal of dogs.
It also ordered a 24-hour helpline to be set up to report dog bites and officials must publicise locations where anti-rabies vaccines are available.
Data tabled in the Indian parliament showed more than 3.7m cases of dog bites and 54 suspected human deaths from rabies in 2024.
 
 

Other estimates peg the number to be nearly twice as high, with Delhi alone accounting for roughly 2,000 cases of dog bites every day.
In middle-class neighbourhoods, many of Delhi’s strays are beloved by their residents despite lacking formal owners, with some dogs clothed in special canine jackets to keep warm during the winter.
But they are also a hazard to humans, with Indian media regularly reporting on the mauling of young children by aggressive dog packs.</p><small>2025-08-11 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618290-qureshi-acquitted-yasmin-rashid-other-pti-leaders-sentenced-to-10-years-in-may-9-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Qureshi acquitted, Yasmin, other PTI leaders get 10 years in May 9 cases</strong></a><br><p>
