Andrabi’s confirmation follows reports that said PM Shehbaz was expected to visit Washington on February 18 and represent Pakistan at the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, which is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.
“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” Andrabi said during a weekly briefing of the FO.
He added that information about other members of Pakistan’s delegation and its engagements would be shared in due course of time.
Asked specifically whether Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir would be included in the delegation, the FO spokesperson reiterated: “We will share these details in due course.
“I do not have the details — neither on the itinerary, nor on the composition of the delegation. I can confirm that the prime minister will lead the delegation and that the deputy prime minister and foreign minister will be part of the delegation. This is the extent of information right now. We will, of course, update you in due course.”
Pakistan is among the 14 countries that signed the charter of the Board of Peace on January 22 on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, becoming a founding member of the body.
The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository. President Trump has designated the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the board’s headquarters.

The information was shared in a report submitted to the SC by PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who quoted the PTI founder as telling him that “he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Subsequently, Raja, alongside Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, spoke to the media outside the SC.
He said, “A crime has been committed against Imran Khan, and this state has committed this crime.”
The PTI secretary general further stated that the “face of this crime is Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. We will not forget this name”.







Anjum has served as the jail superintendent at the Adiala jail, where Imran is imprisoned. Safdar told the court today that according to jail staff, he was transferred on Jan 16, being replaced by Sajid Baig.
Raja said Safdar had conveyed Imran’s “special instruction” to him to immediately file a case against Anjum.
The PTI secretary general also said it was difficult for him to control his emotions after reading the report.
He said the pain in Imran’s eye began in November, and “sometime in December, he completely lost vision in his right eye”.
“Yet Imran was only given drops meant to treat irritation in the eye. He was not taken to hospital, and a qualified doctor to treat eye ailments was also not called. Instead, prison doctors kept giving him eye drops as Imran continued to complain that the pain in his eye was not subsiding,” he alleged.
Raja further claimed: “When the situation worsened, Ghafoor Anjum was immediately replaced on January 16. The new administrator who replaced him also wasted 10 days before a doctor from Pims, Dr Arif, was called [to the Adiala jail] on January 26.”
The PTI secretary general said Dr Arif, after examining Imran’s eye, advised that he should immediately be taken to the hospital. The former premier was administered treatment, including an injection, at the Pims hospital in Islamabad.
“The word used [in the report for Imran’s ailment] is occlusion of the retina,” Raja said, adding that Imran was quoted as saying that after treatment at the hospital, he regained 10pc-15pc vision in his right eye. “He is able to detect light through that eye, but he has not [fully] regained his vision.”
“This is a very painful and terrifying situation,” he said, adding that they had no information about what medical condition was affecting Imran’s vision.
He stressed the need for Imran’s medical examination at the earliest by doctors trusted by the PTI founder, family and public.
“The ongoing situation is unacceptable,” he asserted.



Pointing out that there were no doctors in Pims to treat ailments pertaining to the retina while Shifa International in Islamabad had two such doctors, he alleged that they were “deliberately” not asked to examine and treat Imran.
“So, several people are involved in the crime that has been committed against Imran. All of those names will be revealed, we will not hide any of them. Khan sahib has himself identified one of them, Abdul Ghafoor Anjum. A case will be filed against him immediately.”
Raja further alleged that the “Islamabad High Court is also involved” in this matter, questioning why Imran’s cases were not being fixed for hearing.
Meanwhile, “the condition of one of the eyes of the biggest leader of this nation is very concerning. And we have no information about his overall health condition”.
Despite this, Raja continued, Imran had directed his party to approach the courts. “We will not spare these courts. This nation and history will avenge the crime committed by these courts,” he said, demanding that Imran’s cases be fixed for hearing.
He also asserted that no reason was left to keep Imran behind bars and “freedom is his right now”.
“He will get freedom and this nation will get him freedom. We will fight his case inside and outside courts,” Raja said.
‘Not a matter to be trivialised’
Meanwhile, in an official statement on the matter, the PTI expressed “profound concern and deep anguish” over the report detailing Imran’s health.
“We strongly condemn the treatment meted out to Imran Khan, particularly with regard to the serious deterioration of his eyesight,” the party said on social media platform X.
“The report has laid before the nation facts that are sufficient to shake the conscience of every Pakistani,” it asserted.
The PTI claimed that the jail authorities limited Imran’s treatment to basic eye drops during the last three to four months, while “denying access to his personal physicians”.
“This constitutes a grave and inexcusable act of negligence. It is not merely a medical lapse; it amounts to playing with his life and health,” the party stated.
It further said there would be “no compromise” on Imran’s health and rights.
The PTI declared: “We will raise our voice against this injustice at every constitutional, legal, public, and international forum available to us. Should our legitimate demands remain unmet, we reserve the right to initiate a public movement.
“Imran Khan’s health is not a matter to be trivialised. Any further negligence may provoke a severe public reaction.”







“When the eyesight of a leader of such national and international stature is at stake, every possible transparent and independent medical facility must be provided immediately,” the PTI demanded.
“Any harm inflicted upon Imran Khan’s health will be accounted for,” the PTI warned, asserting that it reserved the right to initiate legal proceedings against Anjum, Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, the Punjab prisons inspector general, the provincial prisons minister and “other responsible officials”.
While noting the SC’s directives regarding a medical team and contact with his sons, the PTI lamented that the “rejection of the request for a family member to be present during the medical examination, and the continued restriction or conditional provision of other basic facilities, is deeply disappointing”.
The party demanded that the ex-prime minister be granted “immediate and unrestricted access to his personal physicians and that, for specialised eye treatment, he be transferred without delay to a reputable hospital recommended by his medical team”.
Stressing that unhindered access to his legal counsel and the full restoration of family visitation rights were his fundamental rights, the PTI said, “To deprive him of these rights is tantamount to trampling upon justice and violating established international norms.”
The PTI urged international human rights organisations and global institutions to “take notice of the treatment being meted out” to Imran.

 

“A former elected prime minister facing prolonged solitary confinement, restricted medical facilities, and impediments to family and legal contact raises serious concerns under universally recognised human rights standards, and falls within the ambit of mental and medical torture,” the PTI alleged.
It also called upon the Pakistani media “not to treat this matter merely as a political dispute, but to highlight it as a serious human rights issue”.
In a separate post on X, the PTI said the report submitted to the SC itself mentions “rapid vision loss, visible distress, lack of full medical transparency, and restricted independent access” for the party founder.
“These aren’t social media claims. They are documented concerns,” the party contended.
It added: “A former prime minister in state custody is dealing with serious health deterioration while basic transparency remains a question. When someone is imprisoned, their health becomes the responsibility of those in power. Period.”
The party emphasised that this was not about politics anymore. “It’s about whether power is being used responsibly or ruthlessly,” it stated.
“You can disagree with a man. You cannot gamble with his health.”
‘Inhumane treatment’
PTI leader and former minister Hammad Azhar pointed out that Imran’s right eye was left with 15pc vision because he “was not provided timely medical treatment”.
“This stinking non-democratic, non-elected, and fascist system is the worst period in Pakistan’s history,” he said on X.







PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh termed the report about his party founder “heart-wrenching and sad”.
“The nation is in deep sorrow and grief today. We demand that Imran Khan be released immediately after providing complete and transparent medical facilities,” he said.







Former KP CM and PTI leader Ali Amin Gandapur emphasised that Imran’s “health is the most important concern of every Pakistani”.
“Proper treatment via his personal medical teams should be ensured,” he demanded.
“Denying proper medical treatment to a former prime minister and Pakistan’s most popular leader is purely evil. Every Pakistani here and overseas condemns this fascist approach,” he asserted.







Opposition ally Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar wrote on X, “For months in a row Imran Khan kept on complaining about loss of vision in his right eye but was denied prompt medical attention.
“This is not negligence. This is torture; cruel, degrading and inhumane treatment,” alleged Khokhar, now a part of the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance.
He highlighted that Pakistan was party to the United Nations’ rules on treatment of prisoners — also known as the “Nelson Mandela Rules” –  and of the UN Convention Against Torture.
Khokhar, who is also a lawyer, argued that these rules “clearly prohibit such treatment” as meted out to Imran.







Moonis Elahi, the son of former Punjab CM and PTI leader Parvez Elahi, posted on X saying that the damage to Imran’s eye was a “result of his inhumane and vindictive treatment of the leader in jail”.
“The nation will neither forget nor forgive,” he said.

Wana Circle Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Asghar Ali Shah told Dawn that the incident took place at around 9am when “a disagreement between two groups over monetary transactions and shop ownership turned into a heated argument”.
“The situation quickly escalated into a physical altercation and subsequently into an armed confrontation,” he said.
The DSP said that upon receiving the information about the incident, SHO Qutab Khan Dottani of the Toi Khullah police station,along with a police party, reached the site of the incident.
“While trying to mediate between the rival groups, the SHO and a police constable came under fire and sustained injuries,” the DSP said, adding that SHO Dottani had sustained a bullet wound in the leg but was out of danger.
Meanwhile, injured constable Bahra Khan sustained a minor head injury.
Both were shifted to the district headquarters (DHQ) hospital in Wana for treatment.
The DSP said that among the four other injured, Juma Gai and Alauddin — who are brothers — sustained bullet wounds in their legs. Another injured person, Hazrat Ali, sustained a bullet wound in the abdomen and was reported to be in serious condition, he said, adding that a man identified as Khudai Noor also suffered an injury in the leg in the incident.
All the injured were shifted to the DHQ hospital Wana.
DSP Shah said police had registered a case of the incident and initiated an investigation to ascertain the circumstances surrounding the incident, while efforts were under way to identify and arrest those involved in the clash.</p><small>2026-02-12 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650485-ramadan-moon-sighting-ruet-e-hilal-committee-to-meet-on-feb-18-in-peshawar' target='_blank'><strong>Ramadan moon sighting: Ruet-e-Hilal Committee to meet on Feb 18 in Peshawar</strong></a><br><p>

A defence ministry source told AFP that the clearance covered the purchase of 114 Rafale fighter jets, adding to the dozens already used by the Indian Air Force (IAF).
“The procurement … will enhance the capability of undertaking air dominance roles across the spectrum of conflict and significantly boost the deterrence capabilities of IAF with long-range offensive strikes,” India’s defence ministry said in a statement, without specifying the number of jets being purchased.
The approval by the defence acquisition council — comprising top military officers and the defence minister — is an important first step for any military hardware purchase in the country.
“The majority of MRFA (Multi Role Fighter Aircraft) to be procured will be manufactured in India,” the statement added.
New Delhi has pushed hard in the last decade to reduce its dependence on Russia, its traditional main supplier of military equipment.
India has boosted military hardware imports from the United States, France, and Israel.
Macron is set to visit India on February 17.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government has also liberalised laws to ease private investments in domestic defence manufacturing under the ‘Make in India’ policy initiative.
Since 2015, India has bought 26 Rafale jets worth around $8.7bn and in April announced a fresh multi-billion dollar deal to buy 26 more of the fighter jets.
Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes, during the four-day conflict between the two countries in May 2025.</p><small>2026-02-12 12:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650487-pakistan-neither-shut-door-on-diplomacy-nor-seeking-war-with-afghanistan-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan neither shut door on diplomacy nor seeking war with Afghanistan: FO</strong></a><br><p>

Developed by the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), the EO-2 satellite is designed to significantly enhance the country’s earth observation and high-resolution imaging capabilities.
The officials of Suparco said the satellite will provide critical data to support national development planning, natural resource management, environmental monitoring, and urban expansion.

 


It will also strengthen governance, disaster management, climate analysis, and strategic decision-making by delivering accurate and timely satellite imagery.
With the addition of EO-2, Pakistan has expanded its satellite fleet, ensuring improved continuity, coverage, and precision of earth observation data, added the space agency.
Suparco officials termed the launch a milestone in Pakistan’s space journey, noting that the successful indigenous development of EO-2 reflects the country’s growing technical expertise and self-reliance in advanced satellite technology.
Earlier on February 7, Pakistan marked a major step forward in its Human Spaceflight Programme as two candidates were officially shortlisted by the Astronauts Centre of China (ACC), according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The development followed a cooperation agreement signed in February 2025 between Suparco and the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA).
Under the agreement, two Pakistanis will undergo astronaut training in China, with one ultimately selected to travel to the Tiangong space station.
Last year, Pakistan launched its first indigenous Electro-Optical (EO-1) satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northern China.
‘Historic milestone’
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar congratulated the nation on the “historic milestone”, highlighting that it was Pakistan’s fifth earth observation satellite and second indigenous electro-optical satellite.
“This achievement reflects Pakistan’s steady progress in strengthening its national space capabilities and advancing technological self-reliance,” he affirmed, noting that the satellite was launched in collaboration with China.

 

“I express my sincere gratitude to the Government of the People’s Republic of China for its continued cooperation and steadfast support,” Dar said.
The foreign minister noted that the Pakistan–China All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership “continues to scale new heights, including in space technology”.
He also commended Suparco, Pakistani scientists, engineers and the entire team for their “tireless efforts in expanding Pakistan’s indigenous space infrastructure and developing reliable, domestically engineered space systems for national development”.

Nipah, which spreads from animals to humans, has no vaccine and a fatality rate ranging from 40 to 75 per cent, according to the UN health body.
“In the past few weeks, three cases of Nipah — two in India and one in Bangladesh — made headlines and caused concern about a wider outbreak,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.

 

WHO assessed the risk of spread of the Nipah virus regionally and globally and found it low, he added.
Two cases of Nipah were confirmed last month in India’s West Bengal state, while one patient died in Bangladesh last week after contracting the virus.
“The two outbreaks were not related, although both occurred along the India-Bangladesh border, and share some of the same ecological and cultural conditions, as well as populations of the species of fruit bat that are known to be the natural reservoir of Nipah virus,” Tedros said.
Nipah was first identified in 1998 after it spread among pig farmers in Malaysia. In India, the first Nipah outbreak was reported in West Bengal in 2001.
In 2018, at least 17 people died from Nipah in Kerala, and in 2023, two people died from the virus in the same southern Indian state.
Symptoms include intense fever, vomiting and a respiratory infection, but severe cases can involve seizures and brain inflammation that results in a coma.</p><small>2026-02-12 11:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/121502131cd9a05.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972718/it-took-me-an-hour-to-write-a-book-with-ai-is-that-a-good-thing' target='_blank'><strong>It took me an hour to write a book with AI. Is that a good thing?</strong></a><br><p>It took me about an hour to produce a 50-page-long children’s book. All it required was a handful of prompts to ChatGPT.
The task was simple: Write a children’s story about a journalist living in the age of artificial intelligence, set at The Korea Herald, with a main character named Jane.
Here’s what I got.



Both the book cover image and the title were created by ChatGPT.
And here are a few pages from the book:



Readers can decide for themselves if the result is convincing enough to pass as something written by a human.
But this experiment shows just how quickly a book can be made with AI, something South Korea’s publishing industry is trying to cope with, for better or worse.
Publishing in the AI era
Some say AI’s rise in publishing represents a change far greater than e-publishing, even akin to the advent of movable type.
Already, the industry is seeing a surge in published titles, as AI dramatically speeds up the production process.
Last year, the National Library of Korea issued 419,534 International Standard Book Numbers, or ISBNs, a 13.5 per cent increase from 369,628 the year before.
It was the first time since records began that annual ISBN issuance posted double-digit growth, far exceeding the roughly two per cent average increase seen over the previous five years.
ISBNs are unique codes for all books published worldwide, in both print and digital formats. A big jump in ISBNs indicates more books are coming to market.
Some early local news stories have called this increase an opportunity. The idea is that if you have a good idea but lack the writing skills, AI could help level the playing field.
In early January, the Korean news outlet Edaily reported that homemakers and even high school students have published books using AI tools.
Seo Jin, CEO of Snowfox Publishing, also said that AI is giving writers new opportunities. Snowfox Publishing released Korea’s first book made with ChatGPT, called “45 ways to find the purpose of life (unofficial title).”
“For aspiring authors, this is an exceptionally strong opportunity for publishing,” she said.
Seo also said that AI use has caused a big increase in manuscript submissions. She explained that this is especially important for small publishers, who have often struggled to get enough good material.
But this boom has also revealed some problems.
A wave of low-quality books, many made with little editing, is now entering the market.
This trend is mostly driven by the search for government subsidies and quick sales.
In Korea, all books issued an ISBN must be submitted to both the National Library of Korea and the National Assembly Library. The system is designed to preserve published works as part of the nation’s documentary heritage. Publishers are required to submit two copies of each title, with libraries compensating them for the price of one.
Recently, there have been growing worries that some publishers are taking advantage of this system by putting out books that don’t even meet basic standards, like proper grammar and spelling, just to get compensation.
On February 9,  the National Library of Korea said it had rejected 395 e-books from Luminary Books, submitted between July and September last year, because they were too short, reused public materials, or had repetitive content. The publisher is known for mass-producing e-books and openly using artificial intelligence in its writing and publishing.
However, publishers say this problem goes far beyond just one company, and more people are starting to worry.
“There is a group chat of roughly 2,000 publishers. Editors regularly share cases of authors submitting manuscripts that are largely completed with the help of AI,” Choi Ah-young, CEO of Calm Down Library, an independent publishing house, said.
She also gave more details about how this is hurting the local publishing industry.
“Editors sign (a contract) with authors because they value their ideas,” she said. “But when unverified information created through AI is turned into a manuscript, it creates serious trouble with fact-checking. Some manuscripts are sent back and revised, but others cannot even do that because the author never had the ability to write the book in the first place.”
She said the issue has even affected international rights deals.
“Some foreign publishers now include clauses explicitly prohibiting the use of AI for translation,” she said.
However, some people see this change as temporary and also as an opportunity.
Seo, CEO of Snowfox Publishing, is among those who view it as a chance for publishers and editors.
She believes that as more low-quality books appear, readers will become more selective. In the end, this will benefit publishers who focus on good editing and strong author voices.
“(Readers) will ask for something more than what they can get by asking ChatGPT. And that creates space for publishers who know what they are doing.”
At her company, editors are encouraged to use AI for tasks like proofreading and finding repetition or structural issues.
“This supports the editing process but doesn’t replace it,” she added.

The SC also directed that Imran be allowed to speak to his children. It was ordered that both the eye inspection and the phone calls be conducted before February 16 (Monday).
The instructions came as a two-member bench headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and including Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan resumed hearing the case regarding the PTI founder’s living conditions in Adiala jail.
Imran underwent a medical procedure at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on the night of January 24 — a development confirmed days later amid an apparent lack of knowledge by the family.
“The issue of Imran’s health is most important,” CJP Afridi observed, adding that “intervention was necessary”.
“We want to know the government’s stance on the matter of his (Imran’s) health,” the top judge said, at which Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan affirmed that it was the state’s responsibility to provide medical facilities.
“If the prisoner is not satisfied, then the state will take measures,” AGP Awan added.
CJP Afridi then noted that the issue of Imran’s “telephone calls with his children is also important”.

 

“We are trusting the government. The government is in a good mood today,” he remarked.
PTI counsel Advocate Salman Safdar, who was appointed amicus curiae and met Imran at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail on Tuesday, had submitted a seven-page report to the SC regarding Imran’s living condition in the prison.
In his report, seen by Dawn, Safdar quoted Imran as telling him that “despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye”.
Imran told Safdar that approximately “three to four months earlier, until October 2025, he had normal 6 x 6 vision in both eyes”. He then began experiencing persistent blurred and hazy vision, which he repeatedly reported to the then-jail superintendent but “no action was taken by the jail authorities”.

 

The report read: “[Imran] stated that he subsequently suffered a sudden and complete loss of vision in his right eye, following which an ophthalmologist from Pims Hospital, Dr Muhammad Arif, was called to examine him.
“According to [Imran], he was diagnosed with a blood clot that caused severe damage, and despite the treatment administered (including an injection), he has been left with only 15pc vision in his right eye.”
Adding to Imran’s claims, Safdar said he “personally observed that the petitioner appeared visibly perturbed and deeply distressed by the loss of vision and the absence of timely and specialised medical intervention”.
“Throughout the meeting, the petitioner’s eyes were watery, and he repeatedly used a tissue to wipe them, reflecting physical discomfort,” the lawyer recalled.
However, during the hearing, the SC dismissed the request to have the condition of Imran’s eye examined in the presence of his family members.
On the request to provide some books to the PTI founder, AGP Awan said it would be done after consultation with eye doctors.
Recalling that the SC had received reports from Safdar and the Adiala jail superintendent, CJP Afridi said: “Most of the things in both reports are similar — the place is good, the facilities are fine.”
Noting that the issue of Imran’s meetings with his family members was pending before the Islamabad High Court (IHC), the top judge said it would be appropriate for the relevant forum to decide on that.
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the narrative being “propagated” by the incarcerated ex-premier’s family has “fallen flat on its face” in light of the report.
In a post on X, he said: “The narrative which was being propagated to international media by Aleema Khan and other members of IK’s family regarding mistreatment and shabby conditions in prison has fallen flat on its face.
“The report regarding daily routine and diet plan has cleared all ambiguity. All facilities are available to him and he has privileges more than any other prisoner,” he added.







‘No access to personal physicians amid deteriorating eye condition’
The report detailed Safdar’s meeting with Imran, the cell conditions, the facilities and amenities provided to the ex-premier, his living compound’s description, as well as the lawyer’s process of reaching the jail.
Safdar further quoted Imran as claiming that “regular and periodic blood tests” were not conducted.
While his personal physicians Dr Faisal Sultan and Dr Asim Yusuf had previously been permitted access, “despite repeated requests and a deteriorating ocular condition, no such access was allowed during the relevant period”, the ex-premier was quoted as saying.

 

“[Imran] stated that for nearly three months, the only treatment administered consisted of eye drops, which resulted in no improvement and was followed by a major impairment of vision in his right eye,” Safdar said.
Imran also claimed that “despite being 73 years old and requiring dental consultation, no dentist had examined or treated him over the past two years, notwithstanding repeated requests”.
According to Safdar, Imran told him about “rapid and substantial loss of vision over the preceding three months while he was living and detained under the ‘care and custody’ of Abdul Ghafoor Anjum”, the jail superintendent.
“This concern of his was neither taken seriously nor addressed by the relevant jail authorities,” Safdar was told. Upon inquiry, the jail staff informed the lawyer that Anjum had been transferred on Jan 16, 2026, and replaced by Sajid Baig.
Safdar stated that upon inquiry, the jail superintendent informed him that Imran was currently under the care of Pims’ Dr Arif and that the on-duty jail doctor recorded the PTI founder’s vital signs three times daily.
A day ago, Safdar denied making any statement on Imran’s health on Tuesday, making it clear that if anything was attributed to him in this regard, it was “misrepresented and misreported”.
On Tuesday, the day he met Imran, Safdar had reportedly told the media that the incarcerated PTI founder was fine and looking healthy.
The SC’s order allowing Safdar to meet Imran came after the bench rejected senior PTI leader Latif Khosa’s request for an immediate meeting, but issued notices to the parties.
Diagnosis and treatment
Meanwhile, a medical report dated February 6 — signed by Pims Executive Director Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander and addressed to the Adiala jail administration — was also submitted to the SC.
It noted that Dr Sikander had been directed by the prime minister’s office to communicate to the jail staff about Imran’s medical condition.
Imran “reported reduced vision in the right eye”, Dr Sikander said, without specifying when.

 

He added: “A qualified ophthalmologist from Pims, Islamabad, conducted a complete eye assessment at Adiyala Jail [sic], including slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, intraocular pressure measurements, essential laboratory tests and OCT (optical coherence tomography) of the retina.
“Based on his assessment, a diagnosis of right central retinal vein occlusion was made and hospital-based follow-up treatment was recommended.”
Recalling Imran’s treatment on the night of January 24, the doctor said the ex-premier was “brought to Pims on the night of Saturday/Sunday for advised procedure”.
“At the hospital, the treatment plan i.e. need for administering anti-VGEF intravitreal injection was explained in full to the patient. Accordingly, an informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure,” Dr Sikander stated.
He reiterated that the procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocols and monitoring, adding that it was “completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes”.
In his report, Safdar said Dr Sikander’s note was provided to him by Imran’s family and it did not “contain full details of the episodes”.
“Nor does it identify the qualified ophthalmologist who conducted the tests and administered the treatment,” he highlighted.</p><small>2026-02-12 11:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/121532085c1326e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/counting-begins-in-landmark-bangladesh-elections-after-gen-z-revolution' target='_blank'><strong>Counting begins in landmark Bangladesh elections after Gen Z revolution</strong></a><br><p>Counting began on Thursday in Bangladesh’s first election since a deadly 2024 uprising and the subsequent student-led revolution, with powerful political heir Tarique Rahman bullish about defeating a coalition.
Voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders have raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote.
It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.
Rahman, 60, said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) could regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.

 

But he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by the Muslim-majority country’s Jamaat-i-Islami party.
“If people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed,” Tarique said after voting.
Polls closed at 4:30pm (3:30 PKT), with the first significant results potentially expected overnight.
With around 128m people eligible to vote, turnout reached a high 32.88 per cent by noon at about three-fourths of the 42,651 polling centres across the country, Akhtar Ahmed, senior secretary of the Election Commission, told reporters.
There were no reports of major violence, but a BNP leader died in a scuffle outside a polling booth in the coastal town of Khulna, and two paramilitary personnel and a 13-year old girl were injured when a home-made bomb exploded outside a polling booth in Hasina’s stronghold of Gopalganj.
Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country on election day, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.
Election Commission officials reported “a few minor disruptions” but top party leaders on both sides raised fears of threats.



In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.
“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”
“This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.”

Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign.
Jamaat, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Rahman saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result.
UN experts warned ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “tsunami of disinformation”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.
‘Ended the nightmare’
Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race.
During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.
Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media.

Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote “will determine the future direction of the country”.
The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina’s 15-year rule ended with her ouster in August 2024.
His administration has barred her Awami League party from contesting the polls.
Hasina, 78, was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India.
Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”.
‘Spirit of the uprising’
He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.
The 127m voters were also voting in a referendum on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.
Yeasin Arafat Emon, 25, said he had backed the charter as it “reflects the spirit of the uprising”.
Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.
Several voters were conflicted about participating in the election.
Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.
But some are determined to cast their ballots.
“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”

The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world’s second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India.
The BNP’s Tarique — whose late parents both led the country — told AFP ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability.
But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that “the economy has been destroyed”.
President Zardari hopes for peaceful process
President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.
“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.
He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.

The power regulator on Monday changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network. The notification effectively terminated the existing net-metering regime and replaced it with net-billing for all.
A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the Power Division to file a review appeal against it after the action drew much criticism.
In response to a call to attention notice — regarding prosumer regulations — raised by PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui during today’s session, Leghari spoke in defence of the move. He began his address by presenting “some key facts”.
He recalled that the issue had been under discussion for the “past 9-10 months”, adding that when the matter was forwarded to the federal cabinet, PM Shehbaz “told us to engage in further deliberations”.
The minister said that the total distributed solar generation in the country was estimated to be between 20,000 MW and 22,000 MW, out of which, “only 6,000-7,000MW of solar systems were on net-metering”.







He continued: “Out of these, only 2,200MW are used by industrial units, while the number for commercial and domestic consumers stood at 4,800MW.”
“Out of these, only 456,000 consumers use net-metering,” the minister said, stressing that given the limited number of consumers, it was “false to say that the general public will suffer due to the move”.
He maintained that only 8-10 per cent of the total solar consumers used the net-metering system. The minister stressed that the issue was not about “being anti-solar, but about fair pricing”.
The minister added that the proposed regulation had maintained the purchase rate for existing users at Rs27 due to “contractual obligations”; however, he noted that “this sparked another debate”.
He said that the net-metering users complained, “if you buy it from us at Rs27, and then give it to us at the rates of Rs45-65. How is this fair?”
“I will tell you how it is fair, this is fair [..] because with all the hydel, solar, wind, nuclear, gas, and coal sources combined, the average price is Rs8.31, then how can you justify the rate of Rs27,” the minister said.
He said that despite the “concessions”, PM Shehbaz has directed the Power Division to “file a review petition to the regulator and limit the move”.
The minister said that if the government were to continue with the policy, “these 456,000 investors, their profit will go down from 50pc to 37pc per year. Is that so bad?”
He stressed that “no one was going to incur any losses”.
“If the electricity cost goes down by Rs1-1.5 for the general consumers and you still get a 37pc profit, then, how can you say that the policy does not serve public interest?” he said.
“Yet, the prime minister has directed us to wait until the NEPRA hearing,” he added.
The minister said that the prime minister further directed the Power Division to develop a strategy to “lessen the burden on others caused by net-metering solar consumers”.
MNA Sharmila Faruqui terms action ‘daylight robbery’
Faruqui, in response to the minister’s remarks, objected to the minister for “shifting the blame to net-metering users for burdening the national grid”.
“These consumers are the ones who followed the government’s clean energy policy,” she said, stressing that the government had taken a “U-turn on their policies”.
“Now they are justifying it by blaming people who were at the forefront of your policy,” she said.
She maintained that the Power Division was “compensating for the cost incurred from line losses and transmission losses, their own inefficiency, inconsistency, corruption, line losses, capacity payments from the people”.
She termed the action “broad daylight robbery”.
In his response to Faruqui, the minister noted that the call to attention on the matter was no longer appropriate “since the prime minister has already said that the net-billing should be halted and the consumers will stay on net-metering for now”.
Addressing the list of issues pointed out by Faruqui, the minister held that “while other issues existed, this is still an important issue that is raising the price of power for all consumers on the grid.
“With this in rationalisation in mind, the regulations were introduced,” he added.</p><small>2026-02-12 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/11235047d788238.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972556/ex-army-chief-qamar-javed-bajwa-hospitalised-after-fall' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa hospitalised after fall</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Former chief of army staff Gen (retd) Qamar Javed Bajwa has been admitted to a military hospital after sustaining injuries in a fall at his home.
Inter-Services Public Relations confirmed this on Thursday, a day after the incident was initially reported.
The military’s media affairs wings said in a statement that the former army chief was under treatment at the Combined Military Hospital after the fall.
An informed source, which also confirmed the reports of Bajwa’s fall, earlier told Dawn that he suffered injuries after slipping at his residence.
He was admitted to the hospital’s intensive care unit. While the extent of his injuries was not immediately clear, he was reported to be in stable condition.
‘100pc out of danger’
In a video message released on social media, the former army chief’s brother-in-law, Naeem Ghumman, said Bajwa was “barefoot when he slipped and suffered a head injury”.
He added that nothing “suspicious came up” following his medical examination, and all necessary tests were conducted.
Ghumman stated that the former army chief is “100 per cent out of danger”.
Bajwa, 65, served as the 10th chief of army staff from Nov 29, 2016, to Nov 29, 2022, with an extension in his tenure granted in 2019.
Since retiring in late 2022, Bajwa has largely stayed out of the public eye.</p><small>2026-02-12 09:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1212300016c11e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972708/what-facilities-does-pti-founder-imran-khan-have-access-to-in-prison' target='_blank'><strong>What facilities does PTI founder Imran Khan have access to in prison?</strong></a><br><p>Advocate Salman Safdar formally submitted to the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday a seven-page report regarding incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan’s living conditions at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, amid concern from his party over his treatment.
The PTI lawyer, who was appointed amicus curaie to visit Adiala jail, told the media after submitting the report that he met the PTI founder and visited his cell. At the time, he refused to divulge details of the report to the media.
A copy of the report, available with Dawn, detailed the conditions of Imran’s confinement, including the facilities provided during his incarceration.
Daily routine and diet
According to the report, Imran’s daily routine varies between summer and winter.
“He takes breakfast at around 9:45am, followed by recitation of the Holy Qur’an from approximately 11:30am for about an hour,” the report said, adding that breakfast consisted of coffee, porridge and a few dates.
“He then undertakes physical exercise using the limited equipment available to him, including an exercise bike, two nine-kilogramme weights, and a bar,” the report said.
“At around 1:15pm, after showering, he is permitted to access the strolling shed within the secured compound, where he may sit or walk.”
According to the report, the PTI leader takes lunch between 3:30pm and 4pm — according to a meal plan selected by himself and financed by his family — and at 5pm he is again allowed a brief walk. The lunch plan consists “two days of chicken, two days of meat, two days of lentils (daal), and/or two days of ‘chaat’/snacks”.
“From approximately 5:30pm until 10am the following morning, he remains confined to his cell,” it said.
It added that Imran did not take a full meal at dinner, instead consuming “fruit, milk and dates”. He further said that bottled Nestle drinking water was available to him.
Confinement cell, hygiene
According to the report, Imran’s designated cell contains a chair, table, bed, and a hanger.
The report stated that “lighting and ventilation are sufficient during both daytime and nighttime”. Imran also informed Safdar that no utensils, crockery or cutlery were kept inside the cell.
Regarding cleanliness, the report shared that a mushaqati (convicted labourer) had been deputed to assist with washing and cleaning, including changing the bedding and maintaining the cleanliness of the cell as well as the washroom.
“He (Imran) expressed no complaint in this regard and stated that he is satisfied with the cleanliness arrangements,” the report said, adding that toiletries were provided to him “whenever demanded”.
Safdar reported that upon inspection of the cell, the bedding provided consisted of “one single-bed mattress, four pillows, and two blankets”.
A toilet was observed within the cell, measuring approximately four and a half feet by four and a half feet and partitioned by a five-foot wall. Outside the toilet area, it added, a wash basin with access to “both hot and cold water” and a mirror were present.
“With regard to cleanliness, some room for improvement in sanitary conditions of the toilet was observed,” the report said.
It also added that the cell had two openings of roughly two by two feet on opposite ends of the ceiling to allow for cross-ventilation. However, it called attention to the lack of an exhaust system installed in the cell despite the presence of the toilet.
The report further noted a carpet mat on the floor of the cell and several belongings of the ex-premier, including a prayer mat and counter (tasbeeh), personal care items such as a shaving kit and mouthwash, and “approximately 100 books”.
Safety and amenities
The report stated that Imran was given a “small-sized heater/blower” in his living cell during the winter months and that hot water was available at all times.
However, he said that during the summer months, his living conditions were “particularly difficult due to extreme heat and humidity” as well as insects and mosquitoes.
Despite an installed room cooler and mosquito repellent, the measures “do not sufficiently mitigate the prevailing conditions”, the report said. This, according to the ex-premier, affected his quality of rest during the summer period.
Notably, Imran also reported that there was no refrigerator provided in the confinement cell, and the cool box provided to him was “not always effective” during extreme weather. Imran expressed discontent in this regard and said that he had experienced food poisoning two to three times during the summer months.
Regarding his safety and security, however, Safdar reported “no concerns” from the incarcerated PTI leader, saying that there were approximately 10 surveillance cameras installed in the compound for monitoring purposes.
“He further stated that while one camera has coverage up to the shower area, there is no camera installed inside the room/cell itself,” the report said.
Overall, it said that the premier expressed no concern over his safety.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650447-imran-khan-left-with-just-15-sight-in-right-eye-claims-medical-report' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan claims only 15% vision remains in his right eye</strong></a><br><p>

The killer, who police identified as Jesse Van Rootselaar, died by suicide after the shooting on Tuesday in Tumbler Ridge, a remote community of 2,400 people in the Pacific province of British Columbia.
Police revised the death toll down to nine, including Van Rootselaar, from the initially reported ten.
On more than one occasion, Van Rootselaar had been apprehended under the provincial Mental Health Act for an assessment, said Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in British Columbia. She once attended the school but dropped out four years ago.



“Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental health with respect to our suspect,” McDonald said.
Unlike the United States, school shootings are almost unheard of in Canada, and federal politicians initially struggled to maintain their composure.
“We will get through this. We will learn from this,” a visibly upset Prime Minister Mark Carney told reporters.
Carney, who at one point looked close to tears, postponed a trip to Europe and ordered flags on all government buildings to be flown at half-mast for the next seven days.
Hours later, legislators in the House of Commons observed a minute’s silence and listened as a sombre Carney said the killings had left the country in shock and mourning.
“It is a town of miners, teachers, construction workers – families who have built their lives there, people who have always shown up for each other there … Tumbler Ridge represents the very best of Canada,” he said.
McDonald said Van Rootselaar, who was born male but began identifying as female six years ago, had first killed her mother, 39, and 11-year-old stepbrother at the family home.
She then went to the school, where she shot a 39-year-old woman teacher as well as three 12-year-old female students and two male students, one aged 12 and one aged 13. Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun.
Dozens were injured, and two severely wounded victims, aged 12 and 19, remain in hospital.
Police officers who arrived at the scene two minutes after the initial call encountered active gunfire, including rounds fired in their direction, according to authorities, before discovering Van Rootselaar dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound.
“We do believe the suspect acted alone … it would be too early to speculate on motive,” McDonald told a press conference, saying police did not have information to suggest that anyone had been specifically targeted.
Several prominent world leaders sent messages of condolence. King Charles, Canada’s head of state, said he was “profoundly shocked and saddened” by the deaths.
Shooting among deadliest in Canadian history
Details about some of the victims were slowly emerging on Wednesday.
In an anguished Facebook post, Abel Mwansa said his 12-year-old son, also named Abel, had died in the shooting. Abel had once cried when his father proposed homeschooling because he loved going to school so much, his father wrote.
He raised his son, Mwansa added, to respect his elders, “be strong, work hard, put a smile on the face like I do, focus on his studies, never miss school and to be a good kid.” Another woman, Shanon Dycke, said her 12-year-old niece, Kylie May Smith, was among the victims.
“Pray for the other families who have lost their child, or are waiting to hear news,” she wrote on Facebook. “Just pray for Tumbler Ridge.” The attack sent shockwaves through the tiny community.
“Everybody knows everybody,” Jordon Kosik, a resident, said in an interview. “People don’t lock their homes. They don’t lock their cars. You can just go to your neighbour’s house, just walk right in.”
McDonald said police had seized firearms from the family residence about two years ago but returned them after the owner, who he did not identify, successfully appealed the decision.
Canada has stricter gun laws than the United States, but Canadians can own firearms with a licence.
Van Rootselaar previously had a firearms licence, but it expired in 2024. Canadians between the ages of 12 and 17 can obtain a minor’s firearms licence after taking a firearms safety course and passing tests.
The shooting ranks among the deadliest in Canadian history.
In April 2020, a 51-year-old man disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car shot and killed 22 people in a 13-hour rampage in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before police killed him at a petrol station.
In December 1989, a gunman killed 14 female students and wounded 13 at the École Polytechnique in Montreal, Quebec, before dying by suicide.
“There’s not a word in the English language that’s strong enough to describe the level of devastation that this community has experienced,” said Larry Neufeld, a local provincial legislator.
“It’s going to take a significant amount of effort and a significant amount of courage to repair that terror,” he told CBC News.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650424-sindh-university-dadu-campus-official-removed-over-viral-videos' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh University Dadu campus official removed after viral videos</strong></a><br><p>

The latest aid consignment was dispatched by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), with the support of Al-Khidmat Foundation.
This is the second aid consignment sent by Islamabad within the last week. Earlier, on Monday, the 28th consignment was dispatched.
Pakistan had sent the first aid consignment, including medicines and tents, for the people of Gaza on Oct 19, 2023, days after the Israeli bombardment began.







The relief goods were dispatched through a chartered flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore to Egypt’s Al-Arish airport for onward delivery to Gaza.
Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents.
Tel Aviv’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced most of its population and left much of the strip in ruins.
Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.</p><small>2026-02-12 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650437-ex-coas-bajwa-admitted-to-cmh-after-fall-at-residence-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Ex-COAS Bajwa admitted to CMH after fall at residence: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The referendum will give people a chance to vote on reforms to state institutions. Here is a look at why the referendum is being held, and what it entails.
Why is a referendum needed?
The referendum focuses on implementing the ‘July Charter’ drafted after the 2024 uprising to establish good governance, democracy, and social justice through institutional reforms, and to prevent “recurrence of authoritarian and fascist rule”.
The interim government that took power after Hasina’s ouster approved the charter’s implementation order in November, saying public approval was necessary for key changes.

What are people voting on?
Voters will decide on four major reforms, including the creation of new constitutional bodies and the introduction of a bicameral parliament, whose upper house majority approval shall be needed for constitutional amendments.
Other questions cover the implementation of 30 charter reforms — including term limits for prime ministers and enhanced presidential powers, along with broader changes in line with political parties’ commitments.
How is the referendum being held?
Each person will cast their vote by secret ballot.
If a majority votes in favour, a Constitutional Reform Council will be formed to complete the reforms within 180 working days from its first session.

Has Bangladesh held a referendum before?
Bangladesh held three referendums before the Hasina government abolished the provision in 2011. A High Court reinstated it in 2024 after she was ousted.
While the 1977 and 1985 referendums asked people if they had confidence in the then-presidents and their policies, the third, in 1991, asked whether Bangladesh should return from a presidential system to parliamentary democracy.
People overwhelmingly voted “yes” in all three referendums.
What do critics say?
The referendum has been criticised for denying voters the chance to decide on reforms individually, instead clubbing together multiple proposals to force a single yes-or-no answer.
Critics say this confuses voters by presenting a complicated premise and limits their ability to properly understand and debate the reforms.
The interim government and political parties have also drawn criticism for framing a “yes” vote as essential, which critics say shrinks space for dissent by implying voting “no” means rejecting reform altogether.

Over the past several years, floods have become a recurring test of who in this country is protected and who is not. According to figures compiled by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), the 2025 floods claimed at least 1,000 lives and affected nearly seven million people across the country.
Punjab was the hardest hit, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and parts of Gilgit-Baltistan, where crops spread over hundreds of acres were lost, homes were washed away, and entire communities were displaced.

 

Every time floods come, they bring with them a host of questions, all linked to their disproportionate impact: why do they affect some more than others? Why do some families lose everything while others rebuild within months? Why do they hit the same cities, same villages and same houses over and over again?
Because beyond the visible damage that floods wreak is a deeper truth that researchers have been highlighting for years: floods do not create vulnerability; they expose it. It is called social vulnerability.
What research says
Social vulnerability is not just about income. It reflects where people live, how secure their livelihoods are, whether institutions work for them, and whether they are included in decision-making. Vulnerability grows when exposure, sensitivity, and lack of capacity combine. That is a hard reality faced by millions in Pakistan every year.
Research across the world, and increasingly in Pakistan, shows that disasters are shaped by social conditions that exist long before hazards strike. Essentially, poverty, unsafe housing, weak services, poor planning, and lack of political voices determine who suffers most.
This is most evident in studies on Pakistan’s flood-prone regions. They expose how households with low education, poor housing, limited land, and weak access to health and social services experience the greatest losses and the slowest recovery.
Over one-third of households in flood-prone zones fall into high social vulnerability categories, research from both rural and urban areas shows. This means that even moderate floods can trigger long-term hardship. Informal settlements, which are often absent from official plans, mainly face the worst flooding and the least protection, despite housing essential urban labour.
These findings are not academic abstractions; they describe everyday realities.
When vulnerability turns into catastrophe
For Pakistan, the 2022 floods were a turning point. They affected over 30 million people, with economic losses exceeding $30 billion. Once again, the devastation followed familiar lines.
In Sindh, districts with poor housing, limited health services, and weak political representation remained under water for months — a reality that the coastal province, situated at the southern end, has lived with for years.
Studies later showed that women, small farmers, tenant cultivators, and landless households faced deeper and longer-lasting impacts, including debt, distress migration, and food insecurity. The floods did not just destroy homes; they reduced people’s ability to cope with future shocks.

 

When the floods returned in 2025, many families were only just beginning to recover from the previous disaster. In Punjab, prolonged river flooding, breaches, and overwhelmed drainage systems hit small farmers and daily-wage workers hardest. Many had already sold assets after previous floods. This time, there was nothing left to fall back on.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, flash floods and landslides struck mountainous districts where weak infrastructure and limited institutional reach turned rainfall into tragedy. In Gilgit-Baltistan, glacial melt and sudden floods damaged roads and homes, isolating valleys and exposing the growing vulnerability of mountain communities to climate extremes.
The lesson was clear: when vulnerability is ignored, and recovery is incomplete, disasters return — even if rainfall doesn’t.
The problem and the lesson
Vulnerability — the word holds more value than it is given. And Pakistan should definitely start taking stock of it because what the country lacks is not disaster authorities or policies, but a vulnerability-centred approach.
Disaster planning still prioritises physical infrastructure. Research shows that while embankments and roads matter, they cannot protect people who remain poor, excluded, and unsupported. Data gaps, weak coordination between institutions, limited local government capacity, and minimal community participation continue to undermine resilience efforts.
As a result, disasters are treated as temporary emergencies instead of symptoms of deeper governance failure.

 

Decades of vulnerability research point to one conclusion: resilience begins with governance. Reducing vulnerability requires institutions that are accountable, coordinated, and focused on people. Local governments must be empowered, land-use planning enforced fairly, social protection strengthened, and communities, especially women and the poor, should be involved in early warning, evacuation, and recovery.
Most importantly, vulnerability must be treated as a development issue, not just a disaster concern. When inequality is reduced and institutions work, disasters lose much of their power to destroy lives.
The floods of 2022 and 2025 were not just nature’s wrath. They were mirrors, reflecting how society is organised — who is protected and who is left exposed.
If Pakistan continues to rebuild infrastructure without rebuilding institutions, floods will keep returning to the same doorsteps. But if the country listens to what research has long shown and puts vulnerability reduction at the heart of governance, disasters can become survivable, recovery faster, and resilience real.
The rain will come again. The question is whether it will still find the same people waiting.

Spot gold edged 0.3 per cent lower to $5,063.11 per ounce by 04:53 GMT. It closed Wednesday with a more than 1pc gain.
US gold futures for April delivery lost 0.3pc to $5,083.90 per ounce.
“The stronger jobs report leading to a slight pare back in Fed rate-cut expectations may have played a role in gold’s lacklustre move,” said Christopher Wong, a strategist at OCBC.
The US dollar index rose following the surprisingly strong employment report that suggested underlying US economic health.
A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced metals more expensive for other currency holders.
“Sensitivity to the dollar, yield repricing, and uncertainty around Fed policy should continue to pose two-way risks for gold in the interim,” Wong said.
US job growth unexpectedly accelerated in January, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.3pc, though the largest increase in payrolls in 13 months likely exaggerates the labour market’s health, as revisions showed the economy added only 181,000 jobs in 2025 instead of the previously estimated 584,000.
The US budget deficit will grow slightly in fiscal 2026 to $1.853 trillion, the Congressional Budget Office forecast on Wednesday, showing that on balance, President Donald Trump’s economic policies are worsening the country’s fiscal picture amid low economic growth.
The Federal Reserve will keep rates unchanged through Chair Jerome Powell’s term ending in May but cut immediately afterward in June, a Reuters poll showed, with economists warning that policy under his likely successor, Kevin Warsh, could become too loose.
Investors now await the weekly jobless claims report on Thursday and inflation data on Friday for more cues on the Fed’s monetary policy path.

Visuals released earlier on Wednesday after the Netanyahu-Rubio meeting showed them holding a document with Netanyahu’s signature on Israel joining the board.
Netanyahu said on X that he “signed Israel’s accession as a member of the ‘Board of Peace’”. He later discussed Iran with Trump.







A UN Security Council resolution, adopted in mid-November, authorised the board and countries working with it to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire began in October under a Trump plan on which Israel and Hamas signed off.
Under Trump’s Gaza plan, the board was meant to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance. Trump thereafter said the board, with him as chair, would be expanded to tackle global conflicts.
The board will hold its first meeting on February 19 in Washington to discuss Gaza’s reconstruction.
Many rights experts say that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory’s affairs resembled a colonial structure. Israel’s presence on the board is expected to bring further criticism as the board does not include a Palestinian.
Countries have reacted cautiously to Trump’s invitation to join the board launched in late January. Many experts are concerned that the board could undermine the United Nations.
While some of Washington’s Middle Eastern allies have joined, many of its traditional Western allies have stayed away.
The ceasefire in Gaza has been repeatedly violated, with at least 580 Palestinians killed since it began in October, according to Palestinian and Israeli tallies, respectively.
The next phase of Trump’s Gaza plan calls for resolving complex issues like Hamas’s disarmament, which the group has long rejected, further Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.
Israel’s invasion of Gaza has killed over 72,000, according to Gaza’s health ministry, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza’s entire population.
Multiple rights experts, scholars and a UN inquiry say it amounts to genocide.</p><small>2026-02-12 06:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650404-imran-khans-eye-examination-must-be-conducted-before-feb-16-orders-sc' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's eye examination must be conducted before Feb 16, orders SC</strong></a><br><p>

Addressing the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s Sub-committee on South and Central Asia on Wednesday, Assistant Secretary of State Paul Kapur underscored Pakistan’s role in regional engagement and highlighted growing bilateral cooperation.
“Pakistan is another important partner in the region. We are working together with Pakistan to realise the potential of its critical mineral resources, combining US government seed financing with private sector know-how would benefit both of our countries,” he told the sub-committee.
Referring to broader economic engagement, Kapur said: “Our trade in energy and agriculture is expanding as well.”
He also pointed to continued security cooperation between the two countries, adding: “And our ongoing counter-terrorism cooperation helps Pakistan combat internal security threats while addressing transnational dangers that can harm the US or our partners.”
During the subsequent question-and-answer session, lawmakers raised issues related to militancy, Pakistan’s past security strategy and broader regional dynamics.
Referring to Kapur’s academic work, a congressman noted that his book examined militancy and national security in Pakistan and asked whether militant groups based in South and Central Asia were operating in the United States.
Kapur said the purpose of his book had been to examine Pakistani strategy and how the Pakistani state had interacted with militant and terrorist groups.
When asked whether this meant that South and Central Asian militant groups were importing Sharia into the United States, Kapur said that as coherent or organised entities, such groups were not known to be operating in the country. He cautioned, however, that individual members could be present anywhere.
The assistant secretary of state added that one of the challenges in dealing with terrorism was that small numbers of individuals could blend into the general population, making their presence difficult to detect.
The hearing then turned to India’s role in the US strategy toward China. Asked how India was likely to support US efforts to counter what was described as an increasingly aggressive China, Kapur said an India that was able to develop independently, stand on its own and preserve its freedom of action served US strategic interests.
He said the broader objective was to prevent China, or any single hegemonic power, from dominating the region or imposing leverage over it. An independent India, he said, reduced China’s ability to become a dominant power across the Indo-Pacific.
Responding to a question on China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Kapur said India’s economic development, infrastructure growth and independent military development constrained Beijing’s ability to expand its influence.
At the hearing, lawmakers from both parties underscored the stakes of US engagement in South Asia. House Foreign Affairs Sub-committee on South and Central Asia Chairman Bill Huizenga said Washington’s approach must be broad-based and values-driven. “Our strategy in South Asia must be comprehensive, anchored in strong partnerships, economic engagement, and a commitment to democratic values,” he said.
Democratic concerns focused on recent regional crises and the direction of US diplomacy. Congresswoman Sydney Kamlager-Dove (CA-37), the ranking member of the sub-committee, recalled that India and Pakistan “fought their most serious military conflict in decades” in May, warning that the confrontation risked nuclear escalation in a region home to nearly two billion people.
She said the episode should have reinforced “the indispensable role of US diplomacy,” but argued that this was eclipsed by President Trump’s insistence on taking credit for the cease-fire and his offer to mediate the Kashmir dispute.
Kamlager-Dove also voiced alarm over Afghanistan, saying she feared it was “only a matter of time” before the administration moves toward recognising the Taliban without securing meaningful improvements in the rights of Afghan women and girls—an outcome she described as unconscionable.
Testifying before the panel, Kapur said the US has begun offering financial assistance to Afghans to return home as it works to close a long-standing camp in Qatar. More than 1,100 people have been held at the former US Army base Camp As Sayliyah (CAS) since early 2025, when the Trump administration halted resettlement for Afghans fearing Taliban reprisals for their ties to US forces.
“We are not forcibly repatriating Afghans to Afghanistan. Some have gone of their own volition, but we’re not forcing anybody,” Kapur said, noting that roughly 150 had accepted the payments, though their status after returning was unknown.</p><small>2026-02-12 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650394-security-official-denounces-achakzais-unfortunate-remarks-on-pakistan-army' target='_blank'><strong>Security official denounces Achakzai's 'unfortunate remarks' on Pakistan Army</strong></a><br><p>

He was chairing a meeting at the Central Police Office to review the implementation of reform measures in the Punjab Police under the ‘Fast, Fearless, Transparent Justice’ initiative.
He said that panic buttons were being installed outside police stations so that citizens could immediately lodge complaints in case of any misconduct or lack of hearing.
He directed that at all police stations, offices, checkpoints, and Khidmat Marakaz, citizens should be addressed respectfully as “sir or madam” and “sahib or sahiba”. He said that counseling and training of officers and personnel would be arranged to improve the overall perception of Punjab Police’s conduct.

IGP also speaks to citizens through 1787 Complaint Centre

It was made clear that officials involved in corruption, abuse of authority, and misconduct would face immediate and strict accountability.
The IGP directed that CCTV cameras installed in all police stations be kept fully operational and backup systems be ensured.
A modern control and monitoring room was being activated at the Central Police Office for effective monitoring of police stations, while through the Safe Cities mechanism, direct monitoring of police stations, SHOs, moharrirs, and investigation rooms would be carried out.
He emphasised on making core policing, supervision, and the command system more effective for crime control and said that Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was herself overseeing all police reform measures.
The meeting also issued instructions to strictly enforce traffic laws and to continue the crackdown against violations.
He said that the investigation process and the activities of citizens visiting police stations would be fully recorded and that key performance indicators (KPIs) scorecards would be implemented in practical terms. He said that he was himself calling applicant citizens from the Central Police Office to obtain feedback.
He directed RPOs and DPOs to initiate direct contacts and meetings for redressal of citizens’ grievances, while in cases of abuse, harassment, and violence, investigations involving affected women and children should be conducted within the bounds of complete civility and respect. Instructions were also given to resolve cases of women and children on a priority basis with the help of data from Virtual Women Police Stations and the Center for Child Safety.
Meanwhile, the IGP initiated direct contact with citizens through the 1787 Complaint Center and spoke with several citizens via phone calls. He obtained information about the duration of redressal of received applications and complaints, police response, and overall conduct.
Citizens also shared their feedback regarding the actions taken and responses by the police.
Mr Kareem directed RPOs, DPOs, and other supervisory officers to take immediate action on citizens’ applications and provide relief without delay.
He further directed that all complaints received via phone calls, SMS, email, and other channels be resolved immediately in accordance with the prescribed timelines and SOPs.
He urged citizens to register complaints on 1787 in case of any irregularity or misconduct by the police force.
The IGP received a detailed briefing on the 1787 dashboard and complaints from across the regions.
During the briefing, Punjab Additional IG Imran Arshad, Additional IG (Internal Accountability) Imran Mehmood, Additional IG (Logistics) Fawad-ud-Din Qureshi, AIG Inspection, AIG Operations, and other officers were also present.

Advocate Safdar, who was appointed amicus curaie to visit Adiala jail, told the media after submitting his report that he met the PTI founder and also visited his cell.
However, he refrained from divulging what he came across during his meeting or recommended in his report, saying his first responsibility was to submit his report to the SC.
On Thursday, a two-judge SC bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, will resume the hearing of the case regarding living conditions of the ex-premier in Adiala jail.
Mr Safdar explained that PTI founder’s sister Aleema Khan and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja “understood his compulsion that he could not talk to them about his report”, which was assigned to him by the court.
He made it clear that he did not inform any of them about the health or living condition of Mr Khan.
Advocate Safdar also denied making any statement on Mr Khan’s health on Tuesday, making it clear that if anything was attributed to him in this regard it was “misrepresented and misreported”.
Before the appointment of Advocate Safdar as ‘friend of the court’ on Tuesday, Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan had informed the Supreme Court that he had “submitted a written response to the chamber in light of the order of Aug 24, 2023”.
The SC had directed the AGP to submit a report on Mr Khan’s living conditions in jail, he said, adding that the PTI founder was in Attock jail at the time of the order. “We had submitted a written report to the chamber on Aug 28, 2023,” the AGP said, adding that a medical report was also submitted.
Subsequently, the court appointed Advocate Safdar as amicus with direction to visit the Adiala jail and meet Imran Khan. In the court order, it was noted that the report submitted by the AGP pertained to the period when the ex-premier was imprisoned in Attock jail in 2023. Hence, the court considered it appropriate that a report regarding the present living conditions of the petitioner in jail be submitted.

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif stepped in on Wednesday to seek a review of Nepra’s revised rules for rooftop solar users, while the power regulator simultaneously rubber-stamped a government plan to impose hefty fixed charges on residential consumers.
The premier also directed the Power Division to file a review petition against the regulator’s move regarding new solar regulations.
On Monday, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) revised the terms for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — on the pretext of rising solar penetration and the need to protect an expensive and inefficient state-run power network. The notification effectively ended the net-metering regime and shifted prosumers to net billing.
A statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said the premier had taken “immediate notice” of the matter, following criticism in the Senate from lawmakers across party lines, including ruling ally PPP and opposition PTI.







The PMO quoted the prime minister as directing the Power Division to file a review petition before Nepra “to ensure every possible safeguard of the existing consumer contracts”.
He was of the view that the “burden of 466,000 users benefitting from solar should not be put on 37.6 million domestic consumers” receiving electricity directly from the national grid. “Power Division should chalk out a comprehensive strategy in this regard,” he said.
The directives were issued during a high-level meeting chaired by the prime minister on the new Nepra regulations. The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Power Minister Awais Leghari, Economic Affairs Minister Ahad Cheema, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani and the prime minister’s adviser Muhammad Ali.
Speaking in the Senate on Tuesday, Mr Leghari defended Nepra’s move, saying it was aimed at easing the burden on consumers. “Changing regulations according to the law and the Constitution is a regulator’s job,” he said, adding that he would not step back. “This is not policy; there should be clarity on that,” he maintained.
Stakeholders and policy experts have warned that the proposed Prosumer Regulations 2025 could undermine a decade of citizen-led expansion in clean energy.
Under the new regulations, registered prosumers will be immediately shifted to net billing in place of net metering, and their exported units will be credited for one month instead of the current three months. Other terms will remain unchanged until their seven-year contracts expire.
Under net billing, electricity generated by a prosumer is purchased by the relevant distribution company (Disco), and the consumer is billed for electricity imported from the grid at about Rs37-55 per unit (depending on the slab) after receiving credit for exports at the National Average Energy Purchase Price (NAEPP) of around Rs10 per unit.
The new rules bar prosumers from installing solar power systems for net metering beyond their originally sanctioned load, effectively reducing the capacity limit by 50 per cent.
Nepra approves fixed charges
Meanwhile, Nepra on Wednesday approved a government decision to impose about Rs132bn in fixed charges on more than 28.5m residential electricity consumers, at rates ranging from Rs200 to Rs675 per kilowatt per month of sanctioned load.
The regulator’s fast-tracked approval of the federal government’s Feb 4 decision will come into retrospective effect from February, increasing the effective unit price by up to 75pc for the lowest strata with a declining scale for higher consumption groups. The Rs132bn fixed charges do not include about Rs24bn general sales tax and other taxes, surcharges and duties.
This will adequately address cross-subsidy on industrial consumers, reducing their average tariff by Rs4.04 per unit as announced by the prime minister to make export products competitive in the global market. For the first time, the burden of cross-subsidy on the industrial sector has come to zero.
Given “the fact that the revised tariff proposed by the federal government is within the determined consolidated revenue requirement of all the XWDISCOs (ex-Wapda distribution companies) and already budgeted tariff differential subsidy (TDS) of Rs249bn for the calendar year 2026, the authority has no objection in approving the motion”, Nepra wrote in its decision to the government for formal publication in the Gazette of Pakistan.
The revised schedule of tariff shows that new fixed charges have been imposed on monthly consumption of up to 300 units, raised for the 400-600 unit slabs and slightly scaled down for higher users to discourage defection from the grid.
As a result, the average power tariff (including energy and capacity components) for both protected and non-protected consumers in the first 100-unit slab has risen by 76pc, or Rs8 per unit, and 73.5pc, or Rs16.5 per unit, respectively, following the imposition of fixed char­ges at Rs200 and Rs275 per kilowatt of sanctioned load.
More than 22m consumers fall into these two categories. “This is the highest-ever price hike for this consumer category since the creation of separate distribution, generation and transmission companies in the early 1990s,” a senior official told Dawn.
For protected consumers using 101-200 units, the average cost has increased by Rs4 per unit, or 31pc, due to a Rs300-per-kW fixed monthly charge, while the non-protected category in the same slab has seen a rise of Rs6 per unit, or 21pc.
Consumers in the 200-300 unit slab will face a Rs350-per-kW fixed charge per month, lifting their average price by 12.7pc, or Rs4.20 per unit. About 5.6 million consumers fall into this group.
The fixed rate for the 301-400 unit category has been doubled to Rs400 per kW from Rs200, raising average unit rates by 6.5pc, or Rs2.5 per unit, despite a slight downward adjustment in base tariffs. More than two million consumers are in this bracket.
Higher-consumption households will also face increases. The fixed rate for the 401-500 unit slab has been raised to Rs500 per kW from Rs400, and to Rs675 per kW for the 501-600 slab, resulting in a 5.8pc, or Rs2.30-per-unit, rise in average tariffs, even after a Rs1.25-per-unit cut in base rates.
For consumers using 601-700 units a month, the fixed charge has been reduced to Rs675 per kW from Rs800, while those exceeding 700 units will also pay Rs675 per kW instead of Rs1,000. Nevertheless, both groups will still see average-rate increases of Rs2 and Rs1.80 per unit, or about 5pc and 4pc, respectively.
Only time-of-use consumers with sanctioned loads above 5kW will benefit from an average reduction of about 7pc, or Rs3.30 per unit, after the abolition of their Rs1,000-per-kW fixed charge in view of peak rates of Rs47 per unit, excluding taxes and duties. Even they, however, will face a 6pc, or Rs2.5-per-unit, rise during off-peak hours.
An official said the Power Division had estimated that the fixed charges would generate an additional Rs132bn for distribution companies, although another calculation suggested the inflow could exceed Rs250bn because most residential subsidies had been eliminated.

The report highlights that prolonged litigation and judicial delays in tax matters have kept vast amounts of public revenue locked in courts, adversely affecting fiscal stability and economic circulation.
To address this critical challenge, the IHC chief justice introduced a series of strategic administrative and judicial reforms aligned with the policy directions of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee (NJPMC).
A central pillar of this reform agenda was the constitution of specialised division benches dedicated exclusively to tax and revenue cases — a step aimed at ensuring focused hearings, uniform legal interpretation and faster resolution of high-value disputes.
Two specialised division benches were formed for this purpose. One bench comprised Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, while another included Justice Muhammad Azam Khan and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas. Later, Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz also served on a tax bench with Justice Sattar, further strengthening the court’s capacity to clear the backlog.

Between April 1, 2025, and Feb 4, 2026, the specialised benches decided 788 tax and revenue cases, involving a total disputed amount of Rs506.13bn.
According to bench-wise data, the bench led by Justice Azam Khan and Justice Minhas decided 178 cases, accounting for the largest share of revenue — approximately Rs456.18bn.
The benches headed by Justice Babar Sattar, along with Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz, collectively decided 610 cases, involving more than Rs49.9bn.
The adjudication of these cases resulted in the vacation of stay orders that had previously prevented the FBR from enforcing tax recovery, thereby unlocking substantial funds that had remained tied up in litigation for years.
The high court noted that this intervention has significantly contributed to the early realisation of public revenue, stren­gthening the national fiscal stream and supporting broader economic objectives.
The annual report describes the initiative as a “targeted, result-oriented case management strategy”, demonstrating how judicial specialisation can produce “tangible economic and institutional benefits within a relatively short period”.
Beyond tax matters, the report outlines broader institutional reforms aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency. The court expedited the disposal of over 3,000 bail applications during the year, facilitated by the establishment of a dedicated police cell within court premises to ensure rapid service of notices and timely production of records.
Fauji Wind Energy sales tax dispute
Meanwhile, the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi Bench set aside a judgement of the appellate tribunal of the Punjab Revenue Authority (PRA) in a sales tax dispute involving Fauji Wind Energy, declaring the proceedings illegal and without lawful jurisdiction.
A Division Bench comprising Justice Jawad Hassan and Justice Mirza Viqas Rauf allowed sales tax reference and quashed the show-cause notice, order-in-original, and the appellate tribunal’s order dated Feb 25, 2025.
Justice Jawad Hassan authored the judgement, relying on earlier precedents including Fauji Cement Company Limited vs Government of Punjab and Rahat Cafe, Rawalpindi vs Government of Punjab, holding that the PRA had exceeded its statutory and territorial authority.
The case stemmed from a show-cause notice issued on June 15, 2016, in which the PRA alleged that Fauji Wind Energy failed to withhold Punjab Sales Tax on services received during the period July 1, 2014, to June 30, 2015, involving payments exceeding Rs3.05bn and an alleged tax liability of Rs488 million.
The court ruled that the PRA lacked jurisdiction because the services were received and consumed in Sindh, where the company’s wind power operations are located, and not in Punjab.

Up until now, the minimum legal age for marriage in Punjab was 18 years for men and 16 years for women under the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Act, 1929.
This has changed with the promulgation of the Punjab Child Marriage Restraint Ordinance 2026, under which offenders could face up to seven years in prison and fines of up to Rs1 million.
The law comes into effect immediately across the province and was promulgated under Article 128(1) of the Constitution as the Punjab Assembly is not in session.
Under the new legal framework, nikah khawans (marriage registrars) have been barred from registering child marriages and could face imprisonment of up to one year and fine of Rs100,000 in case of violations.
Similarly, adults contracting marriage with a child will face rigorous imprisonment of up to three years but not less than two years, as well as a fine of up to Rs500,000.
The ordinance also criminalises cohabitation resulting from a child marriage as “child abuse”, carrying penalties of five to seven years’ imprisonment and a minimum fine of Rs1 million.
It also introduces strict punishments for child trafficking linked to marriage and holds guardians accountable for promoting or failing to prevent underage marriages.
It further stated that if a guardian or any other person in any capacity, lawful or unlawful, committed any act to promote child marriage, child abuse or permitted child marriage to be solemnised, or intentionally or negligently failed to prevent it from being solemnised, they will be punished with rigorous imprisonment between two to three years and will also be liable to a fine of up to Rs500,000.
All offences under the ordinance have been declared cognisable, non-bailable and non-compoundable, and will be tried exclusively by Courts of Session, with cases to be concluded within 90 days.
According to the statement of objects and reasons, the ordinance is aimed at modernising child protection laws in Punjab, removing gender discrimination in minimum marriage age, and strengthening legal safeguards against exploitation and abuse.</p><small>2026-02-11 19:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650333-kp-male-faculty-barred-from-meeting-female-students-in-offices-at-public-universities' target='_blank'><strong>KP male faculty barred from meeting female students in offices at public universities</strong></a><br><p>
