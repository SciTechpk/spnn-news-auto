According to a press release by the CM’s office, the initiative aims to ease traffic congestion, improve public safety, and boost economic activity in the provincial capital.
The meeting, held at CM House, was attended by Local Government Minister Nasir Shah, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi, Finance Secretary Fayaz Jatoi, Secretary to the CM Raheem Shaikh, and other relevant officers.
Nasir informed the chief minister that 24 TMCs across Karachi had requested funding to repair severely dilapidated roads and streets. Due to financial constraints, these TMCs were unable to carry out the works independently.
Wahab reported that 409 roads across seven districts of Karachi needed rehabilitation, including 400 requiring patch repairs and nine requiring complete reconstruction.







According to a breakdown presented by Nasir, a total of 409 roads across Karachi’s seven districts have been identified for rehabilitation at an estimated cost of Rs10.93bn.
Of these, 400 roads would undergo patchwork repairs, while nine roads would be reconstructed to address severe structural damage. An additional 15 per cent allocation of Rs1.64bn was needed for sewerage and water supply projects, bringing the total project cost for this component to Rs12.57bn, the mayor stated.
Citing district-wise estimates, the press release said Malir District had the highest number of roads identified for repair (98), followed by West (81), Central (53), South (50), East (49), Korangi (39) and Keamari (39).
The highest tentative cost was estimated for Keamari District at Rs2.32bn, followed by West at Rs2.31bn and East at Rs1.85bn.
The meeting was informed that 24 TMCs will implement internal road rehabilitation schemes within their respective jurisdictions.
These include major allocations for TMC Manghopir (Rs1.75bn), TMC Gadap (Rs960 million), TMC Baldia (Rs944m) and TMC Mauripur (Rs858m).
Most TMC schemes involve patchwork repairs, while selected roads in Gulberg, Gulshan, Jinnah, Sohrab Goth, Orangi, Manghopir, Saddar, and Landhi would undergo end-to-end rehabilitation, the statement noted.
CM Murad recalled his previous instructions issued at a meeting on January 7, where he had directed that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) would rehabilitate 26 major roads.

 

During the meeting, Wahab presented the KMC’s assessment estimates, which put costs at Rs5.53bn for road reconstruction and resurfacing.
Another Rs1bn were estimated for urgent water and sewerage repairs to be managed by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), Rs1bn for stormdrain retention wall construction and reinforcement, and Rs1bn for streetlight installation and upgrades.
The total estimated expenditure for KMC-led works was Rs8.53bn, according to the press release.
CM Murad stressed that prompt rehabilitation of Karachi’s roads was essential for economic growth and public convenience. He instructed departments to fast-track approval processes and “ensure transparent and high-quality execution of all projects”.
“Amenities for the public and the safety of citizens remain the top priorities of the Sindh government,” the chief minister was quoted as saying.
He further directed authorities to guarantee “transparency, quality and timely completion of all approved schemes”.
The Sindh CM also directed the Finance Department to release funds immediately so that development work on damaged roads, sewerage systems and streetlights could commence.
Nasir informed the chief minister that the total cost of the TMC mega scheme stands at Rs10.93bn, comprising Rs10.68bn for road patchwork and Rs248m for complete road rehabilitation.
An additional 15pc (Rs1.64bn) was earmarked for sewerage and water supply works, while 5pc (Rs628m) was allocated for Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) charges, and 1pc (Rs125m) for contingency expenses. The overall TMC-related project cost has been estimated at Rs13.32bn.
CM Murad directed all relevant departments and TMCs to ensure coordinated execution of road, sewerage and water supply works to avoid repeated digging and inconvenience to citizens.
He reiterated that transparency, quality control, and timely completion would be strictly monitored.
In a similar initiative taken in November, CM Murad approved a plan presented by Wahab and announced a Rs25bn special package for Karachi after heavy rains caused extensive damage to road infrastructure.</p><small>2026-01-23 10:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/23140709a270b73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968611/7-rescued-4-missing-after-merchant-vessel-hits-fishing-boat-off-karachis-manora' target='_blank'><strong>7 rescued, 4 missing after merchant vessel hits fishing boat off Karachi’s Manora</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Seven people were rescued while a search operation was underway to find four others missing after a merchant vessel hit a fishing boat off Manora Beach on Friday morning.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that seven people had been rescued, with four still missing, in the incident.
In a separate statement, Karachi’s Edhi Information Centre said search efforts were ongoing for the missing individuals.
DIG Raza detailed that the incident took place in a channel of the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) at about 2am, when a civil fishing boat named Al-Shahbaz was hit by merchant vessel Kang Huan.
“All fishermen on the boat jumped into the sea, and the fishing boat toppled down,” the police officer added. Subsequently, rescue operations were initiated by HPO, the Pakistan Maritime Security Agency and the KPT.
“Seven persons were rescued by another fishing boat,” DIG Raza said, adding that four were still missing.
“The recovered fishermen were taken to the hospital via Edhi ambulance from Keamari Jetty,” the DIG said.

In its statement, the Edhi service had said: “A boat capsized at Manora Beach and multiple people sank, of which six people were recovered alive with the aid of Edhi’s marine aid team.”
A week ago, a boat carrying eight residents of Karachi capsized in the open sea near Keti Bandar. The incident left one person dead and another missing, while six others were rescued by local fishermen.
In September, a fisherman drowned and three survived when their boat capsized near Port Qasim due to strong winds.</p><small>2026-01-23 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/646745-national-assemblys-youtube-channel-disappears-as-proceedings-go-off-air' target='_blank'><strong>National Assembly's YouTube channel disappears as proceedings go off-air</strong></a><br><p>

Friday’s session was summoned by President Asif Ali Zardari a day earlier, and was presided over by National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.
The fire that erupted at Gul Plaza last week has left at least 67 people dead in its wake. The plaza, parts of which have collapsed due to the blaze, was a ground-plus-three building with 1,200 shops spread over 8,000 square yards.
In the resolution passed today, the parliament expressed solidarity with the families of the victims and took note of the “reported shortcomings that turned an accident into a mass tragedy,” calling for systemic reforms.
“The Parliament offers its heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families of the deceased and prays for the swift recovery of the injured,” the resolution read.
It also paid tribute to firefighter Furqan Ali, who embraced martyrdom while battling the deadly fire.
In the joint resolution, the parliament urged the Sindh government to “ensure compensation to the families of victims and immediate recovery of the businesses affected.”
“Immediately undertake a city-wide emergency fire-risk audit of all commercial and residential buildings,” the resolution read, adding that the number of fire stations and firefighting equipment should be increased as well.
It also called upon the federal government to “facilitate and provide necessary support to the Provincial Government of Sindh in this crisis situation.”
The parliament vowed to “stand in unanimous solidarity with the people of Karachi and the victims’ families in this hour of immense grief”.
It further demanded that “lasting action” should be taken so that “lives lost in Gul Plaza will not go in vain.”
Senator Sherry Rehman calls on govt to play its part
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman, in her address to the joint session, expressed support for the resolution, calling on the federal government to play its part in supporting Karachi.
“Gul Plaza tragedy has been heartbreaking for all of us,” she said, adding that it was particularly difficult for “families who were awaiting the recovery of their loved ones’ bodies”.
During her address, the PPP leader underscored the need for readjusting resources as per population.
Taking note of MQM-P’s demand of handing over Karachi to the federal government, she said, “PPP has many, many contributions to Karachi, and while everyone has a right to criticise, do not add fuel to the fire”.
She urged MQM-P to “not engage in politics over dead bodies, rather help us in the recovery efforts”.
Joint session passes 3 bills
The session also saw the passage of three bills, including the Daanish Schools Authority Bill 2025, the Human Rights (Amendment) Bill 2025, and the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025.
President Zardari returned these bills last month despite their passage by the Senate and the NA.
A day earlier, according to Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, the government had already taken other allied parties into confidence on the matter and assured them that all three bills would be passed in the joint sitting.
Also during the session, the opposition staged a protest as its members, led by leaders of the opposition in the NA and Senate, Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, respectively, gathered in front of the speaker’s dais.
The session was adjourned for an indefinite period.
JUI-F seeks discussion on Board of Peace
Meanwhile, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Senator Kamran Murtaza submitted an adjournment motion in the Senate, seeking discussion on Pakistan joining US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ without taking the parliament or cabinet into confidence.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and other world leaders signed the charter for the “Board of Peace” headed by Trump, who has billed the body as a platform for resolving international conflicts.
In a post on X, the JUI-F Senator said, “An adjournment motion has been submitted in the Senate on behalf of JUI-F regarding Pakistan’s inclusion in the Board of Peace.”







“The House may adjourn its normal business in order to discuss an issue of public importance, whereby the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. issued a statement, i.e. ‘Pakistan will join US President Donald Trump’s ‘Board of Peace to help achieve lasting peace in Gaza’ without taking the Parliament into confidence or without placing the matter before the Cabinet,” the motion read.
It added that such an approach was “against the saying of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.”
Achakzai condemns Imaan and Hadi’s arrest
Opposition leader in the NA Achakzai, while speaking in the National Assembly today, condemned the arrest of activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, stating that “targeting political dissenters violated the Constitution”.
The couple was arrested earlier today in Islamabad while they were reportedly en route to the district courts.
Achakzai stressed that the “freedom of expression and basic civil rights were being continuously curtailed in the country”.
“Using the law to protect the interests of a powerful class was unfortunate,” Acahkzai maintained, adding that such acts “severely undermined the public’s trust in state institutions”.
Achakzai demanded their release, calling for a “transparent and impartial” investigation into the arrest.</p><small>2026-01-23 09:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/231414364377cc2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968613/uk-man-faces-court-for-drugging-raping-ex-wife-over-13-years' target='_blank'><strong>UK man faces court for drugging, raping ex-wife over 13 years</strong></a><br><p>A British man is due to appear in court on Friday accused of drugging and raping his ex-wife over 13 years, alongside five other men also charged with sexual offences against her.
Philip Young, 49, is charged with 56 sexual offences against his former wife Joanne Young, 48, including rape and administering a substance with the intent to stupefy or overpower to allow sexual activity.
Joanne Young has waived her legal right to anonymity.
Voyeurism, possession of indecent images of children and possession of extreme images are among the other charges filed against Young, who is reportedly a former Conservative councillor.
He is yet to enter a plea, and was remanded in custody after a hearing in December.
Young is set to be joined by five other men, aged 31 to 61, also accused of various sexual offences against his ex-wife, at Winchester Crown Court, a criminal court in southeast England.
The alleged crimes took place between 2010 and 2023.
Norman Macksoni, 47, pleaded not guilty to one count of rape and possession of extreme images.
Dean Hamilton, 47, pleaded not guilty to one count of rape and sexual assault by penetration, as well as two counts of sexual touching.
The three others have not yet entered pleas.
They include Connor Sanderson-Doyle, 31, charged with sexual assault and sexual touching; Richard Wilkins, 61, charged with rape and sexual touching; and Mohammed Hassan, 37, charged with sexual touching.
The case bears echoes of a totally separate, unrelated 2024 trial in France in which Gisele Pelicot waived her right to anonymity to raise awareness about sexual violence.

 

Wiltshire Police detective superintendent Geoff Smith said in a statement in December that the UK case stemmed from a “complex and extensive investigation”.
“The victim in this case, Joanne, has taken the decision to waive her automatic legal right to anonymity,” he added.</p><small>2026-01-23 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/22110310503baf2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968042/the-interminable-wait-between-life-and-death-at-gul-plaza-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>The interminable wait between life and death at Gul Plaza in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>It wasn’t so much about the announcement or the declaration of death, muttered Qaiser, but the hours, minutes and seconds between the knowing and the not knowing — the brief yet interminable time of feeling suspended. On Tuesday, the elderly, bespectacled man entered his fourth day of waiting outside what used to be Gul Plaza.
Patches of dust, soot and perspiration stained his white shalwar kameez. His eyes drifted everywhere all at once, always searching but never landing anywhere. Every time a reporter approached him for an interview, he traded it for information: “Here is my phone number, please share the list of the dead whenever you get it,” he requested, and then proceeded to narrate his story.
“My begum loved to shop, and she found the perfect partners in my daughter and bahu,” Qaiser recalled. On Saturday evening, the three women ventured to Gul Plaza — a paradise for shopaholics in Karachi — with a strict 10pm curfew. It was broken, and since then, Qaiser had remained encamped in front of the shopping centre.
As of Wednesday, dozens of people who were trapped inside the plaza when the fire erupted were still missing. So far, 67 bodies or their remains had been recovered.


Fire trucks continue cooling work at Karachi’s Gul Plaza.

Outside Gul Plaza — now just an empty shell — fire trucks and water tankers stood close by, sporadically spraying water to cool the thick smoke emanating from the building. At a short distance, Edhi and Chhipa ambulances lined the road, the drivers inside them taking turns to rest their backs. Near the rear end of the mall, which had since caved in, dumper trucks made hourly rounds to clear carcasses and debris.
On the main road facing the plaza, a crowd of spectators had converged on the footpath, watching intently; dozens of others stood on the rooftops of nearby buildings to get a better view. Camps had also been set up nearby, and the volunteers seated there were quick to distribute water bottles to firefighters, policemen and rescue officials.
Movement never eluded Gul Plaza — not in life, nor in death. But even as rescue work continued, the air hung heavy with the weight of the wait, suspended in anticipation like a defendant about to hear the verdict.
Waiting for help to arrive
For Muhammad Shujat, who worked at an electronics shop at the plaza, patience was running thin on the fourth day. “It is better to die once than to die 100 times each waiting minute,” his shrill cry echoed through the morning breeze. “It is agony.”
Like Qaiser, he hadn’t been home since late Saturday night. He recalled leaving his shop “fully intact” at 9:30pm — the shutters were locked and the day’s earnings secured. “Around 10:45pm, I started getting calls that a fire had erupted at Gul Plaza.”
The 40-year-old reached the plaza within 15 minutes from his residence in Orangi Town, otherwise a 45-minute drive, where he was welcomed by chaos, screams and tears — all of which had been playing inside his brain on loop.
“I tried to get into my shop, which faces the main road, and frantically tried to secure the merchandise, but the flames were huge, unforgiving. All I could do instead was watch my livelihood burn before me and wait … wait for fire tenders, for divine intervention, for a miracle.”


Rescue teams clear debris of Gul Plaza building that collapsed after a blaze ripped through it.

Help did come, but a little too late. The first tenders arrived at the site nearly two hours after the fire broke out, Shujat recalled, and within five minutes they ran out of water. “Once again, we were told to wait, this time for water tankers that were coming from Sohrab Goth and Nipa Chowrangi.”
But by the time they arrived, Shujat’s shop — which, according to him, held items worth Rs3 billion — was reduced to ashes. There was nothing left to save.
“Theek hai [that’s fine],” he said. “They were merely objects, merely money, merely materials that can be built again … but what about the people? Faisal sahab, the neighbour; Asif sahab, the friend; Usman and Kamran, the porters — who will bring them back?”
Shujat’s remarks were not rhetorical; they were very much a question. He was waiting for them, even if dead, and he was ready to risk his life to get them out. “I am tired of waiting. I am ready to jump inside if I have to. I need them back.”
As he spoke, Shujat’s voice pitched higher, loud enough to attract the attention of policemen and Rangers personnel on duty. They began closing in on him to prevent any potential commotion, but before that could happen, Qaiser jumped in.
“Bhai, even I am frustrated … but we must wait,” he coaxed the fellow griever and then proceeded to embrace Shujat, who broke down instantly. Both found a spot at the footpath and sat together, waiting.
Waiting for empathy
A few steps from them, two men in yellow jackets inscribed with ‘Khidmat-i-Khalq Foundation’ walked back to a fire truck owned by the welfare organisation.
“It is hell inside … 100 degrees Celsius,” one of them announced.
“The building will fall … the walls are cracking, they are withering … sab kuch jal k raakh hogaya hai,” said the other.
Among them was Muhammad Khizer Khan, the head of the foundation’s Karachi division and one of the first to arrive at Gul Plaza that night. “On reaching the site, we got our fire trucks working,” he recounted to Dawn.
But what fight could two vehicles put up against a monster breathing flames?


One of the many help desks set up by welfare groups outside Gul Plaza.

According to his team’s findings, the fire broke out in the air conditioning unit and then spread toward the artificial flower shops on the mezzanine floor. “After waiting for two hours, when the KMC (Karachi Metropolitan Corporation) fire trucks finally arrived, they did not have snorkels, so the blaze on the top floors was not catered to.”
During every minute spent waiting, the fire gained strength, intensity, and control — eventually, it became a third-degree blaze. “Every time, we wait for the government to come up with a better response, every time we wait for them to act promptly, every time we fall for the empty promises they make to us.”
Suddenly, an announcement was made. A body was found, but it was unidentifiable — just bones. The engine of one of the Chhipa ambulances revved; the vehicle bounced over the road dug up for the rapid bus transit construction, off to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital. Several people, including Qaiser and Shujat, gathered, shooting questions, but they were all told to head to the medical facility and get DNA tests done. Chaos ensued.
Ehsan Waleed, whose cousin was missing, was among those searching. “We keep running here and there … when we go up to them, they tell us to wait; when we ask questions, they tell us to calm down. What do we do?” he asked.
“From the first day, we have been telling rescue officials to set up an information desk here (there is one at the district commissioner’s office) to facilitate and guide the families.
“They said they will. We are all still waiting.”
When the men in uniforms wait
For his part, Javed Irshad, deputy director of the KMC Fire Brigade, told Dawn that the department received a call regarding the Gul Plaza inferno a little after 10:30pm. In seven minutes, three fire trucks, each accompanied by a nine-member crew, were deployed.
“Our response time for any such incident is three minutes, which means that during this time span, the fire trucks and crew must be out of the station,” he explained. “But we cannot tell when it reaches the site because there are multiple factors at play, such as traffic jams, the condition of the roads …
“All of Karachi is dug up,” Irshad scoffed. The road opposite Gul Plaza was no different.
On reaching the site, an examination was conducted to check the connection points for water lines, turn off the electricity, and inspect the building. “But by that time, the fire had intensified to unprecedented levels; in my 36 years of experience, never have I seen this.”

 

He admitted that the fire trucks ran out of water, which then had to be summoned from the Karachi Water and Sewage Corporation-run hydrants, all located at a considerable distance from the site. “These are all operational challenges that we don’t have any control over; this doesn’t raise questions about our firefighters, their valour or bravery.”
“And they demonstrated this when they stepped inside the building despite extreme heat, when they remained calm even after being mistreated, and when our firefighter lost his life during the rescue operation,” Irshad added.


What remains of Gul Plaza after Saturday’s fire.

Rescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaanul Haseeb Khan narrated similar challenges during the operation: broken roads and traffic jams delayed the emergency response. “And when we reached the plaza, the entire area was jammed packed due to the weekend … to top it, a mob-like situation emerged.”
When the fire trucks ran out of water, it wasn’t just the people who were waiting, but Haseeb and his team did too. “As the intensity of the fire increased, we knew how difficult it would be to control it … but we could do nothing about the traffic or the broken roads or the narrow lanes or the people who just wanted to save their shops.”
Waiting for resources
At the same time, Irshad acknowledged the need for a bigger staff and better resources for the fire department.
According to international fire safety protocols, there must be one fire station for a population of 100,000. In Karachi — home to over 20 million as per the 2023 census — a meagre 28 fire stations are functional, which isn’t sufficient to meet even 10 per cent of the metropolis’ needs.
Ideally, every locality in the city should have a fire station with two fire trucks on service. During a Sindh Assembly session last month, it was revealed that Karachi only has 36 fire tenders, four snorkels and roughly 700 staff, when it actually needs about 200 stations and 34,000 staff.

The Sindh government tried to purchase 89 fire tenders in 2021, with 17 originally allocated to Karachi. The order was reduced to 35 vehicles, and Karachi’s share was cut and redistributed across the province to Hyderabad (10), Sukkur (7), Benazirabad (5), Mirpurkhas (5), and Larkana (8). None of them, however, has been delivered.
During the Gul Plaza inferno, the absence of this equipment manifested in the worst way possible. Haseeb of Rescue 1122 mentioned how lighting was a key issue as his men worked in near-total darkness, trying to navigate through narrow stairwells.
“We are sifting through every particle of dust and ash here … we are looking for not just a human body but body parts,” he said.
Meanwhile, Syed Mairaj Mohsin, a Chhipa worker who had been on duty outside the shopping centre since Saturday, pointed out how window grills prevented people from escaping. “We have seen these visuals at the Baldia factory fire and the RJ Mall inferno.”
In the current scenario, Karachi needed all of the city’s fire tenders to deal with a third-degree fire, such as the one at Gul Plaza, which was exactly what happened. If the city were to face another such blaze, it would need Rs5 billion to equip the fire department, showed a batch of official documents available with Dawn.
What we are talking about here is basic equipment: adequate water supply, wireless communication tools, lighting, the right vehicles, fire suits for each man that usually cost $2,500 or Rs700,000, breathing apparatus, protective masks, helmets, hydraulic cutters and spreaders, and smoke ejectors. In their absence, it was not possible to safely enter burning structures or remain inside long enough to rescue people.
Irshad was hopeful, though. He called the Karachi Fire Department Mayor Murtaza Wahab’s ‘favourite’. “He has promised to fill 440 vacancies for firemen and drivers within two months. At the same time, promotions in the department, halted for a long time, are also on the cards,” he was confident.
Waiting for prevention
Meanwhile, for Sufyan Sheikh, secretary general of the Fire Protection Association of Pakistan, the tragedy at Gul Plaza cannot be fully understood through the lens of a delayed response.
“Globally, the fire brigade is considered the last line of defence,” he explained. “Before that, the responsibility lies squarely with building owners.”
A fire tender, Sheikh said, could carry roughly 3,000 gallons of water — enough to douse flames for just two to two-and-a-half minutes — provided the water was released at a pressure of 500 gallons per minute at eight bar. “It is not technically possible for a fire truck to carry more than that,” he added.
“Ideally, every locality should have its own fire station,” Sheikh said. “For sustained firefighting, you need at least 60,000 gallons of water for two hours. With these resources, how do you give coverage to the entire city?”


Fire trucks spray water on the Gul Plaza building.

The Gul Plaza inferno, he pointed out, was one of the few incidents where almost all available firefighting machinery in Karachi was deployed — and even then, it took three days to extinguish the blaze. “What if two such fires break out at the same time?” he asked. “What will you do then?”
Sheikh believed the greater failure lies not in response, but in prevention.
International standards require building owners to take extensive fire safety measures, including the installation of functional extinguishers, clearly marked and accessible emergency exits, fire alarms, proper housekeeping of combustible materials, and adherence to occupancy limits. “If these measures are in place, the intensity of a fire can be reduced by up to 95pc,” he said.
Those who were unable to escape Gul Plaza, he added, were largely people who stayed behind to protect their shops, only to be eventually trapped. “A third-degree fire produces temperatures of up to 1,000 degrees Celsius. You cannot expect firefighters to go inside such conditions,” Sheikh said. “It is simply not possible.”
What was needed now, he stressed, were structural reforms: stricter enforcement of building safety codes, the hiring of competent inspection teams, and sustained public education on fire risks. “The government can fix this,” he said. “The real question is whether it wants to.”
Until then, the waiting continues — outside Gul Plaza, where men like Qaiser and Shujat remain on the footpath, watching ambulances come and go, listening for announcements that may finally bring certainty.
In Karachi, waiting has become part of the disaster itself: waiting for water, for help, for answers, for reforms. And in that waiting, lives are lost not all at once, but with each passing minute.

Dozens of patients visit the small roadside shop each day in Sindh, where a few chairs are arranged around wooden tables used to lay patients down.
“These patients have faith in me. They believe I can treat them well,” said Abdul Waheed, who opened the facility a few months ago outside Hyderabad city.
During the day, the 48-year-old works at a private hospital in the city.
In the evenings, he comes to the village of Tando Saeed Khan to see patients at his clinic, charging Rs300 per consultation.
“I have spent so much time in this field. I have worked with several doctors. Thanks to God, I have confidence to diagnose a patient and treat the disease,” Waheed told AFP.

There is no signboard, no registration number, and he has no legal authorisation to practise as a doctor.
Waheed, who has a diploma in homeopathy and has completed a four-year nursing course, speaks with confidence.
After examining two young children, he insisted that patients come to him willingly and trust his abilities.
“No one has questioned me yet. If someone comes, I will see what to do,” he said, reflecting the ease with which unqualified individuals practice medicine in the country.
Such unlicensed clinics are often the first, and sometimes the only, point of care for poor communities.
Dangerously reusing equipment
Abdul Ghafoor Shoro, secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association, said there are “more than 600,000 fake doctors” operating across the country.
This nationwide figure has been confirmed by the Sindh Healthcare Commission (SHCC), based on estimates from the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council.
Calling the practise a public health epidemic, Shoro said that such practitioners work with doctors, learn a few things there, and then open their own clinics.
“Unqualified doctors don’t know the side effects and exact dosage of medicines. If a disease is not properly diagnosed, it can become dangerous,” Shoro said.
“The instruments they use are not sterilised. They simply wash them with water and continue using them. They reuse syringes, which increases the spread of hepatitis and AIDS.”

As AFP journalists visited Tando Saeed Khan, another unqualified doctor immediately closed his clinic and disappeared.
Outside Waheed’s shop, villager Ali Ahmed said there are multiple such clinics in the area.
“None of them have qualified doctors. People aren’t educated and can’t recognise qualified doctors,” the 31-year-old told AFP.
Lifelong damage
Medical experts say this unchecked practice has a direct impact on Pakistan’s already strained healthcare system, with tertiary care hospitals overwhelmed by patients whose conditions worsen after improper treatment.
Khalid Bukhari, the head of Civil Hospital Karachi, said the facility regularly receives such cases from across the country.
“They misdiagnose and mistreat patients. Our hospital is overloaded. Most of the cases we receive are those ruined by them,” said Bukhari, whose public hospital is one of the largest in the country.
“These people are playing with the lives of poor citizens. If people go to proper doctors and receive precise treatment, they will not need to come to us.”
Regulatory authorities acknowledge their failure to control the problem.

“We have limited resources. This practice cannot be eliminated easily. If we shut down 25 outlets, 25 new ones open the very next day,” said Ahson Qavi Siddiqi, the head of SHCC.
The commission recently sealed a bungalow in Karachi that had been operating as a hospital — complete with intensive care units for children and adults — because it was unregistered.
“The law against it is weak. We file cases, but the accused get bail the next day because it is a bailable offence,” Siddiqi told AFP.
The official also described serious security threats faced by inspection teams.
“These people are influential in their areas. In many cases, our teams are taken hostage. We are fired upon. I don’t have the force to take strong action,” the SHCC head said.
Shoro said the practice also financially destroys families who are left with big hospital bills when something goes wrong.
“Many people die or become disabled, and their families suffer for the rest of their lives.”</p><small>2026-01-23 08:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/231238513ead50b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968597/lawyers-imaan-mazari-and-hadi-ali-chattha-arrested-by-police-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha arrested by police in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>Activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, were arrested on Friday in Islamabad while they were reportedly en route to the district courts.
Former minister and Imaan’s mother, Shireen Mazari, confirmed in a series of posts on X that her daughter had been arrested by police personnel, saying that she and her husband “have been arrested, put in separate cars, and taken away to unknown locations.”
The former lawmaker claimed that no first information report (FIR) was shown by the police and the bar association “sadly could do nothing”.
“Fascism at its peak. Emasculated men in power must be so pleased with this achievement!” Mazari added in a post on X.







Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court today in the controversial tweets case, in which Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Mohammad Afzal Majoka had issued arrest warrants on January 16.
The couple have been evading arrest, taking refuge in the office of Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) President Wajid Ali Gilani for two consecutive nights.
Mazari also shared videos showing police vehicles trailing the lawyers’ car, with officers stopping the vehicle and opening its doors.







In a separate post, Mazari claimed the police “used violence on the bar leaders, [including] breaking the windows of the car, etc”.
“All [because] the Twitter case had been exposed and more embarrassment would have followed in further [cross-examination] today,” the former minister said, referring to the case against Imaan and Hadi over controversial social media posts.
“Seems they (police) used violence on Imaan and Hadi also,” Mazari alleged in another post.
‘Illegal and unconstitutional move’
The ex-minister shared a video message of Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) President Wajid Ali Gilani, who was with Imaan at the time of the arrest.







“We spoke to the authorities yesterday and other institutions, and they made a commitment that Imaan Mazari and Hadi Chattha will not be arrested and will be given safe passage to go to the district court,” said the bar president in a video posted on X.
He said that, fearing arrest, the lawyers went to IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfaraz Dogar and “informed him that there was a possibility we would be stopped; however, the chief justice did not hold court today.”
Gilani said Imaan and Hadi, along with their lawyers, were on their way to the sessions court when their vehicles came “under attack by police” as soon as they passed by Serena Chowk.
The IHCBA president claimed that the police subjected the lawyers to violence and broke the vehicles’ windows, forcing Imaan and Hadi out of the car.
He further said that male personnel grabbed Imaan and pushed her into the police vehicle.







Gilani also alleged that the police officials “pushed down [IHCBA] Secretary Manzoor Jajja and beat him”.
He called on the lawyers of both the IHC and the sessions court to reach the Sitara Market Women’s Police Station — where he said Imaan was being held — and observe a strike.
“The authorities should stop this oppression. If they do not, then the 2007 lawyers’ movement will be launched again,” Gilani asserted.
Calling it a “very major incident for Islamabad”, Gilani emphasised that lawyers “guard the country’s integrity and law”.



The IHCBA, the Islamabad Bar Association (IBA) and the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) issued separate statements condemning the arrest of the lawyer couple.
The IHCBA and IBA announced a strike for Friday, while the IBC called on lawyers to observe a strike on Saturday.
The IBA added that it held an emergency meeting in light of the “illegal and unconstitutional move” to arrest the duo. The body called on authorities to “immediately release” the arrested lawyers.
“The Islamabad Bar Association believes that every Pakistani has the right to defend themselves in the court,” the statement read, terming the arrest a “violation of fundamental human rights guaranteed by the Constitution and law”.



The IBC condemned the “highly reprehensible conduct, including misbehaviour, assault and torture, perpetrated by the police officials” against Gilani and Jajja during the incident.
It considered such actions “to be a blatant misuse of authority, aimed at harassing advocates and creating an atmosphere of fear and coercion within the legal community”.
The IBC demanded Imaan and Hadi’s unconditional release, a transparent and independent inquiry into the conduct of police officials involved, and “strict disciplinary action against all those responsible for the misbehaviour, high-handedness and use of force”.
Cases against the duo
The main case against Imaan and Hadi, which pertains to a controversial social media post, stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025, at the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in Islamabad.
They were indicted in the case on October 30 last year.
ADSJ Majoka had issued arrest warrants for the couple on January 16, a day after cancelling their interim bail following repeated non-appearances.
Subsequently, Imaan and Hadi challenged their arrest orders before the IHC.
The NCCIA complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations”, while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
The FIR of the case alleged that the two held security forces responsible for cases of missing persons in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
It also stated that they had portrayed the armed forces as ineffective against proscribed groups, including the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).

 

Earlier this week, a case dating back to July 2025 emerged against the duo, about a protest by the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC). The IHC has granted them pre-arrest bail in the case.
Separately, on Thursday, Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra dismissed Imaan and Hadi’s pre-arrest bail applications in a case over a scuffle outside the IHC in September 2025.</p><small>2026-01-23 08:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/231327100637245.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968608/tiktok-establishes-joint-venture-to-end-us-ban-threat' target='_blank'><strong>TikTok establishes joint venture to end US ban threat</strong></a><br><p>TikTok announced on Thursday that it has established a majority American-owned joint venture to operate its US business, allowing the company to avoid a ban over its Chinese ownership.
The video-sharing app is a global digital entertainment powerhouse, but its mass appeal and links to China have raised concerns over privacy and national security.
The TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC will serve more than 200 million users and 7.5m businesses while implementing strict safeguards for data protection and content moderation, the company said.
The new structure responds to a law passed under US President Donald Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden that forced Chinese-owned ByteDance to sell TikTok’s US operations or face a ban in its biggest market.

 

Trump welcomed and claimed credit for the deal, but also thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for approving it.
“I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!” Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Thursday.
“It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice.”
“I would also like to thank President Xi, of China, for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal,” he added.
Cybersecurity audit
ByteDance retains a 19.9 per cent stake in the joint venture — keeping its ownership below the 20pc threshold stipulated by the law.
Three investors — Silver Lake, Oracle and Abu Dhabi-based AI investment fund MGX — each hold 15pc stakes. Oracle’s executive chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally.
Other investors include Dell Family Office, affiliates of Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic.



The joint venture will retain decision-making authority over trust and safety policies and content moderation for US users.
But TikTok’s global entities will manage international product integration and commercial activities including e-commerce and advertising.
Under the arrangement, US user data will be stored in Oracle’s secure cloud environment, with cybersecurity audited by third-party experts and adhering to federal standards, TikTok said.
Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable, a media company focused on the creator economy, said TikTok users would be relieved by the deal but that there were “still big questions about how this will all play out.”

 

“Behind the scenes, TikTok is likely working hard to assure advertisers it will remain business as normal,” she told AFP.
“While the need for users to download a new app seems unlikely, brand partners will want to know that their TikTok strategies won’t be disrupted.”
Ellison in spotlight
The joint venture will be governed by a seven-member, majority-American board including TikTok CEO Shou Chew and executives from investment firms.
TikTok executive Adam Presser was appointed CEO of the new entity, with Will Farrell serving as chief security officer.

 

The 2024 law came as US policymakers, including Trump in his first presidency, warned that China could use TikTok to mine Americans’ data or exert influence through its algorithm.
But Trump, crediting the app for his appeal with young voters, delayed enforcement through successive executive orders, most recently extending the deadline to January 22.
The deal largely confirms an outline announced to staff by Chew last month.
In September, one-time venture capitalist and Vice President JD Vance said the US entity would be valued at about $14 billion but it would ultimately be up to investors to determine pricing.
That month, Trump said a new venture had been agreed with China and would meet the law’s requirements.
Trump specifically named Ellison, one of the world’s richest men, as a major player in the arrangement.
Ellison has returned to the spotlight through his dealings with Trump, who has brought his old friend into major AI partnerships with OpenAI.</p><small>2026-01-23 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/231311039dd1d19.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968605/trump-says-us-armada-headed-toward-gulf' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says US ‘armada’ headed toward Gulf</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump said a US “armada” was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely, even after downplaying the prospect of imminent military action and saying Tehran appeared interested in talks.
Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
The prospect of immediate American action seemed to recede in recent days, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance.
On his way back from the World Economic Forum in Davos, the president told reporters on Air Force One the United States was sending a “massive fleet” toward Iran “just in case.”
“We’re watching Iran,” he said. “I’d rather not see anything happen but we’re watching them very closely.”
Addressing the WEF on Thursday, Trump said the United States attacked Iranian uranium enrichment sites last year to prevent Tehran from making a nuclear weapon. Iran denies its nuclear programme is aimed at seeking the bomb.
“Can’t let that happen,” Trump said, adding: “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.”
The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had also warned Washington Thursday that the force had its “finger on the trigger.”
A fortnight of protests starting in late December shook Iran’s leadership under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but the movement has petered out in the face of a crackdown, accompanied by an unprecedented internet blackout.
Last week, Trump pulled back from a threat to strike Iran over its deadly crackdown on the protests after the White House said Tehran had halted planned executions of demonstrators.
In a standoff marked by seesawing rhetoric, Trump had on Tuesday warned Iran’s leaders the United States would “wipe them off the face of this Earth” if there was any attack on his life in response to a strike targeting Khamenei.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in a speech Thursday, accused the United States and Israel of stoking the protests as a “cowardly revenge… for the defeat in the 12-Day War”.
‘Legitimate targets’
Guards commander General Mohammad Pakpour warned Israel and the United States “to avoid any miscalculations” and learn from “what they learned in the 12-day imposed war, so that they do not face a more painful and regrettable fate”.
“The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief,” he was quoted by state television on the IRGC’s national day.
General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, head of Iran’s joint command headquarters, meanwhile, warned that if America attacked, “all US interests, bases and centres of influence” would be “legitimate targets” for Iranian forces.

In the wake of the arrest, journalists and parliamentarians issued strong condemnations and urged justice for the two lawyers.
Imaan and Hadi were scheduled to appear in a trial court today in the controversial tweets case, after failing to appear yesterday despite repeated summons.
Opposition Leader Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said in a post on X that the arrest of the lawyers on their way to court “highlighted the troubling pattern of state overreach and procedural irregularities that undermine the principles of fair trial and due process enshrined in Pakistani laws and international conventions”.
“Such actions by the state not only expose institutional weaknesses but risk a complete judicial breakdown, eroding public trust in the rule of law,” he said.
The opposition leader added that Imaan and Hadi should be immediately presented for bail and allowed to defend themselves.
“Stop silencing dissent and the advocates of human rights,” Abbas said.







Former PTI federal minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, despite disagreeing with Imaan’s views, also criticised the arrest.
“While I find Imaan Mazari’s views on Balochistan to be foolishly misdirected, no individual should face state repression for their opinions,” he said.
Hussain said that the lawyers’ repeated arrests highlighted “the growing irrelevance of professional legal bodies” and called on lawyers “to reclaim their agency and restore the ‘red line’ around their freedom and dignity”.







Former senator Afrasiab Khattak called the arrest “a brazen attack by the usurpers on human rights and rule of law”.
“But fascist tactics can’t save the usurpers from wrath of the people who will definitely make them accountable,” he added.







Meanwhile, former member of parliament Bushra Gohar also condemned the incident, saying, “Speaking up for human rights and standing against oppression isn’t a crime.”







Barrister Khadija Siddiqi said on social media that the Islamabad police had allegedly manhandled the lawyers and “forcibly dragged them to arrest them”, while phones recording the arrest had been seized by the police.
Siddiqui called it an “abhorrent state of affairs, an absolute shame and disgrace for the Islamabad Bar president”.
“No condemnation can be enough!” she said.







Dawn’s foreign affairs and national security correspondent Baqir Sajjad said, “Under international human rights conventions, every person deserves a fair trial and due process.
“Denying this and state overreach in under-trial cases expose weakness, not strength. Those facing court must always be given a real chance to defend themselves. Justice demands no less.”
He added that judicial compromises and breakdowns did not serve anyone, but rather eroded judicial independence, trust and the rule of law.
“Principles aren’t optional,” Sajjad added.







Journalist Arifa Noor called on the government to condemn the incident, calling it “absolutely pathetic”.
“Will the government and its allies condemn this and make some effort, any effort, to get Imaan and Hadi released?” she said, reposting footage of the arrest posted by Maryam Nawaz Khan.







Journalist Mariana Baabar said that the judiciary was trampling its own laws by not producing first information reports (FIRs), saying that Hadi and Imaan were “prepared. Unafraid.”







Meanwhile, journalist Asma Sherazi said, “This shows the weakness of (the) government, not Imaan and Hadi. Release them and don’t make mockery of justice.”







Journalist Ahmad Noorani also called the incident “highly condemnable”.







Journalist Hamid Mir said that the arrest of Imaan and Hadi “will make this couple more powerful and more respectable”.

A note issued by Khyber House in Peshawar asked Tirah families to refrain from travelling to Bara until Friday evening due to the inclement weather.
It added that the process of evacuation and registration would restart after weather improvement.
Sources in Tirah had earlier informed that law-enforcement agencies made announcements in the valley about speedy evacuation of families as the Jan 25 deadline for displacement neared.

Stranded families complain they had sleepless nights on the road

Announcements caused panic and worry among Tirah families as the weather turned hostile and LEAs wanted them to leave without delay.
Gul Mand Khan, who reached Bara on Wednesday evening, told Dawn that it took him and his extended family six days to cover 110 kilometres from Bagh Markaz to Bara.
He alleged that the convoy of four vehicles his family travelled in was subjected to prolonged and unnecessary delays at Dwa Thoye, Sandana, Paindi Cheena and later at Mandai Kas in Bara, so they had sleepless nights.
“Though my family was provided with four tokens for transport fare at the Bagh Markaz in Tirah by Bara tehsildar Daud Khan on departure from the valley on Jan 16, it took us three days to cover a mere distance of 15 kilometres up to Dwa Thoye where they’re denied transport fare on the pretext that the said amount would be paid to them in Paindi Cheena registration centre,” he insisted.
The displaced person said that on arrival in Pandi Cheena after a 24-hour journey, the family was informed that payment would be disbursed at the Mandai Kas centre in Bara.
“At Mandai Kas, we’re told to offload luggage from vehicles and take the elderly family members along with women and children to their second homes in Bara and return to collect transport fare the next day,” he said.
Mr Khanadded that he was paid fare for just one vehicle, with the rest of the promised amount being withheld on the pretext of verification from the 24-member jirga of Tirah elders despite the issuance of stamped tokens by the district administration in Tirah.
Turab Ali, a social worker from the Sipah tribe, told Dawn from the Sandana centre over phone that heavy snowfall has blocked all roads, with the registration process being completely halted and hundreds of families stranded on the road.
He said most families had got stuck near the Dwa Thoye centre, facing acute shortage of food and warm clothing.
“It is now becoming a human tragedy as the stranded families are without food while they are forced to stay in their vehicles in extreme cold weather without having adequate facilities,” he said.
Two children reportedly lost lives and three people suffered injuries as three vehicles carrying them skidded off the road due to slippery conditions on the way from Tirah to Bara.
Turab Ali feared more casualties if the vehicles stranded at Dwa Thoye and other areas were not immediately cleared. He said displaced families were fast losing hope of receiving any immediate relief from authorities.
Qari Said Faqir, a Malakdinkhel resident in Tirah, accused the district administration of being involved in the sale of fake tokens for transport fare.
He claimed that Bara tehsildar stationed at Bagh Maidan Markaz was responsible for issuing tokens but he didn’t have any records of the tokens issued as they’re sold to unauthorised people in Paindi Cheena and Mandai Kas centres.
The resident alleged that neither the district administration nor the two parliamentarians from Bara didn’t ensure smooth evacuation of thousands of families from Tirah.

With barely two weeks until the tournament, Bangladesh have effectively been forced out after the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected a request to move their matches from India to co-hosts Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.
“Our only demand is to play the World Cup  but not in India,” Bangladesh Cricket Board President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters on Thursday, adding that without a change of venue, the team would not participate.
India is preparing to host the 2030 Commonwealth Games in Ahmedabad, seen as a stepping stone to the 2036 Olympics.
But the chaotic build-up to the T20 World Cup has cast a shadow over those ambitions, especially with cricket returning to the Olympic Games at Los Angeles 2028.
The T20 World Cup schedule was delayed and not released until December and now it appears Scotland could have to be drafted to replace Bangladesh just days before the opening match on February 7.
‘No one to challenge’
“Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation. If a country of nearly 200 million people misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a huge audience,” Bulbul added.
“Cricket is entering the Olympics in 2028, Brisbane in 2032, India is bidding for 2036. Excluding a major cricket-loving country like Bangladesh would be a failure.”
The ICC said it had found “no credible or verifiable threat” to move Bangladesh’s games, and was committed to “safeguarding the collective interests of the global game”.
But that global game is dominated by India, where cricket is woven deep into culture, the economy and politics.
South Asia accounts for about 90 per cent of cricket’s billion-plus fans, with India generating roughly three-quarters of the sport’s global income.
India’s supremacy stems from the outsized revenues of its BCCI cricket board, flush with cash from its role as custodian of the most popular sport in the world’s most populous country.
Sports journalist Pradeep Magazine wrote in the Tribune, an Indian daily, that the BCCI’s “staggering revenues… gives it unimaginable control over decision-making in cricketing affairs of the world”.
“There is no one to challenge India’s hegemony.”
ICC chairman Jay Shah is the son of Amit Shah, India’s powerful interior minister, and right-hand man of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
‘A political issue’
“Cricket has been captured completely by politics in a way that it never has been before,” Indian sports journalist Sharda Ugra told AFP.
“The Bangladesh issue has reached where it has because it’s a political issue.”
Political relations between India and Bangladesh have soured since a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled Sheikh Hasina, now a convicted fugitive hosted by old ally New Delhi.
But matters escalated after the India Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders were ordered by India’s BCCI board to drop Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman, triggering fury in Dhaka.
Rahman’s removal followed online outrage by right-wing Indian Hindus who invoked alleged attacks on a fellow community in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Dhaka maintains that Indian media had exaggerated the scale of the violence.
Bangladesh’s interim government sports adviser Asif Nazrul said that “no one should have a monopoly” over cricket.
“If the ICC truly wants to be a global organisation, and if the ICC does not rise and sit at India’s command, then we must be given the opportunity to play in the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka,” Nazrul said.
Bangladesh wanted to follow the example of Pakistan, who will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under a deal hatched after India refused to travel to Islamabad for the 2025 Champions Trophy and all their games were moved in Dubai.
“There is no one in the ICC who can stand up to anything that the BCCI says or does,” said Ugra.

Trump’s about-face follows Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he openly decried powerful nations using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage.
“Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada’s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time,” Trump wrote in a Truth Social post directed at Carney.







Neither Carney’s office nor the White House immediately responded to Reuters’ requests for comment on Thursday evening.
Last week, Carney’s office said he had been invited to serve on the board and planned to accept.
Carney received a rare standing ovation in Davos after the speech, in which he urged nations to accept the end of a rules-based global order.
Canada, which recently signed a trade deal with China, can show how “middle powers” might act together to avoid being victimised by American hegemony, he added.
Trump retorted that Canada “lives because of the United States”, and told listeners in Davos that Carney should be grateful for the United States previous largesse.
“Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements,” he added, addressing Carney directly.
The withdrawal of Canada’s invitation came hours after Trump officially launched the board, which was initially meant to cement a Gaza ceasefire.
Permanent members must help fund the board with a payment of $1 billion each, according to Trump.
“Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do,” Trump said in Switzerland on Thursday. “And we’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations.
The board’s establishment was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump’s Gaza peace plan, and UN spokesperson Rolando Gomez said on Thursday that UN engagement with the board would only be in that context.
Member nations include Argentina, Bahrain, Morocco, Pakistan and Turkiye. Other US allies, such as Britain, France and Italy, have indicated they will not join for now.</p><small>2026-01-23 06:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2219355248496ec.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968248/game-review-date-everything-is-a-charming-brilliantly-silly-game-of-hot-people-pokemon' target='_blank'><strong>Game review — Date Everything! is a charming, brilliantly silly game of Hot People Pokémon</strong></a><br><p>TL;DR
Pros:
- Small army of sparkling, incredible voice actors
- Deeply funny, genre-savvy writing
- A ton of creative, gorgeous character sprites
- Loveable characters that are all unique and memorable
Cons:
- Gameplay loop can get really boring
- Points mechanism forces you to treat characters like collectable cards
- Dialogue sharply stagnates once you declare a relationship status

Score: 4/7 – Lighthearted and fun, but just a bit too vast to do justice to its characters

I’ve always enjoyed a good old-fashioned dating sim. But Sassy Chap Games’ Date Everything!, published by Team17, is certainly not old-fashioned. How many dating sims feature 100 or more characters you can romance simultaneously? And how many where those characters are literally your household furnishings?
None, and the developers know that – which is why it’s fine that that’s basically their entire premise. With a pair of mysterious glasses called “Dateviators”, you can see and talk to a truly huge number of household objects given human form, finding love, friendship or mutual hate with every one of them – and gaining stats to become slightly more charismatic with all the practice. It’s a zany, ambitious premise that knows it’s zany and ambitious, and it’s so unapologetic about it that I can’t help but enjoy myself.

But as we all know, it’s not the size of your cast that matters, but how you use it. So, here’s how Date Everything measures up when it comes to actually being a good game.



Be warned: this game is rated 17+ for a reason. There’s no explicit content, but it’s raunchy.
‘Gameplay’ loop to rival 2020
The way the game works is simple enough. Walk around. Shoot beams at things through your glasses to bring out their human form. Talk to them, learn about them, do stuff for them when asked, and eventually address how you two feel about each other – good, great or terrible.


Good. – screengrab by author



Great. – screengrab by author



Terrible. – screengrab by author

Achieving a relationship status with a character – even a negative one – gives you points in one of five stats: Smarts, Poise, Empathy, Charm or Sass (SPECS). Climbing high enough in a stat can unlock some new dialogue options, among other things down the line.

Gameplay-wise, though, there’s not much more to it. You’re mainly wandering through a big house, checking your phone and talking to your furniture. With basically nothing else to do, the supposed “gameplay” loop becomes mundane and repetitive very quickly.



There’s only so much the side quests and story-progressing messages from the outside world can do to help, and you can’t leave your house for a while – which makes the whole experience feel a little like a Covid lockdown. I try not to think about that.
But the only real point of the game is to give you a sandbox to talk to fun gijinkas (anthropomorphised sprites) of your sofa, books, clothes hangers and suchlike. And boy, do the gijinkas deliver.
Fantastic, creative characters and visual concepts
The sprite art for this game, if you haven’t noticed already, is incredible. Regardless of one’s personal gender preferences, there’s incredible creativity poured into each and every character’s design, in a way that keeps you hunting down “dateables” if only to see more great art.

Plus, the characters themselves are all extremely unique in personality, and make it known immediately.

There’s no gatekeeping by gender, but you don’t have to romance anyone you don’t want to. And, if any character’s behaviour or theming makes you personally uncomfortable, you can enable the “Content Aware” mode, which warns you of potential triggers and gives you the option to skip them entirely. Players are never forced into dealing with any subject matter that upsets them.

One of the other great strengths of this game, to me, is that you’re not the most important thing in the dateables’ lives. They’re not statically frozen in place, waiting for you; they have their own rich friendships and relationship dynamics with each other. Most of the appeal for me is untangling the messy interpersonal drama in my laundry room, looking for my blanket’s missing tassel hound (read: dog) and solving mysteries alongside my magnifying glass.

Every character is a memorable personality, which is seriously hard to pull off with 100 characters – so major props to the writers for managing it.

Funny, smart writing with a voice cast of champions
Going in without expecting much, I was smacked in the face by how funny this game is from the very start. The writing absolutely glows with terminally online, genre-savvy humour that keeps its finger firmly on the pulse of modern culture, and is constantly making me laugh out loud. Even the flavour text pulls zero punches.

And the voice acting! It’s honestly the main draw of this game. The cast list is stacked with modern-day greats of the voiceover industry, including Matt Mercer of Critical Role fame, Neil Newbon from Baldur’s Gate 3, Sungwon Cho (ProZD) from YouTube, and Prince Zuko himself, Dante Basco.


(And he plays a fireplace and that’s intentional.) – screengrab by author

Felicia Day’s Skylar Specs is an especially standout performance. Peppy and bright, she guides you through the game with a wholeheartedly earnest, quirky charm that breathes oodles of life into every single word. You’ll see for yourself within five minutes of playing.


Felicia Day totally kills it. – screengrab by author

This game commits to being silly before anything else and I love that about it. It doesn’t take itself too seriously and allows its stellar cast to elevate its aggressively witty script. One thing you cannot say it lacks is a bold, cheeky voice.

Gotta catch ’em all…
However.
I went into this game with one main question: does the game’s ambitious scale take it away from the essence of the dating sim it wants to be? The short answer is, regrettably, yes.
That’s not to say it’s a bad game at all. And far be it from me to play a game with the premise “lots of characters”, then complain about too many characters. But Date Everything relies quite heavily on that premise; even its trailers promise nothing but more and more wacky dateables, seemingly predicated on the assumption that with so many of them, you’ll never get bored.
So, what happens when you do get bored? Well, around that point, the game starts insinuating that you can leave…


Skylar warns you about leaving the house. – screengrab by author

…But not if you want a fulfilling ending. For that, you have to get at least a certain number of SPECS points, that too of one type, and only certain characters will grant you that type of point, and only once, so you have to find more characters that’ll give you the same type of points and … you get the idea.
I’m a chronic completionist and love games that reward your investment. But this is different. Firstly, and crucially, not being able or willing to dedicate that much energy to the game shouldn’t preclude you from any fulfilling ending at all. This feels less like rewarding extra attention, and more like punishing a lack of time or patience.
Secondly, this choice undermines the game’s sandbox element of spending time with whoever you want. Your beloved date-ables are suddenly a resource to mine for “satisfying ending” points: once you’ve got what you need, you have to move on to others, whether you care much about them or not. Rather than a dating sim, you are now playing Gijinka Pokémon: you gotta catch ’em all. There’s even a dex.



Even more tragically, however interesting and rich the characters are as you get to know them, they stagnate the minute you’ve achieved a relationship status, rolling out the same stock conversations thereafter. That just further reinforces the notion of characters as collectables. Although the game boasts an impressive size of cast, in practice, it turns out rather wide and lacking depth.


That I miss when we had real conversations? – screengrab by author

That was the expected outcome of a premise this ambitious, and I’m glad I went in prepared. But the game could really benefit from less throwing of extra DLC characters at the player, and more attention paid to the literal 100 loveable and interesting characters it already has.
Verdict: A great, funny art book
So, should you play Date Everything? Sure, but know what to expect. This is more of a silly, witty, interactive concept art book than a classic “dating sim”, and while the art and voice acting are phenomenal, the gameplay loop demands a great deal of patience. I’m still having a lot of fun, but I think I’m too employed to go out of my way for the DLC.
I really like it, though. I can see places where players might drop off, but if you’re willing to invest the time and energy in collecting relationships – and accept that there’s not much more to it – I recommend this as an astonishingly well-written, funny, savvy and lighthearted way to pass the time.
Date Everything! is $19.99 on Steam, with the ‘Lavish DLC’ available for $4.49.

In this regard, a written request was sent from the office of the inspector general of police (IGP), Islamabad, to the office of the chief commissioner, Islamabad. 
The letter, signed by the deputy inspector general of police (Headquarters), sought the requisition of the services of two majors and 16 serving SSG-trained officials on a secondment basis for the capital police.
The letter stated that the Islamabad police are performing multifaceted duties, including maintenance of law and order, crime fighting and prevention and ensuring security and route duties.

Request sent for services of two majors and 16 SSG commandos on secondment

It further requested that the concerned quarters be approached to place the services of two majors and 16 serving SSG-trained officials of the Pakistan Army at the disposal of the capital police against existing vacant posts. Out of the 16 SSG-trained personnel, 10 will be attached to the National Police Academy (NPA), Islamabad.
The letter added that the matter may be accorded top priority.
A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the chief commissioner’s office forwarded the request to the Interior Ministry, from where it was being sent to the concerned army authorities.
The officer said the SWAT force had been established in the capital police with a manpower of over 200 personnel and was most likely to operate under the command and supervision of the senior superintendent of police, Counter Terrorism Department.
SWAT training for the personnel started about a month ago at the Police Lines Headquarters. A team from the army is currently providing training to the force. 
The requisition for the two majors and SSG personnel was made to formalise and officialise the arrangement.
Out of the total, the two majors and six SSG personnel will be placed on secondment at the disposal of the police for training the SWAT force, while the remaining personnel will be posted at the NPA to train under-training assistant superintendents of police (ASPs).

A police team was staying in Islamabad for the last 10 days or so when they got a tip-off that the suspect, Waseem Akthar, was hiding somewhere in the federal capital.
He was nominated in multiple FIRs lodged by his fellow jewellers besides his own stepmother.
The major fraud case surfaced in the second week of December 2025 when several jewellers of Madina Jewellers Market Ichhra after they came to know that Waseem had disappeared suddenly with 20kg of gold worth over Rs1 billion they had “invested” with him for decades.
The lockers of the suspect’s shop where they had deposited the gold ornaments were found unlocked at the time when the affected jewellers visited the premises.
An official, privy to the development, said the suspect kept on changing his location and the police finally managed to arrest him and his wife.
The official source claimed that the Lahore Police wanted to do the interrogation in their own style to ensure the maximum recovery of the gold he had made off with.
For this purpose, the police high-ups issued some instructions to keep the arrest secret, the source said. But the officers’ plan was spoiled when Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on a social media platform claimed the suspect had been arrested.
The police source claimed that the offences/charges mentioned in the FIRs against the suspect as compared to his scale of crime were not strong enough to take him to the court of law for some major punishment. So the police officers decided to investigate the case ‘in a traditional way’ by interrogating the suspect without showing his arrest in the official record, the official claimed.
He added that the most concerning part of the case was that the suspect had reportedly sold everything, including his house, cars, and most probably the huge amount of the gold he had taken away.
As per the reports, an affected jeweller, Ahmad Siddiqui, told the police that he had handed over gold ornaments worth over Rs25m to Waseem Akhtar, the suspect who was the former president of Ichhra Jewellers Association. He said the suspect had been running his business, Madina Jewellers, for the last 35 years and had won the trust of the area jewellers. He said Waseem committed a criminal breach of trust, depriving dozens of his fellow jewellers of their valuables.
In another FIR lodged by a woman with the Ichhra Police Station told the police that the absconding suspect was her stepson and she had handed him over 2.5kg of her gold.
Meanwhile, the investigation wing police released a statement, announcing that Waseem Akthar had been arrested from Islamabad.
The police said he was nominated in multiple FIRs registered on the complaints of the affected jewellers of Ichhra market and further investigations were underway, refusing to share more details.

Speaking at the International Law Year in Review 2026 Conference on Thursday, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said the erosion of treaty obligations and uneven application of international law were undermining the foundations of collective security built after World War II.
“There must be no space for selective compliance or legal exceptionalism,” the ambassador said, adding that the principles of the UN Charter must be applied “more consistently, more courageously and more faithfully” if the rules-based international order was to survive.







Ambassador Asim linked the debate on international law directly to the functioning of the Security Council, noting that divisions among major powers had increasingly paralysed the body. He cited the unanimous adoption of Resolution 2788 during Pakistan’s presidency of the Council in July last year as an exception that underscored what was still possible within the UN framework.
The resolution, he said, “reaffirms the centrality of peaceful settlement of disputes” and demonstrated that consensus could still be achieved despite geopolitical rivalries.
At the same time, he warned that disregard for binding international agreements posed a direct challenge to the UN system. Referring to India’s unilateral move to place the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, Ambassador Asim said such actions reflected a “disturbing trend” that weakened confidence in international law and threatened regional stability.
On the long-stalled issue of Security Council reform, Pakistan reiterated its opposition to models that expand permanent membership or perpetuate veto privileges. Any reform, the ambassador said, should “not exacerbate the fundamental flaws entrenched in permanent membership and veto” but should instead “enhance the relative weight and power of the elected members”, whose voices represented the wider UN membership.
He also drew attention to the growing agenda before the UN related to emerging technologies, arguing that the organisation must play a central role in shaping legal norms on artificial intelligence, cyber operations and autonomous weapons.
Praising the work of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and the International Law Commission (ILC), he called for the “progressive development of international law” to prevent new domains of conflict from remaining unregulated.
Despite persistent criticism of the UN’s effectiveness, Ambassador Asim said the institution continued to command broad legitimacy. “The vast majority of member states have deep faith in the UN and multilateralism,” he said, stressing that the answer lay in reform and renewal rather than marginalisation of the world body.
Diplomatic discussions at the UN this week have reflected similar concerns, with several delegations privately cautioning against the proliferation of ad hoc mechanisms that operate outside established UN processes, even when presented as complementary.
Earlier on Thursday, Pakistan joined 19 other nations in endorsing the charter of a proposed “Board of Peace”, an initiative led by United States President Donald Trump. While Washington has said the body would work “in conjunction” with the UN, diplomats noted that the proposed group could end up supplementing — or potentially complicating — the UN’s role in maintaining international peace and stability.
For many at the UN, the central question remains whether new initiatives can reinforce — rather than dilute — the authority of the organisation at a moment when conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere have already placed unprecedented strain on the multilateral system.</p><small>2026-01-23 04:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/6972bee287272.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1968522/rafah-crossing-with-egypt-set-to-open-next-week' target='_blank'><strong>Rafah crossing with Egypt set to open next week</strong></a><br><p>• Israeli strikes kill five Palestinians in Gaza• Hamas condemns US sanctions on non-government organisations
DAVOS: Gaza’s border crossing with Egypt will reopen next week after largely being shut during the Israel-Hamas war, the Palestinian technocrat leader backed by Washington to administer the enclave announced on Thursday.
Ali Shaath made the announcement by video link during an event in Davos hosted by President Donald Trump, who convened a group of leaders to formally launch a “Board of Peace” initially focused on cementing Gaza’s ceasefire.
A key unfulfilled element of the ceasefire, brokered by Trump in October, has been the reopening of Gaza’s main gateway to the world to allow the entry and exit of Palestinians.
“I am pleased to announce the Rafah crossing will open next week in both directions. For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate. It is a lifeline and symbol of opportunity,” Shaath said.
“Opening Rafah signals that Gaza is no longer closed to the future and to the war,” Shaath said.
There was no immediate comment from Israel, which has controlled the Rafah crossing since 2024. The ceasefire deal left Israel in control of more than half of Gaza, including the area that abuts the border crossing. Hamas controls the remainder of the enclave.
Israeli strikes kill five
In the Gaza Strip, health officials said Israeli air strikes on Thursday killed five people in the enclave. There was no immediate Israeli comment on the violence, the latest to fray the October truce accord. Israel has continued to carry out air and artillery strikes in Gaza.

 

Health officials at Al Shifa Hos­pital, Gaza’s largest, said four Pale­stinians were killed by Israeli tank shelling in the Zeitoun suburb of eastern Gaza City. A fifth person was killed by Israeli fire in Khan Yunis in the south, health officials said.
A day earlier, Israeli fire killed 11 people including two boys and three journalists, health officials said.
On Thursday, Palestinians in Gaza held funerals for the three journalists, who press advocates said had been using a drone to film tents housing displaced people.
US sanctions on NGOs
Hamas on Thursday condemned as “unjust” a move by the United States to sanction Palestinian associations which Washington accused of having links to the movement.
The US on Wednesday imposed sanctions on six nonprofit organisations working in the Gaza Strip, which the Treasury Department said “claim to provide medical care to Palestinian civilians but in fact support the military wing of Hamas”.
It also announced sanctions on a group of Palestinians involved in civilian flotillas that aim to break Israel’s sea blockade on Gaza to bring in humanitarian aid.
The Treasury Department said the Popular Conference for Palestinians Abroad has been “a main organiser” of the flotillas and charged that it was “clandestinely acting on behalf of Hamas”.
“We view these decisions as unjust and oppressive,” Hamas said in a statement, suggesting the sanctions were incited by Israel as a fight against the Palestinian “national cause”.
All the organisations were accused of “secret ties to Hamas” in the US Treasury statement. The sanctions will block any assets the groups have in the United States and criminalise transactions with them.
Hamas called on Washington to walk back its decision.

PARIS : The commander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards warned Washington on Thur­sday that his force has its “finger on the trigger” following mass protests, even as US President Donald Trump insisted the Islamic Republic appears ready for negotiations.
Gen Mohammad Pakpour, the Guards’ commander, cautioned Israel and the United States “to avoid any miscalculations by learning from historical experiences and what they learned in the 12-day imposed war”.
“The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief [Khamenei] — a leader dearer than their own lives,” Pakpour said in a statement quoted by state television.
While the prospect of immediate American action against Tehran appeared to recede this week, tensions remain high. Addressing the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said the US struck Iranian uranium enrichment sites last year to prevent Tehran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.
“Can’t let that happen,” Trump said. “And Iran does want to talk, and we’ll talk.”
Gen Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi, who leads the Iranian joint command headquarters, warned that if the US attacks, “all US interests, bases and centres of influence” would become “legitimate targets”.
Trump had on Tuesday warned Iran’s leaders the US would “wipe them off the face of this earth” if there was any attack on his life in response to a strike targeting Khamenei.
The warnings come as Iranian leadership faces the aftermath of protests that began in late December. A violent crackdown has quelled the movement, accompanied by what the monitor NetBlocks called a “national kill-switch” internet blackout now in its second week. Iranian authorities on Wednesday released their first official toll from recent protests, stating 3,117 people were killed.
Trump-Zelensky meeting
Separately, Trump declared that Russia’s war on Kyiv “has to end” after holding a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Davos on Thursday. Following the discussion, Zelensky reported progress on peace talk negotiations and discussions regarding air defence supplies.
When asked by reporters what his message was for Russian President Vladimir Putin — who is scheduled to meet with a US envoy in Mos­cow later — Trump was direct.
“This war has to end,” Trump said. He described the encounter with the Ukrainian leader as positive.
Zelensky characterised the talks with his US counterpart as “productive”. Writing on the social media platform X, he indicated that diplomatic efforts between the two nations are intensifying.







Greenland deal
Meanwhile, Trump said he had secured total and permanent US access to Greenland in a deal with Nato, whose head said allies would have to step up their commitment to Arctic security to ward off threats from Russia and China. The development came as Trump backed off tariff threats and dismissed seizing Greenland by force, reducing tension in transatlantic relations.
“It’s really being negotiated now, the details of it,” Trump told Fox Business Network from the World Economic Forum. Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told Reuters in Davos it’s now up to senior commanders to handle extra security details.
“I have no doubt we can do this quite fast. Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026,” he said.
While the news triggered a rebound in European markets, officials remain cautious. Dan­ish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen clarified that while security talks are progres­sing, no negotiations occurred regarding sovereignty over the semi-autonomous territory.
“It is still a difficult and serious situation, but progress has also been made in the sense that we have now got things where they need to be. Namely that we can discuss how we promote common security in the Arctic region,” Frederiksen said.

QUETTA: Heavy downpour and snowfall blanketed the Quetta valley and vast parts of northern and central Balochistan on Thursday, ending a long dry spell but paralysing normal life.
The severe weather blocked major highways, cutting off the provincial capital, while lashing Siberian winds caused temperatures to plummet across the region.
Authorities reported that six members of a family were injured when their vehicle skidded off the Quetta-Karachi national highway in the Surab area of Kalat district due to freezing snow. The injured were shifted to a district hospital.
Consequently, officials suspended traffic on various highways connecting Balochistan with other provinces and linking remote districts to Quetta, citing dangerous, slippery conditions caused by high-speed icy winds.
The extreme weather affected more than just transportation. Cities and towns connected to the Sui Southern Gas Company, inclu­ding Quetta, suffered long power breakouts and low gas pressure.
These utility failures caused significant hardship for residents facing freezing temperatures, which were recorded between minus 8 and minus 12 degrees Celsius in Quetta, Ziarat, Kalat, Mastung, Kan Mehtarzai, Khanozai, Muslim Bagh, Qila Abdullah, Sanjavi and many other cities.
The Met Office forecast more rain and snowfall in the next 24 hours due to Siberian winds, which have also frozen large areas in Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, residents witnessed Quetta wearing a “white blanket” for the first time in at least five years. The last heavy snowfall occurred in 2020, when the capital received 3 feet of snow and northern parts saw up to 6 feet, leaving the province cut off for days.
Mountains surrounding the valley, including Hanna Lake and Urak Valley, turned white, prompting locals to flock to these areas to enjoy the season’s first snow.
The other areas of the province that received snowfall and rain included Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Ziarat, Qila Saifullah, Muslim Bagh, Khanozai, Kan Mehtarzai, Chaman, Toba Achakzai, Mastung, Kalat, Harboi, Surab, Toba Kakari, Sanjavi, Duki and other areas.
According to sources, Ziarat, Khanozai, Muslim Bagh, Kalat, Toba Achakzai and Toba Kakari received two to three feet of snow.
Traffic on the highway from Balochistan to D.I. Khan and Islamabad via Zhob was suspended due to snow. The Khojak Pass to Afghanistan via Chaman was also closed to prevent accidents.
Authorities worked to clear highways and spread salt to melt ice. The public was advised to avoid unnecessary travel as heavy machinery helped restore traffic.

He announced PTI’s dissociation from the bill and sought its withdrawal.
Under Section 137 of the Elections Act, all members of parliament and provincial assemblies are required to submit to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), on or before Dec 31 each year, a statement of their assets and liabilities, including those of their spouses and dependent children. Section 138 of the Act requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette.
The proposed amendment to Section 138 seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the Speaker of the concerned Assembly or, as the case may be, the Chairman of the Senate may, on an application made by a member and for reasons to be recorded in writing, by a ruling delivered in the chamber, determine that the statement of assets and liabilities of that member shall not be published publicly by the Commission if such publication would pose a serious threat to the life or safety of the member or, as the case may be, his family, for a period not exceeding one year at a time and subject to the condition that a complete and true statement of assets and liabilities shall be submitted confidentially to the Election Commission.”
Tax bill
On Thursday, the House also passed the Income Tax Third Amendment Bill 2025, moved by Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kayani, who said it aimed to safeguard taxpayers’ rights and strengthen the Alternate Dispute Resolution Com­mittee.

The National Assembly was informed that billions of dollars in investment had been attracted through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said investments had come across multiple sectors, supported by initiatives such as the investment policy and revised visa policy. Minister of State Bilal Azhar Kayani added that the SIFC functioned as a single window to promote investment and transparency.
Furthermore, seven new bills were laid before the assembly for consideration. These included the National Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Financing of Terrorism Authority Bill, the National Archives Amendment Bill, 2026, and the Abandoned Properties Management Amendment Bill, 2026.

LAHORE: The Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has imposed a ban on kite flying in public parks and greenbelts on Basant, as the Lahore administration decided to digitally monitor the three-day festival, starting Feb 6, to ensure compliance.
PHA Managing Director Raja Mansoor Ahmad said the decision was made to ensure that kite flying and related celebrations did not harm trees and other park infrastructure.
“Since the Basant festival is being held for three days in Lahore alone, the arrival of a number of people from other cities of Punjab, other provinces and abroad is expected here for kite flying and other related activities.
In such a situation, the people may rush for the public parks and green areas for kite flying and other related celebrations…” he told Dawn.

 

He said the decision was made to prevent any untoward incident, including damage to the plants, greenbelts and other infrastructure.
“Lahore, in addition to its huge number of permanent residents, may also have a considerable number of people from other cities and countries starting from the Feb 4 evening, since Feb 5 is also a public holiday (Youm-i-Kashmir),” he added.
“The parks would remain open to the people, but they wouldn’t be allowed for kite flying,” he said, adding that the PHA enforcement staff has been put on high alert.
According to an official notification by the PHA, the directors concerned have been asked to ensure strict implementation of the ban within their respective zones.
The authority emphasised that any violation of these instructions will be considered unacceptable, and in case of any damage or untoward incident, the respective director would be held responsible.
Digital monitoring
Meanwhile, the city district administration said that strict digital monitoring of Basant would be carried out through drone cameras and the Lahore Safe City Authority’s cameras. A control room would be set up at the DC office.
It was revealed in a meeting presided over by Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Ali Ijaz.
“Kite flying will only be allowed from Feb 6 to 8, whereas the material will be sold through registered dealers alone,” the DC said while speaking on the occasion.
He said that kites bigger than the ap­­pro­ved sizes will be prohibited. More­over, none of the bikers would be allowed to drive without safety wires. Basant would only be allowed at specific grounds or no­­tified rooftops, including in the Walled City or other locations across the district.
Registration of kite manufacturers
On the other hand, as many as 2,437 kite manufacturers, sellers, traders and associations have applied for registration with the city administration for the festival.
According to a document seen by Dawn, as many as 1,334 kite sellers applied for registration till Jan 22, 2026. Out of this, 161 applications were currently in process, whereas 1,107 had been approved.
A total of 838 kite manufacturers applied for registration, 697 applications had been approved, whereas 85 were in process. However, 51 applications were rejected.
Similarly, 250 kite traders applied for registration, out of which 19 applications were in process and 223 had been appro­ved. Eight applications were rejected.
Moreover, 18 kite flying associations applied for registration, of which 12 were approved, two are in process, while four applications were rejected.
It is pertinent to mention that the provincial government decided in December last year to celebrate a limited Basant in Lahore with strict conditions.

“Safeguarding an employee’s right to be considered for promotion in a timely manner is a right,” observed Justice Ayesha A. Malik, adding that the government departments cannot take shelter behind their inefficiencies and inactions by relying on Section 8(3) of the Punjab Civil Servants Act 1974, as they are responsible for ensuring timely promotions.
The observation came in an appeal of Fakhar Majeed before the Supreme Court, which a three-judge bench comprising Justice Ayesha A. Malik, Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim had taken up against a February 16, 2024, order of the Punjab Service Tribunal, which had dismissed his plea.
The Supreme Court, however, ordered the Punjab Irrigation Department to grant promotion to the employee from 2012 and held the department responsible for an “unjustified”, “negligent”, and “inefficient” delay in processing his promotion for over a decade. The petitioner stated that he was entitled to a proforma promotion, effective January 18, 2010, as the vacancy for the post of draftsman (BPS-14) became available on that date. 

Court says civil servants should not suffer due to procedural delays, inaction of government departments

The department, on the other hand, pleaded that in terms of Section 8 of the Act, the employee did not have any right to seek proforma promotion from the date of vacancy, rather promotion was to be granted with immediate effect.
Petitioner Fakhar Majeed was appointed on Oct 30, 1999, and later promoted to the post of draftsman on current charge basis three times in BPS-10 through letters dated Dec 11, 2008, June 2, 2010, and Nov 12, 2011, for a period not exceeding one year under Rule 10(b) of the Punjab Civil Servants (Appointment & Condition of Services) Rules 1974 or till the arrival of regular incumbent whichever is earlier. 
A Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) was convened in 2012, but his case was not considered. This became the subject matter of a dispute between the parties. 
The employee was ultimately recommended for promotion to the post of draftsman by the DPC held on May 4, 2019, and thereafter promoted through an office order of May 7, 2019. 
The petitioner claimed that he was not treated fairly and was denied the lawful right of being considered for promotion in 2012. The issue, therefore, is the petitioner’s request for regular promotion to the post of draftsman (BPS-14) with effect from Jan 18, 2010.
Authored by Justice Malik, the seven-page judgement observed that it must be remembered that promotion in public service was not a gratuitous benefit, rather it was tied to merit, performance and operational needs of the state.
Once an employee satisfies the prescribed eligibility criteria, a corresponding duty devolves on the competent authority to consider the case, failing which a reasonable timeframe must be documented, Justice Malik observed.
By relying on Section 8(3) of the Act, the department actually tried to nullify the delay, its mismanagement and inefficiency. Fairness, transparency and timeliness in promotion matters are critical to keep employees efficient and motivated, the judgement emphasised.
It said that a delay, failure to convene DPC, or prolonged reliance on current charge or acting arrangements cannot be used to defeat the right of an eligible civil servant to timely consideration for promotion, and that a civil servant cannot be made to suffer for omissions, inefficiency or inaction.
The Supreme Court ruled that the tribunal failed to appreciate the fact that the employee was unjustifiably deprived of the promotion, and set aside the tribunal’s order with a direction that the petitioner be deemed promoted with effect from Jan 21, 2012.

• iPhones see steepest cuts  • Values apply regardless of condition; accessories not included
• Phones must be activated six months before import      
ISLAMABAD: As mobile phone prices remain elevated for new buyers due to higher assessed values, the Customs Valuation Department has reduced assessment rates for duties and taxes on the commercial import of used and old mobile phone sets to ease pressure on consumers in the used smartphone market.
At the same time, fresh assessment values have been set for high-end used iPhone models, ranging from the iPhone 14 and its variants to the iPhone 15 series. For Samsung, Google Pixel and OnePlus, the assessed rates have largely been left unchanged or fixed for the first time.
The revised rates were notified through Valuation Ruling No. 2035 of 2026, which will come into effect from Jan 16, 2026.
Customs officials said the revision reflects a decline in international prices of older smartphones, particularly iPhones, as these devices approach the end of their commercial life cycle.
The downward adjustment, they added, is intended to align valuations with market rates and ensure the benefit is passed on to end consumers through lower duties and, potentially, lower retail prices.
Officials said the new ruling covers 62 mobile phone models across four leading brands, either through revised values or first-time valuation. They said the methodology relied on market inquiries, benchmarked against trade-in prices published on the official websites of manufacturers, including Samsung, Google and OnePlus.
The government levies multiple charges on mobile phones, including a flat Rs250 per set, 18 per cent sales tax, withholding tax, a handset levy and regulatory duties. These are calculated on the notified assessed value of each handset.
A comparison of values notified for 2026 with those issued in 2024 shows a sharp reduction in assessed values for used phones. Used iPhones recorded the steepest cuts, with declines ranging from 32pc to 81pc.
Among the biggest revisions, the assessed value of the iPhone 12 Pro fell to $155 from $280, while the iPhone 12 Pro Max was reduced to $215 from $340.
The iPhone 13 was cut to $170 from $280, the iPhone 11 Pro Max to $145 from $245, and the iPhone XS Max to $95 from $150. The iPhone X was lowered to $57 from $75.
Even newer flagship models were revised downwards, with the iPhone 13 Pro Max reduced to $295 from $430, and the iPhone 13 Pro to $225 from $360.
The department also fixed assessment values for seven newer used iPhone models. Under the new rates, the iPhone 15 Pro Max has been valued at $460, the iPhone 15 Pro at $390, the iPhone 15 Plus at $320, and the iPhone 15 at $310.
For the iPhone 14 lineup, the iPhone 14 Pro Max has been assessed at $360, the iPhone 14 Pro at $290, and the iPhone 14 at $210.
Samsung, Google, OnePlus
By contrast, valuations for other major brands were largely unchanged. Only a marginal adjustment was recorded for the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra, which was assessed at $255, reflecting a modest decline.
Other Samsung models were valued at lower but steady levels, with the Galaxy S23 Plus assessed at $160, the Galaxy S23 at $140, and the Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G at $160. Older models included the Galaxy S21 Plus 5G at $69, the Galaxy S21 5G at $50, the Galaxy S20 Plus at $46, and the Galaxy S20 at $41.
For Google Pixel devices, the ruling fixed values across newer and older models, including the Pixel 9 Pro XL at $260, the Pixel 9 Pro at $195, and the Pixel 9 at $150. The Pixel 8 Pro was valued at $188 and the Pixel 8 at $98.
A similar pattern was reported for OnePlus phones, with the OnePlus 12 assessed at $184 and the OnePlus 12R at $105, while older models were valued at $92 for the OnePlus 11, $65 for the OnePlus 10 Pro, and $60 for the OnePlus 10T.
According to the ruling, the notified values will apply to used mobile phones imported in commercial quantities without packaging and accessories, and will form the basis for the assessment of duties and taxes at the time of import. The values will apply regardless of the specific grade or condition of the phones.
It further stipulates that devices must have been activated at least six months prior to export to Pakistan. Importers will be required to declare the activation period, which will be verified by assessing officers during clearance.
Customs officials said the Directorate General of Customs Valuation held consultations with stakeholders on Aug 12, Sept 26 and Dec 15 last year. Import data covering a 90-day period was collected and analysed, while market inquiries were carried out to determine revised values.
For brands and models imported commercially but not listed in the ruling, importers have been advised to determine assessable values under Sections 25(5) and 25(6) of the Customs Act, 1969.
