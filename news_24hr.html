• Health ministry warns of cholera, typhoid, and dengue risks from contaminated water and stagnant pools
• No immediate desert locust threat, despite ideal rain conditions: UN report
ISLAMABAD: As severe flooding devastates the northern region and Punjab, with impending threats to Sindh, the international community, including the United Kingdom and the United Nations with their partners, has stepped up to aid the flood-stricken areas by releasing funds to expedite relief efforts and enhance disaster preparedness across Pakistan.
The United Kingdom on Thursday announced an additional 1.2 million pounds to help the government’s coordinated response and assist communities in Sindh prepare before disaster strikes.
According to a press release from the British High Commission, the new funding brings the UK’s total humanitarian assistance to £2.53m, providing life-saving support to over 400,000 people.
 
 

The new funds are being deployed to non-governmental organisations in Sindh to enable early warning systems, community evacuations, pre-positioning of essential supplies and the protection of livestock.
“Sindh is in a critical window to prepare and reduce the impact of the upcoming floods,” British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said. “For every dollar spent on prevention, up to seven dollars are saved in response. More importantly, lives are saved, and destruction is avoided.”
This aid complements £1.33m announced on Aug 22 for early response and relief efforts in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan. That support includes providing dry food rations, search and rescue operations, mobile medical camps and restoring irrigation channels.
Additionally, the UK has contributed £500,000 to the Start Ready Disaster Risk Financing system in Pakistan. The funds have been released to reach 20,000 people across Punjab, Sindh and KP to anticipate and mitigate humanitarian impacts from future flooding.
UN aid
The United Nations and its partners are also working closely with Pakistani authorities to assess the humanitarian impact of the floods and identify needs.
Emergency Relief Coordinator Tom Fletcher has released $600,000 from the Regional Humanitarian Pooled Fund to support relief and recovery efforts, according to a statement released by the UN Information Centre in Islamabad.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his condolences and solidarity with Pakistan. He commended the Pakistani authorities for relocating more than one million people in Punjab, according to the statement attributed to his spokesperson, Stephane Dujarric.
Health advisories
Meanwhile, the Federal Ministry of Health has released advisories to combat the heightened risk of disease outbreaks.
The ministry’s research body, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), has warned that extensive water contamination and disease-carrying vectors pose a severe threat to public safety.
The ministry stated that floodwater has contaminated supplies, raising the risk of a surge in diseases like cholera and typhoid. Additionally, vast areas of stagnant water have created ideal breeding grounds for mosquitoes, increasing the potential for Dengue Fever, Chikungunya and Malaria.
The advisories, available on the ministry and NIH websites, provide guidance on preventing and controlling vector-borne, food-borne, water-borne, vaccine-preventable diseases and conjunctivitis. A statement issued by the ministry urged all citizens to follow established safety protocols.
No locust threat
Separately, a United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) report released on Thursday states that Pakistan faces no immediate threat of locusts.
The FAO’s “Desert Locust Bulletin” sta­ted that surveys in August found no locusts in key summer breeding areas, and while very small-scale breeding may still occur, “no significant developments are expected”.

The tremor, at a depth of 10km (six miles), followed the earlier quakes that flattened villages in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces, left tens of thousands homeless and injured more than 3,600 people.
Survivors have been left without shelter as aid groups warn of dwindling resources, with the United Nations and other agencies citing a critical need for food, medical supplies and shelter.
Rescue workers on Thu­rs­day pulled bodies from the rubble of homes razed in Afghanistan’s earthquakes as the confirmed death toll topped 2,200, while homeless survivors faced a bleak future with global aid agencies warning of dwindling resources.
Search operations continued in the quake-hit mountainous eastern areas, the Taliban administration said, announcing a new death toll of 2,205 with at least 3,640 people injured.
“Everything we had has been destroyed,” said Aalem Jan, whose house in the worst-affected province of Kunar was flattened by the tremors.
“The only remaining things are these clothes on our backs,” said Jan. His family sat under trees with their belongings piled next to them.
The first earthquake of magnitude 6, one of Afghanistan’s deadliest in recent years, unleashed widespread damage and destruction in the provinces of Kunar and Nan­garhar on Sunday, when it struck at a shallow depth of 10km.
 
 

A second quake of magnitude 5.5 on Tuesday cau­sed panic and interrupted rescue efforts as it sent rocks sliding down mountains and cut off roads to villages in remote areas.
More than 6,700 homes have been destroyed, authorities have said. The United Nations has warned the toll could rise with people still trapped under rubble as time runs out for survivors.
Humanitarian needs are “vast and growing rapidly”, said the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Soc­ieties.
“Up to 84,000 people are directly and indirectly affected, with thousands displaced,” it added, citing initial figures.
In some of the worst-affected villages in Kunar province, two out of three people had been killed or injured, while 98 per cent of buildings were either destroyed or damaged by the tremors, according to an assessment by British-based charity Islamic Relief Worldwide.
Survivors desperately searching for family members sifted rubble, carried bodies on woven stretchers and dug graves with pickaxes in the wait for aid to arrive.
Video showed trucks, some laden with sacks of flour and others carrying men with shovels, travelling to remote villages on higher slopes. Authorities also airdropped dozens of commando forces at sites where helicopters could not land.
Afghanistan is prone to deadly quakes, particularly in the Hindu Kush mountain range, where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet.
With homes made mostly of dry masonry, stone and timber, some families preferred to sit out in the open rather than return home as aftershocks continue at regular intervals.

• Reiterates commitment to protecting Chinese citizens, promises ‘no red tape’ for investors
• Terms skilled workforce a ‘comparative advantage’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and China on Thursday vowed to further cement bilateral trade and strategic ties, as both sides inked 21 different MoUs and joint ventures worth around $8.5 billion, besides formally launching the second phase of the China-Pakis­tan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.
The MoUs were signed between the two countries with regard to cooperation in the development of CPEC 2.0, science and technology, IT, media, investment, agriculture, etc.
On the last day of his visit to China, PM Shehbaz Sharif met his counterpart, Premier Li Qiang, and attended an investors’ conference.
According to the PM Office, PM Shehbaz and his Chinese counterpart reaffirmed to work together in a meeting that the former termed “most productive”.
“Both sides also agreed to continue working closely on the next phase of upgraded CPEC 2.0, with its five new corridors,” an official statement said.
During the meeting, the prime minister highlighted the “significant contribution” of the CPEC to  Pakistan’s socio-economic development in the past decade. He also stressed the need for early implementation of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway project, the Karakoram Highway realignment and operationalisation of the Gw­­adar Port.
“I also invited Chinese companies to enhance their investment footprint in Pakistan,” the PM wrote on X, adding that the leaders’ agreement on adv­ancing cooperation in information technology, agriculture, minerals, textiles and industry.
 
 

PM Shehbaz also shared Pakistan’s intent to float Panda Bonds, a type of debt security issued by foreign entities denominated in Chinese yuan (RMB), in the Chinese capital market soon.
He later met Chinese Min­ister for Information Techn­ology and Industry Li Lecheng and reiterated Pakistan’s vision of deepening bilateral cooperation with China in industries, agriculture, trade, ICT, mining and minerals.
Investors’ conference
Both countries have also agreed to deepen security and defence cooperation, and will work together to crack down on terrorism, the Xinhua news agency reported, citing a joint action plan agreed by the two countries.
PM Shehbaz later termed the security of Chinese businesses “paramount” to Pakistan, inviting investment into the country under the banner of CPEC-2.0.
Addressing Chinese business leaders at the Pak-China B2B conference, PM Shehbaz said, “I want to make it clear before this assembly of great leaders that the security of Chinese brothers and sisters in Pakistan is paramount for all of us.”
He invited them to “come forward and change the landscape of progress and welfare” for both China and Pakistan.
Noting delays in the formal launch of CPEC-2.0, PM Shehbaz assured the potential investors that “Pakistan will not tolerate even a second’s delay” in facilitating Chinese companies.
He acknowledged that there were delays, and things had not “moved forward as per Chinese standards”; however, he stressed that Pakistan’s doors remained open to Chinese investors, adding that “we will not keep them waiting even for a second”.
“I am here speaking to you first as the chief executive officer of Pakistan and then as the prime minister,” he added.
The prime minister also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing.
He also invited Chinese com­­­panies to consider Pak­i­stan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into special economic zones, saying that the country offered a “un­­ique comparative advantage” with a large pool of skilled and cost-effective labour, competitive input costs and strategic connectivity to regional and global markets.
After wrapping up his six-day visit, PM Shehbaz subsequently returned to Pakistan on Thursday night.

According to an ECP announcement, by-polls in five National Assembly constituencies and four Punjab Assembly constituencies have been put off in view of the flood situation.
The disqualification and sentencing of several PTI lawmakers by antiterrorism courts in connection with the May 9 cases had led the ECP to schedule by-elections in NA-66 (Wazirabad), NA-96 and NA-104 (Faisalabad), NA-129 (Lahore) and NA-143 (Sahiwal). By-polls were also announced for four Punjab Assembly seats — PP-73 (Sargodha), PP-87 (Mianwali), PP-97 (Faisalabad) and PP-203 (Sahiwal) — following the disqualification of PTI MPAs.
The ECP has now postponed polling in all these constituencies. The commission said a new schedule would be issued once the flood situation improves. It po­­inted out that both public and private infrastructure, including government schools and other buildings designated for polling stations and election record storage, had been damaged by the floods.
Civil administration and law enforcement age­ncies are eng­aged in rescue and relief operations, making it difficult for them to perform election-related dut­ies. The Punjab government had also req­uested postponement of the by-elections to free up staff and buildings for relief act­ivities, it said.
The ECP added that large segments of the population in the affected constituencies had been displaced by floods and heavy rains. As a result, many voters would be un­able to participate in the electoral process, risking disenfranchisement and low turnout.
Taking all these factors into account, the commission decided to postpone the by-polls until conditions improve.

• Experts fear catastrophe at Head Muhammadwala
• High flood warning for Kasur, Okara, Bahawalnagar and other cities
• Over 85 Sialkot villages cut off since Aug 26
• Fears of urban flooding as more rain expected from today
• Homes washed away, farmland destroyed in GB’s Deral valley
LAHORE: As the water level continued to rise in the Chenab River at Head Muhammadwala and Sher Shah bridges, the urban centres of Multan and Muzaffargarh were facing a grave threat due to the extremely high-level flood that had not subsided des­pite the passage of 36 hours.
The National Disaster Management Authority also issued a “high flood” warning for Kasur, Okara, Pakpattan, Burewala, Arifwala and Bahawal­nagar, as water levels continue to increase in the Sutlej River.
Multan Deputy Commi­ssioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said that the flood level in the Chenab River was continuously rising, due to which water had reached the Akbar Flood Bund and the Sher Shah bridge, inundating several villages.
“The situation is likely to worsen due to the joining of the Ravi River and the Chenab,” DC Sindhu said, adding that the water was above 414 feet at Greywala Chowk and showing a rising trend. He said the decision to breach the dyke at Head Muhammadwala would be taken if the 417-feet threshold was crossed. The DC said that a record 400,000 people were relocated to safer areas in the district.
Multan Commissioner Amir Karim Khan said that the water gauge at Head Muhammadwala was recorded at 413.66ft — just a few feet short of the critical level of 417ft. He said the decision to breach the embankment would be based on the water flow speed, intensity, and other factors.
‘Non-technical and incorrect information’
However, the experts ap­­peared alarmed by the situation at Head Muham­madwala, claiming that the critical level was actually lower than 417 feet.
The former irrigation department experts said the technical committee, comprising the irrigation department and other de­­partments, provided non-te­chnical and incorrect in­­­­formation to the administration regarding the bre­­aching section. Accor­dingly, the water level at Head Muhammadwala was set at 417 (above sea level), based on the 1992 flood flow.
However, the bridge had not been constructed at the time and the area was an open floodplain, with no controlled area of the bridge obstructing the flood flow, they said, adding that the 417-feet thr­eshold would increase the pressure on the Nawabpur and Akbar Flood embankments.
Since the government did not reassess the critical level at this gauge following the construction of the bridge, the situation at this head was precarious. The slow discharge from Head Muhammad­w­a­­la caused flooding from Jewana Bangla to Head Muhammadwala, they said, adding that the Ravi flood flow was also stagnant at Sidhnai Head­wo­rks for the same reason.
 
 

They urged the authorities to review the critical level to save Multan bef­ore the flood moving from Chiniot towards Trimmu Head­works could merge with the current flood flow.
According to PDMA, the Chenab at Marala Head­w­orks was flowing at 117,369 cusecs. Khanki Headworks was reporting a steady flow of 248,840 cusecs, while Qa­­dirabad Headworks was steady at 385,228 cusecs. The flow at Chiniot Bridge was steady at 554,998 cusecs. The water level at Rivaz Bridge was 520.50 feet; it was rising but remained below its maximum of 526 feet. Trimmu Headworks had a steady flow of 239,545 cusecs. At Head Muhammadwala, the level was steady at 414.00 feet against a maximum of 417.50 feet. The Sher Shah Bridge level was steady at 393.40 feet against a maximum of 393.50 feet.
Indian dams threat
Addressing a press conference, PDMA chief Irfan Ali Kathia said that the water level in Indian dams was continuously rising. He said that New Delhi had issued seven warnings to Pakistan about opening dam gates and three in the last 24 hours. He said that Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab would be affected after the release of more water from Indian dams.
Mr Kathia said that the situation at Head Sindhnai along the Ravi was “problematic” as water levels continued to increase at Jassar as well as Shahdara Headworks. He attributed the increase in the water level to the ‘backwater effect’. The DG said that as many as 3.8 million people had been safely evacuated from flood-affected areas in Punjab. “Massive evacuations have been carried out in the past 24 hours, mainly in Toba Tek Singh, Pir Mahal, Kabir­wala, and Khanewal.”
Sialkot villages cut off
As many as 85 villages of Bajwat, a rural area situated near the Pak-India border, remained cut off from the Sialkot district. Flash floods and incessant rainfall in the catchment area have swept away a bridge.
The residents had been without electricity since August 26 — the day when the devastating rain of over 500mm submerged Sialkot and adjoining areas, including Bajwat, and some other villages in neighbouring Chaprar town. Though the local administration temporarily constructed a Bailey bridge to connect Bajwat with Sialkot, recent flash floods in Tavi and Chenab rivers eroded its foundations, rendering it unusable.
“…Bajwat’s 85 villages are disconnected….despite the fact we have tried hard to restore mobility of the people,” Rana Iqbal Harnah, an MPA from Sialkot, told Dawn.
Sialkot Deputy Com­missioner Saba Asghar Ali said that Bajwat has some local markets from where the people were meeting their needs to some ext­ent. She said the administration was making all efforts to help the residents, adding that they were using bikes to access the area as boats could not be used due to the uneven terrain.
A local official, on condition of anonymity, said the situation was dire, particularly due to a prolonged power outage.  Cha­­­­prar town and its three villages have also been affected by floods and rains,” said Muh­am­mad Nafees, the Chaprar union council secretary, situated near Bajwat. Mr Nafees said the supply of various items from Sialkot to Bajwat continued to be disrupted due to the situation, leading to a shortage of essentials.
Flash flood in GB
Meanwhile, a flood ravaged Deral Valley in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district, damaging at least 20 houses and farmlands, Dawn.com reported.
Deral Assistant Com­mis­sioner Waseem Abbas told Dawn.com that the flood occurred at 6am due to heavy rains, which engu­lfed the Gamari area. “As a result of the floods, 20 houses were damaged, of which five were completely demolished,” he said. “In addition, crops and trees were also damaged.” GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq told Dawn.com that timely information was received from the villagers, which saved dozens of lives.
Another rain spell
Separately, another monsoon spell from September 6 to 9 is expected across the country, including the Punjab districts of Sialkot, Multan, and Khanewal.
In Balochistan, most districts are set to receive “rain-wind/thundershower” on Sept 7-9 with occasional gaps.
In Kashmir, rain-wind/thundershower, with isolated heavy falls, is expected from September 6 (evening) to 8 with occasional gaps, whereas Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cities will receive rainfall from Sept 7 to Sept 9.

They have just done the unthinkable.
They have won gold.
This is not the beginning of a feel-good sports movie. This is the true story of the Pakistan men’s ice hockey team, a group of diaspora athletes who, just one year after forming and without a single ice rink in their homeland, conquered the LATAM Cup Division III last month, winning all five fixtures. Their journey was a testament to love, identity, and the audacious belief that some dreams are worth chasing, no matter how impossible they seem.
It all began with a man and a question: “Why not us?”
Adnan Khan, known to everyone as Donny, is the founder of Pakistan ice hockey. He was born in Karachi, but his love for the game began as a teenager after he moved to the US.
“Ice hockey was something that I really felt connected with,” the 53-year-old Donny recalled while talking to Dawn. “It helped me kind of assimilate into American culture and society.”
That connection grew into a career. He worked for the NHL, USA Hockey and Hockey Canada, becoming a true ice hockey insider. But a piece of his heart was always in Pakistan. Now, he saw a way to use a sport that had helped him find his place in America to help represent his homeland on the world stage.

“I felt we need to represent Pakistan as a positive place in whatever way we can,” Donny said.
The spark ignited when family in Islamabad told him that the Canadian High Commission was using ice hockey to teach climate change. At the time, through his work with the NHL, he was supporting the LATAM Cup, a tournament growing to include teams beyond South America.
The stars aligned. “Why not us?” became a mission. But Donny knew this couldn’t just be a team of expats; it had to be Pakistan’s team. His years of groundwork were key.
Bridge of trust
“I’ve been in contact with the Pakistan Winter Sports Federation for a few years now,” he explained. He had sent equipment and arranged online coaching meetings for enthusiasts in the country’s northern regions. “I sent a letter last year saying I would like to have their endorsement to represent Pakistan in this tournament.”
His genuine efforts to grow the sport at home had by then built a bridge of trust.
“Because I’ve been helping the Winter Sports Federation, they were kind enough to continue to support us … they recognised that we were representing Pakistan here.”
This official endorsement was their badge of authenticity, allowing them to play under the Pakistani flag with full pride.
With that legitimacy secured, Donny jumped all in.

“I submitted the team into the tournament, started working on a logo, designing a jersey, and started finding a roster,” he said.
The first year was humbling.
“While trying to build the team, pretty much anyone I could talk to, I put on the team,” Donny recalled.
In their first tournament, last year’s LATAM Cup, Pakistan’s team was severely short-handed. Donny, who was also working as a coach in that tournament, remembered that they had only 13 skaters and one goalie — his 14-year-old son. They won just one game.
But a seed was planted.
There was also the financial reality of participating; but from the very beginning, this was a venture run on love, not money.
“We are managing everything from here, we don’t have sponsors or anything,” Donny revealed. “I’ve been covering some of the upfront costs for the startup just for the love of the game.”
The financial burden was a shared sacrifice, shouldered by everyone involved.
“We’ve been doing fundraising drives to cover the cost of jerseys and equipment,” Donny said. “And then a lot of the parents have been chipping in; people buying dinners for the team practices, things like that.”
This collective effort was the true foundation of every win. They were all volunteers, investing in a dream they believed was bigger than themselves.

Digital scavenger hunt
Building a national team from scratch in a year, however, requires more than just hope; it requires genius-level resourcefulness. That’s where the players took charge.
Zaakir Khan, a 20-year-old defenseman and the team’s co-captain, became a chief recruiter.
“After that first tournament, me and my co-captain, Tariq Khan, started looking for more diaspora players,” Zaakir told Dawn.
Their method was brilliantly simple.
“Through a website, we were able to look up common Pakistani last names who play ice hockey,” Zaakir, who played at college level for George Mason University, recounted. They scoured databases, reached out via social media, and used Google forms.
They were digital-age pioneers on a patriotic scavenger hunt.
But the call to represent Pakistan required a massive leap of faith. Players flew in from across North America and the UK, often paying their own way.

“It was such a leap of faith, right, to travel halfway across the continent to go play in a tournament with a bunch of guys you don’t really know much about,” Donny said, his voice full of gratitude.
They arrived to find a team that had barely practiced together.
“Right now we’re only able to practice before each tournament,” Zaakir explained. “We are able to get together three or four days before each tournament and we’re able to have quick practice.”
They played through injuries sustained in their brief, intense camps. They shared equipment.
They faced a unique challenge just before the LATAM Cup: their new jerseys, ordered from Pakistan to support the homeland, were stuck in shipping. The men’s team played in their old kits, lending their other set to the newly formed women’s team.
None of it mattered. They were playing for something bigger than themselves.
“It’s always special when you’re playing with people of your heritage,” Zaakir said, articulating a feeling shared by every team-mate. “To be able to play for your country is something that I never thought I’d be able to do.”

Tight-knit group
And, as Zaakir termed it, the team became a “family”.
“We are really fortunate that we were able to recruit players with whom we were able to connect and form a tight-knit group,” Zaakir said.
That chemistry was tested not just by competition, but by conflict. The tournament was non-checking, but the intensity of hockey often boils over.
In one pivotal moment during the LATAM Cup, an opponent ran into the team’s goalie. In a flash, the entire team rallied to defend their team-mate. It was an instinctual act of unity that spoke louder than any victory.
“As someone who’s watching the game and someone who’s responsible for this team, I was so proud of our guys who were standing up for each other,” Donny said. That moment proved they weren’t just a team in name; they were a family, a brotherhood willing to stand up for one another without a second thought.
This feeling of belonging is the team’s bedrock. For these young men, hockey had often been a lonely pursuit.
“Ice hockey is not a very brown dominated sport, especially not a Muslim dominated sport,” said forward Mahd Nasir while talking to Dawn. “So growing up in Vancouver, we grew up around not a lot of Muslim kids playing hockey. So being on a full team of a bunch of Pakistani kids is absolutely amazing.”
Different dynamic
It isn’t just the men’s team that made waves. The newly-formed women’s team, cobbled together from across North America, fought their way to a bronze medal at the LATAM Cup Division II — despite playing their first-ever tournament with a short-handed squad of just 12 players.
The architect behind that incredible feat is Riley Khan, the Assistant General Manager of Pakistan Ice Hockey, who took on the monumental task of building the program from scratch. For her, the mission was personal.
“I got into Pakistan Ice Hockey because last year, Adnan Khan [Donny], my father, put together the men’s team,” Riley told Dawn. “When I travelled to the tournament last year, I saw how many successful women’s teams there were and I wanted to take on the task of putting together a women’s team for Pakistan.”
The initial challenge was simply believing it was possible.

“It didn’t seem possible at the time that there were so many Pakistani women who were passionate about hockey,” she admitted, “until I started looking!”
What she and head coach Mariya Rauf built was more than a team; it was a sanctuary.
“It was surreal to be around girls with so many similar experiences,” Riley said, reflecting on the unique bond they formed. It allowed us to bond in a special way. We were able to create a dynamic that is different than other teams.”
Constant fear
That dynamic was tested by the same logistical nightmares that plagued the men’s team — players flying in from across continents, financial constraints, and the constant fear that it might all fall apart.
“There were multiple times when I was working on this team when I thought that it might not come together in time,” Riley revealed.
But through it all, Mariya was the on-ice glue that held everything together.
“Mariya was a huge part of bringing the girls together once we were at the tournament,” Riley said. “The girls… were connected by Pakistani heritage, but Mariya was a huge part of really bringing them together as a team.”
For Mariya, a NCAA Division I player for Yale, the experience was profoundly moving.
“It was really humbling. I never saw myself as someone people would follow, but knowing that some of the girls joined because of me meant a lot,” Mariya told Dawn. Her vision extended far beyond the ice. “I just hope these women realise that wearing Pakistan’s colors isn’t only about hockey, it’s about creating opportunities for the girls who come after us and showing them that Pakistani women belong in sports.”
This mission of representation was personal.
“As a Pakistani girl growing up in hockey, I never imagined something like this would ever be possible,” Mariya confessed. “I was almost always the only person of color in the locker room. To go from that to leading a team of Pakistani women on the international stage still feels surreal and is an experience that I will never forget.”
Something magical
In Florida, something magical happened. Riley and Mariya’s efforts culminated in a bronze medal and an outpouring of emotion.
It was a triumph of will over circumstance, proving that the passion for hockey and pride in their heritage knows no gender.
“The feeling was pure joy,” Mariya said, describing the locker room scene. “There was laughter, hugs and just a ton of pride. It felt bigger than us, like we had taken a step that would matter for years to come. That’s something none of us will forget.”

The men’s team, on the other hand, stormed through the Division III bracket, their chemistry defying their lack of practice time. And the people came. The few family members from the first year were joined by a legion of supporters.
“I don’t think I have seen this many Pakistani people come together to watch ice hockey. It was amazing,” Donny said.
The 22-year-old Mahd described the unforgettable scene: “People brought Pakistani flags and microphones and every time you scored and looked to the crowd there was a massive sea of Pakistani supporters, all screaming Pakistan Zindabad.”
When the final whistle blew against Peru, securing the 6-1 victory and the gold medal, it was more than a win. It was validation.
A new beginning
The goal now is to ensure this is not an ending, but a beginning. The victory earns them promotion to Division II.
With the roster now expanded to 22 players, Donny dreams of not turning players away but creating more teams.
“My hope is that rather than saying no to anybody, we can just create more teams,” Donny told. “There will be a spot open for maybe another team to come in and build their spot for Pakistan in the lower division.”
Zaakir and Mahd, meanwhile, spoke of inspiring a new generation both in the diaspora and in Pakistan itself.
“Having kids in Pakistan look up to us, it’s just huge,” Mahd said. “They can see kids from across the world… that are representing Pakistan and that are able to play hockey and fulfill representing their country. So that just gives hope to a lot of Pakistani children out there.”
It all started with a question: “Why not us?”
The answer is written in gold — proof that even the wildest dreams can find ice to skate on.

Macron said he, fellow European leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy held a call with United States President Donald Trump after their summit, and US contributions to the guarantees would be finalised in the coming days.
The meeting of 35 leaders from the “coalition of the willing” — of mainly European countries — was intended to finalise security guarantees and ask Trump for the backing that Europeans say is vital to make such guarantees viable.
Security guarantees are intended to reassure Ukraine and deter Russia, which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, from attacking its neighbour again.
“The day the conflict stops, the security guarantees will be deployed,” Macron told a press conference at the Elysee Palace in Paris, standing alongside Zelenskiy.
European officials say peace looks a distant prospect for now, but they want to be ready whenever the war ends. They also see the planning of security guarantees as a way to reassure Kyiv of their support and hope Trump will join their efforts.
Macron initially said the 26 nations — which he did not name — would deploy to Ukraine. But he later said some countries would provide guarantees while remaining outside Ukraine, for example, by helping to train and equip Kyiv’s forces.
He did not say how many troops would be involved in the guarantees.
‘Very specific substance’
Germany and other countries pledged they would be involved in that effort. But Berlin said it would decide on a military commitment only when conditions were clear, including the extent of US involvement in security guarantees.
Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made clear she would not send troops to Ukraine but said Italy was open to monitoring a ceasefire and training Ukrainian troops outside the country.
France and Britain, which co-chair the coalition of the willing, have indicated they are open to deploying troops to Ukraine after the war ends.
“We are working out which countries will take part in which security component,” Zelenskiy said.
“Twenty-six countries agreed to provide security guarantees. Today, for the first time in a long time, this is the first such serious, very specific substance.”
On his call with the coalition leaders, Trump said Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that he said is helping Moscow fund its war against Ukraine, a White House official said.
“The president also emphasised that European leaders must place economic pressure on China for funding Russia’s war efforts,” the official said.
Macron said the coalition and the US had agreed to work more closely on future sanctions, notably on Russia’s oil and gas sector, and on China.
Months of talks
European governments have said European forces in Ukraine would need their own US security guarantees as a “backstop”. Trump has made no explicit commitment to go that far.
His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, met French, British, German, Italian and Ukrainian senior diplomats ahead of the summit, before briefly attending the opening session.
European officials also wanted to highlight a lack of progress toward direct peace talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy since Trump hosted Putin in August, and to prod Trump to raise pressure on Moscow now.
Having rolled out the red carpet in Alaska, Trump on Wednesday accused Putin of conspiring with China and North Korea after the three countries’ leaders staged a show of unity in Beijing at a lavish commemoration of the end of World War Two.
Putin told Kyiv on Wednesday there was a chance to end the war in Ukraine via negotiations “if common sense prevails”, an option he said he preferred, although he was ready to end it by force if that was the only way.
Putin also ruled out the deployment of troops from Nato nations to Ukraine as part of a peace settlement. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte dismissed his objections.
“Why are we interested in what Russia thinks about troops in Ukraine? It’s a sovereign country,” he said at a conference in Prague before joining the Paris summit by video link.
“Russia has nothing to do with this,” he said. “I think we really have to stop making Putin too powerful.”</p><small>2025-09-04 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04152859a66e6e7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939636/pm-shehbaz-chinese-premier-reaffirm-working-on-cpec-20-as-firms-ink-21-mous' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, Chinese premier reaffirm working on CPEC 2.0 as firms ink 21 MoUs</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chinese Premier Li Qiang reaffirmed on Thursday to work together on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor’s (CPEC) second phase in a meeting that the former termed “most productive” as business firms inked 21 memorandums of understanding (MoUs).
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties that span various sectors, including trade, energy, defence, and infrastructure. PM Shehbaz is currently on a six-day visit to China, where he attended the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit held from August 31-September 1.
“Both sides also agreed to continue working closely on the next phase of upgraded CPEC 2.0, with its five new corridors,” said a statement today by the Press Information Department (PID) following the meeting in Beijing.
The prime minister highlighted the “significant contribution” of the CPEC in Pakistan’s socio-economic development in the past decade. He also stressed the need for early implementation of the Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway project, the Karakoram Highway realignment and operationalisation of the Gwadar Port.
 






In a post on X, PM Shehbaz termed the meeting “warm and most productive”.
“I also invited Chinese companies to enhance their investment footprint in Pakistan,” the premier said, noting the leaders’ agreement on advancing cooperation in information technology, agriculture, minerals, textiles and industry.
PM Shehbaz said: “I thanked the Chinese leadership & the people for their steadfast support to Pakistan’s socio-economic development, particularly through the successful implementation of CPEC, which was now entering its next phase.
“Inspired by President Xi Jinping’s visionary leadership, we remain committed to building a stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future,” he added.
 






The PID statement noted the meeting was “warm and friendly”, with both leaders expressing their satisfaction at the positive trajectory of Pak-China relations.
PM Shehbaz expressed his “deepest gratitude to the Chinese leadership and nation for their unflinching support to Pakistan’s territorial integrity, sovereignty, and socio-economic development”.
Both leaders also attended the ceremony of sharing of MoUs and agreements signed related to the “development of CPEC 2.0, science and technology, IT, media, agriculture, etc”.
Recalling the “important consensus” reached between PM Shehbaz and President Xi Jinping in their Tuesday meeting, the statement noted that both premiers reaffirmed their “shared resolve to further strengthen the iron-clad, all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China”.
“The signing of the Joint Action Plan 2024-2029 was deemed as an important step in this regard.”
The prime minister asserted that the government’s “tireless reform efforts were yielding promising results, made possible through China’s strong support”. In June, China rolled over $3.4 billion in loans to Pakistan to help boost Islamabad’s foreign exchange reserves.
 
 

PM Shehbaz also shared Pakistan’s intent to float Panda Bonds, a type of debt security issued by foreign entities denominated in Chinese yuan (RMB), in the Chinese capital market soon.
The prime minister briefed the Chinese premier on the Pakistan-China Business-to-Business Investment Conference held earlier today, where “more than 300 Pakistani and 500 Chinese companies were in attendance”.
He stressed the vast potential for B2B cooperation and investment, identifying agriculture, mines and minerals, textile, industrial sector and IT as priority areas for mutually beneficial economic collaboration.
PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s support for President Xi’s landmark initiatives to strengthen multilateralism, including the Global Governance Initiative, Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and the Global Civilisation Initiative.
The delegation-level talks were followed by a sumptuous luncheon, hosted by Premier Li in honour of PM Shehbaz and his team, PID added. Both countries would celebrate the 75th anniversary of the establishment of Pak-China diplomatic ties next year, it noted.
The premier’s ongoing visit was expected to mark the formal launch of the second phase of the CPEC-II, which focuses on industrial cooperation.
 
 

PM Shehbaz later met Chinese Minister for Information Technology and Industry Li Lecheng and reiterated Pakistan’s vision of deepening bilateral cooperation with China in industries, agriculture, trade, ICT, mining and minerals.
PM Shehbaz hailed CPEC as a central pillar of Pakistan’s socio-economic development and expressed satisfaction at its steady progress in its second phase.
Admiring the government’s economic reform agenda, Minister Li emphasised that China regarded Pakistan as an “ironclad brother and All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partner”.
He expressed China’s firm resolve to elevate bilateral relations to “new heights of cooperation and collaboration”.
 






The prime minister also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing.
He emphasised that industrial cooperation was the cornerstone of Pakistan-China economic cooperation and a “defining pillar” of CPEC’s development in its second phase.
He also invited Chinese companies to consider Pakistan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into special economic zones, saying that the country offered a “unique comparative advantage” with a large pool of skilled and cost-effective labour, competitive input costs and strategic connectivity to regional and global markets.
 






PM Shehbaz pledges security assurance to Chinese investors, terms it ‘paramount’
PM Shehbaz later termed the security of Chinese businesses “paramount” to Pakistan, inviting investment into the country under the banner of CPEC-2.0.
Addressing Chinese business leaders at the Pak-China B2B conference, PM Shehbaz said, “I want to make it clear before this assembly of great leaders that the security of Chinese brothers and sisters in Pakistan is paramount for all of us.”
He invited them to “come forward and change the landscape of progress and welfare” for both China and Pakistan.
Noting delays in the formal launch of CPEC-2.0, PM Shehbaz assured the potential investors that “Pakistan will not tolerate even a second’s delay” in facilitating Chinese companies.
He acknowledged that there were delays, and things had not “moved forward as per Chinese standards”; however, he stressed that Pakistan’s doors remained open to Chinese investors, adding that “we will not keep them waiting even for a second”.
The premier lauded CPEC-2.0 as a “win-win” equation for both Pakistan and China. Marking the formal launch of CPEC-2.0, he outlined B2B investment, agriculture, trade, IT, mines and minerals, and the establishment of SEZs as the main pillars of the second phase.
He added that Pakistan could fulfil China’s need for labour, suggesting that industries such as textiles, leather, among others, could be shifted to Pakistan. He recommended that the country could also produce those goods and services for China.
“This is the total crux of CPEC-2.0,” he said, noting that “if our economy strengthens, everything will fall into place”.
“I am here speaking to you first as the chief executive officer of Pakistan and then as the prime minister,” he added.
Thanking China and President Xi for their economic support, he noted that Pakistan’s economy was stable now because of it.
“Pakistan’s macro indicators continue to show progress, in the short, medium and long term,” the premier said, adding that recent progress was made due to the Chinese president’s “commitment towards Pakistan”.
He said that Pakistan was “now ready to compete with other countries in this race of economic development” with Chinese cooperation.
He and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal also witnessed the signing of 21 MoUs between business firms from Pakistan and China.
 






 






On Tuesday, at the sidelines of the SCO summit, PM Shehbaz and President Xi reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening their “iron-clad and all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.
In his meeting with the prime minister, President Xi pledged support for Pakistan’s home-grown capacity for development, expressing readiness to build CPEC 2.0 and upgrade the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement, and step up cooperation in industries, agriculture, and mining sectors.
PM Shehbaz had stressed the “significance of the CPEC as a flagship project of President Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to help both countries to build an even stronger Pakistan-China community with a shared future”.
 
 

During his recent address at Tianjin University, PM Shehbaz reiterated that all endeavours and initiatives of the current government of Pakistan “closely align with Chinese President Xi Jinping’s vision and philosophy”.
The government has sent 1,000 agriculture graduates from Pakistan to China to learn modern techniques, while about 30,000 students from Pakistan have been getting education and training in China, the premier noted.</p><small>2025-09-04 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04215916634499f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939710/pakistan-secure-spot-in-t20-tri-series-final-after-2nd-31-run-win-against-uae' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan secure spot in T20 tri-series final after 2nd 31-run win against UAE</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan secured their spot in the T20 tri-series final by a second 31-run win over the United Arab Emirates in Sharjah on Thursday.

A press release from the PMD said the quake originated at 9:56pm at a depth of 111 kilometres with its epicentre in the Hindu Kush region.
It said tremors were felt in Peshawar, Mansehra, Hangu, Abbottabad, Swat, Attock, Malakand, Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
 






State broadcaster PTV News said on X that the tremors “lasted for several seconds” and caused citizens to come out of their homes.
 






A statement from the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority said it received initial reports of an earthquake from “all districts” of the province.
PDMA Director General Irfan Kathia said that the administration across Punjab was busy checking buildings and no damage had been reported so far.
“District Emergency Operation Centres across Punjab, including the provincial control room of PDMA, are on 24/7 alert. Damages due to earthquake can be reported on PDMA’s helpline 1129,” the statement said.
Today’s quake comes after the PMD said on Tuesday that tremors were felt in Peshawar, Mansehra and Islamabad after another earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan.
A PMD press release said the 5.4-magnitude earthquake had occurred at 5:30pm in southeastern Afghanistan at a depth of 22km with tremors felt all the way in Peshawar, Mansehra, Islamabad, Abbottabad and Swat.
Meanwhile, the US Geological Survey had reported it as a 5.2-magnitude earthquake 34km northeast of Jalalabad city in Nangarhar province.
The epicentre of the tremor was close to where a magnitude 6.0 earthquake hit Afghanistan late on Sunday night, devastating remote areas in mountainous provinces near the border with Pakistan.
The PMD had reported four more minor quakes on Tuesday: a magnitude 3 with the epicentre 24km northeast of Pattan at a depth of 46km at 7:10pm, a magnitude 4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 2:50pm at a depth of 97km, a magnitude 5.4 in China’s Xinjiang at 12:59pm at a depth of 10km and a magnitude 4.4 in southeastern Afghanistan at 12:25pm at a depth of 20km.</p><small>2025-09-04 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/041650119a7e19c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939684/talk-of-hybrid-system-is-admission-of-dictatorship-justice-minallah' target='_blank'><strong>Talk of ‘hybrid system’ is admission of dictatorship: Justice Minallah</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court Justice Athar Minallah on Thursday said that the talk of a “hybrid system” prevalent in the country actually amounted to an admission to the presence of a dictatorship.
What had previously only been a term coined by analysts to describe the unique system of governance currently in vogue, is now apparently being worn as a badge of honour. Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had in July spoken in glowing terms about the ‘hybrid regime’ that currently runs the country. The term is used to describe the informal power-sharing arrangement, whereby the country’s military holds a great deal of influence on the incumbent civilian setup and has a big say in the way the affairs of the state are managed.
In remarks on the issue while addressing the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) today, Justice Minallah said: “It is something to accept that people today say there is a hybrid system, that [actually] means there is dictatorship and there is no constitutional governance.”
He blamed what he said was the “lack of constitutional governance” in the country that was responsible for elite capture over the rule of law or the Constitution.
“I had to write in many high court orders that there is no rule of law or Constitution in the country; there is elite capture,” he explained.
He said that the history of the country’s judiciary was “not something to be proud of for me”.
The judge said that his generation had passed its time, caused whatever destruction it could to the country, and should never be afraid to admit it, adding that they could not blame anyone else and that this had kept happening throughout the country’s history.
Justice Minallah said that, as per the oath, judges had to impartially decide cases in accordance with the law and defend the Constitution without fear or favour, adding that the judiciary at all levels was bound to the oath and answerable to God and the people.
He explained that if there was a lack of constitutional governance in the country and he, as a judge, did nothing about it, he would not only be violating the Constitution but also his oath.
“Unfortunately, we are taught distorted history, and no one tells us the truth. Our generation did whatever it could do; the most we can do now is to hand over the baton to you and at least tell you the truth.
“The societies in which the truth is eliminated and truth ceases to be spoken are destroyed.”
Justice Minallah further said that no lesson had been learnt from history.
“The root of the country’s split in 1971 was laid down in the dissolution of the constituent assembly by the civil-military bureaucracy,” he said, pointing out that while there had always been free and independent judges in the country’s history, “the judiciary has never played the role that it ought to have.”
He said the Constitution was the expression of the people’s will and premised on the people’s right to rule through elected representatives, adding that it demanded that no institution or political officeholder would engage in political engineering and that any representatives would be elected through fair and transparent means.
“Unfortunately, that too has remained a dream for our history.”
He said the only way forward was to abide by the Constitution and govern the country accordingly, together with the upcoming young generation.
“This idealism of the youth will bring a change in the country. We know that fundamental rights are meaningless, there is no freedom of expression, there is a restriction on political thoughts and criticism,” he said, adding that the country would not have split if there had not been a clampdown on the freedom of expression.
Responding to the judge later in the day, Asif pointed out his role as a provincial minister in the former NWFP government under the tenure of former dictator Pervez Musharraf and called for self-reflection.</p><small>2025-09-04 17:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621981-59-magnitude-earthquake-jolts-twin-cities-parts-of-kp' target='_blank'><strong>5.9-magnitude earthquake jolts twin cities, parts of KP</strong></a><br><p>

The vast majority of the total 2,217 dead and nearly 4,000 injured were in the mountainous Kunar province near the border with Pakistan, deputy government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat wrote on X, adding that “rescue efforts are still ongoing”.
 






Firat said that the earlier toll of 1,469 dead and more than 3,700 injured would likely rise. “We cannot stop hoping” that injured people remain alive under the rubble, he told AFP.
Limited access to the hardest hit areas of mountainous Kunar province delayed rescue and relief efforts, with rockfalls from repeated aftershocks obstructing already precarious roads etched onto the side of cliffs.
While most of the areas that had been unreachable were accessed by Wednesday, expectations of finding survivors were fading fast.
“Many survivors are still believed to be trapped beneath collapsed homes in remote villages, and the window for finding them alive is rapidly closing,” the World Health Organisation (WHO) said in a statement late on Wednesday.
‘Crisis within a crisis’
Poor infrastructure in the impoverished country, still fragile from four decades of war, has also stymied the emergency response.
The WHO warned that local healthcare services were “under immense strain”, with shortages of trauma supplies, medicines and staff. The agency has appealed for $4 million to deliver lifesaving health interventions, expand mobile health services and supply distribution.
“Every hour counts,” WHO emergency team lead in Afghanistan, Jamshed Tanoli, said in a statement. “Hospitals are struggling, families are grieving and survivors have lost everything.”
 
 

The loss of US foreign aid to the country in January this year has exacerbated the rapid depletion of emergency stockpiles and logistical resources.
NGOs and the UN have warned that the earthquake creates a crisis within a crisis, with cash-strapped Afghanistan already contending with overlapping humanitarian disasters.
UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said on X that the quake had “affected more than 500,000 people” in eastern Afghanistan.
 






After decades of conflict, the country is contending with endemic poverty, severe drought and the influx of millions of Afghans forced back to the country by Pakistan and Iran since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover.
Even as Afghanistan reeled from its latest disaster, Pakistan began a new push to expel Afghans, with more than 6,300 people crossing the Torkham border point in quake-hit Nangarhar province on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-09-04 15:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04173821d4714b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939696/mustafa-khokhar-moves-supreme-court-to-fix-pending-petitions-challenging-26th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Mustafa Khokhar moves Supreme Court to fix pending petitions challenging 26th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar on Thursday moved the Supreme Court (SC), seeking its intervention to pave the way for the fixation of pending petitions challenging the 26th Constitutional Amendment before the full court.
The 26th Constitutional Amendment, also known as the Constitutional Package, is legislation that takes away the SC’s suo motu powers, sets the CJP’s term at three years and empowers a special par­liamentary committee to nominate the next CJP from among the three most senior SC judges.
 
 

Last month, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi had ignored a decision made last year by a committee, constituted under the Practice and Procedure Act 2023, to bring challenges to the 26th Amendment of the Constitution before the full SC.
After filing his petition today, Khokhar said while speaking to the media that he sought the CJP’s decision to be overturned.
“The chief justice said, ‘I have informally consulted all Supreme Court justices. We have concluded that all judges of the Supreme Court do not hear this case’”, Khokhar said.
“When one committee administratively gives its decision according to the law, you cannot ignore it,” the former senator emphasised. “In our petition, we have put forward this exact stance — that the committee’s decision stands on its own merit and CJP Afridi’s informal consultations have no legal basis.”
According to a copy of the petition available with Dawn.com, Khokhar pleaded that the apex court “declare that the decision of the committee constituted under Section 2 of the Practice and Procedure Act, directing fixation of the pending petitions before the Full Court is binding and shall be implemented forthwith.”
He requested that the law secretary and other authorities related to the matter be directed to immediately fix the pending petitions challenging the 26th Constitutional Amendment before the Full Court in compliance with the committee’s decision date.
Additionally, he pleaded that the apex court declare that “any administrative act or explanation negating or obstructing the implementation of the committee’s order is without lawful authority and of no legal effect”.
He lastly requested the court to pass any other order deemed “just and proper” in the circumstances of the case, in the interest of justice and to uphold the Constitution.
The petition argued that under Section 2(2) of the Practice and Procedure Act, the committee, by majority decision dated October 31, 2024, directed the registrar’s office to fix the petitions before the Full Court.
“The said direction remains lawful, valid, and binding. Neither the registrar nor any other administrative authority has the competence to disregard or override a lawful order of the committee,” it stated.
Khokhar contended that ignoring the committee’s decision was akin to administrative impropriety and damaged the apex court as an institution.
“The refusal to implement the committee’s lawful order deprives the petitioners and other stakeholders of their constitutional right to a fair hearing and timely adjudication of challenges involving the basic structure of the Constitution, thereby offending Articles 4, 10A, and 25 of the Constitution,” the petition added.
Since October 2024, petitions have been filed with the SC challenging the amendment, contending that it “abrogates, repeals, alters and destroys the basic features of the Constitution” and “violates” fundamental rights.</p><small>2025-09-04 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621943-us-strongly-condemns-suicide-attack-at-bnp-rally-in-quetta' target='_blank'><strong>US 'strongly condemns' suicide attack at BNP rally in Quetta</strong></a><br><p>

For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur on a daily basis.
South Punjab Additional Inspector General of Police (IG) Kamran Khan told Dawn.com that between 20 and 25 suspects attacked vehicles on the motorway.
“Three people were injured in the incident,” he said. “Two of them suffered minor injuries, so they were discharged. One remains admitted in hospital with gunshot wounds to the waist and leg.”
Additional IG Khan added that 10 people were abducted from the scene by the suspects and that no money or valuables were stolen.
Sheikh Zayed Medical College Hospital (SZMCH) spokesperson Rana Ilyas Ahmed confirmed to Dawn.com that three injured people were admitted to the facility.
He later said that two of the injured had been discharged, while one was “receiving treatment for a gunshot wound to the leg”.
“The injured were aboard the same coach and hail from Sheikhupura,” Ilyas said.
Rahim Yar Khan police spokesperson Sub-Inspector Zeeshan Randhawa told Dawn.com that the incident took place on Thursday morning, but did not confirm any injuries or fatalities.
Quoting the Rahim Yar Khan district police officer, Randhawa added that this attack was retaliation for a drone attack carried out on a bandit hideout in the district’s Kacha Ronti area a day earlier.
“We received threats from bandit gangs about a retaliatory attack,” the spokesperson said. “This attack on the motorway was in response to yesterday’s operation.”
Videos and photos recorded at the scene show trucks and other vehicles with bullet holes and popped tyres.
A first information report (FIR) was registered at Bhong police station under Sections 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common
object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 431 (mischief by injury to public road, bridge, river, or channel) and 440 (mischief committed after preparation made causing death or hurt) of the Pakistan Penal Code, as well as Section 7 (punishment for terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
According to the FIR, available with Dawn.com, the incident took place in the early hours of Thursday morning and the attackers were armed with assault rifles and rocket launchers. The firing lasted for half an hour.
It added that one of the vehicles attacked was armoured and belonged to the government.
On August 1, five cops were martyred after bandits from the Katcha area attacked a police checkpoint in Rahim Yar Khan.
In March, three people were allegedly shot dead by dacoits in the Jamaldin Wali area of tehsil Sadiqabad near the Indus River, to avenge the murder of a YouTuber.</p><small>2025-09-04 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04115858e4c7b73.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939639/lahore-atc-also-grants-bail-to-imran-khans-nephew-shershah-in-may-9-riots-case' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore ATC also grants bail to Imran Khan’s nephew Shershah in May 9 riots case</strong></a><br><p>An anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Lahore on Thursday granted bail to PTI founder Imran Khan’s nephew Shershah Khan in a case pertaining to the Jinnah House attack during the May 9, 2023 riots.
The Lahore Police arrested Shershah, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from outside his home on August 22. He was then sent on a five-day physical remand and later to jail for 14 days on August 28.
Today’s development comes a day after Shershah’s triathlete brother, Shahrez Khan, was also granted bail in a similar case. Shahrez was picked up on August 21 and was handed over to police custody for eight days before his judicial remand and bail.
He was released today from Kot Lakpat Jail after paying bail.
 






In the last hearing on Tuesday, the ATC had again granted the prosecution time till today to present the case record in connection with Shershah’s post-arrest bail plea.
ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill presided over the hearing today, where Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer appeared as Shershah’s counsel.
 
 

During the hearing, Umer pointed out that the prosecution had still not produced the case record in the Jinnah House attack case against Shershah.
“No one knows when the trial will begin. Therefore, the suspect cannot be kept in jail for an unlimited period,” the counsel contended. He asserted that “no evidence” had been produced against his client on the record.
“The suspect was not involved in any riots,” Umer stated, arguing that individuals with more serious charges against them had been given bail in other cases.
“Someone cannot be implicated [in a case] just based on one suspect’s identification of him,” the lawyer contended.
Pointing out the arrest “28 months” after the May 9 incidents, Umer alleged, “Vindictive actions are being taken because of being a part of the PTI founder’s family.
The lawyer called the purported recovery of a cane from Shershah, as per the prosecution, “planted”. He argued that the same ATC had previously discharged PTI’s Dr Yasmin Rashid from a case based on a co-suspect’s statement.
Subsequently, Judge Gill accepted the post-arrest bail plea of Shershah against a surety bond of Rs100,000 and ordered his release, if not needed in any other case.
Umer, on X, said the bail was a “result of teamwork” of the lawyers.
 






Shershah’s lawyer, Barrister Taimur Malik, also confirmed the bail approval on X.
 






His cousin, Qasim Zaman Khan, referring to the bails of both brothers, alleged: “These arrests were nothing but political victimisation.”
 






Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed their concerns over the arrests of Shahrez and Shershah, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-09-04 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/041734226d17a52.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939675/pakistan-qatar-reaffirm-commitment-to-regional-peace-and-stability' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Qatar reaffirm commitment to regional peace and stability</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and Qatar reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace and stability during a meeting between Pakistan’s top military official, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and Qatari military leadership on his visit to Qatar, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) Mirza, — who is in Qatar for the second round of the Higher Military Cooperation Committee (HMCC) — called on the Deputy Prime Minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani, where both sides “reaffirmed their shared commitment to peace and stability at the regional and global level,” a press release issued by the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“The civil and military leadership of Qatar acknowledged Pakistan’s pivotal and responsible role in ensuring regional stability,” it added.
Also present at the meeting was the Chief of Staff Qatar Armed Forces, Lieutenant General Jassim Mohammad Ahmed Al-Mannal. The CJCSC was presented with a guard of honour at the Qatar Armed Forces Headquarters ahead of the meeting.
As per ISPR, CJCSC “highlighted historic brotherly ties between both nations”, discussing the “future dimensions of cooperation in defence and security domains between the two countries within the ambit of the Higher Military Cooperation Committee.”
The Qatari military leadership lauded the sacrifices the Pakistan armed forces have made in the country’s fight against terrorism, ISPR said.
Pakistan and Qatar share strong bilateral ties across multiple sectors. In 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Gulf country, where both nations agreed to deepen cooperation and explore new horizons to strengthen bilateral ties. In October last year, Qatar pledged to invest $3 billion in multiple sectors in Pakistan.
In October 2023, the then Chief of Staff of Qatar’s armed forces, Lieutenant General Salem Hamad Eqail Al-Nabet, had called on Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal General Asim Munir, and appreciated Pakistan Army’s continuous efforts for peace and stability in the region.</p><small>2025-09-04 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04144405d9a367e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939663/china-denies-conspiring-with-north-korea-russia-against-us' target='_blank'><strong>China denies conspiring with North Korea, Russia against US</strong></a><br><p>China defended on Thursday its decision to invite the leaders of Russia and North Korea to World War II commemorations, which President Donald Trump accused them of using to conspire against the United States.
Trump wrote a testy Truth Social post addressing his Chinese counterpart after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and Russia’s Vladimir Putin flanked Xi Jinping at a massive parade in Beijing showcasing Chinese military hardware.
“Give my warmest regards to Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un, as you conspire against The United States of America,” Trump wrote.
 


Asked about Trump’s post, Beijing’s foreign ministry said on Thursday “foreign guests” had been invited to commemorate 80 years since the end of World War II.
“It is to work together with peace-loving countries and peoples to remember history, cherish the memory of the martyrs, cherish peace, and create the future,” spokesman Guo Jiakun told reporters.
“China’s development of diplomatic relations with any country is never directed against any third party,” he said.
The Kremlin, meanwhile, said on Wednesday it thought Trump’s allegation was “not without irony”.
Beijing had much stronger words for the European Union’s top diplomat Kaja Kallas, who also criticised the parade.
Kallas said on Wednesday that Xi, Putin and Kim appearing together was part of efforts to build an anti-Western “new world order” and was “a direct challenge to the international system built on rules”.
 
 

“The remarks made by a certain EU official are full of ideological bias, lack basic historical knowledge, and blatantly stir up confrontation and conflict,” Guo said on Thursday.
“Such statements are profoundly misguided and utterly irresponsible,” he said, adding, “We hope that those people will abandon their frog-in-the-well prejudice and arrogance … and do more things that are conducive to world peace and stability and China-Europe relations.“
Xi holds talks with Kim in Beijing
State media reported that Xi and Kim have had talks in Beijing while the North Korean leader is in China on a rare foreign visit.
China is North Korea’s most important ally, their relationship forged in the bloodshed of the Korean War in the 1950s.
Chinese state media said Kim and Xi met for talks in Beijing’s Great Hall of the People today. The foreign ministry said earlier that the talks would be “an in-depth exchange of views on China-DPRK relations and issues of common concern”, using the acronym for North Korea.

“China is willing to work with the DPRK to strengthen strategic communication… (and) deepen the exchange of experience in governance,” spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
Kim arrived in Beijing on Tuesday accompanied by his daughter Kim Ju Ae, his second reported trip abroad in six years and his first to China since 2019.</p><small>2025-09-04 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621894-un-urges-pakistan-to-halt-afghan-expulsions-after-deadly-quake' target='_blank'><strong>UN urges Pakistan to halt refugee expulsions after deadly quake in Afghanistan</strong></a><br><p>

A mop-haired Chopra became India’s first track-and-field athlete to win Olympic gold in the Japanese capital four years ago, and has since added a Diamond League trophy, world championships gold and a silver medal at the 2024 Paris Games.
In November last year, the 27-year-old brought in three-time Olympic champion Jan Zelezny as his coach in a bid to throw even farther. Six months into the partnership, Chopra registered a personal best of 90.23m in Doha earlier this year.
But the Indian has fallen well short of 90m in his last five outings and threw a modest 85.01m in the Diamond League Final in Zurich last week, finishing a distant second behind German Julian Weber’s monster throw of 91.51m.
While a string of high 80m throws have kept him in the top two in each of his last 26 competitions, Chopra acknowledged it would probably not be enough to leave Tokyo with another gold medal around his neck this month.
“This was not too bad. But we are getting very close to the world championships, so I still need to throw a little bit further,” Chopra said after Zurich.
“There were a few things that went well, but still, there were the things which did not go that well.

“In this sport, we do not know. It depends on the day. In Tokyo, everything will be different.”

Weber laid down the gauntlet with a pair of 90m-plus throws in Zurich. Chopra and Brazil’s Luiz Mauricio da Silva are the other others to have breached that mark this season.
“Julian, he is a good friend of mine and I am always happy when he is doing well and we push each other,” said Chopra.
“At major championships, the gold is more important than the far throws. So I will try my best to win the medal.”</p><small>2025-09-04 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/04122539c08a527.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939641/global-funding-cuts-to-force-6m-more-children-out-of-school-in-2026-unicef' target='_blank'><strong>Global funding cuts to force 6m more children out of school in 2026: Unicef</strong></a><br><p>Amid global cuts in education funding, the UN agency for children (Unicef) has projected that an estimated six million additional children could be out of school worldwide by the end of 2026, with around one-third of them in humanitarian settings.
The projection was made in an new analysis, according to a Unicef press release issued on Wednesday, which said that the Official Development Assistance for education was estimated to fall by $3.2 billion — a 24 per cent drop from 2023 — with just three donor governments accounting for nearly 80 per cent of the cuts.
“Such a decline would push the number of out-of-school children worldwide from 272m to 278m — the equivalent of emptying every primary school in Germany and Italy combined,” it added.
The press release quoted Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell as saying, “Every dollar cut from education is not just a budgetary decision, it is a child’s future hanging in the balance.”
“Education, especially in emergency settings, often serves as a lifeline, connecting children to essential services like health, protection, and nutrition. It also provides the strongest opportunity for a child to escape poverty and build a better life,” she said.
The Unicef analysis showed that West and Central Africa face the “sharpest impact, with 1.9m children at risk of losing out”, while the Middle East and North Africa could face “an increase of 1.4m out-of-school children”, alongside major rollbacks in all other regions.
Moreover, 28 countries were projected to lose at least a quarter of the education assistance for pre-primary, primary, and secondary schooling. “Among them, Ivory Coast and Mali face some of the greatest risks, with enrolment at risk of declining by 4pc — equivalent to 340,000 and 180,000 students, respectively,” the press release said.
The analysis concluded that primary education would be hit the hardest, with funding set to fall by a third, “deepening the learning crisis and putting affected children at risk of losing an estimated $164bn in lifetime earnings”.
It further underlined that in humanitarian settings, “where education goes beyond learning, offering life-saving support, stability, and a sense of normalcy for traumatised children, funding could drop sharply – in some cases, cutting the equivalent of at least 10 per cent of the national education budget.
“For example, in Unicef’s Rohingya refugee response, 350,000 children risk losing access to basic education permanently. Without urgent funding, education centres may close, leaving children vulnerable to exploitation, child labour, and trafficking.
“Essential services such as school feeding programmes, sometimes a child’s only nutritious meal of the day, could see funding slashed by more than half, while support for girls’ education is also set to decline significantly,” the press release read.
Moreover, it was pointed out that “wide cuts at the system level will also undermine governments’ ability to make evidence-based plans, adequately support teacher development, and monitor learning outcomes.”
This means that even children who remain in school could see their learning suffer, with at least 290m students across all regions projected to face a decline in education quality, the press release said.
Unicef urged donor and partner countries to “act now to protect education by rebalancing education assistance to be more equitable and effective with a minimum of 50pc directed to least developed countries; safeguarding humanitarian education funding and prioritising education as a lifesaving intervention alongside other essential services; focusing education assistance on foundational learning, concentrating on early childhood and primary education where the returns are the highest; simplifying global financing architecture in line with the UN80 Initiative to improve efficiencies; and expanding innovative financing without replacing core funding to education”.
 






“Investing in children’s education is one of the best investments in the future — for everyone,” the press release quoted Russell as saying. “Countries do better when their children are educated and healthy, and it contributes to a more stable and prosperous world.”</p><small>2025-09-04 08:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621893-pakistan-to-witness-rare-blood-moon-on-sept-7-8' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to witness rare 'Blood Moon' on Sept 7-8</strong></a><br><p>

Since late July, monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country, especially in its northern regions like GB, by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
The assistant commissioner of Deral, Waseem Abbas, told Dawn.com that he flood occurred at 6am on Friday due to heavy rains, which engulfed the Gamari area.
“As a result of the floods, twenty houses were damaged, of which five were completely demolished,” he said. “In addition, crops and trees were also damaged.“
According to locals, many people fled when the flood hit, with dozens moving to safer places. They added that the water channel system was also severely affected by the flood, with damage to cattle sheds and livestock.
The National Disaster Management Authority has instructed citizens not to go near drains and stay in hotels during the rain.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq told Dawn.com that timely information was received from the villagers, which saved dozens of lives.
“On the instructions of the chief minister Haji Gulbar Khan, relief teams have been sent to Deral,” Faraq added. “The Deral administration has also been directed to visit the flood-affected areas and start relief and rehabilitation work on an emergency basis. Rescue and disaster management teams have also been sent.”
On Sunday, the Pakis­tan Meteo­rological Depar­tment issued a high-priority alert for Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs) in the northern regions and warned of urban flooding in the country’s upper parts.
Last month, it was reported that hundreds of people in GB had fallen victim to water-borne diseases owing to a severe shortage of clean drinking water following devastating floods in the region.</p><small>2025-09-04 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/621885-gujrat-reels-after-record-577mm-rain-inundates-city' target='_blank'><strong>Gujrat sinks in deluge from 'record rainfall' as Punjab fights flood fury</strong></a><br><p>

When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
People in Asia, including India and China, will be best placed to see Sunday’s total eclipse, which will also be visible on the eastern edge of Africa as well as in western Australia.
The total lunar eclipse will last from 1730 GMT to 1852 GMT (10:30pm PKT to 11:52pm PKT).
Stargazers in Europe and Africa will get a brief chance to see a partial eclipse just as the Moon rises during the early evening, while the Americas will miss out.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
Blue wavelengths of light are shorter than red ones, so are more easily dispersed as they travel through Earth’s atmosphere, he told AFP.
“That’s what gives the moon its red, bloody colour.” While special glasses or pinhole projectors are needed to safely observe solar eclipses, all that is required to see a lunar eclipse is clear weather — and being in the right spot.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022.
Milligan, a self-described “solar eclipse chaser”, said he considered Sunday’s event a prelude to what he called the “big one” next year.
A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.
For more than a decade, Milligan has travelled the world to witness 12 totalities, which is when the Moon completely obscures the Sun.
Next year’s totality —  the first in mainland Europe since 2006 — will be visible only in Spain and Iceland, though other countries will be able to see a significant partial eclipse.
In Spain, the totality will be visible in a roughly 160-kilometre (100-mile) band between Madrid and Barcelona, but neither city will see the full phenomenon, Milligan said.
It will be the first total solar eclipse since one swept across North America in April 2024.</p><small>2025-09-04 06:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/041006549e66ad9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939600/theme-park-owner-arrested-for-raising-illegal-scheme-in-ravi' target='_blank'><strong>Theme Park owner arrested for raising illegal scheme in Ravi</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) has arrested the owner of Theme Park, an ‘illegal’ housing scheme raised in the river bed of Ravi.
The scheme was completely inundated by the swollen river last week.
“Khushi Muhammad built this illegal housing scheme in the Ravi land, made residential plots on 12,000 kanals inside the river bed and sold them to citizens by fraud. The suspect had not built the society as per law and even couldn’t establish any kind of sewage system in the fake housing scheme and since the entire area was inside the river, therefore, all the houses in the illegal housing scheme were submerged by the floodwater,” an ACE spokesperson said in a statement on Wednesday.
He said the ACE had also sought record of all illegal housing schemes established in the Ravi bed from the River Urban Development Authority (Ruda) and the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) so that action could be taken against those housing schemes as per the law.

ACE seeks record from Ruda, LDA: promises strict action

“Theme Park was not approved by the relevant departments. Keeping in mind public complaints, the ACE has decided to take strict action against all such illegal housing schemes which are established on river land,” he said and added the construction of housing societies on river land could not be permitted at all and indiscriminate action would be taken against already-established illegal housing schemes as well.
 
 

A source said Khushi Muhammad was a police constable before he kicked off this project — Theme Park — with a small piece of land.
“By exploiting the loopholes in the system and greasing the palm of the officials concerned, he continued acquiring more land in the river bed and sold the same to the citizens. He also managed to transfer billions of rupees abroad.
Interestingly, it is the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) which usually initiates action against the housing societies involved in fraudulent activities but in this case the ACE stepped in first.
“It will be a test case for Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz whether she successfully lays hands on those involved in this mega corruption housing scam along the river bed or buckles under the pressure of those who have strong connections in certain corridors,” an official source said and added not only the owners of such societies but top officials in bureaucracy that helped them build structures on the river land with impunity should be taken to task.
Federal Minister for Communication Aleem Khan, also the president of Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party (IPP) which was dubbed as king’s party at the time of its inception in 2023, had got a major relief same year following NAB’s decision to close an inquiry against him for allegedly occupying and encroaching public passages and illegal extension of the Park View housing society both in Lahore and Islamabad under the new accountability laws.
The property tycoon was accused of illegally occupying ‘public passages’ and illegal extension of River Edge Housing Society Lahore and also illegal extension of a housing society (Park View) in Islamabad, thus minting money from general public by selling plots in unapproved phases.
The LDA had raised an objection saying the housing scheme was situated in a river area which could not be utilised for any residential purposes. “It is not safe for the people’s lives to allow residential construction there (Ravi area),” the LDA had informed NAB.
“The land also fell in an agricultural area and did not carry the characteristics of urban property thus the scheme was not approved. Despite this, Aleem Khan and others started selling the plots falling in the area for which approval was refused,” NAB had alleged. It is a big question mark how come RUDA, LDA or TMAs approved structures along the river bed.
In recent days, billions of rupees of residents have been lost in various housing schemes and katchi abadis after floodwater entered their houses and business premises in Lahore. This area comes under the Ravi Riverfront Urban Development Project being executed along a 46km long stretch of Ravi by RUDA.

While the increase marks a positive development, the sector still faces significant challenges, with large areas of cotton crops submerged by floods, especially in Punjab. The floodwaters are now heading towards Sindh, threatening further damage.
According to the latest report from the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) released on Wednesday, as of Augu 31, ginneries across the country had received 1.336 million bales of raw cotton, reflecting a 9 per cent increase over the same period last year.
 
 

The rise has been largely driven by a notable surge in cotton arrivals from Sindh, where production is up by 87pc compared to Punjab. In fact, ginneries in Sindh received 352,000 bales between Aug 16 and 31, a sharp increase from 226,000 bales in the first half of August and a substantial jump from 130,000 bales in the same period last year.
This brings the total for Sindh to 1.336 million bales, a 13pc increase compared to 2024, despite the adverse weather conditions.

Lint production increases by 9pc driven mainly by a surge in Sindh

In contrast, cotton arrivals in Punjab have shown a more modest increase. Ginneries in the province received 466,000 bales by Aug 31, which is a 3pc rise compared to the same period last year. However, a separate report from the Crop Reporting Service Punjab indicated a record 125pc increase in cotton production in the province compared to the PCGA’s data.
Industry challenges persist
Despite the early positive figures, experts warn that the sector’s future remains uncertain. Ihsan Ul Haq, Chairman of the Cotton Ginners Forum, cautioned that the full impact of the floods and rains will only be clear once the adverse weather conditions subside. While many cotton zones have experienced only minor damage, Bahawalnagar, Pakistan’s largest cotton-producing district, has reportedly seen a 50% loss in its crop.
Moreover, a recent report by the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC) projected a deficit of 100,000 tonnes (around 625,000 bales) in Pakistan’s total cotton production this year due to the weather-related disruptions.
Sajid Mahmood, an industry expert, explained that although initial reports show positive figures, they do not paint the full picture. Severe heatwaves, floods, and water shortages have put immense pressure on the cotton crop.

This would translate into an estimated 90pc increase in the bulk hydropower rate to about Rs11.55 per unit (kilowatt hour) from Rs6.10 per unit, an official told Dawn.
The additional revenue of about Rs174bn demanded by Wapda for FY26 also covers an unaddressed financial gap of Rs22.35bn for FY23, Rs56bn for FY24 and Rs61bn for FY25. The Rs365bn revenue requirement further includes Rs29.5bn net hydel profit (NHP) to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at Rs1.55 per unit, Rs11.7bn to Punjab at Rs1.47 per unit, and Rs5bn in water use charges to Azad Kashmir at Rs1.10 per unit.
 
 

The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has scheduled a public hearing on September 11 to assess whether Wapda’s claim is justified for an 85pc increase in return on investments and operations and maintenance (O&M) to Rs179bn in FY26, compared to Rs97bn determined in FY23.
This includes Wapda’s demand for raising O&M expenses from Rs24bn in FY23 to Rs30.665bn in FY24, Rs36.374bn in FY25 and Rs39.59bn in FY26 — a 67pc increase. The claims also include a depreciation charge of Rs7.924bn in FY24, Rs8.611bn in FY25 and Rs8.7bn in FY26. Nepra has also raised questions about Wapda’s demand for a weighted average cost of capital (WACC)-based return on power stations of Rs31.582bn, Rs32.294bn and Rs32.011bn for FY24, FY25 and FY26, respectively.
Similarly, the request for WACC-based return on investment in power projects amounting to Rs59.783bn, Rs78.408bn and Rs99.642bn for the same three years is under scrutiny.
Overall, Wapda has sought its own revenue requirement at Rs318.5bn for FY26 — an almost 166pc increase compared to Rs119.962bn in Fy23. In addition, Wapda has kept its estimates relatively stable for levies and dues payable to the provinces and AJK on account of NHP and water use charges.
Annual NHP payments to KP are estimated at Rs29.53bn for FY26 compared to Rs30bn in FY23. Similar payments to Punjab are booked at Rs11.969bn for FY26 against Rs11.867bn in FY23, while water use charges for AJK are projected at Rs5.085bn in FY26 against Rs4.222bn in FY23. Wapda’s power generation from all assets is projected at 31,563 gigawatt hours (GWh) in FY26, slightly up from 31,286GWh in Fy23.
A key issue for scrutiny will be Wapda’s request to carve out 20MW for a wheeling arrangement to Sky47 — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) of Mari Energy — for data centres of strategic and commercial use, in line with the competitive trading bilateral contract market (CTBCM), along with provisions for post-retirement benefits of Wapda employees.
