Americans re-elected Donald Trump, knowing his fascist proclivities, to accomplish precisely this aim. Notwithstanding the clownish aspects of the fascist consolidation of power (reminiscent of the classical precedents), the cruelty, vengeance, ignorance and pettiness are real, and threaten to take down the entire human species in the course of the predictable implosion from within.
In writing about incipient American fascism since the late 1990s, I have always been careful to note the missing elements compared to the Italian and German precedents, particularly the lack of a charismatic leader and a revolutionary militia, but no such doubts remain. I was cautious even 10 years ago, when pointing out the limited appeal of the alt-right’s ethno-nationalist fantasies, but no longer hesitate to declare this a classical fascist dictatorship in its objectives. Curtis Yarvin’s prescription for a revived monarchy, appealing to authoritarian tech bros, is useful as shorthand, but the case of American fascism is overdetermined and suffers from a surfeit of explanations.
In just six months, this version of Trump, empowered by reactionary oligarchs during the 2020-2024 interregnum, has been worse than the most diehard pessimists expected. Trump’s personal buffoonery aside, the masterplan being executed to convert this nation into an authoritarian/ monarchical/ post-constitutional ethno-state is breathtaking for its rigour, discipline and single-mindedness.
In retrospect, Democrats clearly must have been privy to these internal machinations, glimpses of which appeared in Project 2025, but because they have themselves been the main party carrying the neoliberal virus, serious opposition is precluded. In basic substance they agree with the conversion of the American citizen into a compliant consumer-subject, and the convergence of pseudo-AI (not the real thing) with the radical aims of depopulation, disenfranchisement and the projected importation of the apocalyptic warlordism of the Mad Max world the empire has already conjured, with the help of its abject proxy Israel, in the Middle East.
When crushing media dissenters with debilitating lawsuits and studiously ignoring federal judges’ orders to stop disappearing migrants to foreign concentration camps (whether in El Salvador or South Sudan) or to reinstate essential government employees laid off by Elon Musk’s DOGE chainsaw-wielders, the administration does so with the assurance that the supreme court will always provide it with just enough cover to go ahead with its plans, whether to end Medicare and social security or to fatally undermine birthright citizenship.
The post-constitutionalists are also guaranteed zero real opposition from the Democrats, who have shown more gumption over taking down one of their own, and the brightest and most popular at that, New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, while remaining silent accomplices to the deportations, the gutting of entire agencies like the FDA and the Department of Education, and the acceleration of the anti-Islamic wars in the Middle East.

Civil society is paralysed and unable to summon any meaningful response to the daily annihilation of liberties.

The empire is putting itself out of business by dismantling federal government agencies looking after health, education, safety, retirement and welfare. It is destroying the second-to-none higher education system by punishing universities for so-called DEI by defunding them, banishing international students, and ending basic research. It is destroying immigration by going after birthright citizenship in addition to unprecedented mass deportations resembling the former Latin American dictatorships’ ‘disappearances’. It is imposing a radical tariffs regime all but overturning the global economic order that it painstakingly constructed and defended by military coercion over the last 80 years. It is militarising a long-running subterranean civil war by putting the military on the streets without provocation and without bothering to invoke legal justification.
In short, because this is faster and more comprehensive than expected, and more disciplined and organised because of the oligarchic forces emboldening Trump and using him as an instrument to attain complete asymmetrical power, civil society is paralysed and unable to summon any meaningful response to the daily annihilation of liberties. The worst of the symbolism has been the omnipresent masked mercenaries, masquerading as official ICE agents, arresting dutiful immigrants showing up in court for their appointments while pursuing legal means of residency.
Except for a handful of the usual leftist critics who remain on the fringes, and have been so since the Bush administration’s preview of the current atrocities under more legal cover, there is no appetite among Americans for a reckoning of how and why we got here, aside from a cute nostalgic wish to return to ‘normality’ as it existed before, where ‘we the people’ allegedly sent our obedient representatives to Washington, and monarchy ended with the 1776 revolution.
But why would an empire which — if things were managed skillfully — could have lasted a long while yet, especially given China’s hesitancy to claim the mantle of world leadership, end itself? World-class universities, a global trading regime supporting dollar hegemony and a largely undeserved high domestic standard of living, and in-migration of the best and brightest, are features of the late-stage empire to be crushed only if you desire in the end to destroy even your own MAGA supporters.
Trump’s autarkic sensibility — which has resonated strongly with less-educated Americans all throughout the Cold War and afterwards — might represent the wish to carve out three independent authoritarian zones, America (with expanded he­­m­­ispheric territory), Russia (with claims on Euro­­pe) and China (much of Asia, except the Middle Eastern oil states), but this seems too schematic, and American military strategy won’t allow it.
There is the perfect symmetry of empire beginning with genocide and ending with one. The psychological burden of fighting endless wars and flattening nation after nation for more than 80 years, in Latin America, Africa, Asia and more recently the Muslim world, has become too much to bear. At some point, when empire’s atrocities become too great, the contradictions and hypocrisies dissolve entirely, as the empire implodes in a burst of honesty, and citizens step back to admire their own gruesome handiwork.
The scary thing is that Trump is merely an exc­l­a­mation point, giving vent to the vapid brutality of the American soul, in both its liberal and conserva­t­­ive incarnations, with no varnish or prettification.

Published in Dawn, July 30th, 2025</p><small>2025-07-30 04:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/68896f502c164.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927563/back-in-the-us-embrace' target='_blank'><strong>Back in the US embrace</strong></a><br><p>THE recent visit of Pakistan’s foreign minister to Washington and his meeting with the US secretary of state is being seen as yet another sign of fast-improving relations between the two countries that were formerly allies. The interaction between the top diplomats came about a month and half after President Donald Trump hosted Pakistan’s army chief at a White House lunch, the first time a US president has feted a military chief from Pakistan who wasn’t the head of state as well.
It signalled a dramatic revival of relations that had remained dormant for the past four years. It’s certainly a positive development. Yet the contours of the new phase of the Pak-US relationship have yet to fully emerge. It seems more of a transactional than strategic relationship at this point.
There is also the question of whether the resetting of ties is the result of an institutional policy review in Washington or just Trump’s personal initiative, considering the American leader’s mercurial approach to key matters in international relations. Pakistan would be dealing with an administration that has the dubious reputation of rapidly changing priorities.
Pakistan’s military and civilian leadership seem pleased with the way they have boosted the US president’s ego by nominating him for the Nobel Peace Prize, but the results of such actions are short-lived in light of the extreme ups and downs that this critical bilateral relationship has experienced over seven decades.

Historically, the Islamabad-Washington engagement has been framed narrowly.

With the end of America’s two-decade-long war in Afghanistan in 2021, Pak-US relations have come full circle. Originally touted as a strategic relationship, it morphed into a transactional one. Perhaps the biggest confusion in various US departments revolves around how to deal with Pakistan — as friend or foe? Post-9/11, the two nations could at best be described as ‘frenemies’.
Pakistan was blamed for America’s humiliation in Afghanistan. During Joe Biden’s administration, the relationship hit a new low. After the Afghan war, changing regional geopolitics created a fresh alignment of forces. The growing strategic alliance between the US and India and the China-Pakistan axis are reflected in the emerging geopolitics.
Pakistan’s growing strategic relations with China and the escalating tension between Washington and Beijing, too, cast a shadow over future Pak-US relations. Although Pakistan was still engaged by Washington diplomatically, the relationship went into deep freeze. Meanwhile, the US tilt towards India, which had emerged as Washington’s strategic ally in the region, too, affected Pak-US ties.
After a long freeze, a thaw was witnessed soon after Trump returned to the White House for the second time. In his first address to a joint session of Congress in March this year, the American president praised Pakistan for capturing the mastermind of the deadly attack at Kabul airport in August 2021, which had killed over a dozen American soldiers.
It was apparent that despite hitting a low in their relationship, the two countries continued to cooperate on counterterrorism. The capture of a key terrorist leader of the militant Islamic State group, who was involved in the killing of American soldiers in Afghanistan, was one such example. Counterterrorism assistance helped with the thaw. Recently, Centcom chief Gen Michael E Kurilla detailed how such cooperation had led to the capture of the terrorist. “They [Pakistan] are in an active counterterrorism fight right now, and they have been a phenomenal partner in the counterterrorism world,” Kurilla said in his testimony before the House Armed Services Committee in Washington.
Yet another significant breakthrough in the relationship between the two countries came with America’s role as peacemaker in the recent conflict between India and Pakistan. President Trump claimed it was US intervention that prevented a nuclear war between the two nations, though India has continued to deny yielding to outside pressure. It may have been the first time that trade was leveraged by an American administration in peace diplomacy.
The episode reflected a significant change in Washington’s stance on the Pakistan-India conflict. In recent times, America had shown little interest in facilitating bilateral engagement beyond reactive diplomacy to manage crises. But Trump’s public and vocal intervention in this case marked a departure from Washington’s long-standing policy of de-hyphenating its relations with the two South Asian nations. Some analysts see the change as the Trump administration’s move to recalibrate its tilt towards India.
India is certainly not happy that the US, which it considers a strategic ally, tried to play the role of arbiter. Yet, there is a limit to the role of an external power in bridging the widening cleavage between two warring neighbours. Pakistan’s expectations that Washington could help bring itself and India to the negotiating table are unrealistic.
Historically, the Islamabad-Washington engage­­ment has been framed narrowly, dictated either by short-term security interests or a common challenge. But the growing interest in rare earths and other minerals has also come to define the Trump administration’s policy towards Pakistan. Several US companies have reportedly shown an interest in Pakistan’s emerging minerals sector. But security issues in the region, where most of the mineral deposits are supposed to be located, makes it hard to attract foreign investment.
Pakistan is also close to reaching a deal with Washington on tariffs that is likely to give it an advantage over other competitors. Pakistan’s exports to the US are over $5 billion annually — 18pc of the total exports of the country. Textile products comprise 75 to 80pc of total exports to the US.
For Pakistan, the US remains an important trading and economic partner. But there is also a need to be cautious so that the country doesn’t become a tool in America’s regional conflicts at the cost of relations with strategic allies. These concerns are heightened in the backdrop of growing regional tensions that directly or indirectly involve the US. Pakistan must not allow itself to be sucked into America’s wars.

Several people were injured in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan’s eastern seaboard — devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 — was ordered to evacuate.
“Today’s earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,” Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.
A tsunami with a height of 3-4 metres (10-13 feet) was recorded in parts of Kamchatka, said Sergei Lebedev, regional minister for emergency situations, urging people to move away from the shoreline.
The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3 km (12 miles), and was centred 119 km (74 miles) east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000. It revised the magnitude up from 8.0 earlier, and reported a strong aftershock of magnitude 6.9 soon after.
Japan’s weather agency upgraded its warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 3 metres (10 feet) to reach large coastal areas starting around 0100 GMT (6am PKT).
Tsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan’s Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.
Footage on public broadcaster NHK showed scores of people in the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.
Workers evacuated the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, where a meltdown following the 2011 tsunami caused a radioactive disaster, operator TEPCO said.
There were no injuries or damage reported so far, and no irregularities at any nuclear plants, Japan Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.
Warnings across the Pacific
The US Tsunami Warning System also issued a warning of “hazardous tsunami waves” within the next three hours.
Waves reaching more than 3 metres were possible along some coasts of Russia and Ecuador, while waves of 1-3 metres were possible in Japan, Hawaii, Chile and the Solomon Islands, it said. Smaller waves were possible along coastlines across much of the Pacific, including the US West Coast.
“Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,” US President Donald Trump said in a social media post.
“A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visit tsunami.gov/ for the latest information. Stay strong and stay safe!”

Hawaii ordered evacuations from some coastal areas. “Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,” the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.
 






The Hawaii warning urged residents of low-lying areas to either move to higher ground or to the fourth floor of a building.
Several people sought medical assistance following the quake, Oleg Melnikov, regional health minister, told Russia’s TASS state news agency.
“Unfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,” Melnikov said.
“All patients are currently in satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far.”
Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The population has been evacuated.
While a kindergarten was also damaged, most buildings withstood the quake, and no fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.
‘Ring of fire’
Kamchatka and Russia’s Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
The Russian Academy of Sciences said it was the strongest quake to hit the region since 1952.
“However, due to certain characteristics of the epicentre, the shaking intensity was not as high … as one might expect from such a magnitude,” said Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka Branch of the Geophysical Service, on Telegram.
“Aftershocks are currently ongoing … Their intensity will remain fairly high. However, stronger tremors are not expected in the near future. The situation is under control.”</p><small>2025-07-30 03:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30085100feaa4f9.jpg?r=085103' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927564/faulty-narrative' target='_blank'><strong>Faulty narrative</strong></a><br><p>MORE than three months after the deadly Pahalgam episode in held Kashmir, the BJP-led Indian government is still struggling to construct a believable narrative in the midst of rising domestic criticism over its handling of the events.
Indian Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday told parliament that three suspects killed in an alleged encounter near Srinagar, as part of the so-called Operation Mahadev, were responsible for the Pahalgam killings. He alleged that the suspects were Pakistanis.
However, local security sources had on Monday told Radio Pakistan that New Delhi could stage “fake encounters” involving Pakistanis incarcerated in India and label these counterterrorism operations. The ISPR chief had earlier expressed similar fears. Meanwhile, Indian PM Narendra Modi indulged in more Pakistan-bashing during Tuesday’s parliament session.
But it is not just Pakistan that is casting doubt on India’s Pahalgam narrative; credible voices within that country are also questioning the official line, particularly New Delhi’s efforts to link Pakistan to the terrorist attack. P. Chidambaram, India’s former home minister, is the latest to question the BJP’s narrative. Talking to media outlets, Mr Chidambaram said there was “no evidence” that the Pahalgam attackers were Pakistanis, and that the state had not given clear information about the episode. The former minister further said New Delhi was hiding facts about losses suffered by India during the four-day conflict in May. “Be upfront,” he chided the government.
The BJP is facing similarly stinging queries in parliament regarding the incident. It is overly convenient that the current home minister triumphantly announced that the attackers had been traced and killed — and expediently linked to Pakistan — as more and more Indian voices demand the truth.
Instead of spinning a narrative that has few takers, the BJP regime needs to be honest with its own people, as well as the world. Promoting doubtful accounts will mislead Indians and further damage ties with this country that have already hit rock bottom. Moreover, many of India’s traditional foreign allies are not ready to accept New Delhi’s charge against Pakistan.
The rational course of action would require India to honestly tell the world what happened, admit that mistakes were made, and try to patch things up with Pakistan to reduce the chances of further conflict in the subcontinent. The least that should be expected from New Delhi is to not further drag Pakistan into this quagmire and blame it for India’s own failures.
However, this requires statesmanship, and currently there appears to be no one imbued with this quality in the ruling set-up. It is unfortunate that jingoism, radical religious nationalism and arrogance seem to be the current driving forces of Indian policy towards Pakistan.

• UK moves towards ‘recognition’ of Palestinian state; Ishaq Dar calls it ‘test case’ for the world
GAZA / LONDON: The besieged territory of Gaza is slipping into famine, UN aid agencies warned on Tuesday, as the death toll from Israel’s nearly 22-month war surpassed 60,000.
The World Food Programme (WFP), Unicef and the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) warned that time was running out and that Gaza was “on the brink of a full-scale famine”.
Meanwhile, the Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) air-drops will not be enough to avert the “humanitarian catastrophe”.
“The worst-case scenario of famine is now unfolding in the Gaza Strip,” said the IPC, a grouping of NGOs and institutions that serves as the world’s main monitor for gauging malnutrition, in a statement.
The IPC said its latest data shows that “famine thresholds” have been reached in most of Gaza and hunger-related deaths of young children were rising fast.
Although Israel launched daily pauses in its military operations in some parts of Gaza over the weekend, and opened secure routes to enable UN and other aid agencies to distribute food, Israeli strikes continued overnight, killing 30 people in the Nuseirat refugee camp.
Speaking in Geneva, the WFP’s emergency director Ross Smith said the humanitarian disaster was reminiscent of last century’s famines in Ethiopia and Nigeria’s Biafra region.
“This is unlike anything we have seen in this century,” he told reporters.
UK move towards recognition
Following an emergency meeting of his cabinet, UK PM Keir Starmer had announced that Britain would make the move unless Israel took substantive steps to allow more aid to enter Gaza, made clear there will be no annexation of the West Bank and commits to a long-term peace process that delivers a two-state solution.
Starmer said his government would make an assessment in September on “how far the parties have met these steps”, but that no one would have a veto over the decision.
“I have always said that we will recognise a Palestinian state as a contribution to a proper peace process at the moment of maximum impact for the two-state solution,” he said in a Downing Street address.
France recently announced it would formally recognise the state of Palestine in September, and the UK would become the second permanent member of the UN Security Council to do so, if it goes ahead with the recognition.
UN conference
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has termed the Israel-Palestine question a “test case” for the world, particularly the United Nations, and sought “credible and enforceable international action”.
His call came during the three-day conference on ‘The peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine and the implementation of the two-state solution’, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia.
In his remarks, Deputy PM Dar told the conference, “The Palestinian question is a test case for the United Nations and the world. Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering and principled support for the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination, including their right to a viable, independent and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
During his speech, Mr Dar urged the conference to “ensure universal recognition of the state of Palestine and its full UN membership”.
He said, “Pakistan stands ready to extend dedicated technical assistance and capacity building support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters… Pakistan is prepared to contribute to the building of institutions, including through participation in the Arab-OIC Plan, and any international protection mechanism.
“The question of Palestine has impacted the entire region and beyond. We must give hope to the Palestinian people. The occupation must end, and end now. It is time for freedom, self-determination and statehood, and Palestine’s full membership of the UN. That will be the best guarantee for lasting peace in the region.”
On the sidelines of the conference, Mr Dar met Palestinian PM Mohammad Mustafa and held a detailed exchange on the grave situation in Gaza and occupied Palestinian territory.
He also met Kuwait’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya, expressed their “deep concern at continuing Israeli acts of aggression against Palestinians and worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza”.

• Mysterious woman accused of ‘trapping’ accused men surfaces in court
ISLAMABAD: A two-judge bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) has said any commission formed to investigate the alleged misuse of the blasphemy law could interfere in cases pending before other courts.
The judges on Tuesday explained the reasons for suspending a single bench’s order in the high-profile case.
The now-suspended judgement was issued by Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan after 42 hearings in the case whose proceedings were streamed live, in a divergence from the norm.
It directed the federal government to establish an inquiry commission within 30 days to investigate the allegations of entrapment, custodial deaths, flawed investigations and violations of fundamental rights.
The order, issued on July 15, said nearly 400 FIRs and around 700 individuals were implicated for allegedly committing blasphemy online.
The court also flagged irregularities in FIA’s investigations, including the reuse of Facebook IDs across multiple FIRs, same-day arrests and FIR registrations, private detentions and the use of unverified digital evidence.
Last week, an IHC bench comprising Justices Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Azam Khan heard appeals challenging the single-bench’s ruling.
After a preliminary hearing, the bench suspended for a month the order to form the commission.
 
 

During Tuesday’s hearing, the two-judge bench noted the nearly 400 blasphemy cases, at the heart of this issue, were registered nationwide.
The trials in most of these cases had already concluded, resulting in either convictions or acquittals. In some cases, appeals have been filed against those decisions that are currently pending before various high courts.
The order stated that forming an inquiry commission in such a context could interfere with pending, potentially rendering the legal process “ineffective”.
Interim or final order
The two-judge bench also clarified that Justice Khan’s order was final as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.
The question over the order’s status was raised during the last hearing when the petitioners’ lawyer claimed the case was initially decided but the written verdict stated it would remain pending.
The division bench further clarified that although intra-court appeals are typically not filed against interim orders, the single bench’s ruling was final in nature as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.
‘Mysterious’ woman
Also on Tuesday, a woman named Komal Ismail also appeared before the division bench along with her lawyer.
She is accused of honey-trapping the victims using a false social media identity by the name of “Imaan”.
In a hearing earlier this month, Justice Khan directed the FIA to block her national identity card after she repeatedly failed to appear before the court.
During Tuesday’s proceedings, Ms Ismail’s counsel argued her client was not a party in the main case, yet her CNIC was blocked and her name placed on the Exit Control List.
Justice Soomro responded that Ms Ismail had only been asked to appear before the investigating officer and questioned the harm in complying with that direction.
The bench emphasised that while the case involving Ms Ismail remained under investigation, the court would not interfere in the matter.
Later, the court linked Ms Ismail’s applications with the already pending intra-court appeals and adjourned the hearing.

The remarks came from Justice Ayesha A. Malik , who was a member of the two-judge bench alongside Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, which decided the Sindh government’s appeal against a Feb 27 decision of the Sindh High Court (SHC) Circuit Bench Larkana.
The case was brought by Sorath Fatima, whose father was an employee of the Road and Transport Department, Sindh.
He died in February 2002 and his pension was awarded to his widow — Ms Fatima’s mother — who also died in December 2012.
Ms Fatima, being an unmarried daughter, sought the pension of her father, which she received until she married.
However, when Ms Fatima’s marriage ended in August 2022, she sought the resumption of her father’s pension on the grounds that being a divorced daughter, she was entitled to it.
The Sindh government denied her application, and Ms Fatima challenged the decision before the SHC, which ruled in her favour. The Sindh government then appealed against the decision in the Supreme Court.
 
 

In the 10-page judgment, Justice Malik expressed the concern that a daughter’s entitlment to pension depended entirely on her marital status.
“This dependency model reveals that there is a systematic bias that treats a daughter as a dependent, with her financial dependency shifting from parent to spouse,” the judgment added.
This assumption not only perpetuated “stereotypical mindset about women being dependent members” but also fails to recognise women as individuals or “autonomous individuals” who can be financially independent.
It is also based in the “flawed belief” that unmarried or divorced women are financially dependent, while married women are financially secure, the judgment highlighted.
Justice Malik said pension was an “earned right” passed onto the legal heirs of a deceased government servant.
Justice Malik emphasised the need to revisit pension law and remove marital status as a condition for entitlement.

There is no achievement bigger than this diplomatic achievement,” PM Shehbaz said while speaking at a gathering after inaugurating the upgraded Pak Business Express and newly introduced passenger facilities at Lahore railway station.
“We are streamlining our relations with the United States,” he added.
On Pakistan’s relations with China, PM Shehbaz said work was underway on the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. “We are in full coordination with China on the CPEC-2,” he said.

In his address, the prime minister acknowledged the deterioration of Pakistan’s railway system, once considered a model for public transport. “The railway system in Pakistan was once the best, but unfortunately, it faced destruction,” he said, adding that he had appointed Hanif Abbasi as Minister for Railways to address these issues.
 
 

PM Shehbaz applauded the railways for upgrading its passenger services, including the introduction of Wi-Fi, escalators, modern dining rooms and clean washrooms, as well as the ending of obsolete ticket checking and purchasing systems. He stressed the need for further digitisation to meet future goals.
He asked Mr Abbasi to revive international freight services through goods train operations and commended the improvements in cleanliness and the provision of ATMs at railway stations.
Mr Abbasi, in his address, discussed ongoing developments in the railway sector, including digitisation, new coaches and the expansion of online ticketing services. He stressed that the railways had earned Rs93 billion in revenue during the 2024-25 fiscal year, with support from provincial governments for infrastructure improvements.
Kyrgyzstan ties
PM Shehbaz on Tuesday also met with a high-level delegation from Kyrgyzstan, led by Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers Edil Baisalov, to discuss bilateral cooperation.
The delegation is in Pakistan for the 5th Session of the Pakistan-Kyrgyzstan Joint Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), aimed at strengthening bilateral cooperation across multiple sectors, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.
 
 

The premier welcomed the delegation and praised the successful convening of the IGC session. He appreciated the signing of several memoranda of understanding (MoUs), which he believed would enhance trade, energy cooperation, connectivity and people-to-people exchanges between the two nations.
SCO visit
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz is expected to head to China today (Wednesday) to attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit, PM Office sources said.
He is expected to hold bilateral meetings with Chinese leadership during the visit and will also meet world leaders, including Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The PM has convened the federal cabinet’s meeting today (Wednesday).

• Amit Shah says three Pahalgam attackers killed; Farooq Abdullah wonders whether they were the same men
• Congress leader challenges Modi to say ‘Trump is lying’ on role in ending hostilities with Pakistan
NEW DELHI: In a bedlam of barbs and innuendoes in India’s parliament on Tuesday, the BJP government claimed teaching Pakistan a lesson in their recent military standoff.
But the leader of the opposition, Rahul Gandhi, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of cowardice in not taking Pakistan head-on, while forcing the army and the air force to avoid military targets at the start of the war.
India, Mr Gandhi added, could not afford Modi as prime minister.
For his part, the Indian PM applauded his achievements in the hunt for those who killed 26 Hindu tourists in Pahalgam on April 22.
As if on cue, Home Minister Amit Shah announced that three of the terrorists had been killed and that two of them were identified as members of the now-defunct Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).
Farooq Abdullah, a former chief minister of India-held Kashmir, welcomed Shah’s claim with a caveat, wondering if they were indeed the same men who attacked tourists in scenic Pahalgam.
Claiming all-round success in the short war, Narendra Modi kept scrupulously silent on the losses of Indian aircraft in the air battle with the Pakistan Air Force.
He spoke in Hindi, with plenty of pauses for dramatic effect. Like when he spoke about how the opposition leaders were asking why he did not take back Azad Kashmir: “Who else can they ask this to except me?”
India, he said, had called Pakistan’s “nuclear bluff”, and showed the world it would no longer be cowed by threats of escalation.
Shift in strategic posture
He claimed India struck “terror bases deep inside Pakistan” in just 22 minutes after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, and that “Islamabad’s sabre-rattling, including veiled nuclear threats, did not stop India from responding forcefully”.
It is worth noting that Indian military officials have previously said there was never a moment of nuclear threat from either side.
“Pakistan had some inkling of Indian action and started issuing nuclear threats, but could do nothing when terror targets were hit,” Modi said.
“India responds on its own terms; bullets will be met with cannons.”
This response, he claimed, exposed the limits of Pakistan’s deterrence and revealed a shift in India’s strategic posture. “Only three countries spoke for Pakistan at the UN,” he said, but didn’t say how many spoke for India.
Rahul Gandhi had said in his speech that many countries had condemned terrorism, but none had condemned Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack on April 22.
“No leader of any country asked India to stop any action in its defence against terror,” PM Modi said.
US Vice President J.D. Vance had tried calling him “three-four times” during Operation Sindoor, the Indian PM claimed, but he was too busy in high-level meetings with the armed forces.
Rahul’s challenge to Modi
Before Mr Modi’s speech, Rahul Gandhi had thrown a dare at the PM, pointing out President Donald Trump’s repeated claims of having stopped the war between India and Pakistan. “If Trump is lying, let Modi say he is lying,” Rahul had said.
Modi claimed Operation Sindoor had “planted India’s flag firmly in the global defence market” and there was an increasing interest in India-made munitions.
He also repeated the Indian claim that Pakistani military officials pleaded for a halt in hostilities.
He said former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had cost India dearly with the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty. Modi called the treaty as unfair to India’s farmers, saying “blood and water cannot flow together”.
There was no mention of the losses India suffered in the prime minister’s speech. Several opposition leaders in both houses had asked for details on how many fighter jets, including Rafales, were lost.
Mr Gandhi claimed Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had himself revealed that the Director General of Military Operations was told by the Government of India to ask for a ceasefire just 30 minutes after Operation Sindoor began. “You told them we will not hit military targets; we do not want escalation.”
“The government of India informed the government of Pakistan that we have no political will, and we will not fight,” he said.
Mr Gandhi also quoted Captain Shiv Kumar, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, as saying that India had lost some aircraft and that happened only because of the constraints given by the political leadership not to attack air defence and military targets. “You tied their hands behind their backs and the defence minister has said this in parliament itself.”

• Omar Ayub complains to CJP about ‘procedural violations’ in May 9 trials
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court has postponed the hearing of a set of challenges instituted by PTI founder Imran Khan over being denied post-arrest bail by the Lahore High Court (LHC) in eight cases related to the May 9 violence.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the two-judge bench took up the matter on Tuesday, but adjourned proceedings until Aug 12, although PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja informed the bench that senior counsel Sal­man Safdar, who had filed the app­eals, had requested an adjournment until next week.
Mr Raja also asked the bench to issue notices to the respondent, mainly the state, through Punjab’s prosecutor general. However, the court adjourned the case for Aug 12, ignoring both requests to push the hearing date to next week and for the issuance of notices to the respondents.
In his plea, Imran Khan had argued that contrary to the prosecution’s accusations that he orchestrated the May 9 violence, he was held incommunicado in NAB custody at the time of the alleged offence.
Therefore, his involvement in the May 9 riots was impossible, Mr Khan argued, also reminding that the Supreme Court had already held that the case of an abettor who was not present at the scene of occurrence stands on a lower legal footing than that of a principal accused.
On Nov 27, 2024, an anti-terrorism court had denied Mr Khan bail in the eight cases, which include the Lahore attacks on Askari Tower at Liberty Chowk, PML-N offices in Model Town, the Shadman police station, the burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House and violence at Sherpao Bridge. The LHC later rejected Mr Khan’s bail plea as well.
The fresh appeal contended that the PTI founder had been allegedly subjected to an unprecedented campaign of political victimisation since his ouster from the office of the prime minister two years ago.
Omar Ayub writes to CJP
Separately, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan has written to CJP Yahya Afridi, raising concerns over procedural violations in the ongoing trials related to the events of May 9.
In his letter, Mr Ayub urged the CJP to initiate a judicial inquiry into allegations of misconduct by police and prosecutors and to reopen concluded trials.
“This letter is a solemn appeal on behalf of myself, my party, and the many Pakistani citizens who have been caught up in the web of rushed and unfair May 9 trials currently being conducted in multiple cities,” Mr Ayub wrote.
“The Anti-Terrorism Courts (ATCs) in Lahore, Faisalabad, Sargodha, and other cities are hearing cases related to May 9 with a speed and manner that shocks the conscience of any impartial observer”.
“Hearings commence early morning and extend late into the night; in fact, it is reliably reported that in some cases, proceedings continue until 2am to 3am. This is neither justice delayed nor justice served — this is justice crushed and justice buried under the weight of exhaustion, coercion and haste.”
Mr Ayub also accused the authorities of using the trials for political persecution, alleging that police reports and prosecutions lacked credible evidence and were marked by procedural irregularities.
While claiming that media access to these trials has been severely restricted, he said: “The courts must stand as bulwarks against tyranny, and when constitutional rights are trampled, it is their duty to restore justice and equity.”

Some of them returned to the country during Muha­­rram, others had fled the Iran-Israel war a month ago; and nearly all of them possess valid travel documents issued by the Iranian government. But the border crossing, located almost 70km from the port city of Gwadar, has remained closed since the Iran-Israel conflict broke out.
The stranded individuals have been staying in hotels and other lodgings, while immigration officials await ‘fresh orders’ to process their exit. The recent bar on travelling to Iraq and Iran by road has only complicated matters.
An official of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), posted at the Gabd border, said the students had valid travel documents, but they could not be allowed to cross, as the border was still closed.
“No fresh order has been issued by the Pakistani authorities concerned for opening the border with Iran (after the war ended),” FIA Deputy Director Asif Naseem told Dawn.
He said that in addition to the earlier closure, a recent decision by the government to ban road travel during Chehlum had also imposed restrictions on such travel. The FIA official said the students could travel to their destination by air.
Last week, the Iranian embassy in Islamabad issued guidelines for pilgrims, saying the land entry would be subject to the approval of the Pakistani government. A day later, the government said no such travel would be allowed on account of security concerns.
However, it did not specify if the ban pertained to the Chehlum pilgrims or applied to all travellers entering Iran. In any case, land crossings with Iran haven’t re-opened since the war.
 
 

“More than 50 students, some with families, are stuck at the Gabad border, while hundreds more are waiting in Karachi and other towns, as Pakistani immigration officials claim they have received no instructions to process their exit,” said Maulana Ali Anwar, brother of one of the stranded students.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Anwar, who is also a Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen (MWM) office-bearer, said his brother was stuck at Gabad. He added that many other students had been staying in Karachi and other cities after receiving the news about the stranded students.
According to Mr Anwar, the students, having Iqama, return to their native areas every year during the Muharram holidays and start returning to Iran in the Islamic month of Safar.
‘Arrangements being made’
On the other hand, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry told Dawn that arrangements were being made to facilitate “some 30 to 40 students” stranded at the Pak-Iran border. Jus­tifying the ban concerning land pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq, he claimed it was meant to facilitate Zaireen.
According to the minister, the government will introduce fundamental changes by August 31 to regulate pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq on the pattern of Haj and Umrah.
Asked to comment on fears that the ‘tour operator mafia’ would be the ultimate beneficiary of this policy, he said hundreds of operators would be registered under an open and transparent policy, noting that healthy competition would benefit the pilgrims. “It is a successful model in many parts of the world,” he remarked.
He said Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq were in the process of formulating a joint strategy to facilitate pilgrims, adding that the interior secretary would soon pay a visit to the two countries for follow-up meetings with the relevant authorities. He also revealed that a ship service for pilgrims was being mulled.

A day earlier, representatives from the State Bank of Pakistan, finance min­istry, commercial banks and exchange companies met with senior security officials to discuss steps to bring down the dollar price, stabilise the exch­ange rate and stop the smuggling of US currency to Afghanistan and Iran.
Another meeting, held on Tuesday, was dominated by the crypto agenda and saw Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) CEO Bilal Bin Saqib gave a presentation on the usage of virtual currencies in Pakistan.
In May, Mr Saqib was appointed the PM’s special assistant on blockchain and cryptocurrency, with the status of a minister of state.
“We were told that the cryptos are the future currency for the changed economic world,” said a banker, on condition of anonymity.
 
 

He said the presentation and subsequent Q&A on crypto took “80 per cent time” of the meeting held on Tuesday.
Participants of the meeting Dawn spoke to said it seemed like the government was in hurry to make use of cryptocurrencies on a large scale and make them part of the economy as soon as possible.
Some have raised questions about the high-level of risk involved, but Mr Saqib played down the speculative risks.
Although cryptocurrencies have been in vogue for years, most central banks around the world have steered clear of any attempts to regulate them.
On July 9, SBP Governor Jameel Ahmed had said that they were preparing to launch a pilot for a digital currency, and were finalising legislation to regulate virtual assets.
 
 

The SBP and Finance Division are currently engaged with the Pakistan Crypto Council to develop an appropriate legal and regulatory framework for virtual assets.
“Risks are still high, since the prices of cryptocurrencies fluctuate with wide margin, like Bitcoin prices could jump from $35,000 to to $70,000,” a financial expert said.
However, he claimed that both the SBP and the government were ready for crypto transactions.
On Tuesday, banks, foreign exchange companies and gold traders were briefed on the benefit of such currencies.
Participants of the meeting were told that the central bank would issue licenses for crypto trading banks and other financial institutions. One banker hinted at the possibility of opening field offices in major cities to make virtual assets easily accessible and promote virtual transactions.

• Chitral MNA decries conviction based on ‘political vendetta’
• Gohar warns commission to stick to Constitution
• ECP official says appeals process remains open
ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday disqualified Abdul Latif, a PTI MNA from the NA-1 constituency (Upper and Lower Chitral), raising questions over the haste with which a flurry of similar decisions have been taken in recent days.
The move comes just a day after three other PTI lawmakers were disqualified, including a senator and the leader of the opposition in the Punjab Assembly.
In a notification, the ECP said that under its July 29 order, Mr Latif was disqualified in accordance with Article 63(1h) of the Constitution. His seat in the National Assembly has become vacant following the disqualification.
In May, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad sentenced Mr Latif and four others to 27 years in prison for their involvement in the May 9, 2023, attack on the Ramna police station. The verdict was announced by ATC Special Court-II Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra, who found the accused guilty of arson, violence and attacking law enforcement personnel during the riots.
Earlier on Tuesday, a five-member bench of the commission, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja heard a reference, a representation and a complaint to de-seat Chitrali on the basis of Anti-Terrorism Court verdict of May 30, 2025. The bench reserved judgement, which was placed on its website after office hours.
“Deriving wisdom from the referred judgement wherein it has been held that “where there is a conviction recorded by a competent court against a person who is a member of the Parliament which has attained finality, the role and function of the Election Commission is confined to issuing notification of disqualification of the concerned member on the basis of the verdict of the Court,” it reads.
Despite his conviction, a firebrand Mr Latif denied the charges, claiming he was wrongfully convicted in retaliation for refusing a Rs2 billion bribe to support the “controversial” 26th Constitutional Amendment. Mr Latif described the conviction as politically motivated, calling it an act of vengeance.
‘Democracy at stake’
PTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan expressed concerns over the disqualification of PTI lawmakers, warning that “democracy is at stake”.
Talking to a private TV channel, he acknowledged the growing concerns regarding the way political trials have been conducted, hinting that the situation had been clear from the beginning.
“We could see the writing on the wall,” he added.
The PTI leader also asked the ECP to refrain from justifying its actions and instead “follow the Constitution and the law”.
Appeals ‘open’
When asked for comment, a senior ECP official clarified that under the Constitution, a parliamentarian stood disqualified from office following a conviction.
The official explained that while the right to appeal remains intact even after disqualification, the disqualified member’s seat remains vacant until a court ruling overturns the conviction.
The official noted that if a member receives interim relief from a high court, which suspends the sentence, the disqualification remains in place. However, should higher courts overturn the conviction, the ECP would restore the individual’s victory notification.

•  Officials’ reluctance to share names of mill owners with lawmakers draws rebuke
•  Committee told Rs150m spent out of Rs1.95bn allocated for flood awareness campaign, rest of the money diverted
ISLAMABAD: Amid a hike in sugar price, the Public Accounts Committee was informed on Tuesday that the sugar mills have earned Rs300 billion due to recent fluctuations in the rates of the essential commodity.
The Auditor General of Pakistan made these revelations during the meeting of the apex parliamentary panel, which convened the high-stakes session to review the sugar import and export policy, rising prices, and the lack of transparency in the sugar industry.
The PAC met under the chairmanship of Junaid Akbar Khan and it was briefed by Industries and Production Secretary Saif Anjum, who stated that price regulation and relevant laws fell under provincial jurisdictions.
He revealed that from 2013 to 2023, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) permitted sugar exports amounting to 5.09 million metric tonnes, of which 3.927 million tonnes were actually exported. In 2023-24 alone, the country had a surplus of 1.3 million tonnes, and 790,000 tonnes were cleared for export, the secretary said, adding that the price remained “stable”.
However, the PAC members expressed serious concern, citing ground realities. Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan and other members, including Omar Ayub and Senator Fauzia Arshad, contradicted the government’s claims about the commodity.
Omar Ayub reported that sugar was selling for over Rs200 per kilogramme in many regions, while National Food Secu­rity Secr­etary Amir Mohy­uddin maintained the national average was Rs173. According to Senator Fauzia Arshad, sugar had become both scarce and unaffordable.
‘Cycle of mismanagement’
Mr Akbar, meanwhile, slammed the cycle of mismanagement, stating, “Every year we repeat the same drama: first export (sugar), then import it.”
The PTI lawmaker questioned the lack of transparency, asking, “Who owns these sugar mills?” The committee had requested a list of owners, but the industries secretary said only directors’ names were available.
 
 

The committee rejected this explanation, demanding complete records. It warned, “No further briefings will be accepted without disclosure of owners.”
The Sugar Advisory Board (SAB) also drew flak for failing to regulate the industry effectively. “This is daylight robbery,” said MNA Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood, citing massive profiteering and poor governance. “Rs287 billion have gone into a few pockets,” claimed MNA Riaz Fatyana, while others accused the president and prime minister of allegedly protecting the profiteers.
The Federal Board of Revenue officials told the panel that a list of mills’ directors had been obtained, but the lawmakers sought full ownership transparency, leading to heated exchanges among the members.
Malik Amir Dogar named President Asif Ali Zardari, Jahangir Tareen, and the ruling Sharif family as major sugar mill stakeholders, leading to fiery arguments with fellow lawmakers Shazia Marri, Afnanullah Khan, and Bilal Mandokhail.
PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan noted that only 42 families profited from this massive windfall. “Why is no one else allowed to set up sugar mills?” he questioned, pointing to the concentration of ownership and lack of competition.
PAC member Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood highlighted that sugar was currently available in India at the equivalent of Rs143/kg, much cheaper than local prices.
The food secretary responded that the reduction in sales and other taxes was intended to make sugar more affordable. However, he warned that an import duty of Rs80 per kg would naturally make imported sugar more expensive.
The PAC chairman also questioned the rationale behind importing sugar despite claims from all provinces that ample stock was available. “If there was enough stock, why was the decision made to import it?” he asked.
 
 

Regarding sugar stocks, officials claimed 1.9 million tonnes were available, which will last till November. Nonetheless, PAC members voiced concern about potential spoilage and stressed the need for careful planning ahead of the next crushing season. The government had approved the import of 300,000 tons of sugar to stabilise the supply, while pledging it would not affect farmers or involve previous export destinations.
The PAC members reiterated that the issue would not be dropped until full transparency over sugar mill ownership and profit beneficiaries was achieved. Separately, the PAC scrutinised Rs1.95 billion supplementary grant allocated to the Press Information Department for a flood awareness campaign. Audit officials revealed that only Rs150 million was spent on the campaign, while the rest was diverted elsewhere. The matter was referred to a subcommittee for investigation.

According to District Food Controller (DFC) Shad Muhammad, Additional Assistant Commissioner and Food Inspector raided a location in Kuzabanda based on intelligence information. The raid resulted in the recovery of the slaughtered donkey and the arrest of two individuals, belonging to Hunza and Mansehra.
The arrested people claimed they were supplying the meat to Chinese officials working on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.
“However, an investigation is necessary to determine the actual purpose of the meat,” the DFC emphasised.
“Notably, the arrested individuals neither belong to the butcher community, nor do they have a shop,” he added.
An investigation has been initiated and a letter sent to the food department.
The DFC also highlighted that even if the arrested persons’ claim is correct, slaughtering a donkey in public is not allowed. “Instead, it should be done within residential premises,” he added.
The authorities will investigate further to bring more facts to light and determine the circumstances surrounding the incident.
Battagram District Police Officer (DPO) Ayaz Khan told Dawn.com that a case has been registered against the accused and an investigation has been started.
 
 

The first information report (FIR) seen by Dawn.com shows that the two people have been booked under Sections 272 (Adulteration of food or drink intended for sale) and 273 (Sale of noxious food or drink) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“It is yet unclear whether or not any attempt was being made to supply the meat,” the DPO said.
Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Dr Musadik Malik speaking on Geo News programme ‘Capital Talk’ said: “As Muslims, this act of giving someone else donkey meat to eat is impure and undesirable.”
He added that enforcement was needed to curtail such crimes.
On Sunday, in a major crackdown on illegal meat trade, the Islamabad Food Authority seized about 1,000kg of donkey meat from a farmhouse located in Tarnol.
Over 50 live donkeys were also confiscated during a raid on the premises and a foreign national was taken into custody on the spot.</p><small>2025-07-29 19:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/292309298f67cc9.jpg?r=230941' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927438/curfew-imposed-as-3-day-operation-against-militants-begins-in-bajaur-official' target='_blank'><strong>Curfew imposed as 3-day operation against militants begins in Bajaur: official</strong></a><br><p>The Bajaur administration imposed a three-day curfew at 16 places of the district on Tuesday and initiated an operation against militants in the areas.
Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafiq confirmed the development to Dawn.com.
A notification in this regard issued by Bajaur Deputy Commissioner (DC) Shahid Ali Khan said there was a need to impose restrictions on all kinds of movement on the main roads and outside houses at Badi Siah, Tarkho, Irab, Gat, Agra, Khurchai, Dawagai, Kalan, Legharai, Kitkot, Gillai, Nakhtar, Zarai, Dambarai, Amanata and Zagai area of Tehsil Loe Mamund to prevent any untoward incidents as recommended by the Bajaur District Intelligence Coordination Committee to ensure public safety during targeted actions against militants.
The DC imposed a ban on all kinds of movement of individuals outside houses, on roads, vehicles and all forms of traffic on all roads at the above villages with effect from 5am today till 5pm on July 31 (Thursday) under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
It instructed all individuals to comply with the order and restrict all movement on the roads and outside houses, warning that anyone found violating the order would be liable for legal action under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Awami National Party President Aimal Wali Khan alleged that innocent people were injured in the operation and called on the violence to stop.
The Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl also said that it could not support the operation.
The decision came following the police repulsing an attack by terrorists on Thangi checkpost on Sunday night. Officials had told Dawn that terrorists attacked the joint police and FC post in Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday night around 9:42 pm. They said that police and security forces personnel at the post responded effectively to the attack.
They said that no casualties were reported in the attack. No group claimed responsibility for the attack.
Police on Monday started checking suspicious vehicles and people to thwart terrorist activities in the district. Several police officials took part in the exercise, searching vehicles and people on roads and exit and entry points, said a statement.

In a statement issued today, Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP) Vice President Karrar Haidri said: “Former Olympic and world champion biathlete Laura Dahlmeier sustained serious injuries after being struck by a rockfall while attempting to summit Laila Peak.
“The incident occurred around noon on July 28 at an altitude of approximately 5,700m. Dahlmeier was climbing with her mountaineering partner, Marina Eva, when a sudden rockfall hit her, resulting in significant injuries.”
It said the expedition organiser immediately alerted emergency services and a coordinated rescue operation was launched with support from Pakistan Army aviation helicopters and local high-altitude porters.
It added that rescue helicopters were unable to land at the accident site on Monday due to the challenging terrain and adverse weather conditions.
“Efforts to evacuate Dahlmeier by air continued into July 29 with ground support teams on standby, awaiting a break in the weather.
“Marina Eva successfully descended to base camp and is reported to be in good health. Meanwhile, worsening weather continues to delay aerial access to the injured climber, leaving the rescue team prepared to respond as soon as conditions permit,” the statement said.
A press release posted on Dahlmeier’s Instagram account said that a helicopter overpass determined that she was at least “seriously injured” and “there were no signs of life”.
It said she was in the region with friends since the end of June and successfully climbed the Great Trango Tower (6,287m) on July 8, with Laila Peak the second planned summit goal.
It said she was a state-certified mountain and ski guide, an active member of the mountain rescue service and considered an experienced and risk-conscious mountaineer.

GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said an international mountaineering rescue team was currently overseeing the recovery operation and experienced climbers in the area were assisting in the mission.
Earlier this month, a tourist from the Czech Republic, Klára Kolouchová, died after falling into a ravine at the Nanga Parbat base camp in GB.
Kolouchová, 46, was part of a multinational expedition atte­m­pting to summit the mountain. Her health reportedly deteriorated at Camp 4, forcing her to abort the climb and begin her de­­s­­­cent with Nepali Sherpa Tara­man Tamang.</p><small>2025-07-29 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616381-conventional-warfare-supremacy-over-india-shattered-nuclear-deterrence-myth-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Conventional warfare supremacy over India shattered nuclear deterrence myth: PM</strong></a><br><p>

Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 — called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the US before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Earlier in the day, media reports said that the incarcerated former prime minister told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.
Responding swiftly to the reports, PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram said: “The news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib’s children is completely false. Imran Khan sahib has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan. I would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan sahib says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.”
 






In a follow-up post, he said: “There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that Imran Khan’s children will come to Pakistan. So far, only the date for this has yet to be determined. And everyone should remember that when they decided to come, they clearly told their father that we are not seeking your permission but informing you. So, avoid these propagandas because they are of no use.”
 






Defence Minister Khawaja Asif termed the entire matter “one drama among many dramas”, adding that “the purpose was not the meeting of father and child but political gain. No move by the founder happens without political or financial gain.”
 






Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s son, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry previously questioned what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them and visas would be issued “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had told Dawn.com that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Malik also said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
There were conflicting statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.</p><small>2025-07-29 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/29193003e66b4be.png?r=193759' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927425/18-migrants-die-50-missing-after-shipwreck-in-eastern-libya' target='_blank'><strong>18 migrants die, 50 missing after shipwreck in eastern Libya</strong></a><br><p>At least 18 migrants died in a shipwreck off the city of Tobruk in eastern Libya over the weekend, and 50 are still missing, the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) said on Tuesday, citing reports.
Ten survivors have been accounted for so far, the IOM said.
Tobruk is a coastal city near the border with Egypt.
Since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in a Nato-backed uprising in 2011, Libya has become a transit country for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the desert and over the Mediterranean.
“This latest tragedy is a stark reminder of the deadly risks people are forced to take in search of safety and opportunity. Libya remains a major transit point for migrants and refugees, many of whom face exploitation, abuse, and life-threatening journeys,” the IOM said.
Last month, at least 60 migrants were feared dead after a pair of shipwrecks off the coast of Libya. The first ship went down on June 12 near a Libyan port in Tripoli, with 21 people, including women and children, reported missing and only five survivors found.
Those lost at sea included Eritrean, Pakistani, Egyptian and Sudanese nationals. The second wreck took place about 35 kilometres off the port city of Tobruk, with the sole survivor reporting 39 people lost at sea.
A number of Pakistani migrants were feared to be among the dead after a vessel capsized near the Marsa Dela port, northwest of Zawiya city in Libya in February. The boat was carrying around 65 passengers at the time of the accident.
The development followed a similar incident in January in which a boat carrying 80 passengers capsized near Morocco. While the identities of at least 13 Pakistanis killed in the incident were confirmed, over 40 Pakistanis were reportedly murdered by African human traffickers on the boat and only 22 survived the tragedy.</p><small>2025-07-29 14:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/291912340271d95.jpg?r=192650' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927423/govt-crackdown-on-black-market-dollar-trade-pushes-deals-online' target='_blank'><strong>Govt crackdown on black market dollar trade pushes deals online</strong></a><br><p>The government’s crackdown on black market dollar trading has strengthened the rupee, but traders say under-the-counter deals have swiftly shifted to smartphones and home deliveries instead.
Many unlicensed exchange shops have been shut since July 22, when the military spy agency summoned representatives of the sector to explain the US dollar’s rising cost in the open market. Soon after, raids were carried out by the Federal Investigation Agency, which tackles financial crime and smuggling.
Since the crackdown began, the rupee has rebounded from a sharp fall against the dollar earlier in July. In the open market, it firmed from 288.6 per dollar on July 19 to about 286 in recent sessions.
But traders and bankers say the trade continues, suggesting the crackdown’s effects could be short-lived.
The black market operates outside official channels and includes unlicensed dealers, personal networks, and digital peer-to-peer exchanges, with customers seeking to skip tax declarations, avoid burdensome paperwork and bypass limits on official currency purchases.
In Peshawar, long known for black market currency deals, many shops in the Chowk Yadgar district remain shuttered, though some traders were still operating discreetly in back-alley booths.
 
 

“The trade didn’t stop. It just moved,” said Ahmad, a dealer whose family has been in the business for generations. “Now it’s on WhatsApp. If you know someone, the dollars come to your house.”
“The big players have shifted to safer locations and kept going,” said another trader, Gul. Both traders asked not to give their full names.
Even retail buyers are bypassing the formal foreign exchange market. Hassan, a manager at a multinational firm in Karachi, said stricter documentation drove him to an informal forex chat.
“Everyone there is a buyer or seller. No middleman, no commission. Sometimes it’s physical cash, sometimes bank transfers, sometimes crypto,” he said.
Stricter FX discipline
On Monday, the State Bank of Pakistan called in bank treasury heads to address pressure on the rupee. Two bankers said they were told to stop buying dollars from exchange companies at above-official rates on the grounds it was skewing the market.
Banks were asked to rely on their own inflows from exports and remittances, but both sources have slowed. Exporters are delaying bringing money home, betting the rupee will weaken. Remittances are also tapering off as banks reduce incentives once offered to attract overseas inflows.
Authorities also pressed banks to keep the gap between the interbank rate and the open market rate narrow, a condition of Pakistan’s $7 billion IMF deal meant to discourage speculation.
“These meetings have been happening for years, but this one was more pointed,” one banker said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The central bank is expected to cut rates on Wednesday, easing inflation but risking pressure on the rupee.</p><small>2025-07-29 14:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/29183609d24f59a.jpg?r=190142' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927419/air-india-audit-finds-51-safety-lapses-from-unapproved-simulators-to-training-gaps' target='_blank'><strong>Air India audit finds 51 safety lapses, from unapproved simulators to training gaps</strong></a><br><p>India’s aviation watchdog found 51 safety lapses at Air India in its July audit, including lack of adequate training for some pilots, use of unapproved simulators and a poor rostering system, according to a government report seen by Reuters.
The annual audit was not related to the deadly Boeing 787 crash last month that killed 260 people in Ahmedabad, but its findings come as the airline faces renewed scrutiny after the accident.
The Tata Group-owned airline is already facing warning notices for running planes without checking emergency equipment, not changing engine parts in time and forging records, along with other lapses related to crew fatigue management.
The 11-page confidential audit report from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) noted seven “Level I” significant breaches which need to be fixed by July 30, and 44 other non-compliances classified which need to be resolved by August 23.
Officials said they found “recurrent training gaps” for some unspecified Boeing 787 and 777 pilots, saying they had not completed their monitoring duties — where they don’t fly but observe functioning of instruments in the cockpit — ahead of mandatory periodic evaluations.
Air India’s fleet includes 34 Boeing 787s and 23 Boeing 777s, according to Flightradar24 website.
Flagging operational and safety risks, officials wrote in their report that Air India did not do “proper route assessments” for some so-called Category C airports — which may have challenging layouts or terrain — and conducted training for such airfields with simulators that did not meet qualification standards.
“This may account to non-consideration of safety risks during approaches to challenging airports,” the DGCA audit report said.
In a statement to Reuters, Air India said it was “fully transparent” during the audit. It added it will “submit our response to the regulator within the stipulated time frame, along with the details of the corrective actions”.
A preliminary report into the June crash found that the fuel control switches were flipped almost simultaneously after takeoff and there was pilot confusion in the cockpit. One pilot asked the other why he cut off the fuel and the other responded that he hadn’t done so, the report said.
The DGCA has often flagged concerns about Air India pilots breaching the limits of their flight-duty periods, and the audit report said an AI-787 Milan-New Delhi flight last month exceeded the limit by 2 hours and 18 minutes, calling it a “Level I” non-compliance.
The audit was conducted by 10 DGCA inspectors and included another four auditors.
It also criticised the airline’s rostering system, which it said “doesn’t give a hard alert” if a minimum number of crew members were not being deployed on a flight, adding that at least four international flights had flown with insufficient cabin crew.
Tata acquired Air India from the government in 2022. While it has aggressively expanded its international network, it faces persistent complaints from passengers, who often take to social media to show soiled seats, broken armrests, non-operational entertainment systems and dirty cabin areas.
Reuters reported last week that Air India’s senior executives, including the airline’s director of flight operations and its director of training, were sent notices on July 23 flagging 29 “systemic” lapses, pulling up the airline for ignoring “repeated” warnings. Air India has said it will respond to the regulator.
The audit report noted that “door checks and equipment checks” showed inconsistency with procedures and there were gaps in training documentation. Further, it said no chief pilots were assigned for the Airbus A320 and A350 fleet.
“This results in a lack of accountability and effective monitoring of flight operations for these aircraft types,” the report said.
Last year, authorities warned or fined airlines in 23 instances for safety violations, with 11 involving the Air India Group. The biggest fine was $127,000 on Air India for “insufficient oxygen on board” during some international flights.</p><small>2025-07-29 14:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2918262817776f8.jpg?r=182641' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927414/islamabad-police-say-students-shifted-amid-outcry-over-operation-to-vacate-qau-hostels' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad police say students ‘shifted’ amid outcry over operation to vacate QAU hostels</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad Police on Tuesday said that some students were “shifted” during an operation to vacate the hostels of Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) that generated intense criticism.
Videos circulating on social media since the early hours of today showed police personnel outside the hostels with some of them about students being arrested or taken away. The videos elicited strong criticism with many decrying why action was being taken against students and saying that over 70 were arrested.
A statement from the Islamabad police confirmed the development, saying: “At the request of the university administration, [the] Islamabad police provided legal police assistance. The students had vacated 11 hostels, while regarding the remaining four hostels, the university administration stated that some students were not vacating them despite instructions from the university administration and were residing there illegally.
“Upon the written request of the Quaid-i-Azam University administration, assistance was provided to the university administration and security guards. Those students who resisted this peaceful process have been shifted from the hostel, and now legal action will be taken based on the written request of the university administration.”
 






A statement from the university said the district administration took action in the morning to vacate the hostels after the deadline expired.
“It should be noted that [the] Quaid-i-Azam University had decided to temporarily close the hostels from July 13, 2025, in view of the annual repair, maintenance and renovation work during the summer vacations. A large number of students complied with this decision and vacated the hostels, however, some students were still there who had been given repeated time by the university and the district administration to vacate the hostels,” it read.
It added that the Islamabad High Court had dismissed the students’ petition challenging the administrative action of the university as inadmissible and confirmed the autonomy of the institution under the Quaid-i-Azam University Act 1973.
“[The] Quaid-i-Azam University once again reiterates its commitment to providing a safe and conducive environment for students while maintaining discipline, academic standards, and institutional autonomy,” the statement said.
Contesting the police statement, human rights lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir in a post on X questioned why entry was not being allowed to the Secretariat police station. “We just had a meeting with the vice chancellor [of the QAU] and he clearly stated that he did not make any such request,” she added.
 






She alleged that over 70 students were “being kept in illegal detention without any first information report (FIR)” at the Secretariat police station and the authorities were “refusing to share copy of FIR”.
 






Former senator Afrasiab Khattak termed the police crackdown “shameful”.
“Forty students are arrested because they are requesting to be allowed to stay in hostels to prepare for their exams. They must be immediately released and the issues should be resolved by negotiations. Campuses are important part of civil society,” he wrote on X.
 






Academic and activist Dr Taimur Rehman said the students were protesting to start the summer semester. “Imagine. They were arrested because they want to study,” he said.
 






Artist, environmentalist and activist Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Junior lamented that “universities in Pakistan have turned against their own students”.
“Seventy students from Quaid-i-Azam University have been arrested in Islamabad for simply requesting that hostels be kept open over the summer. Keep our students safe! Keep campuses safe!”
 






The incident was also strongly criticised by former human rights minister Dr Shireen Mazari in a series of posts on X.
In September, as many as 25 students were injured in a clash between two groups at the university. Of the injured students, 20 were admitted to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences and five to Polyclinic.
The university (once named Islamabad University) was established in July 1967 under an act of the National Assembly and started teaching and research programmes for PhD and MPhil degrees. Later, it also started offering master’s, graduate and undergraduate programmes.</p><small>2025-07-29 13:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2916295983bd4d6.jpg?r=163111' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927407/drap-directs-pharma-firms-to-recall-3-substandard-syringes' target='_blank'><strong>Drap directs pharma firms to recall 3 ‘substandard’ syringes</strong></a><br><p>The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) on Tuesday directed three pharmaceutical companies to recall “substandard” medical devices from the market and advised pharmacists and chemists to stop supplying these products.
“[The] Central Drugs Laboratory Karachi informed the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan that the samples of the below-mentioned medical devices have been declared as ‘Substandard’,” an alert issued by Drap stated.
The alert identified Zindagi Auto Disable Syringe 5ml, the Ultra Fine SMD Painless Syringe 5ml and Ultra Fine SMD Painless Syringe 3ml as the substandard devices.
“Use of these syringes, in invasive or intravenous procedures, poses a significant risk of introducing microbial contaminants into the patient’s body, which may result in localised infections, abscesses, or life-threatening systemic infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals,” Drap said.
“All pharmacists and chemists working at distribution and pharmacies should immediately check their stocks and stop supplying the mentioned products,” the statement said, adding that the remaining stocks should be quarantined and returned to the supplier or the company.
 
 

The Zindagi Auto Disable Syringe was declared “substandard” on the basis
of a sterility test, while the Ultra Fine SMD Painless Syringes were declared “substandard” on the basis of a sterility test and description test with “clear visible black particles found in the barrel of the syringe”.
The alert advised consumers to stop using products bearing the affected batch number and contact their physician or healthcare provider if they experienced any problems that may be related to using the items. It further urged them to report the incident to Drap.
Last year in March, Drap directed a pharmaceutical company to recall a syrup, which is given to children to treat fever, from the market and advised health professionals not to prescribe it.
In January 2024, Drap directed pharmaceutical companies to recall nine contaminated syrups, according to its chief executive officer.</p><small>2025-07-29 12:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616337-imran-khan-bars-sons-from-visiting-pakistan-ahead-of-august-5-protest' target='_blank'><strong>'No doubt' Imran Khan's sons will visit Pakistan: PTI</strong></a><br><p>

The two accused — Mohammad Minhaj Qazi alias Asad, and Mehboob Ghufran alias Athar — along with their alleged accomplices, had been charged with the killing of the then-managing director of the KESC, his driver and a guard in Karachi’s DHA neighbourhood on July 5, 1997.
An ATC had already sentenced Saulat Mirza to death in 1999 in this case and he was executed in Balochistan’s Machh jail in 2015.
During the proceedings held at Karachi jail today, the court acquitted Qazi and Ghufran for lack of evidence and ordered their release, if they were not nominated in any pending case.
 
 

Defence counsel Advocate Mushtaq Ahmed contended before the court that Qazi had no connection with the case. He said that according to the first information report, the complainant had only seen Mirza outside Hamid’s car.
However, he said, the plaintiff changed her position after Qazi was arrested.
Rangers picked up Qazi on Feb 3, 2016 and placed him under 90-day preventive detention for an inquiry over his alleged involvement in terrorism cases. Later, he was handed over to the police and the investigation officer formally arrested him in the Shahid Hamid murder case.
In May 2016, Shahid Hamid’s widow Shahnaz and son Omar had identified Minhaj as one of the four hitmen during an identification parade held before a judicial magistrate.
According to the prosecution, Hamid, his driver Ashraf Brohi, and guard Khan Akbar were gunned down in an attack on his car in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority on July 5, 1997.
A case was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code, read with Section 7 of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, on the complaint of Hamid’s widow Shahnaz at the Darakhshan police station.
Mirza had been on death row for nearly 17 years before he was executed in Machh jail on May 12, 2015.
In a video aired before his death, Mirza had hurled serious allegations on the MQM and its top leadership, alleging he received direct orders from MQM chief Altaf Hussain via telephone at the residence of MQM leader Babar Ghauri to assassinate the then-KESC chief.</p><small>2025-07-29 12:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/291643130572130.png?r=173216' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927403/tiktok-launches-guide-to-combat-misinformation-during-pakistans-monsoon-floods' target='_blank'><strong>TikTok launches guide to combat misinformation during Pakistan’s monsoon floods</strong></a><br><p>Social media platform TikTok on Tuesday launched a new search guide designed to help users in Pakistan access authoritative and up-to-date information during the ongoing monsoon flood season, according to a press release issued by its public relations firm.
With the onset of the monsoon season, which typically lasts from late June to September, different parts of the country witness heavy rainfall and a heightened risk of extreme weather events like flash floods and landslides, especially in its northern and western regions.
“Now, users searching for flood-related updates on TikTok will now see a prominent banner urging them to verify information through credible sources,” the press release read.
“This guide connects users directly with the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), from where users in Pakistan can access verified information regarding natural disasters,” it added.
The guide also connects users to TikTok’s Safety Centre resources and provides a direct link to TikTok’s Tragic Event Support guide, which offers practical support for individuals affected by distressing incidents.
The guide defines what constitutes a tragic event — ranging from natural disasters to personal loss — and provides users with information on seeking mental health support and responsibly sharing or reporting content related to such events.
“We understand that during times of crisis, access to timely and accurate information is critical,” the statament quoted Fahad Muhammad Khan Niazi, TikTok’s head of public policy and government relations in Pakistan, as saying.
“By partnering with organisations that work directly with disaster response and making these resources more visible to our community, we aim to support informed decision-making and ensure user safety.”
Earlier this month, the Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal underscored the urgency of addressing the growing threats of misinformation and disinformation.

The agreement, signed by Health Minister Mustafa Kamal and WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo at a ceremony in Islamabad, will remain in force until Dec 31, 2027 and “may be extended by written agreement of the parties”.
In addition to the provision of medicines, WHO will continue to support Pakistan’s Ministry of Health and provincial authorities with technical guidance, resources, and operational support to fight childhood cancer.
The agreement aims to increase the survival rate of children fighting with cancer from 30 per cent to 60pc by 2030, the WHO statement highlighted.
“Limited access to treatment is one of the main factors behind the low survival rate in the country, compared to a survival rate of 80pc in higher-income countries,” it noted.
In addition to the provision of medicines, WHO will continue to support the health ministry and provincial authorities with technical guidance, resources, and operational support to fight childhood cancer.
“No child affected by cancer should die because of lack of access to treatment, including quality-assured medicines. WHO will work side by side with the Ministry of Health and partners to save lives and leave no child behind, no matter where they live or who they are,” the press release quoted Dr Luo as saying.
 
 

On the occasion, Kamal said: “Today is a big day for Pakistan, because through this agreement, we are going to receive medicines to treat children who have cancer. This is the way forward.”
He added: “We are thankful to WHO, the Global Platform, Unicef, and all partners who have made this possible and give our children access to treatment to fight this disease. If we are able to save one life through this collaboration, we are saving mankind.”
Pakistan is the second country in the Eastern Mediterranean Region to join the Global Platform, co-founded in 2021 by St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital and WHO to provide an uninterrupted supply of certified cancer medicines to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
The initiative works in collaboration with the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef), that will be responsible for procuring medicines and delivering them to Pakistan, according to the statement.
It is estimated that 400,000 children develop cancer each year. Close to 90pc of them live in LMICs, where survival rates are less than 30pc, meaning seven out of 10 children affected by cancer do not survive, WHO noted.
Minister stresses need to control fertility rate, preventable diseases
Meanwhile, Kamal also stressed the need to control the country’s fertility rate and reduce the spread of preventable diseases.
The fertility rate has declined in Pakistan over the last few decades, from six live births per woman in 1994 to 3.6 births per woman in 2024, according to the United Nations’ World Fertility Report 2024. However, it has stayed stagnant at 3.6 since 2005, becoming a matter of concern for policymakers.
Addressing the signing ceremony, Kamal called for the government and public to work together to achieve targets for a healthy society, saying that it “begins with population, with childbirth”.

The minister claimed that 11,000 mothers died every year due to pregnancy complications, adding: “Imagine it — start counting 11,000 corpses; you won’t be able to.”
However, a WHO statement from April put that figure at 9,800.
“Every day, 675 babies under one month and 27 mothers die from preventable complications in Pakistan, amounting to over 9,800 maternal and 246,300 newborn deaths each year. Pakistan also registers more than 190,000 stillbirths annually,” the statement noted.
Kamal highlighted that religious institutions had even stated in fatwas that in the event of danger to a mother or her child’s care, a break in childbirth was necessary.
 
 

He also drew attention to Pakistan’s high fertility rate of 3.6 births per woman, saying that nowhere in the world could people make progress with such a fertility rate.
He pointed out that even countries in the region, such as Bangladesh, Iran and India, had all reduced their fertility rates. “They are making progress. They are able to take care of their people.”
Referring to childbirth, the minister stated that 43pc of children were born “stunted” in the country, with their brains not developing correctly.
“So when you say that our youth is our asset, 43pc of our youth is a liability,” he said.
Speaking on high rates of preventable diseases, Kamal said medical experts reported that 68pc of those in Pakistan were waterborne. “If we start drinking clean water, then 68pc of the hospital rush will end,” he quipped.
The minister expressed discontent that not enough was being done to prevent the spread of waterborne diseases, particularly stressing the need to treat sewage.
 
 

He explained that the lack of a separate line for sewage to travel directly to the sea for disposal contributed to diseases, as the sewage would travel to another neighbourhood’s pipeline and mix in with its water.
According to Kamal, sewage flushed by a house in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) could go on to mix with someone else’s drinking water “in some nullah, some river, some stream […] because the water does not get treated when it leaves there”.
“All the way from GB to Karachi, people are drinking other people’s sewage.”
The minister criticised the nation’s “lack of understanding” about sewage treatment being necessary.
 
 

Kamal also called attention to the refusal of many families to allow vaccines to be administered, saying that “people are coming to doorsteps to administer vaccines and you are closing the door on them”.
“This is not the sole work of the government,” he said, adding, “This cannot be done by any Pakistani district, provincial or federal government alone.”
He called on the public to “fix” its thinking as a nation and listen to the government’s message. “My worker is going down to administer shots for six, 12 illnesses and being refused with a closed door,” he said.</p><small>2025-07-29 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/29135842c62c959.jpg?r=142450' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927385/palestinian-question-a-test-case-for-world-dar-tells-un-moot-on-two-state-solution' target='_blank'><strong>Palestinian question a ‘test case’ for world, Dar tells UN moot on two-state solution</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Tuesday said the Israel-Palestine question was a “test case” for the United Nations and the world as he addressed a high-level conference on the two-state solution in New York.
Dar was addressing a rescheduled global conference on “The Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution” at the United Nations headquarters.
The three-day moot, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, comes amid renewed international efforts calling for an end to Israel’s bombardment of Gaza ongoing for over 660 days, with France announcing it will formally recognise the State of Palestine.
“The Palestinian question is a test case for the United Nations and the world. Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering and principled support for the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination, including their right to a viable, independent and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital,” Dar told the conference.
 






“It is high time for credible and enforceable international action,” he stressed, according to a transcript posted on X by Pakistan’s Permanent Mission to the UN.
Since October 7, 2023, Israel’s offensive against Gaza has killed more than 60,000 and injured 145,870 others, according to the health ministry in the besieged and bombarded territory.
“First, an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire across Gaza and all Occupied Palestinian Territories.
“Resolution 2735 must be implemented. We commend the efforts of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt and the United States,” Dar said, referring to a UN Security Council resolution passed last year for a ceasefire in Gaza.
“Second, full and unimpeded humanitarian access, especially life-saving food and medicine. Humanitarian teams must be protected,” the deputy premier said, highlighting the need for reinforced political and financial support for the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA).
“International accountability for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Impunity must end,” Dar further said. The International Criminal Court (ICC) had issued arrest warrants last year for Israel’s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas’s slain military chief Mohammed Deif.
 
 

Dar further noted: “Fifth, the reinvigoration of a genuine and irreversible political process to end the occupation and realise the two-state solution.”
The conference, with 123 countries and global organisations participating, aims to chart a concrete path towards the two-state solution through proposals developed by eight working groups, which have held extensive consultations with UN member states and civil society groups.
During his speech, Dar urged the conference to “ensure universal recognition of the State of Palestine and its full UN membership”, welcoming France’s decision in that regard.
The deputy premier highlighted: “Today, Gaza is a graveyard of international law and humanitarian principles.
“The death and destruction inflicted by Israel, including the killing of over 58,000 Palestinians — mostly women and children — is an unconscionable breach of international humanitarian law, UN resolutions and the binding measures of the International Court of Justice (ICJ).”
The ICJ, in a non-binding ruling, had ordered Israel in January 2024 to prevent acts of genocide against Palestinians, but had stopped short of ordering a ceasefire as requested by South Africa. In July that year, it also ruled that Israel’s decades-long occupation of Palestinian territory was “illegal” and needed to end as soon as possible.
At the moot, the deputy PM also called attention to Israel’s blocking of humanitarian aid to Gaza, which Tel Aviv eased on Sunday.
“The blockade of aid, deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure, including refugee camps, hospitals and aid convoys, has crossed every red line of legality and humanity. This collective punishment must stop now!” Dar emphasised.
“For over 75 years, the Palestinian people have endured occupation, displacement and denial of their fundamental rights, including their inalienable right to self-determination. This prolonged injustice is not just a political failure, but a moral stain — and a persistent threat to international peace and security.”
 






Detailing Pakistan’s will to support Palestinians, Dar said: “Pakistan stands ready to extend dedicated technical assistance and capacity building support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters in key sectors such as public administration, health, education and service delivery, in coordination with the Palestinian leadership.
“Pakistan is prepared to contribute to the building of institutions, including through participation in the Arab-OIC Plan, and any international protection mechanism,” he added.
“Justice delayed is justice denied. But when justice is denied for generations, the consequences are even graver.
“The question of Palestine has impacted the entire region and beyond. We must give hope to the Palestinian people. The occupation must end, and end now.  It is time for freedom, self-determination and statehood, and Palestine’s full membership of the UN. That will be the best guarantee for lasting peace in the region,” the foreign minister asserted.
 
 

Speaking on the outcomes of the conference, Dar underscored the “centrality of the two-state solution as the only path to sustainable peace”. He called on the moot to demand Israel’s immediate withdrawal from Gaza and support its reconstruction as envisaged in Resolution 2735 and a plan by Arab countries.
“Four: reject and halt any attempts at the forced displacement or demographic manipulation. Five: Oppose illegal Israeli settlements and annexation, especially in the West Bank and East Jerusalem,” the foreign minister said, addressing the UN member states present.
The deputy premier also supported a proposal by the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to “provide international protection for the Palestinian people through the deployment of an international protection mechanism”.
Dar meets with Palestinian PM
On the sidelines of the UN conference, Dar met with Palestinian PM Mohammad Mustafa and held a “detailed exchange on the grave situation in Gaza and Occupied Palestinian Territory”.
“I conveyed deep sorrow over the immense suffering endured by innocent Palestinians, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s full solidarity with them,” the deputy PM said on X.
 






He reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to lasting peace and the establishment of a sovereign Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders.
“We expressed hope that the conference would lead to concrete outcomes in support of the Palestinian cause and the realisation of the two-state solution,” Dar wrote.
Mustafa also addressed the conference, saying: “What is happening in Gaza is its latest and most brutal manifestation, and we are more than ever compelled to act.”
 






Dar, Kuwait FM discuss close collaboration at multilateral forums
Separately, Dar also held a meeting with Kuwait’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya in New York and discussed close collaboration at multilateral forums.
Pakistan established diplomatic relations with Kuwait in October 1963. The two countries maintain strong brotherly relations rooted in shared religion and culture, with the oil-rich Gulf state hosting nearly 100,000 Pakistanis.
Dar met with the Kuwaiti minister on the sidelines of the international conference on the two-state solution.
The two leaders “discussed close collaboration at multilateral fora, including at the UN and OIC”, a statement by the Foreign Office said.
“The two leaders discussed ways to further strengthen Pakistan–Kuwait relations, with a focus on enhancing cooperation in trade, investment, energy, food security and defence.”
Both sides agreed to undertake high-level exchanges soon to deepen bilateral engagement, the FO added.
The two foreign ministers also expressed their “deep concern at continuing Israeli acts of aggression against Palestinians and worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza”, stressing the urgent need for a just and lasting resolution.
 






Pakistan, Bangladesh reaffirm aim to boost ties
Dar also met with Bangladesh’s Foreign Adviser Md. Touhid Hossain on the sidelines of the conference, which the FO noted was their fourth meeting since October 2024.
“The two leaders reviewed bilateral ties, reaffirmed commitment to deepen political, economic and cultural cooperation, as well as boost connectivity and people-to-people exchanges,” the FO said on X.
“Both agreed to undertake high-level visits in the near future,” it said, adding that the two diplomats also expressed their concern over the “grave humanitarian crisis and ongoing Israeli aggression” in Gaza.
