Due to the spectrum auction across several bands, the 4G coverage area in the country will expand, increasing the service area, but this will also push demand for smartphones.
The Ministry of Industries and Production has finalised the Mobile and Electronic Devices Manufacturing Policy 2026-33 at a meeting chaired by Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Haroon Akhtar Khan.
Mr Khan said that the policy is a milestone initiative and, starting with mobile phones, will eventually help the country’s industrial sector, as electronics have dominated all spheres.

Govt finalises policy as spectrum auction looms

The industry has welcomed the new policy, noting that with fresh spectrum scheduled for next month, demand for new and more advanced phones, including 5G-compatible sets, will increase.

 

“The new policy comes at the right time as the telcos will take around 5-6 months after obtaining the spectrum to implement the infrastructure for introducing 5G services in key urban areas and 4G in other cities and towns,” said Amir Allawala, senior member of the Pakistan Mobile Phone Manufacturers Association.
“The mobile phone industry also needs around the same time to shift to 5G sets, and many companies making feature phones are already in the process of shifting their production lines to smartphones,” he added.
The key feature of the policy is 8 per cent incentives on mobile phone exports, as well as a reduction in customs duties on the import of parts, while the import of CBUs of mobile phones and accessories such as chargers, hands-free, etc., will have higher duties.
The policy will be forwarded to the prime minister for approval. The meeting noted that there were 37 licensed mobile set manufacturers, producing 40 million mobile units annually.
Pakistan assembled 30.2m phone sets in 2025, and around 40pc were feature phones. At the same time, the maximum local consumption of phones could reach 40m sets per annum; therefore, export incentives were essential to boost the industry.
The policy also recommends establishing a dedicated Mobile & Electronics Devices Cell within the EDB to ensure effective implementation and coordination.

The government’s appetite for more bank money has shot up, leaving little room for the private sector to borrow. The private sector is not performing well enough to spur economic growth, given persistent tight monetary policy despite low inflation.
The data issued by the State Bank showed that the government borrowed Rs1,912 billion in 7MFY26 from the commercial banks compared to Rs408bn a year ago.
However, the government ended FY25 with total borrowing of Rs5.4 trillion, indicating most of the borrowing was carried out in the second half of that fiscal year.

Raises Rs1.9tr from banks in 7MFY26, leaves little room for private sector

The situation is even worse this year, as the government has already borrowed about Rs2tr, and if the pace continues, the total would surely exceed the Rs5.4tr borrowed in FY25.
It must be alarming, since the government had borrowed Rs8.5tr in FY24 to meet rising current expenditure.
Interest payments accounted for the largest share of spending, at around Rs8tr in FY25.

 

Financial sectors have been warning that increased borrowing will lead to higher debt servicing costs. The government has no option but to borrow and cut development spending, as noted over the last three years.
Last month, the State Bank reduced the Cash Reserve Requirement (CRR) for banks to 5pc from 6pc enabling banks to have higher liquidity. This additional liquidity has been created to feed the private sector.
However, financial sector experts believe the additional liquidity could boost investment in
government papers, as the private sector is least interested in launching new projects or expanding production. Businessmen and industrialists were borrowing for working capital, not for new ventures.
Experts offer several reasons for the private sector’s reluctance to borrow for long-term investments. First, the interest rate is still double the prevailing inflation and the highest among regional countries.
Secondly, the banks prefer risk-free easy profit from government securities and discourage long-term lending to businesses amid high default fears. Third, the unprecedented cost of inputs, especially energy, and high taxes, combined with rampant corruption in the Federal Board of Revenue, discourage new investment.
It is believed in the financial sector that the time is not suitable for any new long-term investment due to the uncertain political situation in the country, while an alarming high alert in the region regarding the increasing possibility of attacks on Iran by Israel and US forces.
Neither domestic nor foreign investors would invest in the economy unless the external and internal situation becomes conducive and attractive. This is why hundreds of Pakistanis have relocated their companies and partially shifted their businesses to Central Asia, Africa, and Mexico.
Published in Dawn, February 22nd, 2026</p><small>2026-02-22 05:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699a50b0bae6b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974935/a-peek-into-trumps-iran-mindset' target='_blank'><strong>A peek into Trump’s Iran mindset</strong></a><br><p>ALL eyes in Pakistan must be on Iran because of the likely crippling consequences of an outbreak of hostilities between the US-Israel coalition and the Persian Gulf Islamic Republic, with millions here and abroad asking when and if Trump will pull the trigger.
Many analysts believe that the level of US military mobilisation ordered by President Donald Trump and the assembling of what he calls an ‘armada’ in the Gulf can’t be just to threaten or intimidate Iran but is actually part of preparations to attack it. Israel and its American supporters who have given Trump hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign funds apply their own pressure.
Despite its overwhelming technical, numerical and resource advantage, is American military might enough to deliver mass-scale destruction in Iran in the shortest possible time? Even if accompanied by, reportedly, hundreds, even thousands, of Mossad-CIA-MI6 (Israeli, US and UK) agents and operatives on the ground — all carefully cultivated, funded and armed to play fifth columnists? This is the question Trump must be addressing.
America’s appetite for either prolonged conflict or ‘boots on the ground’ is near zero, especially in Trump’s MAGA heartland. With mid-term Congressional elections due on Nov 3, a little over eight months away, the US president knows what making the wrong call on Iran could mean for the remainder of his term in office if his obedient-subservient Republicans lose their House majorities.

Iranian planners know they can’t win a war against the US. But they say they plan to inflict a heavy cost on the US for any unilateral aggression.

The US may not be dependent on Gulf oil, unlike China and East Asia and even Pakistan, but 20 per cent of the global oil supply passes through the Strait of Hormuz daily. If the US can’t quickly clear the area of Iranian naval assets — including of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) — comprising high-speed missile boats, shore-based fortified missile batteries, and missile launchers on islands dotting the Gulf, besides Iran’s ability to mine the narrow waterway, then any disruption will lead to a rise in oil prices.

 

The longer the disruption, the higher the oil prices. Where this can devastate economies such as Pakistan’s and cause headaches for even China — 15pc of whose oil needs are met by discounted Iranian imports — experts say that a months-long campaign can push oil prices up to $150 a barrel. Such an oil price hike will hammer the global economy and the US can’t remain immune to its effects.
Blocking the strait is just one step the Iranians could take if they retain the military capacity in the days and weeks after the start of a possible attack during which the US military claims it can carry out 800 sorties a day. Sea- and land-based missiles will be in addition, as will Israeli air attacks.
Iran could retaliate by targeting not just US military bases but also part of the Arab Gulf oil and gas infrastructure, impacting supplies. One can be sure that if the US does decide to attack Iran, mainly at the behest of Israel and some of its two-faced regional allies, it will have factored in Iran’s military capability and devised a plan on how to knock out Tehran’s missile stockpiles and launch sites quickly.
The memory of last year’s 12-day war is still fresh; faced with an Iranian missile barrage that breached sophisticated multi-layered missile defence shields to hammer Israel. The latter country is reported to have asked the US to secure a ceasefire.
One can be sure in the months since that the US-Israel coalition has done its homework, strengthened missile defence shields and worked on identifying and better targeting Iran’s missile launchers, many of which are said to be in deep underground bunkers but still highly mobile.
Although China and Russia have refrained from any openly declared military supplies/upgrades, there are suggestions in the independent media (not in the Western legacy media framework) that the Iranian military, like Pakistan’s, has now completely transitioned to the Chinese BeiDou satellite system from the US Global Positioning System (GPS).
This has two advantages. The first is the West’s difficulty in jamming it, and secondly, its targeting is said to be better compared to that of GPS in some areas. There are some reports that Iran now also possesses a datalink for military communications and targeting similar to Pakistan’s Link-17 which the latter state used to devastating effect in last year’s conflict with India.
Iranian planners know well that they can’t win a war against the US. But they say they plan to inflict a heavy cost on the US for any unilateral aggression. How high that cost can be and how much of it is achievable by a long-sanctioned Iran is something Trump would be receiving briefings on.
Israel wants to devastate Iran’s central authority and turn the country into another Libya or Syria so that it loses its ability to challenge the settler-colonial state. Fragmentation and a civil war-like situation may remove the threat to Tel Aviv but the latter’s proxies can threaten states like Pakistan, unleashing hitherto unknown dynamics.
Western media is abuzz with talk of an attack as early as this weekend. But, as we speak, Russian, Chinese and Iranian (including the IRGC) navies are carrying out exercises in the Strait of Hormuz. China has made it clear many times that it has no appetite for military conflict and will focus on economic growth and global trade integration through its Belt and Road Initiative.
Russia is preoccupied with its war in Ukraine and the US might leverage that conflict to secure Russian neutrality. However, with both major powers carrying out naval manoeuvres bang in the middle of a conflict zone, it isn’t clear what their reaction would be if their assets suffer collateral damage; they won’t be targeted. This may dictate the timing of the US decision, perhaps the decision itself.

Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The action was taken, “in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan, including Imam Bargah at Islamabad, one each in Bajaur and Bannu, followed by another incident today in Bannu during the holy month of Ramazan,” the information ministry’s statement said.
“Pakistan has conclusive evidence that these acts of terrorism were perpetrated by Khwarij on behest of their Afghanistan-based leadership and handlers. Responsibilities for these attacks were also claimed by Afghanistan-based Pakistani Taliban belonging to Fitna al Khwarij (FAK) and their affiliates, and Islamic State of Khorasan Province (ISKP),” the statement said.

 

The statement asserted that “Pakistan has always strived for maintaining peace and stability in the region, but at the same time, the safety and security of our citizens remains our top priority”, adding that the action against the seven camps and hideouts was “a retributive response”, carried out based on “intelligence-based selective targeting”.
“Despite repeated efforts by Pakistan to urge the Afghan Taliban Regime to take verifiable measures to deny use of Afghan territory by terrorist groups and foreign proxies to carry out terrorist activities in Pakistan, the Afghan Taliban Regime failed to undertake any substantive action against them,” the statement noted.
“Pakistan expects and reiterates [that the] Interim Afghan Government […] fulfil its obligations and deny use of its soil by Khwarij and terrorists against Pakistan as the safety and security of people of Pakistan comes first and foremost. Pakistan also expects the international community to play a positive and constructive role by urging the Taliban regime to stand by its commitments as part of [the] Doha Agreement to deny use of its soil against other countries; an act vital for regional and global peace and security,” the statement added.
Souring relations
There has been a resurgence in terrorism in Pakistan since the Afghan Taliban returned to power in Kabul in 2021. Islamabad has repeatedly urged the Taliban administration to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries on Afghan soil, particularly those linked to the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. Officials say those appeals have gone unheeded.
Tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan heightened once again after the Feb 16 vehicle-borne suicide attack on a joint security forces post in Bajaur district near the Afghan border. Terrorists belonging to the TTP attempted to breach the Malangi check post and rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into its perimeter wall after an exchange of fire.
Eleven Pakistani soldiers were martyred. A young girl also died, and seven others, including women and children, were injured when a nearby residential building was damaged in the blast.

 

Investigators said the suicide bomber, identified as Amad, alias Qari Abdullah or Abu Zar, was a member of the Afghan Taliban’s special forces from Balkh province. The TTP claimed responsibility for the assault.
Then, on Saturday, Feb 21, a lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
On Feb 19, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to conduct strikes inside Afghanistan if attacks continued from across the border, saying military options remained viable.
Not the first time
In November last year, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, had claimed that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
At the time, Pakistan had neither confirmed nor denied the strikes, which were reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The strikes were reported almost a month after deadly border clashes at the Pak-Afghan border had resulted in the martyrdom of 23 Pakistani soldiers and the killing of over 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists, according to the ISPR.
The skirmishes began “on the night of Oct 11/12, 2025, [after] Afghan Taliban and India-sponsored Fitna-al-Khawarij launched an unprovoked attack on Pakistan, along the Pak-Afghan border”.</p><small>2026-02-22 05:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699a50e62c5be.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974936/strategic-confusion' target='_blank'><strong>Strategic confusion</strong></a><br><p>IT was late spring, yet Islamabad was gripped by a heated debate over whether Pakistan should send its troops to Saudi Arabia to participate in the Saudi-Yemen war. The joint session of parliament deliberated for five days, reflecting an unusual level of engagement, as it is rare in Pakistan’s history for parliament to decide matters concerning security and foreign policy.
A similar moment had emerged in May 2009, when the military leadership sought parliamentary support to launch Operation Rah-i-Raast in Swat against what was at that time described and debated as action against its ‘own people’.
After a few days, parliament concluded on April 10, 2015, that Pakistan should remain neutral in the Yemen conflict to play a proactive diplomatic role in ending the crisis. Indeed, it was a crucial decision that parliament made, one which the establishment could not have afforded to take unilaterally; parliament had provided it full support.
Has such a moment arisen again? Pakistan’s leadership is once again hesitant to play a role in the Middle East, ie, to announce its participation in the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), which will be tasked with securing reconstruction zones and supporting a post-conflict governance arrangement in Gaza.
Prime Minister Mian Shehbaz Sharif and Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, along with a delegation, went to Washington where they attended a Donald Trump-led Board of Peace meeting, during which the American president and Mr Sharif exchanged “traditional greetings”, with a reminder that Trump had prevented a nuclear war between India and Pakistan. However, Pakistan was not among the five nations that announced their formal participation in the ISF.

Pakistan’s leadership is once again hesitant to play a role in the Middle East.

With Mr Sharif and Mr Dar continuing their meetings in Washington, including with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the leadership may reach a decision in the next few days about Pakistan’s contribution to the ISF, as hinted by the Foreign Office spokesperson during a media briefing.
It is spring again, and the establishment has quickened its pace towards becoming a hard state. And yet, this is a peculiar move for it and it might be considering taking parliament into confidence to seek its endorsement and present it as a consensus decision. Such doubts arise because Pakistan is maintaining a similar position on the ISF, ie, that it would be part of a peacekeeping mandate but would not participate in any disarmament of Hamas or demilitarisation mandates.
Let us recall the April 2015 session, when parliament went a step further: while endorsing the establishment’s plan, it also advised that Pakistan should not send its troops to Saudi Arabia even for training and advisory purposes. In its resolution, it stressed that the leadership should play a proactive diplomatic role rather than deploy troops. Will Pakistan repeat this stance?
The situation is altogether different now. Pakistan has renewed its defence pact with Saudi Arabia, there are new geostrategic alignments in West and Central Asia as well as in Africa, and Pakistan is enjoying the support and favour of President Trump. This time, multiple Muslim nations are participating in the ISF, and it would be difficult for the leadership to make a decision.
However, there is a perception that, more than a backlash from the masses over unpopular decisions, the establishment is apprehensive of the historical factor — history can make us either heroes or villains. Such an impression has a cost not only for individuals but also for institutions. Such assumptions may haunt the decision-makers, but perhaps the strategic advantages they see in any geostrategic adventure they contemplate is not viewed from a longer-term perspective.
Seemingly, Pakistan faces a dilemma: an India-centric security doctrine, seeking help from the West and Gulf countries, while providing a strategic backyard to the US and offering specialised security services to Gulf countries. Though the dream is to eventually become a net security provider to the Gulf and North Africa, defence production capabilities and a weak economic profile are major hindrances to this, but the decision-making skills of the establishment have always been tested on both fronts.
US regional priorities are changing and may require Pakistan’s backyard as part of its strategy against China and Iran, something Pakistan obviously cannot consider, unlike the role it played against the Soviet Union in the 1980s and 1990s. Afghanistan is a different story now. It still carries some strategic value for the US for the same purpose, but the country has lost much of its strategic capital and will take a long time to regain even limited strength. Meanwhile, Pakistan will continue to exert pressure on it, and this appears to be sufficient for the US for now.
In the Middle East, where Pakistan has somewhat greater geostrategic space, it often becomes confused about which direction to take. It tries to balance its relations with neighbouring countries, mainly Iran, manage the domestic front marked by sectarian and political divisions, and, more importantly, confront India’s growing influence in the Gulf countries over the last two decades.
In geopolitics, nothing is risk-free, and alliances and equations evolve on the basis of mutual interests and give-and-take, not on moral or ideological grounds. Impartiality and a non-aligned attitude are diplomatic positions that have value in realpolitik, but medium-sized nations must make decisions to remain geo-strategically relevant and to maximise their economic interests.
Pakistan had faced consequences of such confusion in the past as well, for instance, in its relations with Saudi Arabia and the first Iraq war. If the decision seems difficult, parliament is here to happily provide its support, as it did in the past. Joining the Board of Peace without considering its costs would have been a blunder, but once one has set sail, one must cope with the voyage.

Published in Dawn, February 22nd, 2026</p><small>2026-02-22 05:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/699915e58447a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974759/smokers-corner-the-problem-with-tactical-entryism' target='_blank'><strong>SMOKERS’ CORNER: THE PROBLEM WITH 'TACTICAL ENTRYISM'</strong></a><br><p>In February 2025, the National Citizens Party (NCP) was established by the prominent youth leaders of Bangladesh’s so-called ‘Gen-Z Revolution.’
This student-led uprising had terminated Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year authoritarian tenure during the summer of 2024. The primary objective of the party was to transition young leaders into the parliament.
The 2024 uprising comprised a broad coalition of liberals, leftists, Islamists and nationalists. The Bangladesh Jamaat-i-Islami (BJI) emerged as the most organised faction. It had been a primary target of Hasina’s government. The movement against Hasina’s rule was highly iconoclastic, actively attacking symbols associated with the birth of Bangladesh and the role played by Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujeeb, in this birth. He is someone the BJI detests.

 

When the young leaders of the 2024 uprising decided to formalise their revolution by establishing a political party, the move was immediately met with internal confusion. The NCP’s ranks comprised a volatile mix of progressives, secularists, conservatives and nationalists. Internal debates were often heated but failed to produce a consolidated consensus. Instead, a flimsy foundational statement was tabled, asserting that the party was neither secular nor Islamist.
This was criticised by political analysts as a product of political ambiguity. This lack of clarity became particularly apparent during the drafting of the party’s primary charter. The leadership struggled to reconcile the aspirations of its secular factions with the increasing influence of its Islamist factions. By refusing to define its stance on the role of religion in the state, the party risked becoming a vessel for any organised group capable of mobilising the street. This led to NCP’s controversial alignment with the BJI for the elections.

From Pakistan in 1977 and Iran in 1979 to Egypt in 2011 and Bangladesh in 2026, when loosely organised reformists align with disciplined Islamist forces, the ‘revolution’ rarely ends as they imagine

This represents a classic phenomenon observed across various developing nations, where small progressive groups frequently align themselves with the more organised right-wing forces. Such progressives often operate under the belief that this partnership will provide a viable route into the corridors of power by leveraging the superior organisational machinery of right-wing parties.

 

However, the historical precedent for such alliances is almost invariably disastrous. In these arrangements, the smaller progressive elements often find themselves ideologically hollowed out or eventually sidelined by their resource-rich right-wing ‘partners’. The NCP’s attempt to harness the mobilising power of the BJI ultimately compromised the youthful party’s reformist identity and led to significant internal fractures.
In the 1977 general elections in Pakistan, and the subsequent anti-Bhutto protest movement, various small secular and progressive parties joined an alliance that was largely led by the country’s three main Islamist parties. The alliance viewed the Zulfikar Ali Bhutto regime as tyrannical. However, the progressives in the alliance frequently found themselves at a loss for words when their Islamist ‘allies’ began advocating for the replacement of Bhutto’s ‘socialist’ policies with a government based on Shariah law.
When the Bhutto regime was toppled in a reactionary military coup, the progressives and secularists in the alliance found themselves in jails or exile, while the Jamaat-i-Islami, a major partner in the alliance, successfully integrated itself into the first cabinet of the new military regime.
The Iranian Revolution of 1979 provides another prominent example of this precarious dynamic. In the late 1970s, a broad coalition of secular liberals, leftists and student activists collaborated with religious clerics under Ayatollah Khomeini to overthrow the Shah of Iran.
According to the Iranian-American historian Ervand Abrahamian, middle-class progressives operated under the assumption that, as the “intellectual engines of the uprising”, they would inevitably dictate the shape of the post-revolutionary state. However, once the Shah was ousted, the more organised Islamist factions rapidly consolidated authority. This resulted in a systematic and brutal purge of their former secular and leftist partners.
A similar pattern emerged in Egypt following the ousting of Hosni Mubarak in 2011. The sociologist Hazem Kandil wrote that the secular and liberal activists who had led the protests lacked a formal political structure to translate their street presence into institutional power. They entered into a tactical partnership with the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood.
Although the Brotherhood won the ensuing elections, the alliance with the progressive youth disintegrated. The progressives felt that the Brotherhood had ‘hijacked’ the revolution to implement a narrow ideological agenda. This internal collapse eventually created the conditions for a military takeover in 2013.



The NCP could only win seven seats in the recent parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. The elections were swept by the centrist Bangladesh National Party (BNP). Critics within the NCP are of the view that its alliance with an Islamist party alienated a significant number of their supporters, who decided to vote for the BNP, which has been a historical opponent of the Awami League.
Progressives/leftists are often effective at articulating grievances and dominating the media narrative during an uprising. Yet, they frequently lack the social machinery required to sustain political power. They employ ‘tactical entryism’, believing that it is more convenient to enter into a partnership with  larger right-wing parties and use their physical and logistical strength to grab a piece of the power pie and gradually steer the government toward reform.
Such moves frequently fail. Right-wing parties are strictly hierarchical and highly disciplined. This makes it easy for them to later purge their more loosely organised progressive ‘allies’. A recent case of ‘entryism’ is visible in the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Aaien-i-Pakistan (TTAP), an opposition alliance headed by the right-wing populist Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI). It contains a mixture of sectarian outfits, secularists, conservatives and a left-wing group.
The left within this alliance has decided not to view PTI as a right-wing party but as a populist vehicle for ‘democracy’ and, of course, its own entry into a future parliament. There may also be an ambition that they might simply step into the vacuum and replace the PTI that is in such spectacular shambles. After all, what better way to lead the masses than by hijacking a shipwreck, no?
One can only admire the intellectual flexibility required for these activists to rationalise positions that contradict their own stated values, most notably PTI’s steadfast refusal to entertain any meaningful action against Islamist militants. It is a masterclass in moral amnesia.
Meanwhile, the alliance’s more seasoned folk, who are ex-devotees of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), are clearly treating this populist vehicle as an elaborate audition. Their goal isn’t so much to save the soul of the nation as it is to bat their eyelashes at the establishment, hoping to be hand-picked for the lead role in the next state-sanctioned ‘king’s party.’
Ultimately, the whole spectacle offers far more fodder for a dark comedy than it does for any genuine ‘struggle for democracy’ and the ‘sanctity of the constitution.’

Rescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan told Dawn that the explosion took place on the top floor of Bismillah Residency near Hyderi Market in Block-E of North Nazimabad at Sehri time.
The sound of the explosion was heard miles away.
He said that two flats caught fire as a result of the explosion, leading to the death of a 15-year-old while another four people were injured.
The spokesperson added that four fire tenders were being employed to extinguish the fire while a snorkel had also been called.
He adding that the exact nature of the explosion would be ascertained after the fire was brought under control, but said that it could be a gas-related explosion.
Meanwhile, an Edhi Foundation spokesperson in a statement said the injured also included a 70-year-old man and a four-year-old girl. The injured sustained serious burn injuries and were rushed to the burns centre of Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.
Central District police also issued a statement, saying that after receiving information about the incident, police immediately rushed to the spot and called the rescue and fire brigade services.
The statement added that evidence was being collected to ascertain the cause of the explosion.
In a statement issued by his spokesperson, Sindh Governor Kamran Khan Tessori expressed his concern over the incident.
He directed the authorities to prioritise saving lives and to secure the surroundings of the affected building.
The incident comes days after at least 15 people, including women and children, were killed, and 18 others were injured after a gas explosion caused part of a residential building to collapse in Karachi’s Soldier Bazaar area.
The incident occurred at a residence in the Gul Rana Colony area of Soldier Bazaar.

Mr Trump has said “bad things” would happen to Iran if it did not strike a deal within the next 10 to 15 days, while adding that he was still considering ‘limited’ military strikes.
He has also said that the option of regime change in the Islamic Republic remains on the table. It seems that the American leader — through his verbal threats and display of military muscle — is waging a psychological campaign against the Iranians. The problem with this approach is that a single miscalculation can lead to disastrous real-world consequences, and cause the whole region to erupt in flames.
On their part, the Iranians appear confident that an agreement can be reached. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has said a draft deal is nearly ready, though he did observe that the US military posturing was “unnecessary and unhelpful”. Yet despite the minister’s belief that the parleys can succeed, Iran’s leadership has also said that an attack by America would lead to a regional war.
Iranian allies in the region — Hezbollah, the Houthis, militias in Iraq — have similarly said that this time, they will hit back if Iran is attacked.
Israel, meanwhile, is also reportedly drawing up war plans. In fact, it is Tel Aviv that is most interested in an attack on Iran. Israel has lobbied for nearly impossible conditions to be inserted in any deal with Iran — an end to Tehran’s nuclear and ballistic missiles programmes, and cessation of support for Iran’s regional armed allies. Suffice to say, the Iranians are highly unlikely to agree to such terms, and any deal should focus on realistic goals regarding the nuclear file.

 

The ball is in Mr Trump’s court. With his huge build-up of forces around Iran, and frequent threats targeted at the Islamic Republic, the US president has created a very difficult situation for himself. Statesmanship would require him to back down from his threatening posture and give the Iranians genuine sanctions relief so that they can revive their battered economy, and come to terms with Tehran on a doable nuclear deal.
To think that any military action against Iran would be ‘limited’ is delusional, as in the heat of battle, matters can escalate very quickly.
Mr Trump must decide if he wants to stick to his campaign promises of ending ‘forever’ wars and putting ‘America first’, or if he wants to put ‘Israel first’ by launching a disastrous war against Iran.

Some observers view the visit as a “message of displeasure” to the ruling PML-N, while others see it as preparation for early general elections.
Amid media reports suggesting the possible release of Mr Khan from jail, Mr Zardari’s aggressive tone is also being seen as an attempt to block such a move.
Although the president, as head of state, should remain apolitical, Mr Zardari has often acted otherwise. As the PPP supremo, he acts as a shield for the party against political odds and offensives.
Mr Zardari has just completed his visit to Punjab, where he stepped up his political engagements by holding several public meetings with PPP provincial leaders.
In a series of public addresses, he criticised Mr Khan, saying the jailed PTI leader should face imprisonment “like a man” and should not order his party leaders and workers to block roads. “He has served less than two years of imprisonment and is exhausted. In fact, [one realises what jail] actually is after two years of imprisonment,” he said. He added that leaders like Mr Khan had never made sacrifices and always made tall claims to [mislead] the public.

South Punjab’s visit sparks speculations of early polls

Political analysts believe these engagements are more than routine activities of a head of state and have some objectives behind them.
A senior PPP leader, who did not want to be named, said Mr Zardari’s remarks carried weight amid media reports that a deal was being struck between the PTI founder and the establishment for his early release.
However, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar rejected such reports on Thursday, stating on X that there was “neither any deal nor any leniency for Imran”.
He added that any impression of government concessions to the ex-premier was “entirely false and misleading”.







Mr Khan, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case. He was also convicted months ago in a case related to state gifts and faces pending trials linked to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The minister’s clarification followed remarks by Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah, who said efforts had been made to find a solution but Mr Khan was not ready for any “deal”.
The PPP leader suggested that Mr Zardari’s visit to Punjab and outburst against Mr Khan might have been intended to block any move for the PTI founder’s release.
“However, the remarks backfired, drawing strong criticism from the PTI’s social media brigade,” he added. He also said there was a strong possibility of early general elections and that Mr Zardari might be laying conducive groundwork for his son, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, for a key position in the next regime.
“Some political circles believe elections could be held by the end of this year or early next year. Mr Zardari may be trying to dent the PML-N in its Punjab stronghold.”
Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) president, Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, said sadly apolitical offices in the country — the presidency and governorships — have remained political.
“Not only the president but governors often prioritise party affiliations and safeguard their parties’ interests,” he said.
Although the PPP was part of the ruling set-up holding key offices such as the presidency, governorships and Senate chairmanship, he said, Mr Zardari’s visit to Punjab, a PML-N stronghold, was significant, particularly after his recent expression of mistrust in the government and his return of several parliamentary bills without assent.
“I think the president’s visit to Punjab is a message to the PML-N that the PPP is unhappy with government decisions and policies. The PPP has already complained that it was not taken on board in decision-making,” Mr Mehboob added.
A source close to Mr Zardari said politics could not be separated from his personality, as he simultaneously held the offices of president and PPP co-chairman. The source said there was no specific agenda behind the Punjab visit, adding that Mr Zardari only sought to strengthen the party in the province.
“The president is of the view that political activities usually remain slow during Ramazan and that is why he visited Punjab to meet party leaders and workers there.” He dismissed the possibility of early elections or Mr Khan’s release, saying Mr Zardari’s outburst was a response to remarks by some PTI leaders against his daughter, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari.
The source said the president was keen to strengthen the PPP in Punjab and reach out to other parties and groups.
“A recent statement by Jahangir Tareen (Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party leader), suggesting the PPP could be his next political destination after the [next] general elections, is ‘quite significant’,” he added.

Huckabee made the remarks in an interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson on Friday, where the envoy asserted that Israel’s borders are based on the Bible when questioned about the country’s current boundaries.
In response, Carlson noted that the biblical verse included the region between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile in Egypt. To this, Huckabee, who is a staunch pro-Israel conservative, said, “It would be fine if they (Israel) took it all”.
In a joint-statement issued today, the foreign ministers of countries including Pakistan, Egypt, Jordan, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Indonesia, Kuwait, Oman, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, along with the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the League of Arab States (LAS), and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), expressed “profound concern” regarding Huckabee’s statement.







“They affirm their countries’ categorical rejection of such dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region,” the statement said.
The joint statement stressed that Huckabee’s remarks were in contradiction of “the vision put forward by US President Donald Trump, as well as the Comprehensive Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, which are based on containing escalation and creating a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement that ensures the Palestinian people have their own independent state.”
It stressed that Trump’s plan was “grounded in promoting tolerance and peaceful coexistence, and that remarks seeking to legitimise control over the lands of others undermine these objectives, fuel tensions, and constitute incitement rather than advancing peace.”
The countries maintained that Israel held “no sovereignty whatsoever over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands”.
“They reiterated their firm rejection of any attempts to annex the West Bank or separate it from the Gaza Strip, their strong opposition to the expansion of settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and their categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states,” the statement read.
The ministers also warned against the “continuation of Israel’s expansionist policies,” stating that the “unlawful measures will only inflame violence and conflict in the region and undermine the prospects for peace”.
They called for “an end to these incendiary statements”.
The statement further underscored the countries’ “steadfast commitment to the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to self-determination and to the establishment of their independent state along the lines of June 4, 1967, and the end of the occupation of all Arab lands”.</p><small>2026-02-22 04:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/22090105f7a3347.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974907/denial-of-personal-doctors-to-imran-unconstitutional-kp-cm' target='_blank'><strong>Denial of personal doctors to Imran ‘unconstitutional’: KP CM</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakh­tun­­kh­­wa Chief Minister Muham­mad Sohail Afridi on Saturday said certain individuals were flouting and bulldozing the Constitution by denying incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan access to his personal physician, terming the demand neither unjust nor outside the jail manual.
“We held a peaceful sit-in for five days, but unfortunately some people behaved senselessly,” the chief minister said, adding that his party did not want to politicise the health of PTI founder Imran Khan; otherwise, it could have taken a different course of action.
Addressing a ceremony after administering the oath to the newly elected body of the Peshawar Press Club at the Chief Minister’s House, Mr Afridi said the world knew his party was the largest political force with the biggest street movement, yet its democratic protest was mishandled and Mr Khan was denied access to his personal physician.

 

“Mr Khan has sought a meeting with his personal doctors. Matters are moving in the wrong direction, and no one will be able to stop us if we give a call,” he said, adding that continued refusal to grant access would be dangerous for both the government and the country.

Claims peaceful five-day sit-in mishandled; warns continued refusal poses risks for govt and country

The CM claimed that when Mr Khan was prime minister, he allowed former premier Nawaz Sharif to travel abroad for medical treatment despite reservations abo­ut his medical reports, alleging that Mr Sharif later returned after three years.

 

He said that federal ministers had acknowledged Mr Khan’s eye condition and that the apex court had ordered proper treatment, which was never provided. He added that his leader had been shot yet was still summoned for court cases, while the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who had left the country, was facilitated with biometric verification at the airport.
Mr Afridi told media persons that his government welcomed constructive criticism, unlike other provinces where, he alleged, journalists were picked up over minor issues.
He added that he faced what he termed a media trial after allocating Rs4 billion for victims of Tirah Valley, while questioning why there was silence over the alleged purchase of an aircraft worth Rs11 billion by the Punjab government.
He claimed that while Pakistan was seeking IMF support to run its economy, alleged embezzlement of Rs5,300bn highlighted in reports had not received due attention.
Earlier, Special Assistant to the CM for Information and Public Relations Shafi Jan said journalism was a pillar of the state.
President-elect of the Peshawar Press Club, M. Riaz, said the club symbolised democratic values and human rights and held annual elections regularly.

UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar has cautioned that the deepening liquidity crisis at the United Nations is significantly undermining peacekeeping operations, reinforcing urgent concerns previously raised by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
Antonio Guterres earlier this month warned that the United Nations could face an “imminent financial collapse” unless member states pay their dues fully and on time, or reform budget rules that require the organization to return unspent funds despite cash shortages.
Ambassador Iftikhar speaking at the opening of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, said funding shortages are undermining mandate implementation, civilian protection, violence deterrence, and the safety of peacekeepers.
He stressed that UN peacekeeping remains vital to international peace and security but is facing mounting political, operational, and financial pressures that demand collective action.
Highlighting Pakistan’s longstanding role, he noted that the country hosts the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan and has been among the largest troop contributors for over six decades. He paid tribute to 182 fallen Pakistani peacekeepers and said more than 250,000 Pakistanis have served in 48 UN missions across four continents.
Meanwhile, Pakistan reaffirmed its opposition to adding new permanent members to the UN Security Council, arguing that doing so would increase the 15-member body’s dysfunction and violate the principle of sovereign equality.
Speaking at a resumed session of the long-running Intergovernmental Negotiations (IGN) aimed at reforming the Security Council, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, said that the demand for individual permanent membership runs counter to the agreed principles of reform.
As part of the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, he said Pakistan advocates expanding only non-permanent, elected seats to enhance democratic representation and ensure “reform for all, privilege for none.”
Full-scale negotiations to reform the Security Council began in the General Assembly in February 2009, focusing on five key areas: categories of membership, the question of the veto, regional representation, the size of an enlarged Council, and the Council’s working methods and relationship with the General Assembly.
Progress toward restructuring the Council remains blocked as the G-4 countries — India, Brazil, Germany, and Japan — continue to push for permanent seats, while the Italy/Pakistan-led UfC group opposes any additional permanent members. arguing that it would create “new centres of privilege”.
As a compromise, the UfC has proposed creating a new category of members — not permanent members — with longer terms and the possibility to re-election.
The Security Council currently comprises five permanent members — United Kingdom, China, France, Russia, and the United States — and 10 non-permanent members elected to two-year terms.
The IGN framework aims to make the Council more representative, effective, and accountable.
In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy emphasised that the campaign for individual permanent membership cannot serve as the basis for reform governed by agreed principles.
He said the overwhelming majority of UN member states recognize that permanent membership and the veto lie at the core of the Council’s paralysis and inaction over the years.
“For them, this is not a peripheral concern; it is the central fault line that undermines the Council’s credibility and effectiveness,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad said.
“At a time when the multilateral system is under extreme stress and there are calls for a UN that is fit for purpose, the demand for special privileges must have no place in these discussions.”
Highlighting Pakistan’s consistent position, he said, adding new permanent members would not neutralise the “inordinate” influence of the existing permanent members; rather, it would risk entrenching and expanding it.
“Two wrongs cannot make a right, and a larger oligarchy is no antidote to an elite power club,” the Pakistani envoy remarked.

Islamabad has shared “irrefutable and concrete evidence of Indian sponsorship of terrorism and terrorist groups operating in Pakistan from across our borders,” said Tahir Abdrabi, spokesperson for Pakistan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a recent press briefing.
The warning comes as Nikhil Gupta, an American citizen, formally stands convicted in a US federal court after a Manhattan judge accepted his guilty plea in a murder-for-hire conspiracy targeting Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, a Sikh activist living in New York.
The case carries a maximum prison exposure of 40 years.

Observers say conviction confirms Indian plot to kill Sikh activist, but it does not resolve broader diplomatic questions of ‘state responsibility’

Under US law, a conviction occurs once a judge accepts a guilty plea after determining it was made knowingly, voluntarily, and with a factual basis. In Gupta’s case, the finding of guilt is final; only sentencing remains. His hearing is scheduled for May 29, with prosecutors calculating an advisory sentencing range of 235 to 293 months (roughly 19 to 24 years).
Gupta admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. US officials have emphasised the broader implications.
A US Department of Justice state­­ment said the assassination plot was initiated by an Indian government employee, identified in reports as former Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) officer Vikash Yadav.
FBI Assistant Director James C. Barnacle, Jr., added that Gupta acted at the “direction and coordination of an Indian government employee,” facilitating a “foreign adversary’s unlawful effort to silence a vocal critic of the Indian government.”
When the case first appeared in the media in November 2023, then-Senator and Foreign Relations Committee Chair Ben Cardin described it as “a foiled assassination plot against a US citizen involving Indian government officials,” highlighting the need to examine how governments attempt to silence dissidents abroad.
While US lawmakers have not publicly commented on Gupta’s conviction, reports indicate interest in assessing whether the plot reflects a systemic pattern or a limited operation. Intelligence cooperation between Washington and New Delhi could see subtle recalibrations in sensitive channels, while the Trump administration is expected to use the case as a warning against extraterritorial targeting on American soil.
Diplomatic observers in Washington note that the case will likely influence “intelligence sharing, law-enforcement coordination, and visa or security vetting in sensitive areas,” rather than immediately prompting public sanctions or a breakdown in relations.
The case also remains linked to the 2023 killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada, an episode that strained Ottawa-New Delhi relations and drew attention from the United States and other Five Eyes partners. Together, the two incidents have positioned India in Western security discourse as a country accused of targeting dissidents abroad.
While Gupta’s conviction confirms the plot, it does not resolve broader diplomatic questions of state responsibility, the observers noted.
Those issues are expected to be addressed through intelligence channels, congressional oversight, and private diplomatic engagement — the quiet processes through which Washington balances law enforcement red lines with strategic partnerships central to its Asia policy.
In that sense, the case is no longer just about the criminal act itself, but about how the United States chooses to translate a conviction into long-term norms governing the conduct of both allies and adversaries.

TEHRAN: The Iranian government has demanded evidence after the US President Donald Trump told reporters that 32,000 people were killed during last month’s nationwide protests in the Islamic Republic, Al Jazeera reported on Saturday.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said the government released a list of 3,117 people, including about 200 security personnel, whom he described as “victims of recent terrorist operation”.
“If anyone disputes accuracy of our data, please share any evidence,” the diplomat, who has previously stated that 690 people on the list were “terrorists” armed and funded by the US and Israel, wrote on X.







His comments came as the threat of war looms increasingly large over the country and potentially the region, with Serbia on Saturday becoming the latest country to call on all its citizens to immediately leave Iran.
‘20,000 civilians’
Mai Sato, UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, has said more than 20,000 civilians may have been killed, but information remains limited amid heavy internet filtering by the state, six weeks after a nationwide communications blackout was imposed.
The US-based HRANA says it has documented more than 7,000 people killed during the nationwide protests, and is investigating nearly 12,000 more cases.
Sato was among 30 special rapporteurs and international human rights experts who signed a joint statement on Friday calling on Iranian authorities to fully disclose the fate and whereabouts of tens of thousands arrested, forcibly disappeared or missing in the aftermath of the nationwide protests, and to halt all related death sentences and executions.
‘Iran will not bow to pressure’
Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that his country would not bow its head to pressure from world powers amid nuclear talks with the United States, Reuters reported.
“World powers are lining up to force us to bow our heads … but we will not bow our heads despite all the problems that they are creating for us,” Pezeshkian said in a speech carried live by state TV.
On the other hand, the Iranian foreign minister has also been speaking with multiple US media outlets to advocate for a “fair” agreement with Washington over Iran’s nuclear programme.
The comments come after President Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran after ordering a major naval build-up in the Middle East aimed at pressuring Tehran to reach a deal to curb its nuclear programme.
The latest warning came after Iran’s foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready within days, following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week.
Trump had suggested on Thursday that “bad things” would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, a deadline he later extended to 15 days.
Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump replied: “The most I can say — I am considering it.”
As part of the military build-up, the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford was seen entering the Mediterranean Sea on Friday, transiting the Strait of Gibraltar, after being ordered to the region by Trump.
Washington had already deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln and escort warships to the Gulf in January.

The prime minister’s spe­cial aircraft touched down at Luton Airport, after which he travelled to his residence in the British capital.
Sources said he would remain in London for two days before leaving for Pakistan on Monday. He is accompanied on the visit by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Federal Information Minister Atta Tarar.
The premier had travelled to the United States at President Trump’s invitation to participate in the high-level gathering foc­u­sed on Gaza and broader peace efforts. Addressing the gathering in Washington, PM Shehbaz stressed the need to end ceasefire violations in Gaza, calling it “very important” for achieving long lasting peace in the war-torn territory. “The people of Palestine have long endured illegal occupation and immense suffering,” he said, adding that protecting lives and advancing reconstruction required strict adherence to the ceasefire.
He emphasised that Palestinians must exercise full control over their land and future in line with UN Security Council resolutions, and called for a credible pathway to self-determination through the establishment of an independent, sovereign and contiguous State of Palestine.
Earlier, Mr Tarar shared a video on social media in which President Trump praised PM Shehbaz and Field Marshal Asim Munir.

• Calls blocking ID cards as unreasonable as cutting off water or electricity
• Says courts shouldn’t curtail basic rights
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court ruled on Saturday that a judgement debtor’s Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) cannot be blocked as a mode of executing a money decree, declaring that such a practice is beyond the jurisdiction of executing courts.
A two-judge bench, headed by Justice Munib Akhtar and including Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, made the decision after hearing an appeal from Agha Abid Majeed Khan, who had challenged an Aug. 1, 2023, ruling by the Sindh High Court that rejected his plea.
In a three-page order authored by Justice Akhtar, the Supreme Court observed that a CNIC is not a luxury or a mere statutory requirement.
“In these times it has become essential to being able to carry on a normal way of life in the ordinary course,” the judgement said.
Petitioner Agha Abid was a judgement debtor in a summary chapter suit where a decree was passed in favour of respondent Idrees Ahmed. During execution proceedings initiated by the decree holder, the executing court ordered the blocking of Mr Abid’s CNIC until he furnished surety for the decretal amount.
Consequently, the petitioner approached the high court through a revision petition. It was dismissed on Aug 1, 2023, with an observation that blocking a CNIC was “a step towards execution of lawful orders”.
The lower court had noted that the litigation between the parties had been pending observation that blocking a CNIC was “a step towards execution of lawful orders”.
The lower court had noted that the litigation between the parties had been pending since 2012 and the judgement and decree had remained unexecutable since March 29, 2016.
However, the Supreme Court cautioned against a “muscular” approach, observing that Section 51 of the Code of Civil Procedure sets out different modes for executing a decree.
The final clause (e) allows the decree to be executed “in such other manner as the nature of the relief granted may require”. While this clause confers the necessary flexibility to enable the executing court to ensure that a decree is satisfied, the Supreme Court observed that it cannot obviously be stretched to the point where the order made in execution loses all contact with the statutory provision.
In the case at hand, the decree is simply a money decree on a summary chapter suit, Justice Akhtar noted, adding that the court was not at all satisfied that such a decree would require or make permissible execution by blocking the CNIC of the judgement debtor by resort to Section 51(e).
“One might as well then allow the executing court to order the blocking of utilities like electricity, water, etc., from the residence or workplace of a judgement debtor for execution of a money decree,” the judge observed.
While a robust approach should certainly be taken to ensure execution, it cannot be so muscular — especially in the exercise of a general power conferred by clause (e) — that it essentially deprives the judgement debtor of an essential aspect of living, the judgement continued.
To curtail a judgement debtor from this is not the proper exercise of discretion or statutory powers, as the high court erroneously concluded, Justice Akhtar emphasised.
During the hearing, an Additional Attorney General had drawn the attention of the court to a 2018 amendment in which Order 21, Rule 117 was added: “The modes of compelling the judgement debtor for his attendance or for completing the execution proceedings may include blockage of his CNIC.”
Justice Akhtar noted that the rule may apply in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa but not in Sindh, from where the present proceedings arose.
While concluding, the Supreme Court converted the petition into an appeal and allowed it while setting aside the orders of both the executing court and SHC.

Trump had immediately announced a 10pc  across-the-board tariff on Friday after the court’s decision, which found the president had exceeded his authority when he imposed an array of higher rates under an economic emergency law.
The new levies are grounded in a separate law, known as Section 122, that allows tariffs up to 15pc but requires congressional approval to extend them after 150 days.
Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday’s “extraordinarily anti-American decision” by the court to rein in his tariff programme, the administration was hiking the import levies “to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15pc level”.







“During the next short number of months, the Trump Administration will determine and issue the new and legally permissible Tariffs, which will continue our extraordinarily successful process of Making America Great Again — GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE,” he said in his post.
On Friday, the conservative-majority US Supreme Court ruled the emergency powers law — International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) — “does not authorise the President to impose tariffs”, marking Trump’s biggest defeat at the SC since returning to the White House last year.
While hard-hit Canada welcomed the ruling, pointing out the levies were always “unjustified”, other US trading partners, particularly European powers, were cautious in their response, with the United Kingdom, Germany and the European Union stating that they were in contact with the Trump administration and analysing the court decision “carefully”.
Trump has leveraged tariffs — taxes on imported goods — as a key economic and foreign policy tool. They have been central to a global trade war that Trump initiated after he began his second term as president, one that has alienated trading partners, affected financial markets and caused global economic uncertainty.
Trump’s tariffs were forecast to generate over the next decade trillions of dollars in revenue for the United States, which possesses the world’s largest economy.
However, Trump’s administration has not provided tariff collection data since Dec 14, 2025.</p><small>2026-02-21 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21205752247ce6d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974819/inaugural-board-of-peace-meeting-comes-under-discussion-during-call-between-dar-azerbaijan-foreign-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Inaugural Board of Peace meeting comes under discussion during call between Dar, Azerbaijan foreign minister</strong></a><br><p>The inaugural Board of Peace meeting came under discussion during a phone call between Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Azerbaijan’s Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov.
In a post on the social media platform X, the Foreign Office said DPM Dar spoke to Bayramov while in London.
“The two leaders discussed bilateral cooperation, regional and international developments, including the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington, which they both attended,” the FO said.







Both countries are among the founding members of the Board of Peace, which came together after the Trump administration, teaming up with Qatar and Egypt, negotiated a ceasefire in October to halt two years of devastating Israeli onslaught in Gaza.
The plan’s second phase calls for the disarmament of Hamas. US President Donald Trump on Thursday promised $10 billion and five Muslim-majority nations  — Morocco, Albania, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, and Kosovo — offered funding and troops for Gaza at the inaugural Board of Peace meeting in Washington.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the meeting had stressed the need for an end to ceasefire violations in Gaza, saying that it was “very important” for long-lasting peace in the war-torn Strip.</p><small>2026-02-21 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21192115b7ab6c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974812/england-captain-brook-says-a-shame-if-pakistan-players-snubbed-for-hundred-competition' target='_blank'><strong>England captain Brook says a ‘shame’ if Pakistan players snubbed for Hundred competition</strong></a><br><p>England captain Harry Brook said on Saturday that it would be “a shame” if Pakistani players were shut out of England’s domestic white-ball Hundred competition by Indian-owned franchises.
Former England skipper Michael Vaughan on Friday urged the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) to “act fast” on BBC reports that Pakistani players will be “overlooked” in the player auction next month.
Ahead of England’s opening Super Eights clash against Sri Lanka in Kandy on Sunday, Brook — who will play for Indian-owned Sunrisers Leeds in the Hundred this year — was asked about the issue.
“Our main focus now is what’s coming up in the T20 World Cup. It’s not really any of our business, to be honest,” said Brook.
“But what I would say is Pakistan have been a great cricket nation for many years.”
Long-standing political tensions between India and Pakistan have led to the border rivals only playing each other in international cricket events.
Their Colombo showdown at the ongoing T20 World Cup only went ahead after Pakistan called off a threatened boycott.
“I think there’s about 50, 60 players in the auction, and it would be a shame to not see some of them in there,” said Brook.
“There’s some amazing cricketers and, yeah, and they bring some great crowds as well.
“So it would be a shame to not see some of the Pakistan players in there and make the tournament and competition even better.”
The newly renamed Sunrisers Leeds is owned by Indian conglomerate Sun Group, one of the four of the eight Hundred franchises with connections to the Indian Premier League (IPL).
The others are Manchester Super Giants, Southern Brave and MI London.
It has been claimed that politics has also led to an effective ban on Pakistani players participating in the Indian Premier League since 2009.
The ECB has been unable to substantiate the BBC allegations, but former England captain Vaughan called for the governing body to investigate the issue thoroughly.
Vaughan referred to the ECB’s stated aim of cricket becoming the most inclusive sport in the country.
“The ECB need to act fast on this… they own the league and this should not be allowed to happen… the most inclusive sport in the country is not one that allows this to happen,” Vaughan posted on X.







An ECB spokesman said: “The Hundred welcomes men’s and women’s players from all over the world and we would expect the eight teams to reflect that.”
Only two Pakistan internationals — Mohammad Amir and Imad Wasim — appeared in last year’s Hundred, the final edition before new investors became involved.</p><small>2026-02-21 15:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21161650de6ed87.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974792/ctd-claims-arrest-of-suspected-female-suicide-bomber-in-di-khan-operation' target='_blank'><strong>CTD claims arrest of suspected female suicide bomber in DI Khan operation</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) police claimed to have averted a major incident after arresting a suspected female suicide bomber during a raid in the Sheikh Yousaf Khema Basti area of Dera Ismail Khan, officials said on Saturday.
According to a CTD spokesperson, the Dera region received intelligence regarding the presence of a young woman allegedly linked to a banned outfit and preparing for a suicide attack. Acting on the tip-off, a Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team conducted a raid at the specified location.
Officials said the suspect, identified only by the initial “Z”, was taken into custody after preliminary questioning. During interrogation, she allegedly disclosed that she had remained under the training of a militant commander, identified as Shah Wali alias Tariq Kochi, who is reportedly deceased.
The suspect further claimed that she had recently consented to carry out a suicide attack and that a suicide vest and target were to be provided by another militant commander identified as Asim, police said.
During the search, officials recovered a bag containing a pistol with ammunition, two mobile phones allegedly used for contact with members of the banned organisation, a power bank, and other items.
Police also claimed that a perfume bottle was recovered, allegedly intended to mask the smell of explosives.
The suspect has been formally arrested and shifted for further investigation.
Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zulfiqar Hameed commended the CTD team for the operation and announced a cash reward for the officials involved.
Further investigation is underway to verify the suspect’s claims and trace her alleged handlers.
“Across the province, indiscriminate operations will continue to crush terrorists’ evil intentions, prevent all forms of terrorism, and ensure full implementation of a zero-tolerance policy against anti-state elements,” said the CTD statement.
Last week, four police personnel, including an SHO, embraced martyrdom and two officials sustained injuries in a terrorist ambush in the district.
On January 23, five people, including a peace committee leader, were killed, while 10 others were injured in an explosion — said to be a suicide attack — during a wedding ceremony in DI Khan district.</p><small>2026-02-21 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2119435824040d7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974811/kidnapping-case-registered-against-unidentified-suspects-after-canadian-national-reportedly-goes-missing-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Kidnapping case registered against unidentified suspects after Canadian national reportedly goes missing in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Police on Saturday registered a kidnapping case against unidentified suspects after a Canadian national pursuing doctoral research allegedly went missing in Lahore three days ago.
A police station in Defence Housing Authority registered the case under kidnapping charges on the complaint of Yousif Rasheed, a friend of the Canadian citizen who has been identified as Hamza Ahmad.
According to the first information report (FIR), Ahmad arrived in Pakistan on February 13 to work on his PhD thesis and was staying with his friend in DHA Phase 10.
The complainant stated that Ahmad had booked a cab and left the home between 1am and 2am on February 19 but did not return. He said that the friends searched for Ahmad on their own but were unable to trace his whereabouts.
The FIR stated that unknown persons may have kidnapped Ahmed, requesting legal action against those responsible.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran confirmed to Dawn that a kidnapping case had been registered against unidentified suspects and that efforts were under way to recover the Canadian national.
“At this stage, we do not know who might have kidnapped Ahmad or whether he went missing under other circumstances,” the DIG said, adding that police were making all-out efforts to trace him.
He said the motive behind the alleged kidnapping was also unknown, adding the investigation was ongoing and that further developments would be shared as the search progressed.
Meanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) expressed grave concern over the incident.
In a post on X, the commission stated that it was deeply troubled by reports that Ahmed had “gone missing” while conducting “field research” in Pakistan.
“Colleagues in Lahore have alleged that he was abducted by unidentified persons on February 19,” it said.







The commission urged authorities to “immediately” trace his whereabouts and ensure his safe recovery and return home.
Academics, political activists and social media users also expressed concerns over the alleged abduction.
In a social media post on X, political activist Ammar Ali Jan stated that he had recently met Ahmad in Lahore.







He described him as a PhD scholar from Canada working on anti-imperialist politics and said, “Yesterday, Hamza was abducted in Lahore. This regime is waging a relentless attack on dissent.”
The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also commented on the matter on X, saying that “the right to pursue academic research and express scholarly views is fundamental in a democratic society”.
It added that “silencing researchers through harassment or forced absence undermines intellectual freedom and weakens institutions”, and that Ahmad “deserves fairness, safety, and the opportunity to continue his academic work without fear”.</p><small>2026-02-21 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652176-sindh-assembly-adopts-resolution-against-creation-of-karachi-province' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh Assembly adopts resolution against creation of 'Karachi province'</strong></a><br><p>

The resolution, tabled by CM Murad and passed with a majority, stated that the House “unequivocally condemns and rejects any conspiracy aimed at the division of Sindh or the creation of a separate province comprising Karachi”.
“Karachi is, and shall forever remain, an integral and inseparable part of Sindh,” it declared.
The chief minister’s move comes after the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has repeatedly called for the Centre’s intervention in Karachi, demanding that the metropolis be made a “federal territory”.



The resolution urged “all political stakeholders to refrain from divisive rhetoric or actions that threaten provincial harmony and national cohesion”.
It reaffirmed that the “unity, territorial integrity, and historic identity of Sindh are sacred trusts inherited from our forefathers and shall be defended through constitutional, democratic, and political means”.
The resolution stated that the Sindh Assembly stood “united — beyond party lines — in defence of Sindh’s integrity, dignity, and unbroken legacy”.
Lone Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) MPA Muhammad Farooq, and PTI’s Shabbir Qureshi and Sajjad Soomro supported the resolution, while MQM-P leaders voted against it.
In their speeches, the MQM-P members contended that the resolution contradicted the Constitution.
The MQM-P and the PPP have been engaged in a war of words since the deadly Gul Plaza inferno, trading blame over improper governance during the tenure of their respective party mayors.
Earlier this week, MQM-P’s Mustafa Kamal — also the federal health minister — criticised the provincial administration for what he described as systemic neglect of Karachi’s residents.
Responding to the opposition’s debate regarding the resolution, CM Murad categorically rejected claims that the resolution was unconstitutional, challenging opponents to identify even a single point that violated the law.
He pointed out the “shifting” stance of the MQM-P, recalling that the House had passed a similar unanimous resolution against the division of Sindh in 2019, and at that time, MQM-P stood in support.
“The members of MQM cannot play on both sides of the fence,” he remarked.
On the opposition’s grievance regarding mentions of the governor, the chief minister clarified that the resolution itself did not mention the governor by name.
“If a member takes the governor’s name, you may expunge it from the proceedings; it has nothing to do with the resolution,” Murad stated. However, he noted that a meeting regarding such matters did indeed take place at the Governor’s House.
Rejecting the opposition’s claim that they “smell something fishy” behind the resolution, the Sindh CM retorted, “You say you smell something [fishy], but I smell something from your conduct.”
Murad condemns ‘division’ rhetoric
Speaking on the floor of the assembly after tabling the resolution, CM Murad said no one could divide Karachi or separate it from Sindh.
“Karachi is an inseparable part of Sindh,” the chief minister added.
He affirmed that the Sindh Assembly would uphold provincial unity and solidarity, as well as protect the province.







Referring to opinions suggesting Karachi be made into a province separate from Sindh, CM Murad said: “I condemn all these statements.”
The chief minister contended that the “enemies” of Pakistan had launched a campaign to divide the country’s people. “Whoever believes in Pakistan will support this resolution,” he said.
The chief minister noted it was for the two-thirds majority of the Sindh Assembly to decide if any move to create a new province was attempted.
He also invoked the slogan “Pakistan Khappay”, raised by Asif Ali Zardari, emphasising that the PPP stands for national unity and federalism.
“PPP will never go against Pakistan’s integrity. It is you who speak of dividing Pakistan,” he said in a pointed rebuttal to critics.
He recalled that a similar resolution had been passed by the Sindh Assembly in 1994, emphasising that this was “not the first time” the province had resisted attempts to undermine its unity.
He pointed out that when Karachi was declared the capital in 1948, the country did not yet have a constitution, arguing that constitutional clarity today leaves no room for “unilateral” decisions.







Without naming any political party, Murad said the resolution targeted no individual but urged members to read it carefully and raise objections, if any, through democratic debate.
“Opposing this resolution would amount to supporting the division of Sindh,” he remarked.
Concluding his speech, CM Murad declared: “Even the thought, dream or idea of breaking Sindh will never succeed.”
‘Sindh has collectively contributed to building Karachi’
The resolution detailed Sindh’s history as a province, including it being the first province to “pass the resolution in favour of Pakistan, reflecting its longstanding commitment to federalism, democracy, and national unity”.
It highlighted that the framers of the 1973 Constitution “reaffirmed the federal structure of the country and explicitly provided under Article 239 that no alteration of provincial boundaries shall take place without the consent of more than two-third members of the concerned provincial assembly”.
“The sons and daughters of Sindh — from Karachi to Ketibundar, from Kashmore to Karoonjhar — have collectively contributed to building Karachi into the economic engine of Pakistan, symbolising unity in diversity rather than division,” the resolution noted.

 

It pointed out: “Karachi, historically known as Kolachi, emerged from the soil of Sindh and evolved as its principal port, commercial heart, and gateway to the world — nurtured by the land, labour, and collective spirit of the people of Sindh — and despite serving as the first capital of Pakistan after independence in 1947, remained geographically, historically, and emotionally inseparable from Sindh.”
The resolution cautioned, “Any attempt to divide Sindh, fragment its territory, or detach Karachi from Sindh is contrary to history, constitutional spirit, democratic norms and the deeply held sentiments of the people of Sindh, and would undermine national cohesion and the federal compact.”
It recalled that the people of Sindh resisted the imposition of the One Unit scheme in 1955, which dissolved historic provinces into an artificial administrative structure, and that the “restoration of Sindh in 1970 stands as enduring testimony to the unwavering resolve of its people to safeguard their province”.

 

Noting that Sindh was one of the world’s oldest living civilisations, the resolution highlighted that it was a province “whose identity, language, and cultural continuity predate modern political boundaries and have endured invasions, empires, and colonial rule”.</p><small>2026-02-21 14:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21150325b5ef91b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974789/lieutenant-colonel-among-two-army-personnel-martyred-in-bannu-suicide-attack-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Lieutenant colonel among two army personnel martyred in Bannu suicide attack: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>A lieutenant colonel and a sepoy were martyred in a suicide attack during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district on Saturday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
In a press release, ISPR said a security forces’ convoy was “targeted by Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij” while an IBO was being conducted on the reported presence of terrorists, including a suicide bomber.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
The military’s media wing added that five terrorists were also killed during the operation.
“A vehicle-borne suicide bomber was intercepted by the leading group, foiling his nefarious design to target innocent civilians/law enforcement personnel in Bannu City, averting major catastrophe,” the ISPR stated.
It added that the terrorists were located during the operation and after an “intense fire exchange, five khwarij were sent to hell by the security forces”.
The statement added: “However, in desperation, khwarij rammed the explosive-laden vehicle into one of the vehicles of the leading group.”
Resultantly, 43-year-old Lt Colonel Shahzada Gul Faraz, hailing from Mansehra, whom the ISPR described as a “brave commanding officer renowned for his daring actions, who was leading his troops from the front”, and 28-year-old Sepoy Karamat Shah from Peshawar, embraced martyrdom.
In its statement, the military reiterated that terrorists were “using Afghan soil” for carrying out attacks inside Pakistan, “violating the sanctity of the holy month of Ramazan”.
“This clearly indicates that they have no link with Islam,” the ISPR declared.

 

It also noted that the “Afghan Taliban Regime has yet again failed to stop the khwarij from use of Afghan soil for terrorist activities inside Pakistan, that too in the holy month of Ramazan”.
“Pakistan will not exercise any restrain and operations would continue against the perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act for justified retribution against khwarij, irrespective of their location,” the ISPR asserted.
The military’s media wing added that the counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan “will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
“Such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further reinforce our unwavering commitment [to] safeguarding our nation at all costs,” the military affirmed.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in separate statements, strongly condemned the “cowardly terrorist attack” and expressed grief over the martyrdoms.
“The supreme sacrifice of the martyrs is the nation’s asset,” President Zardari was quoted as saying.
Conveying his condolences to the martyrs’ families, the president said: “We aim to continue the operations against Fitna al Khawarij indiscriminately and with full force. There will be no compromise on the public’s protection.”
“The terrorists violating the sanctity of the month of Ramazan have no relation with Islam,” he added.







Similarly, in his statement reported by state-run APP, PM Shehbaz stressed that the terrorist act carried out by Fitna al Khawarij during Ramazan was “proof that terrorists had no religion”.
The prime minister commended the security forces for “foiling the nefarious designs of Fitna al Khwarij” by eliminating five terrorists, acting swiftly, and “saving the city from major destruction”.
Noting the security forces were achieving “major success” under the Azm-i-Istehkam vision, the premier reaffirmed that the state was determined to completely eradicate all forms of terrorism from the country.
Concerns over usage of Afghan soil amid terrorism resurgence
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned TTP broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
The Bannu district has been the scene of repeated security incidents in recent months, with both civilians and local security actors coming under attack, prompting targeted operations.
Islamabad has also raised concerns over the presence of TTP terrorists in Afghanistan, maintaining that they have been involved in attacks inside Pakistan.

 

It has repeatedly urged Kabul to take action to prevent these attacks.
Earlier this week, Pakistan issued a demarche to the Taliban regime over the use of Afghan soil for a terrorist attack on security forces in KP’s Bajaur that martyred 11 soldiers.
Pakistan had also issued a demarche to Afghanistan in late December, over its failure to rein in terrorist organisations ope­r­ating from Afghan soil, after a deadly attack on a military camp in North Waziristan.</p><small>2026-02-21 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2111362379ff111.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974778/youth-abducted-released-after-filming-viral-cricket-video-of-aina-wazir-in-north-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Youth abducted, released after filming viral cricket video of Aina Wazir in North Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>PESHAWAR: A youth from North Waziristan who was reportedly abducted by unidentified individuals for sharing a viral video showing a young girl playing cricket in the region was released, it emerged on Saturday.
A viral video showing young cricketer Aina Wazir bowling in North Waziristan drew widespread attention on mainstream and social media. However, the abduction of the young man who filmed and shared the clip on social media triggered concern across the region.
According to local police, the man, Zafran Wazir, was allegedly abducted by unidentified individuals from the Shewa subdivision of the district.
During his captivity, a video circulated on social media in which he termed sharing the cricket clip his “mistake” and stated that he was in the custody of unknown persons.
In the same video, the abductors claimed that recording and circulating footage of a minor girl playing cricket was “against Islam and Pashtun traditions”.
Following efforts by local tribal elders through a jirga, Zafran was safely recovered and returned home. Residents welcomed him warmly, placing garlands around his neck, with videos of the reception also circulating online.
District Police Officer (DPO) Sajjad Hussain confirmed that the youth had safely reunited with his family and said investigations into the incident were underway.
Eight-year-old Aina’s passion for cricket had already been a subject of discussion in the region. Her viral video caught the attention of the owner of the Pakistan Super League franchise Peshawar Zalmi, Javed Afridi, who said that “talent like this deserves the right platform”.
In a post on X, Afridi said that she would be part of the upcoming Zalmi Women League — a platform for girls to “play, inspire, and express their talents”.
“We will ensure she is provided with all necessary cricket equipment and proper facilities so she gets the opportunity she truly deserves to grow and shine and become the next Saira Jabeen,” he said.







The video had also captured the attention of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, who said on X, “It is truly heartening to witness such extraordinary raw talent emerging from our soil, a powerful reminder of the immense potential within our youth.”
He said he hoped to see Aina receive the encouragement, training, and institutional support she deserved so her talent “can be fully refined”.







Aina, in response, pledged to work hard to play for the women’s cricket team and expressed special gratitude to Afridi for including her in the Zalmi Women League, calling it the “biggest moment” of her life.</p><small>2026-02-21 12:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211711408edae2d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974797/pakistan-us-express-desire-to-enhance-economic-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, US express desire to enhance economic cooperation</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the United States on Saturday expressed the desire to enhance economic cooperation, especially in the fields of trade and investment, according to the finance ministry.

It said that finance minister was accompanied by the commerce secretary, Pakistan’s ambassador to US, and trade and economic ministers.
“Both sides expressed the desire to enhance our economic cooperation, especially in the fields of trade and investment, besides discussing the USA’s interest in investing in fields of information and communication technology, mining, minerals and energy,” the ministry said.







According to the ministry, Aurangzeb appreciated the role of the US Chamber of Commerce in organising the US-Pakistan Trade and Investment Forum, which will take place on March 31 and will be attended by renowned companies and ministerial representation from both countries.
He expressed the hope that the office of the US commerce secretary would also participate in the forum, the ministry said.
“Both sides reiterated their commitment to further their engagements on investments in major projects in the coming months,” it concluded.

The case was registered on Nov 9, 2025, by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016, following allegations that the KP CM made false and defamatory claims against state institutions.
This is the fourth time the court has issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the KP chief minister in this case, with two issued in January and another on February 10.
As during a previous hearing, Senior Civil Judge Muhammad Abbas Shah today ordered the immediate arrest and production of CM Afridi, noting that the latter had consistently ignored multiple summons and remained absent without any lawful justification.
The court then adjourned the hearing until March 9.
During the January 28 hearing, the court had termed Afridi’s persistent non-appearance a deliberate attempt to evade the legal process and emphasised that he had been given multiple opportunities to appear and respond to the allegations.
According to the first information report (FIR), the case stems from remarks made by CM Afridi during a media interaction outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail three days prior.
He had allegedly accused security forces of bringing dogs inside mosques in KP and tying them there — an accusation widely condemned for allegedly violating the sanctity of holy places.

 

Following an inquiry conducted on November 8, authorities concluded that CM Afridi and others had “knowingly and deliberately, with mala fide intentions and ulterior motives”, made false, misleading, and intimidating statements against state institutions.
The FIR contended that the video contained “offensive, profane, false, misleading and unfounded allegations” intended to malign and defame state institutions and harm their reputation.
Investigators had alleged that the content formed part of an organised campaign to undermine public trust in state institutions, incite unrest, promote racial hatred and destabilise national security.
The investigating team has further accused Afridi of preparing and circulating fake content on social media with the intention to incite violence, create panic and promote anti-state sentiments deemed harmful to Pakistan’s security and stability.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/21162629cb7c4d0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974794/india-brazil-ink-critical-minerals-deal-as-modi-lula-meet-in-new-delhi' target='_blank'><strong>India, Brazil ink critical minerals deal as Modi, Lula meet in New Delhi</strong></a><br><p>India and Brazil agreed to boost cooperation on critical minerals and rare earths on Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said after talks in New Delhi with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
“The agreement on critical minerals and rare earths [is] a major step towards building resilient supply chains,” Modi said.
Brazil has the world’s second-largest reserves of critical minerals, which are used in everything from electric vehicles, solar panels and smartphones to jet engines and guided missiles.
India, seeking to cut its dependence on top exporter China, has been expanding domestic production and recycling while scouting for new suppliers.







“Increasing investments and cooperation in matters of renewable energies and critical minerals is at the core of the pioneering agreement that we have signed today,” Lula said.
The details of the deal were not immediately available.
Nine other agreements and memoranda of understanding were finalised on Saturday, the foreign ministry’s spokesman said, touching on digital cooperation, health, entrepreneurship and other fields.
“Brazil is India’s largest trade partner in Latin America. We are committed to taking our bilateral trade beyond $20 billion in the coming five years,” Modi said.
“Our trade is not just a figure, but a reflection of trust.”







Lula, who arrived in New Delhi on Wednesday for a summit on artificial intelligence, is accompanied by a delegation of more than a dozen ministers as well as business leaders.
On Saturday, he was given a ceremonial welcome and paid his tributes to India’s independence hero Mahatma Gandhi, before going into the meeting with Modi.



With China holding a near-monopoly on rare earths production, some countries are seeking alternative sources.
Rishabh Jain, an expert with the Delhi-based Council on Energy, Environment and Water think tank, said India’s growing cooperation with Brazil on critical minerals complements recent supply chain engagements with the United States, France and the European Union.
While these partnerships grant India access to advanced technologies, finance and high-end processing capabilities, “Global South alliances are critical for securing diversified, on-ground resource access and shaping emerging rules of global trade”, Jain told AFP.

‘New momentum’
India, the world’s most populous nation, is the 10th largest market for Brazilian exports, with bilateral trade topping $15 billion in 2025.
Key Brazilian exports to India include sugar, crude oil, vegetable oils, cotton and iron ore.
Demand for iron ore has been driven by rapid infrastructure expansion and industrial growth in India, which is on track to become the world’s fourth-largest economy.
India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said he was confident that Lula’s talks with Modi “will impart a new momentum to our ties”.







Modi said that “our cooperation in the defence sector is also continuously growing,” hailing a “win-win partnership”.
“When India and Brazil work together, the voice of Global South becomes stronger and more confident.”
Brazilian firms are also expanding in the country, with Embraer and Adani Group announcing plans last month to build aircraft in India.
Lula addressed the AI Impact summit in Delhi on Thursday, calling for a multilateral and inclusive global governance framework for artificial intelligence.
He will travel on to South Korea for meetings with President Lee Jae Myung and to attend a business forum.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/211511223ad8da0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1974790/us-ambassador-says-it-would-be-fine-if-israel-takes-over-large-swathes-of-middle-east' target='_blank'><strong>US ambassador says it ‘would be fine’ if Israel takes over large swathes of Middle East</strong></a><br><p>The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said that he would not be opposed to Tel Aviv taking over large swathes of the Middle East, reported Al-Jazeera.
Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, is a staunch pro-Israel conservative.
In a Friday interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the envoy asserted that Israel’s borders are based on the Bible when questioned about the country’s current boundaries.
Carlson noted that the biblical verse includes the region between the Euphrates River in Iraq and the Nile in Egypt.
“It would be fine if they took it all,” said Huckabee, who was appointed by President Donald Trump last year.







Carlson, clearly surprised, questioned Huckabee on whether he truly endorsed Israel’s expansion across the entire region.
“They don’t want to take it over. They’re not asking to take it over,” the ambassador replied.
The US envoy then appeared to downplay his comments, describing them as “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement,” while still allowing for the possibility of Israeli expansion according to his religious view.
“If they end up getting attacked by all these places, and they win that war, and they take that land, OK, that’s a whole other discussion,” Huckabee said further.
The ambassador is not a stranger to controversy. In June 2025, he said he does not think an independent Palestinian state remains a US foreign policy goal, prompting the State Department to say he spoke for himself, Reuters reported.
Asked whether Huckabee’s remarks represented a change in US policy, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce declined to comment, saying policy-making was a matter for Trump and the White House.
“Unless there are some significant things that happen that change the culture, there’s no room for it,” Huckabee was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. Those probably won’t happen “in our lifetime,” he said.
Huckabee suggested a piece of land could be carved out of a Muslim country rather than asking Israel to make room. “Does it have to be in Judea and Samaria?” Huckabee said, using the biblical name the Israeli government favors for the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where some 3 million Palestinians live.
In 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories is illegal and must cease immediately.</p><small>2026-02-21 11:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652132-lt-col-among-two-martyred-five-terrorists-killed-in-bannu-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Lt Col among two security personnel martyred in Bannu IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The LHC’s Rawalpindi Bench gave this ruling while dismissing a petition filed by Fauji Foundation’s educational entity Foundation University. The plea challenged the deduction of Zakat from its investments in National Saving Certificates.
The bench, led by Justice Jawad Hassan, held that the university does not qualify for exemption as a charitable institution under the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance 1980.
Justice Hassan ruled that the university, despite being established under the Foundation University Ordinance 2002 and sponsored by the Fauji Foundation, functions as an independent body corporate with financial autonomy, making it liable to compulsory Zakat deduction.

 

The university had approached the court through counsel Sayyid Murtaza Ali Pirzada, seeking to set aside a letter issued by the Ministry of Religious Affairs on April 24, 2018, which held the institution liable to pay Zakat on its investments.
The petitioner argued that as the university was sponsored by Fauji Foundation — a trust established under the Charitable Endowment Act 1890 — and reinvested its surplus funds to provide quality education, it should be exempt from Zakat.
Assistant Attorney General (AAG) Barrister Zain Mansoor, who appeared on the state’s behalf, opposed the petition, contending that the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance contains a comprehensive mechanism defining assets and institutions liable to Zakat.
He argued that the university’s statutory status neither exempts it from the operation of the law nor alters the character of its accounts attracting Zakat.
The court observed that Section 3(2) of the Foundation University Ordinance 2002 explicitly defines the university as a “body corporate” with perpetual succession and power to acquire, hold and dispose of property.

 

Justice Hassan noted that such attributes establish the university as an independent juristic person, separate from the federal or provincial government.
“The preamble to the statute situates the establishment of the petitioner university within the broader framework of national interest, but that alone does not confer charitable status for fiscal purposes,” the judgment stated.
The court further examined the university’s powers under its governing statute, which include the authority to enter into agreements, charge fees, create posts, appoint staff and invest funds.
“The university operates on a revenue-generating model rather than a pure charitable basis. Though chartered and sponsored by Fauji Foundation, the record of the Higher Education Commission unequivocally classifies it as a private sector university,” the judgment noted.
Referring to Section 1(2) of the Zakat Ordinance, the court held that any company, association of persons, or body of individuals — whether incorporated or not — with majority shares owned by Muslim citizens of Pakistan, is liable to Zakat.
The court further observed that the university, as a body corporate, squarely falls within the definition of “person” under the ordinance.
The judgment extensively relied on Supreme Court precedents, including Liaqat National Hospital versus Province of Sindh, which held that registration under a charitable law does not automatically confer tax exemption, and institutions charging fees while providing some charity operate with a duality of function, irreconcilable with exclusivity demanded by fiscal statutes.
The court also considered Pakistan Telecommunication Employees Trust versus Federation of Pakistan, which laid down a two-limbed test requiring registration as a charitable organisation and approval by revenue authorities for exemption.

 

Justice Hassan noted that despite repeated directions issued on Dec 8, 2020, Feb 17, 2022, April 4, 2024, and Nov 19, 2024, the university failed to place on record any document establishing its status as a charitable institution or pointing to any specific provision granting exemption from Zakat liability.
The court also rejected the petitioner’s reliance on Administrator General Zakat versus Pakistan Insurance Corporation, distinguishing it on facts as that case involved a statutory corporation wholly owned by the federal government, unlike Foundation University, which operates independently.
Amicus Curiae Nisar A Mujahid, appointed by the court to assist in the matter, submitted that the university does not qualify as a charitable institution under the ordinance, as educational advancement alone does not confer charitable status without fulfilment of statutory conditions.
“The petitioner university has failed to demonstrate any illegality in the impugned letter warranting interference by this court in its constitutional jurisdiction,” the judgment concluded, dismissing the petition with no order as to costs.
The verdict upholds the compulsory Zakat deduction from the university’s investments in National Saving Certificates, affirming the position taken by the Ministry of Religious Affairs.</p><small>2026-02-21 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652096-peer-muhammad-shah-posted-as-karachi-traffic-police-chief-again' target='_blank'><strong>Peer Muhammad Shah posted as Karachi traffic police chief again</strong></a><br><p>
