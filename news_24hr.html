In its July 12, 2024 short order, eight out of 13 judges ruled that roughly half out of a list of 80 MNAs were and are the returned candidates of the PTI, setting it to emerge as the single largest party in the National Assembly.
However, the ruling had not been implemented as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had not notified the changes given its objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
 
 

As the full-strength 13-member CB led by Justice Aminuddin Khan took up the review pleas today, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi objected to them, declaring the applications as inadmissible.
The other 10 members of the bench were Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhter Afghan, Shahid Bilal Hassan, Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Salahuddin Panhwar, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi.
Five of the eight judges who ruled in PTI’s favour — namely senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Athar Minallah, Justice Shahid Waheed and Justice Irfan Saadat Khan — are not part of the CB.
While Justices Mazhar, Ayesha and Rizvi were part of that majority verdict, Justices Aminuddin and Afghan had rejected the PTI’s pleas, denying it the reserved seats.
Haris Azmat appeared as the counsel for the PML-N while Sikandar Bashir Mohmand was present on behalf of the ECP.
While the CB formally accepted the review petitions for hearing, Justices Ayesha and Abbasi dissented with the majority decision, objecting to the maintainability of the pleas.
With a split majority of 11-2, the bench issued notices to the parties in the case and adjourned the hearing till tomorrow (Wednesday).
It also stated that a contempt plea filed by PTI’s Kanwal Shauzab against the ECP for not implementing the SC’s July 12 ruling would be clubbed with the review pleas.
 
 

In its review application, the ECP submitted that the July 12 short order was based on the law that has since been altered by the amendments made to Sections 66 and 104 of the Elections Act and a new section, namely 104-A, has also been inserted with retrospective effect.
It requested the SC to revisit its judgement in the reserved seat case that granted relief to the PTI, saying it was neither a political party nor individuals claiming to be its candidates had ever approached the ECP, Peshawar High Court or the apex court to claim the reserved seats.
In its detailed verdict on the reserved seats case, which was authored by senior puisne judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, the SC had observed that the
ECP’s numerous “unlawful acts and omissions” had “caused confusion and prejudice to PTI, its candidates and the electorate who voted for PTI”.
It had also castigated the ECP for failing to fulfil its “role as a guarantor institution and impartial steward” of electoral processes.
On Sept 14, 2024 — the day the government was supposed to lay the 26th Amendment in both Houses of the parliament but could not — the Supreme Court, through a clarification, had reprimanded the ECP for not implementing its July 12 ruling in the reserved seats case.
Later on October 18, in yet another clarification, Justice Shah reiterated that the effect of an amendment made in the Elections Act 2017 in August last year could not undo the reserved seats case verdict.
 
 

The bill, titled “Elections (Second Amendment) Act, 2024”, was seen as aimed at circumventing the apex court’s verdict on the reserved seats case by barring independent lawmakers from joining a political party after a stipulated period.
A six-judge CB of the apex court was set to take up the PTI’s petition challenging those tweaks to the election laws in December 2024. A separate plea of the PTI against the Jan 13, 2024 ruling denying it its election symbol is also pending before the SC.
‘Clear error in verdict must be identified for review plea to be taken up’
Earlier today, a three-member bench of the SC observed that a “clear error” in an original verdict must be identified for a review petition to be accepted for hearing.
The ruling came as the bench — led by Justice Shah and comprising Justices Mazhar and Hassan — took up a set of civil review petitions against a PHC ruling which had dismissed challenges brought by candidates who had been denied appointments as primary school teachers.
 
 

Justices Mazhar and Hasan are part of the CB that has taken up the review pleas against the SC’s ruling on the reserved seats case.
The judgment, authored by Justice Shah, stated that a review could be sought only under Article 188 of the Constitution, which empowers the SC to review any judgment pronounced or order made by it, or under the Supreme Court Rules of 1980.
Citing the Code of Civil Procedure 1908, the order stressed that “some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record” was one of the situations where a review may be sought.
Acknowledging that the phrase “cannot be defined with precision”, Justice Shah declared that the error “must be self-evident, immediately apparent, and not require extensive discussion or reasoning”.
The power of review was “not an open invitation to revisit judgements merely on the basis of dissatisfaction with the outcome”, the judge emphasised.
 
 

“A decision, order, or judgment cannot be corrected simply because it is erroneous in law, or because a different view could have been taken by the court or tribunal on a point of law or fact,” he noted.
“Frivolous claims serve no purpose other than to waste the court’s
time and resources,” the order stated, clarifying that the power of review should not be confused with the appellate power.
Noting that there were over 2.2 million cases currently pending before courts across Pakistan, including approximately 56,635 before the SC, the ruling pointed out that “frivolous, vexatious and speculative litigation contributes
substantially to this backlog”.

The move comes after Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour Party was punished in local elections in England last week by voters angry over issues, including illegal immigration.
The government is expected next week to publish a policy document, known as a white paper, which will set out how the government plans to reduce net migration, which reached 728,000 people in the year to June last year.
“Our upcoming Immigration White Paper will set out a comprehensive plan to restore order to our broken immigration system,” the Home Office said in a statement.
High levels of legal migration have long dominated Britain’s political conversation and were one of the major drivers for the Brexit referendum in 2016.
Out of the 108,000 people who claimed asylum in Britain last year, 16,000 had student visas, government data shows. The government does not provide a breakdown of the nationalities of those who had student visas, who went on to claim asylum.
 
 

But the government said people from Pakistan, Nigeria and Sri Lanka were the most likely to claim asylum in Britain after arriving on a work, student, or a visitor visa.
In the aftermath of the party’s poor local election results last week, some Labour members of parliament urged the government to do more to take a more decisive approach on issues such as bringing down net migration.
Jo White, who represents a group of lawmakers in previously Labour heartlands known as the “Red Wall”, said the government should stop “pussyfooting around”.</p><small>2025-05-06 10:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/68193943cfac5.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908697/indian-states-told-to-conduct-air-raid-drills' target='_blank'><strong>Indian states told to conduct air raid drills</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: The Indian government on Monday asked all states to conduct mock drills for “effective civil defence”, which includes operationalising air-raid warning signs, crash blackout measures, camouflaging vital installations and evacuation plans.
Meanwhile, Indian PM Narendra Modi  met with defence secretary Rajesh  Kumar Singh, followed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, in his  office.
The mock-drills are to begin countrywide on May 7 and likely to continue till May 9, The Hindu quoted a senior government official as saying.
Around 400,000 volunteers associated with the Direc­torate General, Civil Defence, under the home ministry will be roped in for the drill, the official told The Hindu.
Government sources confirmed to the paper that this comes in the backdrop of escalating tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The Civil Defence department was created in 1962, following India’s war with China.
The official said mock-drills are routinely performed for disasters such as earthquakes and building collapse among others but air-sirens are used to warn the public when there is an “external threat”.
“Every state including those on the western border will do the mock-exercise beginning May 7. The finer details will be shared on Tuesday. Some states are better equipped and for others we will issue guidelines,” said the official.
The official explained that camouflaging of vital installations amounts to switching off all illumination including in the vicinity of plants and vital buildings.
“We have over 400,000 volunteers associated with the Civil Defence. We will try to mobilise the maximum number for the exercise. The state police will also mobilise volunteers in their jurisdictions,” said the official.
On Sunday, police conducted a 30-minute blackout drill in the Ferozepur district of Punjab, bordering Pakistan. The Ferozepur Cantonment Board issued an advisory and residents were asked to switch off lights for half an hour.

An attack on April 22 in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
Speaking during the National Assembly session today, Bilawal said, “Pakistan had no hand in that crime. We do not export terror, we are the victims of terrorism.”
He refuted India’s claims on fighting against terrorism, saying, “How can you fight terrorism while practicing state terrorism in Kashmir?”
He said that Pakistan was suffering from “foreign-sponsored, ideologically driven, and brutally indiscriminate” terrorism. “We have buried our soldiers and school children … We have fought the menace with not only arms but with ideas, education, economic reforms and unity.”
Bilawal continued, “Terrorism cannot be defeated by a tank alone, it must be defeated with justice. It cannot be uprooted by bullets, it must be disarmed with hope. It cannot be defeated by demonising nations but by addressing the grievances that give it birth.”
He called on India and Pakistan to work together, stating, “The prime minister’s challenge to India for an impartial investigation is a start.
“Why would a true victim of terror shy away from accountability? Unless they are worried that the real blame for the bloodshed in Kashmir lies in Delhi and not in Islamabad.”

The PPP leader further said, “If India wishes to walk the path of peace, let them come with open hands and not clenched fists. Let them come with facts and not fabrication. Let us sit as neighbours and speak the truth.
“If they do not … then let them remember that the people of Pakistan are not made to kneel. The people of Pakistan have a resolve to fight, not because we love conflict, but because we love freedom.”
He said, “Let India decide. Will it be dialogue or destruction? Cooperation or confrontation?”
 
 

A day earlier, the NA unanimously passed a resolution condemning India’s unlawful and unilateral declaration to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in blatant violation of the treaty.
The resolution said that the killing of innocent civilians was contrary to the values upheld by Pakistan, and the NA rejected all “frivolous and baseless attempts” to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack.
The lawmakers condemned the “orchestrated and mala fide campaign” by the Indian government to malign Pakistan, which “follows a familiar pattern of exploiting the issue of terrorism for a narrow political goal”.</p><small>2025-05-06 09:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/061418593f6d6dc.jpg?r=141907' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908811/at-least-14-dead-due-to-heavy-rain-in-indias-gujarat' target='_blank'><strong>At least 14 dead due to heavy rain in India’s Gujarat</strong></a><br><p>At least 14 people died and 16 others were injured in the past two days as heavy pre-monsoon showers lashed India’s western state of Gujarat, state officials said on Tuesday.
Television visuals showed fallen trees and damaged crops as heavy lightning and thunderstorms impacted several districts.
The unseasonal rain across most of the state was driven by a cyclonic circulation in the neighbouring parts of Pakistan and India’s Rajasthan state, according to India’s Meteorological Department.
The weather forecaster has forecast more rain, thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds across Gujarat until Thursday.
Local officials told Reuters that 14 people were killed and 16 injured so far.
“We are awaiting reports on crop damage,” said Anju Sharma, secretary of the state’s agriculture department. Gujarat is a major producer of cotton, cumin and rice.
“District administrations will assess the losses and send us their reports today.”
Last month, unseasonable heavy rain across eastern and central India and parts of Nepal killed more than 100 people.</p><small>2025-05-06 09:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/06142536fbeee2b.jpg?r=142555' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908810/loyalists-cheer-as-ex-pm-zia-returns-home-to-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Loyalists cheer as ex-PM Zia returns home to Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s ex-prime minister Khaleda Zia, chair of the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), returned home to cheering crowds on Tuesday after months abroad for medical treatment.
Zia, 79, led the South Asian nation twice but was jailed for corruption in 2018 during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, her successor and lifelong rival who barred her from travelling abroad for medical care.
The 79-year-old was released from house arrest after a student-led mass uprising ousted Hasina in August 2024.
She flew to Britain in January and returned on Tuesday, BNP spokesperson Shairul Kabir said.
Thousands of party activists welcomed her, gathering on either side of the road leading to the airport, carrying photographs of Zia and waving party flags and placards with welcome messages.
Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, 84, who has led an interim government since Hasina fled into exile as crowds stormed her palace, has said elections will be held as early as December, and by June 2026 at the latest.
“This is a significant day for the country and the people of Bangladesh,” Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir, the BNP’s secretary general, told reporters.
 
 

“The celebration we are witnessing is not only an outpouring of emotion but also a demonstration of our strength.”
Zia’s rival Hasina remains in self-imposed exile in India and has defied an arrest warrant from Dhaka over charges of crimes against humanity.</p><small>2025-05-06 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603352-nearly-5-million-children-out-of-school-in-kp-reveals-report' target='_blank'><strong>Nearly 5 million children out of school in KP, reveals report</strong></a><br><p>

Instead, it is reeling from a $48 million snap aid cut by US President Donald Trump’s government, which health workers say could rapidly unravel years of hard work and cause huge numbers of preventable deaths.
“Doctors told me I was infected with a serious kind of tuberculosis,” labourer Mohammed Parvej, 35, told AFP from his hospital bed after he received life-saving treatment from medics funded by the US aid who identified his persistent hacking cough.
But full treatment for his multidrug-resistant tuberculosis requires more than a year of hospital care and a laborious treatment protocol — and that faces a deeply uncertain future.
“Bangladesh is among the seven most TB-prevalent countries globally, and we aim to eradicate it by 2035,” said Ayesha Akhter, deputy director of the formerly US-funded specialised TB Hospital treating Parvej in the capital Dhaka.
 
 

Bangladesh had made significant progress against the infectious bacteria, spread by spitting and sneezing, leaving people exhausted and sometimes coughing blood.
TB deaths dropped from more than 81,000 a year in 2010, down to 44,000 in 2023, according to the World Health Organisation, in the country of some 170 million people.
Akhter said the South Asian nation had “been implementing a robust programme”, supported by the US Agency for International Development (USAID).
“Then, one fine morning, USAID pulled out their assistance,” she said.
Starving children
More than 80 per cent of humanitarian programmes funded by USAID worldwide have been scrapped.
Tariful Islam Khan said the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research Bangladesh had, with US funding, carried out mass screening “improving TB case detection, particularly among children” from 2020 to 2024.
“Thanks to the support of the American people… the project has screened 52 million individuals and diagnosed over 148,000 TB cases, including 18,000 children,” he said.
Funding cuts threatened to stall the work.
“This work is critical not only for the health of millions of Bangladeshis, but also for global TB control efforts,” he said.

Growing rates of infectious diseases in one nation have a knock-on impact in the region. Cuts hit further than TB alone.
“USAID was everywhere in the health sector,” said Nurjahan Begum, health adviser to the interim government — which is facing a host of challenges after a mass uprising toppled the former regime last year.
US aid was key to funding vaccines combating a host of other diseases, protecting 2.3 million children against diphtheria, measles, polio and tetanus.
“I am particularly worried about the immunisation programme,” Begum said.
“If there is a disruption, the success we have achieved in immunisation will be jeopardised.”
Bangladeshi scientists have also developed a special feeding formula for starving children. That too has been stalled.
“We had just launched the programme,” Begum said. “Many such initiatives have now halted”.
Pivot to China
US State Department official Audrey M. Happ said that Washington was “committed” to ensuring aid was “aligned with the interests of the United States, and that resources are used as effectively and efficiently as possible”.
Bangladesh, whose economy and key garment industry are eyeing fearfully the end of the 90-day suspension of Trump’s punishing 37pc tariffs, is looking for other supporters.
 
 

Some Arab nations had expressed interest in helping fill the gap in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
China, as well as Turkey, may also step into Washington’s shoes, Begum said.
Jobs are gone too, with Dhaka’s Daily Star newspaper estimating that between 30,000 and 40,000 people were laid off after the United States halted funding.
Zinat Ara Afroze, fired along with 54 colleagues from Save the Children, said she worried for those she had dedicated her career to helping.
“I have seen how these projects have worked improving the life and livelihoods of underprivileged communities,” she said, citing programmes ranging from food to health, environmental protection to democracy.
“A huge number of this population will be in immediate crisis.”
Babies dying
Those with the least have been hit the hardest.
Less dollars for aid means more sick and dead among the Rohingya refugees who fled civil war in their home in neighbouring Myanmar into Bangladesh since 2017.
Much of the US aid was delivered through the UN’s WHO and Unicef children’s agency.
WHO official Salma Sultana said aid cuts ramped up risks of “uncontrolled outbreaks” of diseases including cholera in the squalid refugee camps.
Faria Selim, from Unicef, said reduced health services would impact the youngest Rohingya the hardest, especially some 160,000 children under five.
Hepatitis C, with a prevalence rate of nearly a fifth, “is likely to increase in 2025”, Selim said.
Masaki Watabe, who runs the UN Population Fund in Bangladesh working to improve reproductive and maternal health, said it was “trying its best to continue”.
Closed clinics and no pay for midwives meant the risk of babies and mothers dying had shot up.
“Reduced donor funding has led to … increasing the risk of preventable maternal and newborn deaths,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-06 08:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603348-uk-planning-on-restricting-visa-applications-from-pakistan-nigeria-sri-lanka-report' target='_blank'><strong>UK planning on restricting visa applications from Pakistan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka: report</strong></a><br><p>

The benchmark KSE-100 index increased by 990.87 points, or 0.87 per cent, to stand at 115,093.10 from the last close of 114,102.23 at 10:03am.
Shares then witnessed a slight decline, up by 621.75 points, or 0.54pc, to stand at 114,723.98 from the previous close at 12:30pm.
The State Bank of Pakistan’s decision to slash the interest rate by 100 basis points to 11 per cent defied analysts’ expectations that ongoing tensions with India might keep the central bank cautious and lead to no change in the interest rate.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said the rate cut “provided much-needed impetus to the stock market where investor confidence is deterred by India-Pakistan tensions”.
 
 

In the past few days, panicky investors have continued to reduce their holdings as Pakistan has expressed a heightened possibility of a military action by India in the wake of the latter’s allegations regarding a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
However, Ashraf noted that the “likelihood of a full-scale war between Pakistan and India remains low, constrained by the nuclear deterrence factor”.
“We believe, escalation at a wider scale would have severe consequences for both nations, particularly given their dependence on external financing and exposure to short-term external liabilities,” he added.
Samiullah Tariq, head of research at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, also attributed the gains in shares today to the monetary policy, noting that the SBP rate cut was “higher than market expectations”.
Topline Securities Ltd had observed yesterday that the benchmark index was volatile, falling by 1,036 points in early trading. However, it made a strong recovery in the second half, mainly supported by the cement sector, as investors expected a possible rate cut in the monetary policy later in the day.
 
 

Also on Monday, international rating agency Moody’s warned that sustained India-Pakistan tensions could negatively affect Pakistan’s growth.
It also said that escalating tensions could cause a setback to nascent macroeconomic stability and also disrupt Pakistan’s access to foreign funding flows.
On the other hand, Moody’s noted that macroeconomic conditions in India would remain stable. However, it did stress that higher defence spending could impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”.

The move represents the latest salvo from a Trump administration willing to use the power of the federal purse to force institutions, from law firms to universities, to make sweeping policy changes or else lose billions of dollars in federal grants and contracts.
In a letter to Harvard, US Education Department Secretary Linda McMahon said the university must address concerns about anti-Semitism on campus, school policies that consider a student’s race, and complaints from the administration the university has abandoned its pursuit of academic excellence while employing relatively few conservative faculty members.
“This letter is to inform you that Harvard should no longer seek grants from the federal government, since none will be provided,” McMahon wrote.
 
 

Harvard said the McMahon letter doubles down on demands that would impose “unprecedented and improper control” over the university and makes new threats to “illegally” withhold funding for lifesaving research.
“Harvard will also continue to defend against illegal government overreach aimed at stifling research and innovation that make Americans safer and more secure,” a university spokesperson said.
The freeze of future funding represents a slightly altered tactic by the Trump administration, whose attempts to freeze top schools of existing funds raised legal eyebrows.
Trump has targeted Harvard over allegations of anti-Semitism on campus during pro-Palestinian protests. The protests were sparked by US ally Israel’s military assault on Gaza after the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas.
Trump has alleged pro-Palestinian protesters are anti-Semitic and sympathetic to Hamas. Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say the government wrongly conflate their criticism of Israel’s actions in Gaza with anti-Semitism and their advocacy for Palestinian rights with support for extremism.
In recent weeks, the administration began a formal review into nearly $9 billion in federal funding for Harvard, demanded the university ban diversity, equity and inclusion practices, and crack down on some pro-Palestinian groups and masks in protests.
 
 

Harvard rejected numerous Trump demands last month, calling them an attack on free speech and academic freedom. It sued the Trump administration after it suspended about $2.3 billion in federal funding for the educational institution, while also pledging to tackle discrimination on campus.
In its lawsuit against the Trump administration, Harvard said the government’s funding cuts will have stark “real-life consequences for patients, students, faculty, staff, (and) researchers” while putting in jeopardy crucial medical and scientific research.
Harvard has a $53bn endowment, the largest of any US university, but the funds are often restricted and used for things like financial aid and scholarships.</p><small>2025-05-06 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/0602545874d4a60.jpg?r=031151' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1908586/pakistans-objectives-largely-served-and-achieved-by-unsc-moot-on-south-asia-tensions-asim-iftikhar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s objectives ‘largely served and achieved’ by UNSC moot on South Asia tensions: Asim Iftikhar</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN Asim Iftikhar on Tuesday said that the country’s objectives were largely achieved by a United Nations Security Council (UNSC) meeting it had requested to discuss the prevailing tensions in South Asia amid a standoff with India in the wake of a militant attack in occupied Kashmir.
The April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan has firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
Tensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. As temperatures remain high, with the military warning of a “swift” response to any misadventure by New Delhi, diplomatic channels have remained engaged to prevent conflict.
Iftikhar delivered a press briefing following the UNSC meeting, stating that the nation’s objectives were “largely served and achieved” by the discussion and reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to remaining peaceful and open to dialogue.
“Several [council] members recognised the imperative of peacefully resolving all issues, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” Iftikhar said.
“There was also a clear sense that regional stability cannot be sustained through unilateralism, it requires principled diplomacy, engagement and adherence to international law.”
Iftikhar noted that peace “does not happen in a vacuum” and highlighted some of the key points discussed during the moot.
“We expressed grave concern over India’s recent unilateral measures, particularly the illegal actions of April 23, military buildup and inflammatory statements,” he said.
“These actions, alongside credible evidence of potential escalation, have dangerously raised tensions.
“Pakistan does not seek confrontation [but] we are fully prepared to defend our sovereignty and territorial integrity in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter. When peace is threatened in a region home to one-fourth of humanity, it becomes a global issue,” he noted.
Iftikhar highlighted that Pakistan “categorically rejected” India’s allegations that it was responsible for the Pahalgam attack, which was condemned by Pakistan and “all council members”.
“What India is claiming is nothing but recycled allegations, unsubstantiated, unverified [and] designed to serve its political interest and strategic objectives, which include trying to divert attention from repression and human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir and to undermine the legitimate Kashmiri struggle for self-determination,” he said.
Iftikhar also raised India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, which he noted was brokered by the World Bank and “upheld during wars”.
“Water is life, not a weapon,” he said. “These rivers sustain over 240 million Pakistanis. Any attempt to disrupt their flow constitutes aggression, and allowing such a precedent would endanger every lower riparian state.”
According to Iftikhar, the council was reminded that the Kashmir issue was the core contributor to instability in South Asia.
“The Kashmiri people continue to face gross human rights violations, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, torture, demolition of homes — that we are seeing now — restrictions on expression and media and a systematic denial of their right to self-determination,” he lamented.
“Lasting peace in South Asia requires that the UNSC implements its own resolutions, which include the holding of a UN-supervised plebiscite for Kashmiris to determine their own future,” he stated.
The ambassador added that Pakistan called out India’s “weaponisation of disinformation [and] efforts to malign Pakistan”.
“We reminded the UNSC that Pakistan has been a frontline state in the war on terror, sacrificing over 19,000 lives along with immense economic setback,” he said. “India’s attempts to distort this reality, while ignoring its own destabilising actions and involvement in terrorism abroad, including the case of Kulbushan Jadhav and extraterritorial assassinations, must be met with truth, transparency and accountability.”
Iftikhar continued: “We reiterated our commitment to peaceful, cooperative relations with all our neighbours, including India. We remain open to dialogue based on mutual respect and sovereign equality.”
The ambassador added that Pakistan reiterated its call for a “transparent, neutral and credible investigation” of the Pahalagam attack.
“While we pursue peace, we will defend our interests and safeguard our sovereignty resolutely, and at all costs. We urge the UNSC and the secretary general to remain actively engaged in peacemaking and preventative diplomacy,” he said.
“The role of the council is not just to observe conflict from afar, but to prevent it through timely and principled action. Peace must be built through dialogue, engagement and respect for international law. India’s current posture reflects none of these,” Iftikhar said.
“The burden of peace must be shared — the people of Kashmir have waited far too long for justice, and the people of Pakistan will not stand by while their rights — to water, to peace, to sovereignty — are threatened,” he added.
“In view of the gravity of the situation, the calls for dialogue, de-escalation, and peaceful resolution of disputes, such as by the secretary general and what we heard from the council members today, are the most pertinent and the way forward for lasting peace and stability in the region,” he concluded.
Earlier today, the Foreign Office (FO) said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had instructed Iftikhar to take immediate steps for the UNSC session.
 
 

“Pakistan will particularly brief the UNSC on how India’s aggressive actions, repeated provocations and inflammatory rhetoric pose a serious threat to regional and global peace and stability,” an FO press release issued today said.
It said that Pakistan would call upon the UNSC to “exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security by taking appropriate measures to address these concerning developments”.
“It will also highlight India’s unlawful and unilateral attempt to put the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance — a clear violation of its international obligations,” the FO said.
The instructions came two days after Ambassador Iftikhar said Pakistan was closely following the situation stemming from India’s aggressive moves in the wake of the Pahalgam attack and would seek a UNSC meeting at an appropriate time.
Pakistan and India have fought multiple wars and remain bitter foes.
International pressure has been piled on both New Delhi and Islamabad to de-escalate.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack in Kashmir.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given his military “full operational freedom” to respond, and Islamabad has warned it will hit back against any aggression.
UN chief urges ‘maximum restraint’ in India, Pakistan standoff
Earlier, before the session, UN chief Antonio Guterres urged that Pakistan and India must exert “maximum restraint” and step back from the brink of war.
Relations have reached “a boiling point”, Guterres told reporters in New York, adding that they were at their “highest in years”.
He again condemned the April 22 attack in Pahalgam, calling for those responsible to be brought to justice through “credible and lawful means”.
“It is also essential — especially at this critical hour — to avoid a military confrontation that could easily spin out of control,” the secretary-general warned.

“Now is the time for maximum restraint and stepping back from the brink.”
The UN chief also called Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the prevailing security situation in South Asia, according to a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
It added that this was the second telephone conversation between the two leaders within a week.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the UN chief’s continued engagement and outreach efforts and welcomed his call for de-escalation as well as the need to avoid any confrontation.
“While reiterating his offer of an independent, transparent, neutral and credible investigation, the prime minister expressed his concern that India was yet to provide any evidence, nevertheless, it continued to resort to provocative rhetoric and warmongering,” the statement said.
The premier reiterated Pakistan’s determination to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.
PM Shehbaz also expressed his serious concern at Indian attempts to politicise international financial institutions in an attempt to harm Pakistan’s economic interests.
The UN chief briefed the prime minister on his outreach efforts for peace and stability in the region, and expressed his commitment to remain engaged with all interlocutors on the issue.
NA passes unanimous resolution, condemns India’s move to suspend Indus Waters Treaty
Meanwhile, the National Assembly (NA) unanimously passed a resolution condemning India’s unlawful and unilateral declaration to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in blatant violation of the treaty.
Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry presented the resolution.
The resolution said that the killing of innocent civilians was contrary to the values upheld by Pakistan, and the NA rejected all “frivolous and baseless attempts” to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam attack.
The lawmakers condemned the “orchestrated and mala fide campaign” by the Indian government to malign Pakistan, which “follows a familiar pattern of exploiting the issue of terrorism for a narrow political goal”.
The resolution warned that Pakistan remained fully capable and prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression, including water terrorism or military provocation and any misadventure by India would be met with a firm, swift and decisive response.
The lawmakers emphasised that the people of Pakistan remained committed to peace but would never allow anyone to transgress the country’s sovereignty, security, and interests.
The resolution demanded that India should be held accountable for its involvement in different acts of terrorism and targeted assassinations on the soil of other countries, including Pakistan, and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering moral, political and diplomatic support for and commitment to the Kashmiri people’s just struggle for the realisation of their inalienable right to self-determination.
Pahalgam attack attempt to divert attention from India’s cross-border terrorism: Dar
FM Dar said that the attack was an attempt to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges and its cross-border terrorism.
Addressing the Regional Dialogue 2025 in Islamabad today, organised by the Institute of Regional Studies, Dar said Pakistan believed the Pahalgam attack was part of an effort to “divert attention” from India’s internal challenges, adding that it could be “self-choreographed”.
“We believe that what has happened is to divert attention — I am talking of Pahalgam — from India’s internal challenges, state-sponsored terrorism, the ongoing human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Kashmir, and to gain narrow domestic political objectives,” Dar said.
“Don’t forget that there are some by-elections coming in the next few months in India,” he added, referring to the upcoming polls in Bihar in October.
“This brinkmanship carries consequences that extend far beyond India’s borders,” the deputy PM warned, calling India’s actions “unilateral, politically-motivated and highly provocative”.
He noted: “There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern — level allegations against Pakistan without evidence, use inflammatory rhetoric, incite war hysteria and use this as a pretext for aggression and unilateral actions.”
In a reference to the Indian government, Dar stressed that regional and international peace and security could not be “sacrificed at the altar of narrow electoral gains”.
“This is a dangerous political game and gamble, putting at stake the lives of millions in the region,” the foreign minister highlighted. However, he also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace: “We will support all efforts towards de-escalation.”
“Analysts say this could be another ploy. It might have been self-choreographed,” echoing Pakistani leaders’ previous statements of the Pahalgam attack being a “false flag operation”.
 


“How can an FIR (first information report) be registered in 10 minutes at a police station where you need at least 45 minutes to reach? […] Come on. Nobody’s a fool,” Dar quipped.
“International dignitaries are talking [to] both sides. Few of them — great friends — suggested to me, ‘Can you try and help the perpetrators be caught?’ I said ‘come on, do you know the distance where it happened and where’s the Line of Control? 230 kilometres.”
The deputy PM asserted: “Pakistan has exposed India’s mala fide and they are now on the backfoot. But it takes two to tango. I am telling all these dignitaries that we will show patience and will not be the first ones to attack.
“But if anybody makes any mistake and ventures into adventurism, then God knows what situation that will lead to. I hope sense prevails and they should [reflect].”
He detailed that he has directed Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations to request a meeting of the UN Security Council.
 
 

“Let’s share with them the facts and figures and the details and the evidence we showed the other day,” said Dar, referring to his press briefing with the military’s spokesperson, where they accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan.
“I cannot find the word abeyance in any international treaties’ dictionary. The word suspension is there,” Dar said, referring to India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.
UK to ‘work closely’ with Pakistan, India to reduce tensions
Separately, UK High Commissioner to Pakistan Jane Marriott assured PM Shehbaz today that her country would “work closely with Pakistan and India for maintaining regional peace and security”, the PMO said.
In his meeting with Marriott in Islamabad, PM Shehbaz urged her country to play its part in de-escalating the ongoing tensions with India.

The premier shared Pakistan’s perspective on the prevailing situation in South Asia in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident and rejected India’s attempts to link Pakistan to the incident without providing any evidence.
He also reiterated his offer for a transparent, credible and neutral international investigation into the incident and invited the UK to join it, the PMO statement added.
Noting that the UK enjoyed “good relations” with both India and Pakistan, PM Shehbaz assured Marriott that Islamabad “would never take any action that could imperil regional peace and security”.
The prime minister stressed that with the support of friendly countries, including the UK, his government’s “foremost priority remained advancing economic growth and development of the country”.
Iran FM meets with PM Shehbaz, army chief
Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also met PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir today, state broadcaster PTV News said in a post on X.
FM Araghchi, who arrived in Islamabad late last night, also met with Deputy PM Dar.
 


“Key discussions held with PM Shehbaz Sharif, FM Ishaq Dar and Army Chief Gen Asim Munir,” PTV News stated, highlighting that the visit came amid “rising India-Pakistan tensions after the Pahalgam attack”.
In his meeting with the Iranian FM, PM Shehbaz stressed that India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty was unacceptable and a red line for Pakistan.
According to the PMO, the premier shared serious concerns over the prevailing tensions in South Asia as a result of India’s provocative behaviour since the Pahalgam incident.
He categorically rejected any attempts to link Pakistan to the incident, without sharing any evidence and said Pakistan had offered that an international, transparent, neutral and credible investigation be conducted to ascertain the facts behind the Pahalgam incident.
While stating that Pakistan had acted with maturity and responsibility, the prime minister said, “India had, on the other hand, created a media frenzy to divert the world’s attention away from Jammu and Kashmir dispute, which remained the root cause of instability in South Asia.”
Iran’s FM Araghchi conveyed warm greetings from the Iranian leadership to the prime minister and reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to strengthening its relations with Pakistan and also playing its part in bringing peace and stability in South Asia.
The meeting between the army chief and the Iranian FM at General Headquarters (GHQ) today featured constructive discussions on the geo-strategic environment, with particular focus on challenges confronted by both countries in the domain of security, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.

Both sides agreed to stay engaged for enhanced bilateral cooperation while jointly working to assist in bringing positive developments in issues concerning the region, ISPR said.
The Iranian FM acknowledged and appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for peace and stability in the region, it added.
In their meeting, Dar and Araghchi exchanged views on the evolving situation in South Asia and the US-Iran nuclear talks, the Foreign Office said.
Both leaders also agreed that complex issues could be “resolved through diplomacy and negotiations”.
“They appreciated each other’s constructive diplomatic efforts, which demonstrate their shared commitment to peace and stability in the region,” the FO said. As Pak-India tensions persist, FM Araghchi is also expected to visit India later in the week.
According to an FO press release, Dar shared Pakistan’s “serious concerns over the prevailing tensions in South Asia as a result of India’s provocative behaviour” and rejected “unsubstantiated attempts to implicate Pakistan in the incident”.

The foreign minister thanked his Iranian counterpart for making the visit at this “critical juncture”. On his part, Araghchi conveyed cordial greetings from the Iranian leadership and reaffirmed Tehran’s desire to further deepen bilateral relations with Pakistan.
Dar pointed out that Pakistan had “consistently denounced terrorism in all its forms” and underscored the country’s frontline role in the fight against terrorism.
Both foreign ministers also reaffirmed their commitment to strong Pakistan-Iran ties and agreed to boost cooperation in trade, energy, and connectivity.
They also pledged to maintain strong momentum in Pak-Iran relations, including by maintaining an increased frequency of interaction at the leadership level.
Araghchi also called on President Asif Ali Zardari to discuss matters of bilateral and mutual interest, regional security situation, particularly the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.
The Iranian foreign minister said that he was undertaking the visit on the instructions of the Supreme Leader Khamenei, and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, expressing understanding of Pakistan’s position on the current situation and calling for restraint by both sides to de-escalate the tensions.
The president thanked the Iranian foreign minister for undertaking the visit to Pakistan at a critical juncture.
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to dialogue and diplomacy, while expressing concern over India’s aggressive posture, which he said was endangering regional peace and stability.
China reaffirms ‘time-tested friendship’ with Pakistan
Earlier today, China reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India as President Asif Ali Zardari met with Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong.

During today’s meeting at Aiwan-i-Sadr, Zardari expressed concern over the recent “irresponsible and aggressive rhetoric by the Indian government”, saying that such actions threaten regional peace and stability.
The two discussed matters of bilateral importance, with a particular focus on the ongoing situation between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack.
The Chinese ambassador reaffirmed the “enduring and time-tested friendship between China and Pakistan”, describing the relationship as one of “ironclad brothers” who have always supported each other in challenging times.
He thanked Zardari for sharing Pakistan’s perspective, and emphasised that China would always support its ally to achieve the common desire of both countries to secure peace and stability in South Asia.
 
 

Zardari conveyed his deep appreciation and gratitude to the Chinese government for its “consistent support, always standing by Pakistan in difficult times”.
On Thursday, PM thanked China’s envoy for endorsing his offer to conduct a neutral probe into the Pahalgam attack. Last week, China had urged both India and Pakistan to “exercise restraint” as the two countries reportedly exchanged fire at the Line of Control (LoC).
As Pakistan continues diplomatic engagement with various countries to brief them on the ongoing situation, PM Shehbaz yesterday spoke to his Malaysian counterpart, while Dar spoke to the foreign ministers of Malaysia and Russia.
When war breaks out, you can’t control it: Khawaja Asif
Meanwhile, appearing on Samaa TV programme ‘Nadeem Malik Live’, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reiterated that any Indian attack would be met with a “befitting response”, adding that it would be “a level above what they do”.
“If they attack, which I can’t define right now, our response will be a step up and will not come down,” he said.
When asked about the possibility of an Indian attack on the LoC, Asif responded that there was anticipation that any Indian attack would be contained to the LoC or Sialkot sector.
“Once war starts, you cannot calibrate or control it,” he said. “Starting a war itself is something which is extremely dangerous.
“Modi is fighting a war for his own gains and for votes,” Asif added. “Political compulsions dictate their strategic policy, which is very unfortunate. Votes are more valuable than human lives or international peace.”
 


Info minister refutes claims of ‘terrorist hideouts’ during LoC visit
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar visited the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir with local and foreign media and dismissed India’s allegations of “terrorist hideouts” there, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The visit facilitated by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting was aimed at exposing the “false and baseless Indian propaganda”, the report said, pointing out that media representatives were taken to specific locations that India had allegedly “labelled as terrorist hideouts”.
“By witnessing the ground situation, hearing from the local population, and observing the environment firsthand, the media got the opportunity to assess the truth behind India’s claims,” Radio Pakistan noted.
Among the group of international journalists was CNN’s International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson.
 


According to Radio Pakistan, Robertson visited a village where Muhammad Farooq and Muhammad Deen were killed in a “fake encounter by the Indian army”.
The CNN editor interviewed both men’s bereaved families, who appealed for justice through international media, the report said. No statement by Robertson was found on his social media accounts immediately after the visit.
Speaking on the occasion, Tarar said: “India is now claiming the presence of training camps in Bela Noor Shah, which is near Pir Chinasi, and that they were used in the Pahalgam attack.
“This area is 26 kilometres away from the LoC and the purpose of coming here is to show that Indian propaganda is false, fake, and concocted,” he added.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“India’s narrative has failed miserably, and the international media has not picked it up. There are contradictions in India’s response and they are not able to provide evidence,” the minister said.
He asserted: “There are no terrorist camps here. There are beautiful mountains and people [only].”
“Don’t resort to any misadventure,” Tarar warned, adding that Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian aggression and would go to any extent to defend its sovereignty.
Echoing Deputy PM Dar’s statements, Tarar said India uses propaganda to “hide its internal failures”.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Army again responded to unprovoked firing by the Indian army along the LoC overnight, state broadcaster PTV News reported.
According to security sources, Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing on multiple Pakistani military posts in Nakyal, Khuiratta, Sharda, Kel, Neelum and Haji Pir sectors along the LoC.
The action was responded to in a befitting manner by the Pakistan Army, PTV News added. It quoted security sources as saying that the armed forces were “fully alert”.
Pakistani troops had previously responded to “unprovoked” Indian firing on April 30. Both countries have reportedly been trading small arms fire since April 25.

Four survivors rescued after the “panga”-style open fishing vessel washed ashore near Torrey Pines State Beach were transported to hospitals, and two other people found on a nearby beach were detained by authorities, according to US Coast Guard officials.
The two taken into custody were suspected to be smugglers, Coast Guard spokesperson Hunter Schnabel told Reuters.
Earlier Coast Guard accounts put the number of people missing from the overturned craft at nine, but Schnabel said the tally of those unaccounted for was revised to seven after confirmation that two individuals had been detained.

A Coast Guard cutter, an emergency response boat and a helicopter were involved in an ongoing search for the missing, among whom were two children, another Coast Guard spokesperson, Chief Petty Officer Levi Read, said.
At least some of the boat’s occupants were apparently from India, as a number of Indian passports “were found on the beach near where the panga washed up,” Read said.
Shawn Gibson, a special agent in charge of the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agency, said the incident was a “stark reminder of the dangers posed by maritime smuggling.”
“The ruthless smuggling of undocumented individuals is not only illegal, it’s deadly,” Gibson said of the incident, which occurred about 30 miles north of the US-Mexico border. Read said ocean conditions off the San Diego County coast were rough at the time, with two metres seas reported.
Personnel from HSI, the US Border Patrol, the local fire department and law enforcement also responded to the scene, officials said.
So far this fiscal year, since October 2024, the Coast Guard has tracked 277 vessels clandestinely entering US waters from Mexico in the San Diego area, some of the boats being interdicted and others getting away, Read said. Those incidents resulted in 983 people being apprehended.
That compares with 1,354 maritime border-crossing incidents in the same region during the previous 12 months, with 561 individuals taken into custody during that period.
Of the four hospitalised survivors from Thursday’s panga capsizing, one was listed in critical condition when rescued, according to a statement from the city of Encinitas.
One survivor reported that 18 people had been aboard the vessel, and 18 life vests were located on shore, the statement said. But Read said the Coast Guard’s best information was that the boat was carrying just 16 individuals when it capsized.</p><small>2025-05-06 06:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603322-karachiites-likely-to-experience-rain-today' target='_blank'><strong>Karachiites likely to experience rain today</strong></a><br><p>

• Chambers, traders’ bodies slam govt for not taking them on board
ISLAMABAD: In what appears to be a major step to broaden the country’s narrow tax base, the government has authorised the stationing of tax officers at business premises to monitor production, stocks, supply of goods and rendering of services in the largely undocumented service sector.
On Monday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was briefed about three major amendments which address urgent legal, administrative and enforcement gaps in the tax system. These amendments were implemented through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025.
The amendment pertains to the posting of FBR officers at business premises under Section 175C and is intended to help monitor the revenue collection of high-end services and sectors operating outside the scope of the existing sales tax regime.
This section will not cover traders who are already regulated under section 40B of the Sales Tax Act 1990.
This step simply brings services into parity and ensures fair and comprehensive oversight across sectors, tackling an underground economy that is estimated to be more than 30pc of the GDP.
The measure is a response to the growing tax fatigue among the salaried class and documented manufacturers. Through enhanced documentation of the high-potential service sector, the FBR aims to create a fiscal space that could allow potential downward revisions in personal income tax rates on salaried individuals.
 
 

The service sector, which represents nearly 60pc of GDP, remains largely undocumented as over 70pc of enterprises are reportedly unregistered.
The scope of this section specifically targets high-earning yet under-documented businesses. Prominent among these are restaurants, hotels, guest houses, marriage halls, clubs, courier and cargo services, beauty parlours, clinics, hospitals, diagnostic laboratories, gyms, foreign exchange dealers and photographers.
Some private hospitals are reportedly charging Rs100,000 to 200,000 per day for inpatient room occupancy — rates that exceed even those of five-star hotels. Many of these entities are underreporting revenues and do not comply with tax laws, undermining public trust and depriving the state of critical revenue needed for social services and infrastructure building.
This amendment introduces a monitoring mechanism, subject to inter-agency oversight, ensuring that FBR officers cannot act without accountability or beyond the authorised scope. All operations under this provision will be conducted transparently, under strictly defined SOPs, and in coordination with other regulatory authorities to prevent overreach or harassment.
PM’s observations
PM Shehbaz says ongoing tax reforms are aimed at reducing the burden on the common man. He said the amendments in various provisions of the Income Tax Ordinance and the Federal Excise Act will remove obstacles in tax collection.
According to a statement by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat, the amendments will make the tax payment system more convenient and will not affect the rights of individuals and companies who regularly pay taxes.
The premier directed the authorities to expedite measures against tax evasion, under-invoicing and other irregularities in different sectors on priority basis.
He also directed strict legal action against buying and selling of illicit cigarettes and other items.
The meeting was briefed about steps taken against tax evasion in tobacco, cement, poultry, sugar, beverages and other industries. The prime minister was informed that work was underway on digital monitoring and the track and trace system.
The FBR has been successful in identifying irregularities in many industries through video monitoring. The meeting was told that powers to seize illicit products have also been transferred to provinces.
Tax amendments
The first amendment relates to Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A), concerning the immediate payment of tax demand even if a stay is granted or an appeal is pending. Following the recent constitutional amendment, special benches have been established in the superior judiciary to fast-track such cases under the oversight of the Chief Justice of Pakistan. Although the courts are now resolving cases promptly, a lacuna in the law previously allowed taxpayers a 30-day delay in making payments on confirmed demands — even when the matter had been conclusively decided by a court.
As a result, billions in confirmed revenue remained unrealised despite clear court verdicts. The amendment through Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A) seeks to curtail this delay and allow for swift implementation of final judgements issued by the Supreme Court and High Courts.
It is categorically clarified that this provision does not apply to orders passed by lower appellate forums such as commissioners, commissioner of appeals, or Inland Revenue Appellate Tribunals.
It is strictly limited to cases where the highest courts have already adjudicated on the matter and no stay is available. This provision does not overrule any stay granted by the Supreme Court or a high court. On the contrary, it reinforces the tax recovery order adjudicated by the Supreme Court or a high court.
The second amendment addresses the visits of FBR officers to private sector industries not currently accountable to FBR. The visits of FBR officers and officials to business premises engaged in taxable activities — whether earning taxable income or supplying taxable goods and services — are strictly regulated through a series of rules and STGOs. All such visits must be authorised through a bar-coded letter and officials are required to record proceedings on a mobile device for transparency.
Officers are provided with standardized pro forma documents, which are completed during the visit and submitted both electronically via a mobile application and in hard copy to a chief commissioner or to the FBR headquarters.
The conduct of these officers is closely monitored by civil intelligence agencies, and any instance of misconduct — whether reported by intelligence or private businesses — is promptly investigated and addressed.
KCCI, LCCI criticise move
The chief of the Karachi Chambers of Commerce and Industry opposed the insertion of Sections 138(3A) and 140(6A) in the Income Tax Ordinance because these provisions “override judgments of superior courts”.
Mohammad Jawed Bilwani said the business community was worried because the new law would make disputed tax liabilities immediately recoverable even where relief was granted by judicial forums.
Mian Abuzar Shad, who heads the Lahore Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said in a statement that the business community “rejects the controversial amendments” as no stakeholders were consulted.
“These amendments are dangerous and anti-business. Therefore, we unanimously demand their immediate withdrawal or parliamentary review through proper consultation,” Mr Shad said.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari calls on PM Shehbaz Sharif.—APP

ISLAMABAD: The federal government will hand over power distribution companies to provinces in two months, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said on Monday.
PM Shehbaz made these remarks while meeting a delegation of PPP led by its Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
The federal government has been trying to privatise or devolve to provinces the power distribution companies (Discos) that supply electricity to homes.
Most of these Discos are suffering heavy losses due to poor recovery and transmission issues.
The prime minister made a similar announcement last month when he said the electricity price will be reduced by curtailing losses of around Rs600bn each year due to electricity theft, opening up electricity market operations and either privatising power distribution companies or handing them over to the provinces.

Meets PPP delegation; cancels Malaysia visit amid tensions with India

An official press release issued by the Prime Minister Office (PMO) after the meeting said the PM discussed the transfer of Discos with the PPP delegation.
“It was decided that within two months, the distribution companies will be handed over to the provinces,” the press release said.
The PPP delegation expressed confidence in the government’s reforms in the energy sector.
PM  Shehbaz also said the federal government has started consultations with its allies, including the PPP, for the upcoming budget.
The federal budget is likely to be announced in the first week of June.
The PPP delegation presented their proposals regarding the budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026.
On the issue of tensions with India, both allies reiterated that the entire nation stood united with the armed forces against any aggression from the neighbouring country.
They emphasised the armed forces are “always ready to confront the enemy”.
According to the PMO, PM Shehbaz emphasised that while Pakistan desired peace and stability in the region, it possessed the capability to deliver a strong and effective response in defence of its sovereignty.
Describing India’s provocative behaviour following the Pahalgam incident as “deeply regrettable”, the prime minister said Pakistan not only expressed concern over the incident but also called for an impartial and independent investigation into the killing of 26 tourists.
He firmly rejected India’s baseless attempts to link Pakistan to the incident without any evidence.
The prime minister criticised India’s unilateral and illegal suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, calling it an act of “water aggression” which was “unacceptable” and a “red line” for the people of Pakistan.
He said Pakistan was actively pursuing diplomatic efforts to expose Indian aggression and that he had met with ambassadors from several countries to present Pakistan’s perspective.
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan will also expose India’s “nefarious designs” at the UN Security Council.
The PPP delegation said all political parties stood united for the defence and security of Pakistan.
They reaffirmed their full support for Pakistan’s brave armed forces.
The delegation also appreciated the federal government’s diplomatic efforts to highlight India’s war-mongering intentions internationally.
The PPP delegation comprised Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Naveed Qamar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, and Senator Saleem Mandviwalla.
PM shelves visit
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz has postponed his official visit to Malaysia amid escalating tensions with India, Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Monday.
In a statement, the Malaysian PM said he has an “understanding of the difficult circumstances Pakistan is facing” in light of recent tensions following the attack in India-held Kashmir
He hoped the situation would de-escalate swiftly.
PM Shehbaz was scheduled to arrive in Malaysia on Friday.
The PMO said the two sides spoke on Sunday night and that he “conveyed that he looked forward to paying an official visit to Malaysia later this year”.

The activists belonging to the Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) and Balochistan National Party-Mengal, were detained on March 22 under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance in Quetta’s district jail.
Lawyers representing the detainees, including BYC chief organiser Dr Mahrang, had filed petitions in the Balochistan High Court challenging the detentions.
A division bench of the BHC, comprising acting Chief Justice Ejaz Ahmed Swati and Justice Muhammad Aamir Rana, heard the petitions on Monday. Lawyers Kamran Murtaza, Sajid Tareen and Imran Baloch appeared for the petitioners.
Mr Tareen told the media the hearing was postponed until Tuesday at the request of the prosecution.
He stated that the Balochistan Home Department had rescinded the MPO orders against the 150 activists.
“The prosecution will defend its plea on the detention of Dr Mahrang and six others under MPO-3,” Mr Tareen said, confirming the orders against the larger group had been withdrawn.
According to the lawyers, those whose MPO-3 detention orders remain in effect were Dr Mahrang, Beebu Baloch, Gulzadi Baloch, Sabghatullah Shah Jee, Bebarg Baloch, Sanaullah Baloch and BNP member Mama Ghaffar Baloch, who is the father of Beebu.

During the current tensions between India and Pakistan, the Pakistani patients were sent back from India without completion of their treatment. The CM on Monday directed the health authorities to ensure free treatment of all such patients.
“The patients returning from India will not be left alone under any circumstances,” she said and issued directions for the best treatment of those needing kidney and liver transplants or those suffering from other critical diseases in the province. These patients, who were receiving treatment in India, had to return to Pakistan after the Indian government revoked their visas.
Meanwhile, she lauded the ranking system in the Punjab Police that had led to a decrease in crime rate in Lahore and other cities.

Amid escalating tensions, patients had to return without complete treatment

“By introducing the ranking system in the police department, the crime rate in Lahore and other cities is on the decline. The crime graph coming down is the result of excellent policing. Lahore police operations wing’s laudable performance in the ‘crime index’ has made it a safe city as compared to London and New York. It is a great milestone for the Lahore police and the Punjab government. Lahore city has been included in the Safe City category due to adopting an excellent strategy in combating crime,” the CM said while speaking to IGP Dr Usman Anwar who briefed her on law and order situation and crime rate in the province in a meeting.
CCPO Bilal Siddique Kamyana, DIG Administration Imran Kishwar, DIG Operations Faisal Kamran and DIG Investigation Zeeshan Raza were also present.
Ms Nawaz underscored that protection of the life and property of every citizen was the foremost responsibility of the state. She urged the citizens to cooperate and support the police in order to maintain law and order across Punjab.
She added that despite enormous challenges with regard to maintaining law and order, achieving crime reduction targets spoke volumes of excellent teamwork.
“By introducing ‘key performance indicators (KPIs)’, the performance of the police and administration had significantly improved. Policing has been improved by adopting modern technology, taking immediate feedback and carrying out effective monitoring. The process of accountability has also been ensured in the police,” the CM said.

“Netanyahu is directly MEDDLING within the US Government to DRAG it into another DISASTER in our region,” Araghchi said on X, warning against “ANY mistake against Iran”.
 






Araghchi also accused Netanyahu of “attempting to brazenly DICTATE what President Trump can and cannot do in his diplomacy with Iran”.
“The world has also learned how Netanyahu is directly MEDDLING within the US Government to DRAG it into another DISASTER in our region,” he added.

FM Araghchi says ‘lethal support for Israeli PM’s genocide’ in Gaza and war in Yemen have achieved nothing for Americans

Iran’s top diplomat cited US support for Israel in its war in Gaza against Palestinians in Gaza.
It also referred to the US retaliatory strikes against Yemen’s Houthis, whose attacks have targeted Washington’s ally Israel and Red Sea shipping in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.
“LETHAL support for Netanyahu’s Genocide in Gaza and waging WAR on behalf of Netanyahu in Yemen have achieved NOTHING for the American people,” he said.
The remarks came after the latest round of nuclear talks with the US, which were meant for May 3, were delayed with mediator Oman citing “logistical reasons”. The two countries have held three rounds since April 12, their highest-level contact since Washington withdrew from a landmark deal with Tehran in 2018, during Donald Trump’s first term as US president.
Netanyahu has called for dismantling Iran’s nuclear programme, saying a credible deal must “remove Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons” and prevent the development of ballistic missiles.
On Sunday, Trump said he would only accept “the total dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme, but also signalled openness to discussing one for civilian use.
“Now, there’s a new theory going out there that Iran would be allowed to have civilian (programme) — meaning to make electricity,” he told NBC News, adding that he “would be open to hearing” the argument.
Tehran has consistently denied that it was seeking atomic weapons, insisting that its atomic programme is solely for civilian purposes.
Araghchi reiterated that if the goal was for Iran to not have a nuclear weapon, “a deal is achievable and there is only ONE PATH to achieve it: DIPLOMACY based on MUTUAL RESPECT and MUTUAL INTERESTS”.

The iconic open-sided vehicle, designed to allow the pontiff to greet crowds of well-wishers, has been transferred to Caritas Jerusalem and will head to Gaza if and when Israel opens a humanitarian corridor.
The car, a converted Mitsubishi, was used by the pope during a 2014 visit to Bethlehem and had since been on display, gathering dust and rust. It has now been repaired and refurbished as a mobile clinic.
“With the vehicle, we will be able to reach children who today have no access to healthcare — children who are injured and malnourished,” said Peter Brune, secretary general of Caritas Sweden.
Brune told AFP that Sweden’s Cardinal Anders Arborelius had asked the late pope, who died on April 21 aged 88, that the spare vehicle be put to use providing essential frontline healthcare to Palestinian children.
It will be fitted with medical equipment and a fridge for medicines and be assigned a driver and a team of doctors.
 
 

“This vehicle represents the love, care and closeness shown by His Holiness for the most vulnerable, which he expressed throughout the crisis,” said Anton Asfar, secretary general of Caritas Jerusalem.
It was not clear, however, if or when the aid agency’s hoped-for humanitarian corridor would open.

• EU says plan ‘will result in further casualties, suffering’
• Israeli strikes kill 19 in war-ravaged territory’s north
JERUSALEM: Israel’s security cabinet approved the expansion of military operations in Gaza including the “conquest” of the Palestinian territory, an official said on Monday, after the army called up tens of thousands of reservists for the offensive.
It comes as the United Nations and aid organisations have repeatedly warned of the humanitarian catastrophe on the ground, with famine again looming after more than two months of a total Israeli blockade.
The Israeli official said the expanded operations “will include, among other things, the conquest of the Gaza Strip and the holding of the territories, moving the Gaza population south for their protection”.
A different senior security official said “a central component of the plan is a large-scale evacuation of the entire Gazan population from the fighting zones… to areas in southern Gaza”.
The plan, approved by the cabinet overnight, comes amid a push by Israel for Palestinians to leave the territory.
A “voluntary transfer programme for Gaza residents… will be part of the operation’s goals,” the senior security official added.
‘Political blackmail’
The European Union voiced concern and urged restraint from Israel, saying the plan “will result in further casualties and suffering for the Palestinian people”.
Hamas said on Monday the new Israeli aid framework amounted to “political blackmail”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said two Israeli air strikes killed at least 19 people in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory’s north early Monday.
“Our teams found 15 martyrs and 10 wounded, mostly children and women, after an Israeli strike on three apartments” northwest of Gaza City, said the agency’s spokesman, Mahmud Bassal.
Four other people were killed and four wounded in a strike on a house in Beit Lahiya, north of Gaza City, he told AFP.
The Israeli cabinet, which includes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and several ministers, “unanimously approved” the plan aimed at defeating Hamas and securing the return of prisoners held in the territory.
The official source said the plan included “powerful strikes against Hamas”, without specifying their nature.
“I think, as an Israeli citizen, that it’s a smart move to finally address the root problem properly”, public employee Yossi Gershon, 36, told AFP.
“All the steps of backing down — we can see that unfortunately, there really isn’t peace with the other people.”
The senior security source said the troop deployment would “allow a window of opportunity” for a possible prisoner deal coinciding with US President Donald Trump’s upcoming visit to the Middle East in mid-May.
“It is a thoughtless way of endangering more lives on both sides”, student Tamar Lazarow, 59, told AFP. “Enough innocent people have died… I do not really trust our government to make decisions coming from the right place.”
An Israeli campaign group representing the relatives of prisoners said the plan for an expanded offensive was “sacrificing” those held in Gaza.
Alongside the plan for the expansion of the war, Netanyahu “continues to promote” a proposal by Trump for the departure of Gazans to neighbouring countries, the official said.
The US president’s plan, unveiled in early February, has been rejected by Arab nations and governments around the world and the Palestinians.
Israel’s security cabinet also approved the “possibility of humanitarian distribution, if necessary” in Gaza, “to prevent Hamas from taking control of the supplies and to destroy its governance capabilities”.
A grouping of UN agencies and aid groups in the Palestinian territory has said Israel is seeking to “shut down the existing aid distribution system…
and have us agree to deliver supplies through Israeli hubs under conditions set by the Israeli military“.
The plan “contravenes fundamental humanitarian principles and appears designed to reinforce control over life-sustaining items as a pressure tactic — as part of a military strategy”, the bodies said in a statement.

• Dar sees Pahalgam incident as ‘calculated attempt’ at escalation
• Any violation of sovereignty to be met with ‘decisive force’, vows army chief
• Kremlin following situation with ‘great concern’
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Monday urged the global community to swiftly intervene to bring down tensions in the South Asian region and de-escalate the crisis by addressing its underlying reason: the unresolved Kashmir dispute.
Pakistan’s leadership also pledged to fiercely defend national sovereignty against any provocation in the wake of the Pahalgam attack that resulted in the death of 26 people in the held-Kashmir region. The government said that provocative rhetoric from New Delhi and baseless accusations against Pakistan were part of a pattern aimed at diverting attention from the Kashmir dispute.
In his meetings with foreign dignitaries, including Iran’s foreign minister, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated Pakistan’s offer for an “independent, tra­nsparent, neutral and credible” international inv­e­stigation into the Pahal­gam incident and invited cou­ntries, including the UK, to participate.
PM Shehbaz also raised concerns over what he termed India’s attempts to politicise international fina­ncial institutions to damage Pakistan’s economy and condemned recent actions concerning the Indus Waters Treaty, calling them “unacceptable” and a “red line”.
Iran FM visit
During their separate meetings with visiting Iranian Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi, PM Shehbaz and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar highlighted their shared commitment to diplomacy.
Iran had offered to mediate between India and Pakistan, with President Pezeshkian already having spoken to leaders in both capitals and Mr Araghchi expected to travel to New Delhi on Thursday.
“The prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Iran for peace, stability, and development in the region,” the PM Office said in a statement after the meeting. Foreign Minister Araghchi reaffirmed Iran’s commitment to strengthening its relations with Pakistan and playing its part in bringing peace and stability to South Asia, reported state-run APP.
In his meeting with UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott, the prime minister emphasised that Pakistan would not take any step that endangers regional peace. “Our priority remains economic development,” he said, urging London to use its good offices with both countries to promote peace.
‘Pakistan will defend itself’
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, at a seminar in Islamabad, said that Pakistan remained committed to regional stability but would not hesitate to defend itself if provoked.
“There appears to be a calculated and premeditated attempt to escalate regional tensions, following a familiar pattern—level accusations without evidence, incite hysteria, and use it as a pretext for aggression,” Mr Dar said.
“If aggression is imposed on us, we will exercise our inherent right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.”
He also voiced concern over India’s move to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, calling it a dangerous development with far-reaching implications. The foreign minister urged the global community to intervene before the situation spirals further.
“The international community must take serious note of these developments. At a time when the region requires cooperation and restraint, any tolerance for adventurism would only embolden further instability,” he emphasised.
“Being a responsible member of the international community, Pakistan remains committed to regional peace and stability. We will support all efforts towards de-escalation,” he reassured the international partners about Pakistan’s cooperation for de-escalation.
The Pakistani military reinforced the civilian leadership’s stance, with Gen Asim Munir warning that while the country sought peace, any violation of its sovereignty would be met with decisive force.
“If Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity are violated, we will respond with full force to preserve national prestige and the well-being of our people,” Gen Munir said during remarks at the Balochistan National Security Workshop.
Islamabad has consistently framed the Kashmir dispute as central to the region’s volatility and reiterated its call for a resolution based on UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.
The Iranian top envoy also called on army chief General Asim Munir at GHQ, Rawalpindi.  “The meeting featured constructive discussions on the geo-strategic environment, with particular focus on challenges confronted by both countries in the domain of security. The Pak-Iran border security mechanism was also reviewed as part of efforts to enhance bilateral coordination,” said a statement issued by the army’s media wing after the meeting.
Kremlin’s concern
Meanwhile, the Kremlin also called for a de-escalation on Monday, expressing the hope that both sides would work towards reducing tensions.
“We hope that the parties will be able to take measures (…) that will reduce tensions,” Spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, adding that “we are following with great concern the tense atmosphere that has developed on the border.”
Russian President Vladimir Putin told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a phone call on Monday that the “particularly privileged partnership” between Moscow and Delhi was “not subject to external influence and continues to develop dynamically in all areas”, the Kremlin said in a statement.
Moscow last week said it was ready to mediate after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held calls with both sides last week.
“India is our strategic partner. Pakistan is also our partner. We value our relations with both Delhi and Islamabad,” Peskov said.

India took measures such as closing its airspace to Pakistan airlines, while Pakistan barred those owned or operated by its neighbour, suspended trade and halted special visas for Indians, although it let international airlines use its airspace.
Lufthansa Group’s airlines are  “avoiding Pakis­tani airspace until further notice”, it said in a statement to Reuters.
The Pakistan Civil Avi­a­tion Authority declined a Reuters request for comment.
However, flight tracking data showed some flights of British Airways, Swiss International Air Lines and Emirates turning north towards Delhi in order to avoid Pakistani airspace, after travelling over the Arabian Sea.
British Airways and Emirates did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
“The airline has decided to suspend overflight of Pakistan until further notice,” Air France said in a statement, citing the  “recent evolution of tensions” between India and Pakistan.
The carrier said it was altering its flight schedule and flight plans with destinations such as Delhi, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh, entailing longer flight times.

• Decreased inflows at Marala will result in more water shortage for crops, Irsa warns
• Reuters report claims New Delhi plans to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects
NEARLY a week after its unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, India on Monday virtually stopped water discharges from the Chenab River into Pakistan without prior notice, reducing flows in the river manifold.
Water flows in the Chenab, recorded at the Marala headworks, decreased from up to 35,000 cusecs on Sunday to about 3,100 cusecs on Monday morning.
 
 

“They have almost blocked the River Chenab flows to downstream (Pakistan) after they (Ind­ian authorities) took the dec­ision on Sunday,” a senior official of the Punjab irrigation department confirmed on Monday.
“Currently, they are using our water to fill up their dams/hydropower projects in the Chenab basin. They cannot do this since it is a grave violation of the Indus Water Treaty…,” the official deplored.
According to a document seen by Dawn, India has three major hydropower projects in the Chenab Basin. The first is the 1,000MW Pakal Dul Dam, having an 88,000 acre-feet reservoir storage capacity and a 10km head race tunnel to divert water south.
The second is the Baglihar Dam (88km from Pakal Dul upstream). This is a 900MW power generation plant, having a 321,002 acre-feet reservoir storage along with a spillway capacity of 582,692 cusecs.
The third one is Salal Dam, located 78km from Baglihar, having an installed power generation capacity of 690MW along with 228,000 acre-feet reservoir storage and spillway capacity of 792,012 cusecs.
“From Salal Dam, Marala Barrage (in Pakistan) is situated 76km away. The reason behind the massive reduction in the flows is the filling of these dams, which have a total storage capacity of over 1.2 million acre-feet. And if they keep filling their dams and avert discharging, they (India) may leave us without water for four to five days more,” the official warned.
To a question, he said that if India suddenly started discharging water downstream, there could be a flood-like situation in Chenab, putting the local population at risk.
To another question, he said Marala’s capacity was 1.1 million cusecs, whereas the total storage capacity of India’s dams in the Chenab basin was over 1.3 million acre-feet. “However, they don’t have control over the water inflows to Pakistan in the river from the Jammu-Tavi and Munawar-Tavi distributaries,” the official added.
According to the official, Chenab is very important for Pakistan’s irrigation system, as its canals, including the UCC and BRB canals, irrigate a vast tract of agricultural land in Punjab.
According to the daily water report issued by the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), the water inflows in Chenab at Marala were recorded at 5,300 cusecs, whereas there were zero outflows on Monday.
The inflows and outflows in the river at Marala on Sunday were 34,600 and 25,400 cusecs, respectively.
Shortage for Kharif crops
Separately, a meeting of the advisory committee of the Indus River System Authority also expressed concerns over the unilateral Indian decision that would cause additional shortages to Kharif crops, already facing an estimated 21pc shortfall.
“…sudden decrease in river Chenab inflows at Marala due to short supply by India would result in more shortages in early Kharif season,” said a statement issued by Irsa. The water regulator declared an overall shortage of 21pc for the remaining early Kharif season in case supplies in River Chenab remained normal. However, the situation would be monitored on a daily basis and if the decrease continues, the shortages would be revisited accordingly, Irsa said, adding the late Kharif shortages were expected to be 7pc.
An official told Dawn that Chenab flowed at 35,600 cusecs on Sunday at Marala headwork, but dropped to 3,177 cusecs on Monday morning, showing a reduction of almost 11 times. He said three storages — Baglihar, Dulhasti and Salal — on Chenab in Kashmir had the capacity to stop river flows.
Sindh’s concerns
Sindh representatives recorded their objections over the operationalisation of Chashma-Jhelum Link Canal by Punjab, but was explained that Punjab was using its own share. Sindh, nevertheless, insisted that the opening of the emergency link canal affected Sindh’s allocated share downstream.
Sindh was also told that its share of 76,000 cusecs was being released, which would reach its canal command areas in five to six days. Punjab’s discharges were reduced from 84,000 cusecs to 65,000 cusecs at its request.
The Irsa meeting worked out Punjab’s water availability estimate at 31.35 million acre feet (MAF) for the entire Kharif season, followed by Sindh’s 28.85MAF. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan would get 0.82MAF and 2.86MAF, respectively, during the season.
Work on Indian dams
Separately, the Reuters news agency reported that India has begun work to boost reservoir holding capacity at two hydroelectric projects.
A “reservoir flushing” process to remove sediment began on Thursday, carried out by India’s biggest hydropower company and authorities in the occupied Kashmir, it reported.
The process initially results in sediment-laden waters being released downstream from the reservoirs, potentially causing sudden inundation, followed by a reduced flow of water as the reservoirs are refilled, one of the unnamed sources cited by Reuters said.
The report said the work may not immediately threaten supply to Pakistan, which depends on rivers flowing through India for much of its irrigation and hydropower, but it could eventually be affected if other dams launch similar efforts. There are more than half a dozen such projects in the region.
“India did not inform Pakistan about the work at the Salal and Baglihar projects, which is being done for the first time since they were built in 1987 and 2008/09, respectively, as the treaty had blocked such work,” Reuters said, quoting sources.
The report said the Indian authorities had also asked officials concerned to open the adjustable gates for cleaning, which they did from May 1. The effort was aimed at freeing dam operations from any restrictions, it added.

In the first incident, un­­known assailants planted an improvised explosive device in the Dasht Nallah area of Jiwani. The device was detonated by remote control as the Pakistan Coast Guards (PCG) pat­­rol vehicle passed, officials reported.
The blast damaged part of the vehicle and injured two PCG personnel, while three others aboard were unharmed, officials said. Security forces secured the site and transported the injured soldiers to a nearby health facility.
The injured, identified as Shah Mir and Shafqaat, were later moved to Gwa­dar for further treatmentSeparately, in Pishin’s Huramzai Tehsil, attackers targeted a Levies official travelling in his private car, Levies officials said.
An explosive-laden mot­or­cycle was detonated near the vehicle, which sustai­ned damage, but the levies official inside was unhurt, officials confirmed.
Elsewhere, in the Wadh area of Khuzdar district, Le­­vies personnel preven­ted a potential attack by defusing a bomb plan­ted at a roadside. Officials said unknown individuals had parked an explosive-laden motorcycle by the road.
Levies men on patrol id­­entified the motorcycle as suspicious. Upon insp­­­ec­tion, an attached explosive device was discovered.
“Levies bomb disposal experts defused the 10kg explosive device,” said Assistant Commissioner Wadh Ali Akbar.
Also, armed men kidnapped Asfand Salehzai at gunpoint from the Zehri bazaar.
