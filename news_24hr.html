A press release from the Finance Division said the revised prices were based on recommendations by Ogra and concerned ministries.
The new petrol price is Rs272.15 per litre and Rs284.35 for HSD.
The press release did not mention any changes in the prices of kerosene and light diesel oil.
According to informed sources, the ex-depot price of petrol was projected to rise by about two per cent to Rs272.04 per litre, while HSD was likely to see a 2.5pc increase to approximately Rs279.48 per litre.
Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households.
Diesel fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods. Transporters had already begun adjusting fares in anticipation of the expected increase.
Despite zero general sales tax (GST) on petroleum products, the government is currently collecting close to Rs98 per litre in total levies on both petrol and diesel. This includes a petroleum development levy (PDL) of Rs78.02 on petrol and Rs77.01 on diesel and HOBC, along with a Rs2.25 per litre climate support levy (CSL). Additionally, a customs duty of Rs20-21 per litre is levied on both fuels, whether imported or locally refined.
Oil marketing companies and dealers are earning around Rs17 per litre as combined distribution and retail margins.
Petrol and diesel remain the primary drivers of fuel consumption, with monthly sales between 700,000 and 800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene.
In FY24, the government collected Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy and aims to increase this by 27pc to Rs1.470tr in FY25. Despite zero GST, petroleum products continue to serve as a significant source of revenue.</p><small>2025-07-15 19:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/152342564bf2815.jpg?r=234300' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924401/3-children-killed-5-people-injured-as-two-roofs-collapse-in-kps-malakand-after-heavy-rains' target='_blank'><strong>3 children killed, 5 people injured as two roofs collapse in KP’s Malakand after heavy rains</strong></a><br><p>Three children were killed and five people were injured as roofs collapsed in two separate incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand division after heavy rains in the region.
Last week, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) alerted the district administrations across KP to the possibility of floods due to a new spell of torrential rains from July 11 to 17. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province in June and are set to continue.
Pakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
Lower Dir Rescue 1122 spokesperson Abdur Rehman told Dawn.com today, “An under-construction mud house roof collapsed, burying four children underneath debris.”
He said the incident occurred at the Shahi Moro Barawal area along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Lower Dir.
According to the Rescue 1122 spokesperson, the rescue team had reached the site and retrieved the children from the debris and shifted them to a Samar Bagh hospital, where doctors declared two of them dead.
He said the remaining two children were undergoing medical assistance at the hospital.
In another incident, a child was killed and a mother and two others were injured when a mud-roof collapsed due to heavy rainfall in the Opal area of Chakesar tehsil in Shangla.
Shangla Rescue 1122 spokesperson Rasool Khan Sharif told Dawn.com that the family was asleep at night when the roof collapsed due to torrential rain.
“The local people had retrieved the trapped family members who were all buried underneath debris,” Sharif said.
The rescue spokesperson added that a five-year-old boy was killed while the mother and two other children were injured.
He said the injured family members were taken to the Rasool Khan Sharif Rural Health Centre, from where they were referred to a hospital in Mingora, Swat, for further treatment.
The deaths came amid an alert from the KP PDMA about the increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof).
“Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Islamabad has intimated that a wet spell is likely to affect KP in current week. During this period, scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls, are expected in KP. The prevailing weather conditions, increase the risk of Glofs and flash flood events in vulnerable glaciated regions of KP.
“In view of the above weather conditions, you are requested to kindly take all necessary
precautionary measures to avoid any loss of life/ livestock and damages to infrastructure/ crops,” said the alert to the deputy commissioners of Upper and Lower Chitral, Upper Dir, Swat and Upper Kohistan.
 






Ten people, including eight children, were killed in separate rain-related incidents across KP on Monday.
The deaths were reported in Bajaur, Khyber, Malakand, Kohat and Lakki Marwat districts. The PDMA had confirmed six deaths.</p><small>2025-07-15 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614171-viral-video-rant-court-releases-elderly-citizen' target='_blank'><strong>Viral video rant: Court releases elderly citizen</strong></a><br><p>

Rashid has been in prison for more than two years now in connection with multiple cases against her regarding the events of May 9. She was first detained on May 12, 2023, under the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance and later arrested for her alleged involvement in the May 9 riots.
She was hospitalised last year in May and July as well.
“Yasmin Rashid was shifted from jail to Services Hospital Emergency Department,” her lawyer Rana Mudassar told Dawn.com.
He added that Rashid was experiencing severe difficulty in breathing and also suffering from extreme stomach pain.
“Dr Yasmin Rashid has also been given oxygen due to her difficulty in breathing,” Mudassar said, adding that she was being tested at the hospital.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram also confirmed the development in a post on X.
“Dr Yasmin Rashid has just been urgently shifted from Kot Lakhpat Jail to a hospital due to her deteriorating health,” he wrote.
 






He added that Rashid was suffering from various ailments and “has been unjustly imprisoned for 24 months”.
“PTI demands that, keeping the requirements of justice in view, Dr Yasmin’s bail be immediately granted,” he added.
Barrister Taimur Malik, who contested the 2024 polls with the support of the PTI and is a member of the party’s legal team, also called for Rashid to be “granted the right to bail like thousands of others in these cases”.
He said that the PTI had asked the courts repeatedly to decide her bail applications.
“More than two years in prison as an under-trial prisoner is punishment itself before any case has even been decided,” he added.
 






PTI leader Musarrat Cheema said, “Rashid is a cancer survivor; she also has a breathing issue, but she was not even provided with oxygen. Every day, she endures jail trials in bogus cases.”
She requested prayers for Rashid’s health.
 






On July 12, an anti-terrorism court reserved its verdict on the bail petitions of former Punjab governor Umar Sarfraz Cheema and Rashid in cases related to the May 9 riots.
The same day, Rashid and four other PTI senior leaders incarcerated in Kot Lakhpat Jail demanded fresh, free and fair general elections in the country in an open letter, and called for learning lessons from the 1970 debacle.</p><small>2025-07-15 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614167-bestway-celebrates-50-years-with-star-studded-tribute-to-founder-sir-anwar-pervez' target='_blank'><strong>Bestway celebrates 50 years with star-studded tribute to Founder Sir Anwar Pervez</strong></a><br><p>

In March, Dr Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) members were arrested for “attacking” the Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after the group faced a police crackdown while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances. The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
“I urge you [Balochistan CM] to release all Baloch activists targeted solely for exercising their rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression,” the sample letter by Amnesty read.
It called on CM Bugti to drop all charges and overturn detention orders against Baloch activists targeted solely for exercising their rights.
“End the wider crackdown against activists and protesters across the province by allowing them to exercise their rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and expression without undue restriction,” the letter urged.
“The crackdown on Baloch activists, including Mahrang Baloch, Bebarg Zehri, Beebow Baloch, Shah Jee Sibghat Ullah, Ghafar Baloch and Gulzadi Baloch, violate Pakistan’s international human rights commitments, particularly the rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly,” the letter continued.
Amnesty said that laws such as the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO) and Anti-Terrorism Act have been used to prolong their arbitrary detention in violation of their rights to liberty and due process.
“This is part of a wider crackdown on human rights in Balochistan through suppression of peaceful assembly, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions,” the human rights organisation said.
It expressed concern for the safety and well-being of all those detained, as “access to family members and lawyers is regularly blocked by prison authorities.”
The letter said that the continued detention of the six Baloch activists, beyond the 90-day period allowed under MPO, has already long passed and violates the law.
Mahrang has been held at the Hudda District Prison in Quetta under Section 3 of the MPO — a law that empowers authorities to arrest and detain individuals suspected of posing a threat to public order.
Last week, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Quetta handed Mahrang and other organisers of the group into police custody for 10 days, extending their three-month detention.
In May, Amnesty and four other human rights organisations had called on Pakistan to release human rights defenders in Balochistan and end the crackdown on dissent.</p><small>2025-07-15 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/152247222e00b9d.jpg?r=224759' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924402/putin-unfazed-by-trump-will-fight-on-and-could-take-more-of-ukraine-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Putin, unfazed by Trump, will fight on and could take more of Ukraine: sources</strong></a><br><p>President Vladimir Putin intends to keep fighting in Ukraine until the West engages on his terms for peace, unfazed by Donald Trump’s threats of tougher sanctions, and his territorial demands may widen as Russian forces advance, three sources close to the Kremlin said.
Putin, who ordered Russian troops into Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in the country’s east between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops, believes Russia’s economy and its military are strong enough to weather any additional Western measures, the sources said.
Trump on Monday expressed frustration with Putin’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire and announced a wave of weapons supplies to Ukraine, including Patriot surface-to-air missile systems. He also threatened further sanctions on Russia unless a peace deal was reached within 50 days.
The three Russian sources, familiar with top-level Kremlin thinking, said Putin will not stop the war under pressure from the West and believes Russia — which has survived the toughest sanctions imposed by the West — can endure further economic hardship, including threatened US tariffs targeting buyers of Russian oil.
“Putin thinks no one has seriously engaged with him on the details of peace in Ukraine — including the Americans — so he will continue until he gets what he wants,” one of the sources told Reuters on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.
Despite several telephone calls between Trump and Putin, and visits to Russia by US special envoy Steve Witkoff, the Russian leader believes there have not been detailed discussions of the basis for a peace plan, the source said.
“Putin values the relationship with Trump and had good discussions with Witkoff, but the interests of Russia come above all else,” the person added.
Asked for a comment on the Reuters reporting, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly blamed former president Joe Biden for allowing the war to erupt during his administration.
“Unlike Biden, President Trump is focused on stopping the killing, and Putin will be faced with biting sanctions and tariffs if he does not agree to a ceasefire,” she said.
Putin’s conditions for peace include a legally binding pledge that Nato will not expand eastwards, Ukrainian neutrality and limits on its armed forces, protection for Russian speakers who live there, and acceptance of Russia’s territorial gains, the sources said.
He is also willing to discuss a security guarantee for Ukraine involving major powers, though it is far from clear how this would work, the sources said.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said Ukraine will never recognise Russia’s sovereignty over its conquered regions and that Kyiv retains the sovereign right to decide whether it wants to join Nato. His office did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
A second source familiar with Kremlin thinking said that Putin considered Moscow’s goals far more important than any potential economic losses from Western pressure, and he was not concerned by US threats to impose tariffs on China and India for buying Russian oil.
Two of the sources said that Russia has the upper hand on the battlefield and its economy, geared towards war, is exceeding the production of the US-led Nato alliance in key munitions, such as artillery shells.

Russia, which already controls nearly one-fifth of Ukrainian territory, has advanced some 1,415 square kilometres in the past three months, according to data from the DeepStateMap, an open-source intelligence map of the conflict.
“Appetite comes with eating,” the first source said, meaning that Putin could seek more territory unless the war was stopped. The two other sources independently confirmed the same.
Russia currently controls Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, plus all of the eastern region of Luhansk, more than 70 per cent of the Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and fragments of Kharkiv, Sumy and Dnipropetrovsk regions. Putin’s public position is that those first five regions — Crimea and the four regions of eastern Ukraine — are now part of Russia and Kyiv must withdraw before there can be peace.
Putin could fight on until Ukraine’s defences collapse and widen his territorial ambitions to include more of Ukraine, the sources said.
“Russia will act based on Ukraine’s weakness,” the third source said, adding that Moscow might halt its offensive after conquering the four eastern regions of Ukraine if it encounters stiff resistance. “But if it falls, there will be an even greater conquest of Dnipropetrovsk, Sumy and Kharkiv.”
Zelenskiy has said Russia’s summer offensive is not going as successfully as Moscow had hoped. His top brass, who acknowledge that Russian forces outnumber Ukraine’s, say Kyiv’s troops are holding the line and forcing Russia to pay a heavy price for its gains.
Trump and Putin
The US says 1.2 million people have been injured or killed in the war, Europe’s deadliest conflict since the Second World War. Neither Russia nor Ukraine give full figures for their losses, and Moscow dismisses Western estimates as propaganda.
Trump, since returning to the White House in January after promising a swift end to the war, has sought to repair ties with Russia, speaking at least six times by telephone with Putin. On Monday, he said the Russian leader was not “an assassin, but he’s a tough guy”.
In an abrupt break from his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden, Trump’s administration has cast the war as a deadly proxy conflict between Russia and the US, withdrawn support for Ukraine joining Nato and floated the idea of recognising Russia’s annexation of Crimea.
Putin portrays the war as a watershed moment in Moscow’s relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the 1991 fall of the Soviet Union by enlarging Nato and encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine and Georgia.
Putin has yet to accept a proposal from Trump for an unconditional ceasefire, which was quickly endorsed by Kyiv. Recent days have seen Russia use hundreds of drones to attack Ukrainian cities.
However, Trump told the BBC in an interview published today that he was not done with Putin and that a Ukraine deal remained on the cards.
The first source rejected Trump’s assertion last week that Putin had thrown “bullshit” around, saying there had been a failure to transform positive talks with Witkoff into a substantive discussion on the basis for peace.
A White House official said on Monday that Trump was considering 100pc tariffs on Russian goods as well as secondary sanctions on other countries that buy its exports as a means to drive Moscow to the negotiating table. China and India are the biggest buyers of crude.
Despite existing sanctions and the cost of fighting Europe’s biggest conflict since World War Two, Russia’s $2 trillion economy has performed far better than many in Russia or the West expected. The economic ministry forecasts a slowdown to 2.5pc annual growth in 2025 from 4.3pc last year.
The second person said that Trump had little leverage over Putin and suggested that even if Washington imposed tariffs on the purchasers of Russian crude, then Moscow would still find a way to sell it to world markets.
“Putin understands that Trump is an unpredictable person who may do unpleasant things, but he is manoeuvring to avoid irritating him too much,” the source said.
Looking ahead, one of the sources said there was likely to be an escalation of the crisis in the coming months, and unscored the dangers of tensions between the world’s two largest nuclear powers. And, he predicted, the war would continue.</p><small>2025-07-15 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/15220221c2bf6fe.jpg?r=220334' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924397/gujranwala-court-dismisses-post-arrest-bail-plea-of-ahmadi-man-held-for-distributing-muharram-niaz' target='_blank'><strong>Gujranwala court dismisses post-arrest bail plea of Ahmadi man held for ‘distributing Muharram Niaz’</strong></a><br><p>A Gujranwala court on Tuesday dismissed the post-arrest bail petition of an Ahmadiyya community member, who was arrested on blasphemy charges for distributing Niaz (free food and drinks) on the 10th of Muharram (Youm-i-Ashur).
The first information report (FIR) against the suspect was lodged with the Satellite Town police station in Punjab’s Gujranwala city on the complaint of a Hafizabad Road resident under Section 298(C) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), which criminalises certain acts by members of the Ahmadi community, including calling themselves Muslims or referring to their faith as Islam.
In the FIR, the complainant said the incident took place on July 6 at 4:30pm when he saw the suspect distributing free food and drink during Muharram, “posing as a Muslim”. The Ahmadi man was subsequently arrested and sent on judicial remand.
Gujranwala Judicial Magistrate Sidra Gul Nawaz presided over a hearing for the man’s post-arrest bail plea today.
The court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said that the suspect was “found guilty” during the investigation and “sufficient material has come on record connecting him with the commission of the offence”, adding that a large silver cooking pot with chicken biryani was recovered from him.
It also pointed out that the offence under Section 298(C) was related to matters concerning the religious sentiments of a particular community and carried “serious repercussions for law and order”.
Thus, the order said that as a “necessary corollary” of the above, the post-arrest bail plea was dismissed.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman had condemned the Ahmadi man’s arrest and expressed hope that the government would annul the FIR.
Last month, the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) asked the Punjab police chief to prevent the Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and take action against its members if found violating the law.
In a letter, the LHCBA said that the followers of other religions and sects — especially the Ahmadis — are neither legally nor religiously permitted to use Islamic symbols and practices.
In March, the Human Rights Com­­mission of Pakistan (HRCP) said it had observed a growing trend of mob-led attacks on homes of families belonging to religious minorities, as well as their places of worship.
The HRCP also spoke of Ahmadis’ “arbitrary detention”, “desecration of their graves” and the “vulnerability of Hindu and Christian women” to forced conversion.
The report, titled Under Siege: Freedom of Religion or Belief in 2023-24, said over 750 persons were in prison on charges of blasphemy, as of October last year. It documented at least four faith-based killings, three of which targeted the Ahmadi community.
One of the key findings of the report said that disinformation on social media sparked most of the registered blasphemy cases.
HRCP observed an “increasing weaponisation of blasphe­­my laws against Ahmadis”, with cases often initiated by law enforcement officials themselves.</p><small>2025-07-15 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614156-pm-shehbaz-meets-president-zardari-discusses-political-and-economic-situation' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with President Zardari, PM Shehbaz discusses political and economic situation</strong></a><br><p>

A statement issued by the Presidency said the two held a meeting today at the President House.
“The meeting involved discussions on the country’s political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed.
“The prime minister briefed the president on the government’s measures to improve the economy. Both leaders reiterated their commitment to work together for the country’s stability, development, and prosperity,” the statement said.
The meeting was also attended by Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Law  Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Interior  Minister Mohsin Naqvi and PM’s Adviser on Political and Public Affairs Rana Sanaullah.
 






 
 

The meeting comes in the wake of growing speculation about the upcoming 27th constitutional amendment and it being claimed that President Zardari may soon step down, potentially paving the way for the army chief to assume the country’s presidency.
The reports on social media claim that work is underway to replace the current parliamentary system with a presidential form of government. Some reports also claim that President Zardari has set one condition for his exit — a key role for his son Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari in the new dispensation.
Naqvi said earlier this month that there were no plans to remove President Zardari and dismissed the reports about any such move.
 
 

He had to dismiss the reports again last week, claiming that the country was shifting to a presidential system and that Field Marshal Asim Munir would replace Zardari as head of state.
“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the chief of army staff (COAS). I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion — nor does any such idea exist — about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” Naqvi had posted on X.
He said the president enjoyed a strong and respe­ctful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces. “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”

Pakistan and Indonesia maintain strong bilateral relations rooted in shared religion and culture, with both countries cooperating in trade, education, and health.
Gen Sjamsoeddin called on PM Shehbaz at the PM Office today, where he reiterated Indonesia’s desire to “further strengthen defence ties with Pakistan and to explore possible areas for cooperation, especially in defence production”, according to a statement from government-run PID.
 






The Indonesian minister conveyed the best wishes of President Prabowo Subianto for the prime minister and people of Pakistan, the press release added.
Meanwhile, PM Shehbaz “reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to explore and expand collaboration with Indonesia in joint ventures of investment in mutually beneficial projects”, the statement said.
The prime minister also reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to enhance bilateral cooperation with Indonesia in all avenues, including economic, strategic and trade sectors, along with defence and defence production.
He highlighted that Pakistan and Indonesia enjoyed a “longstanding friendship rooted in shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, supporting each other at international forums”.
Both sides stressed the importance of “enhancing multifaceted bilateral cooperation”, according to the PID.
“The meeting underscored the deep-rooted historical, brotherly and friendly bilateral relations between Pakistan and Indonesia,” the statement noted.
Recalling his meeting last year with Indonesia’s President Prabowo Subianto on the sidelines of Developing-8 Summit in Cairo, PM Shehbaz conveyed his best wishes for the Indonesian president.
The prime minister also reviewed ongoing initiatives under the Pakistan-Indonesia Defence Cooperation Agreement and agreed to “accelerate the implementation of key areas of mutual interest”, the PID added.
Gen Sjamsoeddin later met Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir at General Headquarters.
Both sides exchanged views on bilateral defence collaboration, regional security dynamics and avenues to further strengthen military ties.
“The meeting underscored the longstanding friendship and cooperation between the two countries. Field marshal highlighted the importance of mutual cooperation in maintaining peace and stability in the region,” said a press release from the Inter-Services Public Relations.
Gen Sjamsoeddin appreciated the role of the Pakistan Army in the fight against terrorism and reaffirmed Indonesia’s commitment to enhancing defence relations with Pakistan.
 






In June, the two countries decided to increase cooperation in areas such as vaccine production in Pakistan, the establishment of medical institutions in Indonesia, pharmaceutical development and human resource exchange.

The SCO is a 10-nation Eurasian security and political grouping whose members include China, Russia, Pakistan, India, and Iran. The group’s foreign ministers meet as a precursor to the annual summit of its leaders, which will be hosted by China this autumn in Tianjin.
On June 13, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign on Iran that targeted military and nuclear sites as well as residential areas, and killed senior military commanders, nuclear scientists and civilians. The attacks began days before a planned meeting between Tehran and Washington aimed at reviving nuclear negotiations. The US, which had been in talks with Iran since April 12, joined Israel in carrying out its own strikes on June 22, targeting Iranian nuclear sites at Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz. Iranian authorities say the Israeli strikes killed at least 1,060 people.
Addressing the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers today, Dar said: “We have strongly condemned the unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel against the Islamic Republic of Iran and the US strikes on its nuclear facilities. Such illegal actions directed against SCO member states are unacceptable.”
Continuing his criticism of Israel, he said: “Israel has shown a reckless disregard for international norms and humanity through its relentless and disproportionate use of force in Gaza, resulting in the death of tens of thousands of civilians causing the worst humanitarian crisis in Gaza. We call for immediate halt to Israel’s atrocities. The only viable remedy to Palestine dispute is the realisation of two-state solution which includes the establishment of Palestine as a viable, secure and contiguous state on the basis of pre-1967 borders with Al Quds as its capital.
“Unilateral and illegal measures to change the status of disputed territories in violation of UN Security Council resolutions must be strongly condemned and opposed by all.”

Dar said Pakistan was “increasingly concerned at the trends of using aggression as a tool of policy.”
Instead, he called for the resolution of longstanding disputes through peaceful means, dialogue, diplomacy and according to the principles of international law, justice and fairness.
 






On regional issues, FM Dar said Pakistan sought a relationship of peace and stability with all its neighbours.
“However, the last three months witnessed extremely disturbing developments in South Asia. It is most unfortunate that the attribution of the Pahalgam Attack to Pakistan — without a credible investigation or verifiable evidence — brought the two nuclear-armed states to the brink of a major conflict. In the wake of mounting tensions, Pakistan’s restrained and responsible approach was met with legal transgressions, rhetorical belligerence, and strategic recklessness.
“Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to the ceasefire and the cultivation of a stable regional equilibrium. However, we cannot accept that the arbitrary use of force is normalised. We believe that disputes and differences are resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, instead of conflict and coercion. In that backdrop, initiation of a comprehensive and structured dialogue can meaningfully address the full spectrum of issues that have long bedevilled the peace and security in South Asia. Strict adherence to bilateral agreements would be equally important in this regard.”
He said the events unfolding in the region since the April 22 terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam reaffirmed a “central truth” of South Asian geopolitics: the peaceful settlement of longstanding unresolved disputes was “imperative for an enduring peace” in the region.
Dar added that enduring peace and stability in Afghanistan also constituted a cornerstone of the SCO members’ shared aspiration. He pointed out that the revival of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group could serve as a valuable platform for pragmatic and results-oriented cooperation.
“Terrorism is the common concern of humanity that threatens global security. All forms of terrorism, including state terrorism are condemnable. We must shun the use of terrorism for political purposes and combat this menace through a cooperative approach, including addressing its root causes.”
He said the SCO was a vital platform for realising the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), pointing out that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a flagship BRI project, not only supplemented the SCO’s vision of regional connectivity and economic integration but also complemented its common objective of shared development and prosperity.
“We need to take concrete steps within existing SCO’s mechanisms for trade and development and promote the use of national currencies for mutual settlement within SCO region to avoid international financial shocks. We support the proposal to create SCO alternative development funding mechanism to give needed impetus to various stalled development initiatives.
“As the permanent chair of the SCO’s Special Working Group dedicated to combatting poverty, Pakistan is fully committed to providing the necessary momentum to our collaborative endeavours to address poverty.”
Dar called on the SCO members to also collectively address the “existential threat” of climate change.
 


“At a time when the global order is experiencing profound challenges, SCO has emerged as a stabilising force. Its inclusive approach underscoring the sovereign equality of states and seeking peaceful resolutions to disputes, offers a compelling alternative to aggression, confrontation and zero-sum rivalries. The SCO’s commitment to consensus, development, and mutual respect is a beacon of hope for building a better and equitable world.”
Stressing Pakistan’s commitment to the organisation and its principles, Dar said: “In our pursuit to peace and security, we believe in non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, non-use of force or threat of its use in international relations, as well as seeking no unilateral military superiority in the region.”
In a post on X after the meeting, Dar said: “At the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers meeting today, we reaffirmed our shared commitment to multilateralism, mutual respect and regional stability. The Shanghai Spirit continues to guide us towards dialogue, mutual trust and the pursuit of a more just and inclusive international order.”
 






Meeting with Xi
Earlier today, Dar met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing as he represented Pakistan in a joint call of the SCO foreign ministers.
In a post on X, the deputy PM said he was “delighted” to meet with Xi and conveyed the “warm greetings of the leadership, government and people of Pakistan”.
“As iron-clad brothers and all-weather strategic cooperative partners, we remain committed to deepening Pak-China enduring friendship and advancing shared regional goals,” he posted on X.
 






The Chinese president, welcoming the heads of delegations, underlined the “salience of regional cooperation” under the ambit of the SCO, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Mofa).
Shortly later, Dar arrived in Tianjin along with other foreign ministers to lead Pakistan’s delegation to the SCO Council of Foreign Ministers’ meeting, according to Mofa.
 






The deputy premier arrived in Beijing last night, where he was received at the airport by Ambassador Yu Hong and other senior officials of the Asian Affairs department of China’s Mofa, as well as Pakistan’s ambassador to China, Khalil ur Rehman Hashmi.
India’s Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Russia’s Sergei Lavrov and Iran’s Abbas Araghchi are among the top diplomats arriving in Beijing for the SCO moot.
Meetings with SCO members’ ministers
Dar also met with the foreign ministers of various SCO member states on the sidelines of the joint call on Xi.
“Always good to exchange views for strengthening regional understanding and cooperation in such a challenging time,” he said on X about his meeting with his Iran, Uzbekistan and Belarus counterparts.
 






“Both leaders reviewed bilateral cooperation across diverse areas and discussed the evolving regional situation following the recent Israeli aggression against Iran,” the Foreign Office said of FM Dar’s meeting with his Iranian counterpart.
 






Da also met Russian FM Sergei Lavrov. “Both sides expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties and agreed to further enhance cooperation in trade, energy, agriculture and defence,” the FO said, with Dar reiterated the invitation for FM Lavrov to visit Pakistan.
 






In separate meetings with Kazakhistan FM Murat Nurtleu and Kyrgyzstan’s Zheenbek Moldokanovic, Dar and the ministers reaffirmed a commitment to the enhancement of positive bilateral ties and expanding collaboration across areas of interest.
According to an earlier statement from the Mofa, Dar is set to hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from the SCO member states during his visit to China.

The camel, now named Cammie, had her front leg allegedly chopped off by a landlord in June 2024, as punishment for foraging in his field for fodder, for which six suspects were remanded.
She was taken in by the Comprehensive Disaster Response Services (CDRS) Benji Project for Animal Welfare in Karachi, where she has spent over a year.
Today, the shelter provided an update that Cammie had stood up for the first time since her mutilation, along with a video showing her getting used to walking with her new prosthetic leg.
“It’s been a year of tears, setbacks, rehab, pain, and quiet perseverance. A year where we were told to give up, to move on, to stop delaying the inevitable. But we chose to stand by her. And today, she stood for us all.”
The shelter thanked its team and supporters, as well as PPP MNA Shazia Marri, PPP Senator Quratulain Marri and the Sindh government for their “unwavering support and trust in [the team’s] mission”. The Sindh government had previously committed to covering the cost of the treatment.
Both sisters had taken stern notice of the camel mutilation incident. In a joint statement last year, they said that veterinary doctors referred them to CDRS, and rescuing the camel was a “joint effort”.
Shazia said today that there was “no greater feeling than when months of hard work, care and consistent efforts pay off!” while the latter said: “Dedicated service over momentary outrage any day. You stuck to this long after the temporarily infuriated had forgotten her existence. Everyone on the team who continues to care for Cammie - they are the superstars!”
 






The shelter also thanked the founder of Bionic Pets, Derrick Campana, who designed and created the custom prosthetic to fit Cammie.
“We still have a long road ahead as Cammie adjusts to her prosthetic, but today is for celebration, for hope, and for all the silent victories that happen when you refuse to give up,” the shelter said.
 
 

Pakistan has almost no animal welfare policy or service in place. The most prominent law for animal protection, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (1890) — which dates back to the colonial era — is limited in scope and lacks understanding of animal welfare in today’s context.
The federal government did pass a law in 2018, increasing the fines for animal cruelty. It increased the maximum fine to Rs100,000 for animal cruelty, which had remained at the Rs50 level since the law was first passed in 1890, for first-time offenders. The minimum fine was raised to Rs10,000. There was a similar increase in fines for other offences against animals.
However, the law is only applicable in the federal capital, and does not extend to the rest of Pakistan. This is because animal welfare became a provincial subject after the 18th Amendment, and provinces are required to enact their own laws.
That is yet to happen, resulting in punishment for offences against animals in the rest of Pakistan staying the same as they were under the 1890 law.</p><small>2025-07-15 14:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614133-disqualification-row-pa-speaker-halts-action-against-oppositions-lawmakers' target='_blank'><strong>Disqualification row: PA speaker 'halts' action against opposition's lawmakers</strong></a><br><p>

A few days ago, a video of Sajid riding a motorcycle in the rain went viral on social media, in which he could be heard using abusive language against the chief minister.
A sessions court on Monday sought a reply from Johar Town police on a habeas corpus petition seeking his recovery. Sajid’s son Muhammad Umar had filed the petition for the recovery of his father.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, “No incriminating evidence is present against the accused person to be sent to judicial remand.
“Hence, the request of the investigating officer (IO) has been turned down, the accused person is discharged from the instant case … first information report, and the IO is ordered to release the person forthwith”.
The Lahore court discharged Sajid after he was nominated in a June 2024 case filed by the Green Town police station. Police subsequently released the senior citizen from handcuffs.
Police had arrested the citizen on July 14, according to a request for his judicial remand and presented him in the Model Town court today.
The accused’s counsel, Advocate Noman Sarwar Dogar, argued that his client had been wrongfully nominated in the 2024 FIR by the police.
The court observed in its order that all the facts and circumstances of the case create doubt in the police’s version of events.
In the habeas corpus case, the petitioner, Advocate Sameer Khan Khattak, alleged that Johar Town police had illegally detained his client’s father for the past two days.
He had claimed that Sajid had been arrested without any registered case and had not been produced before any court.
The counsel also stated that the police had forced the petitioner’s father to record apology videos, which were later circulated on social media.
He asked the court to order the recovery and release of the petitioner’s father.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Ghulam Farid had issued a notice to the Johar Town station house officer and directed him to file a reply by July 15.</p><small>2025-07-15 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151801062ea01ab.jpg?r=180146' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924360/fact-check-china-has-not-removed-pakistan-from-list-of-countries-with-visa-free-entry-pakistan-was-never-part-of-the-list' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: China has not removed Pakistan from list of countries with visa-free entry; Pakistan was never part of the list</strong></a><br><p>Posts from users and Indian accounts on social media platform X on Monday were claiming that China has removed Pakistan from its list of countries allowed visa-free entry. However, no such development has occurred since Pakistan was never included in China’s list of countries with visa-free entry.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation, and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors, including trade, energy, infrastructure, and media collaboration, with initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor symbolising a shared vision for development.
On July 14, a user, who appears to be a PTI supporter based on his previous posts, claimed in a post on X that China has removed Pakistan from its list of visa-free countries.
A social media graphic from a news outlet accompanying the post reads: “China just announced visa-free entry for 74 countries, but Pakistan didn’t make the list.”
The post garnered over 19,000 views.
The same post was shared by several other PTI supporters as well, as can be seen here, here, here, here, and here, gaining over 18,000 collective views.
The same claim was shared on X by an Afghan-based user, gaining over 95,000 views.
The same claim was also circulated by several Indian accounts, with individual posts garnering over 557,000, 180,000, 27,000, 24,000, and 14,000 views, respectively.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in matters related to Pakistan-China relations.
To investigate the claim, the July 9 news article published by Media Bites, whose social media graphic was being shared, was reviewed.
The news report was titled: “China offers 30-day visa-free access to citizens of 74 countries, but Pakistan misses out”.
The story cited US-based news outlet ABC News, which reproduced a report by US wire news agency The Associated Press (AP)
AP published the report on July 9 with the following headline: “Citizens of more than 70 countries can now visit China without a visa.”
According to the report, China has expanded its visa-free policy to allow citizens of 74 countries to enter for up to 30 days without a visa as part of efforts to boost tourism and strengthen its global image. The list includes most European countries, such as France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, along with select nations from Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Additionally, citizens of 10 other countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, are eligible for a 10-day entry under China’s limited transit visa policy.
Pakistan was not mentioned anywhere in the report as being removed from the list of countries.
Checking the official website of the China Visa Application Centre Islamabad showed that not only does it mention the various types of visas that Pakistanis can apply for, but also, its page of the online visa application procedure was last updated June 24 — well before the July 9 AP report.
The procedure shows the detailed steps and documentation needed to apply for a Chinese visa, confirming that Pakistan has always required a visa to enter China and was never among the countries granted visa-free entry.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that China has removed Pakistan from its list of visa-free countries is misleading.
Pakistan has not been removed from any list because it was never among those countries with visa-free entry in China and Pakistanis have always been required to apply for various types of visas to gain entry. While Pakistan was not included in the recent list, omitting the fact that Pakistanis have always required a visa for entry in China has the potential to misguide the public into thinking it is a new development or that Pakistan has been removed.

In its latest report on Pakistan’s Digital Ecosystem issued yesterday, the ADB cautioned that steep and inconsistent taxes on digital infrastructure in the country pose a serious risk to foreign investment, growth, and the expansion of digital services.
“Pakistan’s digital infrastructure faces a major challenge from high taxation. Taxes on this sector, both federal and provincial, are some of the highest globally and regionally, and the tax policies tend not to be very consistent,” the report said.
“The cost of service provision exacerbates the digital divide, especially for women and marginalised groups, who face asymmetric cost and cultural barriers to accessing the internet.”
The report further added that the telecom sector in Pakistan “experienced a decline in revenues and foreign investment, which reflects a very challenging business environment”.
It called for a “renewed focus is needed by the government on engaging with investors and industry stakeholders to address their concerns and provide incentives and facilitation to invest and operate in the country”.
In its recommendations on the digital economy, the report also advised to cut corporate income tax rates and the cost of doing business for SMEs by 10pc for the next 10 years, conditional on the businesses registering themselves and using digital platforms for their transactions.
Other recommendations included simplifying taxation and foreign exchange regimes for ICT export companies; capping income tax for staff of ICT-export companies to 15pc; tax credits for women-led digital businesses; single window regulation; providing low-interest loans; and mandating through the State Bank of Pakistan that commercial banks allocate at least 15pc of their loan portfolios to SMEs with a minimum of 50pc emphasis on digital and ICT businesses.
The ADB urged the government to “rationalise all digital infrastructure taxes, both direct and indirect, making them competitive against a basket of countries, and fix sector tax rates for at least 10 years”.
Pakistan currently has 56.5pc broadband penetration with 137 million subscriptions. Every province charges a regressive sales tax of 19.5pc on internet service usage which is higher than any other service, ADB added.
“High capital investment; regulatory obstacles; costly and cumbersome Right of Way (RoW) arrangements; and high, unpredictable taxes hinder new investments in Pakistan’s digital infrastructure,” the report stated.
Pakistan has the world’s lowest average revenue per user due to fierce competition among service providers, the report noted, adding that revenues of operators and telecom companies have been “shrinking” in real terms.
It recommended mandating a flat countrywide optimal RoW fee per meter — permission granted to telecom companies to install and maintain their infrastructure (like fiber optic cables, mobile towers, etc) — and provide for a predictable rise over a longer period.
It also recommended prioritising early-stage investments in digital infrastructure projects, promote local manufacturing of smartphones, and provide 3pc research and development allowance on exports of locally produced smartphones.
The ADB advised the government to create a “robust enabling legal and regulatory framework for development and implementation of public–private partnerships (PPPs) for digital infrastructure”.
It also called for expanding internet access and device ownership for citizens, especially women, working with local and global partners to design tailored PPP programmes, and providing low-cost or easy installment-based smartphones.</p><small>2025-07-15 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151459089314149.jpg?r=150306' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924364/4-of-a-family-among-5-killed-in-karachi-road-accidents' target='_blank'><strong>‘4 of a family’ among 5 killed in Karachi road accidents</strong></a><br><p>Five people — four from the same family — were killed in two separate road accidents in Karachi on Tuesday, according to police and rescue officials.
The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
At least four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall next to a nullah on Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area, according to Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza.
DIG Raza speculated that the family was most likely returning from the Hawke’s Bay beach. The incident took place at 9am on Tuesday, he added.
“The accident most likely happened as a result of speeding,” said the DIG, adding that further investigation was underway.
The deceased included a man and woman — identified as Yousuf and Khalida — along with two children, six-year-old Zainab and 10-year-old Ayesha.
The injured were taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, three of whom were in critical condition, according to Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
 
 

In a separate incident, a collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway, according to rescue officials.
The injured were rushed to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, as per rescue officials.
The deceased has been identified as 39-year-old Gaya Chand, rescue officials said.
On June 19, a speeding dumper truck overturned on a 4x4 vehicle on Rashid Minhas Road, killing a woman and an accompanying five-year-old girl.
On June 11, a young man was killed and his wife injured in an accident after an unknown vehicle hit their bike on the Super Highway.

On April 22, 26 tourists were killed at a hill station in India-occupied Kashmir’s (IoK) Pahalgam. India has blamed Pakistan for the horrific attack, an accusation the latter denies. Islamabad has called for an international independent probe into the massacre.
In an interview with the Times of India on Monday, IoK Lieutenant Governor and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Manoj Sinha said, “I take full responsibility for the incident, which was undoubtedly a security failure.”
In response to the admission, numerous Indian politicians slammed him for negligence and for his delay in taking accountability and called for his resignation.
The Indian National Congress |(INC) suggested that Sinha intended to shield “unspecified officials” in the union government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, The Wire reported.
Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera said in a post on X, “He (Sinha) finally takes responsibility for Pahalgam after 82 days of the attack. In doing so, who is he protecting in Delhi? How many days, weeks, months to also be held accountable and resign or get sacked?”
 






Similarly, INC national spokesperson, Shama Mohamed asked: “Since [Sinha] has taken full responsibility for the security lapse during the Pahalgam attack — when is he resigning? In a democracy, the next step after taking the responsibility is resignation!”
 






Meanwhile, Imran Nabi Dar, spokesperson for IoK ruling party National Conference, told The Wire that the “next logical step for him (Sinha) should be to step down and apologise to the people of Jammu and Kashmir whose lives, livelihood and dignity were put at stake due to his blunders”.
The Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and general secretary MY Tarigami said that his party had been demanding accountability from the union government since the attack. He called for the government to provide details about the lapses that resulted in the deaths of 26 civilians.
“All those responsible should be held accountable. Acceptance means certain action against those who have committed such a grave mistake,” he was quoted as saying by the report.
PPP Senator Sherry Rehman also reacted to the interview today, saying the admission came “well after two months and after going to a whole war over it”.
She added, “The opposition in the Lok Sabha should really take down this regime for the spectacular incompetence that jeopardised Indian lives, credibility and reputation. The momentum is right there.”
 






New Delhi ‘lied’ to public about Pahalgam attack
In an exclusive interview with Indian journalist Karan Thapar last week, PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had said the Indian public was “lied to” by New Delhi about Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the Pahalgam attack.
In an interview with The Wire’s Thapar, the PPP chief said that had Pakistan been involved in the attack, evidence would have surfaced and the perpetrators identified.
“As far as the Pahalgam terrorist attack is concerned, Pakistan has been willing to be part of an impartial international investigation; your government refused that,” Bilawal said.
“To this day, the Indian government has not shared with Pakistan, with the international community, with the Indian public … who exactly are these individuals that were involved in this terrorist attack that are from Pakistan?”
When pressed on the issue, Bilawal said that if Pakistan was truly involved, the international community would endorse India’s perspective.
“It’s very uncomfortable for you that I point out the truth to the Indian public, that they have been lied to … that Pakistan was involved in this attack when we were not,” he asserted.
“The government has been unable to provide the evidence. That’s why during this war, the Indian media and the Indian government launched a campaign of disinformation to continue to bamboozle the people of India,” he added.</p><small>2025-07-15 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/151159287a3405e.jpg?r=120425' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924347/psx-breaks-record-rally-sheds-500-points' target='_blank'><strong>PSX breaks record rally, sheds 500 points</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) plunged over 500 points on Tuesday, failing to continue its upward trajectory despite crossing the 137,000 barrier in intra-day trading.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,237.03 points, or 0.91 per cent, to stand at 137,739.56 points at 11:39am, from the previous close of 136,502.53 points.
Finally, it closed at 135,939.87 points — dropping 562.66 points, or 0.41pc, from yesterday’s close.
The market had opened on a positive note, rising by 1,205.1 points, or 0.88pc, to reach 137,707.63 points at 9:45am. It then dropped to 136,498.16 points at 10:15am before regaining its bullish momentum.
Earlier today, Samiullah Tariq, head of Research and Development at Pakistan Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, had attributed the early gains to strengthened macroeconomic indicators.
“Improvement in macroeconomic indicators and better result expectations, especially in commercial banks, is the primary reason for the increase in the [stock] market,” he told Dawn.com.
Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said: “Investors are booking profits in companies that posted significant returns during the recent bull run, while delays in clarity regarding the clearance of circular debt payments have kept energy sector stocks under pressure.”
He said the recent rally was “likely to continue, supported by attractive stock valuations and expectations of further monetary easing”.
Yesterday, the PSX had continued its upward trend from last week, crossing the 136,500 level due to value-hunting by investors and optimism over strong corporate earnings.
The rally was supported by active participation from local mutual funds and institutional investors.
 
 

A surge in workers’ remittances, robust auto sales, and improved foreign exchange reserves provided a solid backdrop for investor optimism, helping offset subdued participation and minor currency depreciation.
Workers’ remittances rose to a historic $3.4bn in June, up 8pc year-on-year, taking full-year FY25 inflows to a record $38.3bn — a 27pc increase over the previous year. The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves surged by $1.8bn to $14.5bn for the week ending July 4, marking a 39-month high.
The previous week saw the stock market continue its record-breaking bullish run, crossing the 134,000-point threshold amid strong macroeconomic fundamentals and persistent buying by local mutual funds.</p><small>2025-07-15 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614116-facilities-imran-khan-is-availing-at-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Facilities Imran Khan is availing at Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>

China and India should “adhere to the direction of good-neighbourliness and friendship” and “find a way for mutual respect and trust, peaceful coexistence, common development and win-win cooperation”, Wang said, according to Xinhua.
The two foreign ministers met in Beijing on Monday as the two rivals seek to repair ties following a 2020 clash on their border.
The world’s two most populous nations are intense rivals competing for strategic influence across South Asia, and their 3,500-kilometre frontier has been a perennial source of tension.
The 2020 clash between their troops led to a four-year military standoff, but they agreed in October on patrols in disputed areas.
India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and China’s President Xi Jinping met for the first time in five years later that month, agreeing to work on improving relations.
New Delhi is concerned over Beijing’s increasing presence in the Indian Ocean, seeing the region as firmly within its sphere of influence.
Another source of tension is the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader India has hosted since he and thousands of other Tibetans fled Chinese troops who crushed an uprising in their capital Lhasa in 1959.
The 90-year-old Dalai Lama says only his India-based organisation has the right to identify his eventual successor.
China insists that it would have the final say on who succeeds the Tibetan spiritual leader.</p><small>2025-07-15 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614105-ecp-disqualifies-mna-jamshed-dasti-over-fake-degree' target='_blank'><strong>ECP disqualifies MNA Jamshed Dasti over fake degree</strong></a><br><p>

The announcement came just a day after the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and decided to establish the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
In a statement today, the British High Commission (BHC) in Islamabad said: “The UK Government is replacing physical immigration documents for most student and worker visas with a digital proof of immigration status, an e-visa.”
British High Commissioner Jane Marriott said on X that the facility was for “most students and workers applying for more than 6 months”.
 






An e-visa is an online record of a person’s immigration permission in the UK and will make the visa process easier and more secure, the BHC noted in its statement.
“E-visas are tried and tested, with millions of people already using them on select immigration routes,” it highlighted.
Students and workers who intend to stay in the UK for a period longer than six months will be eligible to apply for the e-visa. The UK government plans to expand the scheme to all visa applications, according to the statement.
In 2024, the UK government announced that the country’s immigration system was transitioning to a fully digital format, replacing physical documents with an online immigration system.
The BHC outlined the following eligibility criteria for the e-visa:

Students, including short-term study for 11 months
Global Business Mobility routes (specifically, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Service Supplier, Secondment Worker)  
Global Talent   
International Sportsperson   
Skilled Worker (including health and care)  
Temporary Work routes (specifically, Charity Worker, Creative Worker, Government Authorised Exchange, International Agreement, and Religious work routes) 
Youth Mobility Scheme  

Applicants applying as dependents or for visas other than study or work, eg. general visitor visa, will still need a physical visa, the statement noted.
Those with existing in-date physical visas do not need to take any action.
Marriott noted that the changes were set to make the visa process simpler for students and workers. “It also means applicants can hold onto their passports, saving time,” she pointed out.
 
 

She clarified that updating from a physical visa to an e-visa will have no impact on a person’s present immigration status.
“Holders can link their travel document (such as passport) to their UKVI (UK Visas and Immigration) account to facilitate straightforward international travel,” the statement read.
The UKVI — introduced in 2024 — is an account that visa holders staying in the UK for longer than six months are required to create. It serves as an online record of people’s immigration status.</p><small>2025-07-15 09:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614086-fm-dar-meets-iron-clad-brother-president-xi-as-sco-leaders-converge-in-beijing' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar meets 'iron-clad brother' President Xi as SCO leaders converge in Beijing</strong></a><br><p>

The store opened its doors to select visitors after its inauguration by Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in India’s financial capital Mumbai.
Tesla has for years signalled its interest in India but held back due to the country’s steep tariffs on electric vehicles.
 
 

Musk, who once described India as having “more promise than any large
country”, has also criticised its import duties, calling them among the “highest in the world”.
New Delhi has offered to cut import taxes on electric vehicles for global automakers only if they commit to investing hundreds of millions of dollars and make cars locally.
Tesla has yet to announce plans to set up a plant in India.
For now, local media reports say, the company will likely sell cars imported from China, with deliveries projected to start from late August.
Its Model Y variants start from an on-road price of around $70,000 in India, according to its website, compared with a US price of $37,490 after a $7,500 federal tax credit.
Tesla’s India debut comes at a critical time for the company, which is seeing demand wane for its cars in countries around the world.
The recent slump in Tesla’s sales partly reflects the highly competitive nature of the EV market, which the company once dominated but now also features BYD and other low-cost Chinese players.
While Tesla is looking to tap the world’s third-biggest car market, experts say it is unlikely to see huge volumes in the short term due to the nascent nature of India’s EV industry and the hefty price tag of its vehicles.
India’s EV market is fast-growing but remains small, with automakers reporting sales of around 100,000 vehicles in 2024 or less than three per cent of total car sales.

Soumen Mandal, a senior analyst at Counterpoint, said the high price tag will likely place it out of the price range of most Indian customers and see it compete against offerings from luxury carmakers instead.
“We don’t expect Tesla to play the volume game right away given the price tag,” Mandal told AFP.
“We project 500-700 units sold in the initial months and then that to taper off to 200-300 (per month).”
India is currently negotiating a trade deal with the United States, including a potential reduction in tariffs on automobiles.
In February, Musk held a one-on-one meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Washington.</p><small>2025-07-15 08:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/614077-in-meeting-with-naqvi-iranian-president-warns-of-israels-attempts-to-divide-muslim-world' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Naqvi, Iranian president warns of Israel's attempts to divide Muslim world</strong></a><br><p>

The conservative-dominated court, in an unsigned order, lifted a stay that had been placed by a federal district judge on mass layoffs at the department.
The three liberal justices on the nine-member panel dissented.
Trump pledged during his White House campaign to eliminate the Education Department, which was created by an act of Congress in 1979, and he moved in March to slash its workforce by nearly half.
Trump instructed Education Secretary Linda McMahon to “put herself out of a job”.
 






Around 20 states joined teachers’ unions in challenging the move in court, arguing that the Republican president was violating the principle of separation of powers by encroaching on Congress’s prerogatives.
In May, District Judge Myong Joun ordered the reinstatement of hundreds of fired Education Department employees.
The supreme court lifted the judge’s order without explanation, just days after another ruling that cleared the way for Trump to carry out mass firings of federal workers in other government departments.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a dissent joined by justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, said in the Education ruling that “only Congress has the power to abolish the Department”.
“The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naïve, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave,” Sotomayor said.
Traditionally, the federal government has had a limited role in education in the US, with only about 13 per cent of funding for primary and secondary schools coming from federal coffers, the rest being funded by states and local communities.
But federal funding is invaluable for low-income schools and students with special needs. And the federal government has been essential in enforcing key civil rights protections for students.
 
 

After returning to the White House in January, Trump directed federal agencies to prepare sweeping workforce reduction plans as part of wider efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) — previously headed by Elon Musk — to downsize the government.
Trump has moved to fire tens of thousands of government employees and slash programmes — targeting diversity initiatives and abolishing the Education Department, the US humanitarian aid agency USAID and others.</p><small>2025-07-15 06:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/1507520242280c9.jpg?r=075208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1924275/ecp-seeks-kp-assembly-session-to-swear-in-mpas-on-reserved-seats' target='_blank'><strong>ECP seeks KP Assembly session to swear in MPAs on reserved seats</strong></a><br><p>• Writes to KP governor, chief minister; says delay in oath taking would prevent it from holding Senate elections on schedule
• Commission reserves verdict on plea seeking redistribution of reserved seats in provincial assembly
ISLAMABAD: With Senate elections in Kh­yber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) just a week away, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has written to the province’s governor and chief minister, asking that the provincial assembly be convened immediately so that new members can be sworn in on reserved seats.
Also on Monday, the ECP reserved its verdict in a case related to reallocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly.
The letter, addressed to the KP governor’s principal secretary, stated that the commission was obligated to conduct Senate elections in the province, which had been set for July 21.
“But the matter of administration of oath is still pending and dela­yed,” it said.
The correspondence no­ted that the KP Asse­mbly speaker was requ­ested to administer the oath to the newly returned candidates, enabling them to complete the electoral college for Senate elections.
In response, the speaker has conveyed that the oath will be administered when the assembly is in session.
“The Commission has also received a copy of the letter of the Leader of the Opposition, attached with the application submitted by Mr Suresh Kumar MPA and others in this Comm­ission, wherein the Spe­aker has stated that neither the Constitution nor the Provincial Asse­mbly of Khy­ber Pakht­unkhwa Proce­dure and Con­duct of Business Rules, 1988, contain any provision empowering the Speaker to summon a session of Assembly on his own,” it said.
Noting that the administration of oaths has already been delayed considerably, it asked the governor to summon the assembly at the earliest.
Through another letter, the KP chief minister has been requested to issue advice to the governor to summon the assembly immediately, so that new members can take oath and the Senate elections can be held.
Verdict reserved
Meanwhile, an ECP bench, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, reserved its verdict in a case related to the re-allocation of reserved seats in the KP Assembly, after hearing arguments from all parties.
Five political parties — the PML-N, PPP, JUI-F, Awami National Party and PTI-Parliamentarians — and 71 individuals had been issued notices, as the ECP fixed the case for hearing after receiving the order of the Peshawar High Court.
The PHC had on July 8 ordered the ECP to redistribute reserved seats after hearing all parties, while declaring the ECP’s notifications on distribution of reserved seats of KP Assembly null and void. The PHC verdict came on a petition filed by the PML-N.
Later, talking to reporters, JUI-F counsel Senator Kamran Murtaza said the PML-N was demanding a greater share of reserved seats after independent candidate, Tariq Awan, joined the party belatedly.
Mr Murtaza said that an independent lawmaker who joins a political party after the time stipulated in the law has expired, continues to be an independent, and this in no way affects the share of a political party in terms of reserved seats.
The PTI-led government currently holds 92 seats in the KP Assembly, while the opposition, which was only able to win 18 out of the total of 115 general seats, has seen its numbers swell to 53.

Muhammad Umar filed the petition for the recovery of his father, Muhammad Sajid.
Representing the petitioner, Advocate Sameer Khan Khattak alleged that Johar Town police had illegally detained his client’s father for the past two days.
He claimed that Sajid had been arrested without any registered case and had not been produced before any court.
The counsel also stated that the police had forced the petitioner’s father to record apology videos, which were later circulated on social media.
He asked the court to order the recovery and release of the petitioner’s father.
Additional District & Sessions Judge Ghulam Farid issued a notice to the Johar Town station house officer (SHO) and directed him to file a reply by July 15.
A few days ago, a video of Sajid riding a motorcycle in the rain went viral on social media, in which he could be heard using abusive language against the chief minister.

The virtual data room — an online repository used for document stora­­ge and sharing — facilita­tes due diligence proces­ses typically associated with mergers and acquisitions, loan syndication, private equity and venture capital transactions.
A meeting of the standing committee, chaired by Muhammad Farooq Sat­tar, also passed the Priv­a­tisation Com­mis­­sion (Am­­endment) Bill 2024 — a government-sponsored bill — by a majority vote.

The issue at hand was a PTCL announcement in which the company said it would auction a property situated on I.I. Chundrigar Road, Karachi. Committee’s Chair­man Syed Aminul Haq exp­ressed displeasure, saying the PTCL was not providing the proof of powers that allowed it to sell properties.
The chairman of the committee asked the PTCL team about the specific clauses of the sale and purchase agreement that allowed PTCL to sell its properties without seeking permission from the government. The company did not provide information to the panel, but in a response to the IT ministry it stated that the PTCL’s Memoran­dum of Association allowed the company to sell its properties.
At this, the lawmakers asked if the company had such powers to sell land and wondered whether other government entities could do the same without seeking prior authorisation. Meanwhile, Sher Ali Arbab also expressed concerns that the PTCL had not responded to the queries by the committee.

Chairman says all stakeholders will be invited to in-camera meeting to clear ambiguity

Mazhar Hussain, adviser to the PTCL president, said that the company was not bound to respond to the questions posed by the committee and the reply had been forwarded to the IT ministry. He added that the committee could approach the ministry or Etisalat which retains the management control of the PTCL.
The situation in the committee room turned tense due to this response and Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani suggested taking the matter to a logical end to clear the ambiguity.  The members said the panel had powers to hold the company accountable since it was owned by the government.
The PTCL team was led by Zahida Awan,  Group Chief Legal Officer and it included Naveed Butt and Mazhar Hussain, advisor to President PTCL.
Meanwhile, the representative of the Privatization Commission informed the committee that under Clause 6 of the agreement between the government and Etisalat, the commission was legally bound not to share the details of the agreement unless mutual consent was obtained from both the government of Pakistan and Etisalat.
Amid concerns that the members might have been given ‘incomplete information’ by the company representatives, the chairman said that the matter would be discussed in an in-camera meeting to be attended by the representatives of the IT ministry, the law ministry, the Privatisation Commission, and Etisalat. They will be invited so that the sale and purchase agreement could be thoroughly reviewed.
The next meeting is likely to be held by the end of this month.
Another agenda item pertained to the upcoming projects of the Universal Service Fund (USF) in District Tharparkar and Sargodha Division.
While briefing the committee regarding complaints received from LDI (Long Distance and Inter­national) operators, PTA Chairman retired major general Hafeezur Rehman informed that 9 LDI operators defaulted on their payments, amounting to approximately Rs19 billion. Additionally, more than 100 cases involving these operators were pending in various courts.
The PTA issued notices to the LDI operators and at least six operators had expressed their willingness to clear their outstanding dues, he said, adding that there was a need to formulate a clear mechanism for recovery. According to one of the suggestions, an instalment-based payment plan could be used for recovery.
To address the overall issue, a subcommittee was constituted under the convenorship of Sher Ali Arbab.
