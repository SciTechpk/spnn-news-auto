Last week, the Balochistan High Court rejected constitutional petitions seeking the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) Chief Organiser Dr Mahrang Baloch and two other leaders detained under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance (MPO). The BYC is a Baloch advocacy group working against enforced disappearances since 2018.
Mahrang and other BYC activists were arrested on March 22 for allegedly “attacking” Quetta Civil Hospital and “inciting people to violence”, a day after their members faced a police crackdown in Quetta while protesting against alleged enforced disappearances.
A letter dated May 27 was addressed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and signed by Amnesty, the Asian Forum for Human Rights and Development (Forum-Asia), Front Line Defenders (FLD), the International Federation for Human Rights, and the World Organisation Against Torture, both of which work under the framework of the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders.
 






The groups said late on Tuesday night they strongly condemned the alleged “harassment and arbitrary detention of Baloch human rights defenders exercising their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly in Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan.”
“The actions of your government to systematically harass and detain HRDs, raising their voice against enforced disappearances and other unlawful state practices, run afoul of Pakistan’s international human rights obligations,” the letter alleged.
It added that the “attacks on BYC leaders and supporters, who are peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and assembly, not only violate Pakistan’s constitution but also its international legal obligations.”
The letter noted that the Pakistani Constitution guarantees the right to assemble
peacefully under Article 16 and the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19.
The groups further alleged in the letter that the crackdown was launched “against a backdrop of harassment of journalists and a clampdown on freedom of expression.”
“It is imperative that human rights are upheld and never sacrificed in the name of security,” the letter said.
The organisations called on Pakistan to “immediately and unconditionally release all Baloch HRDs and their family members arbitrarily detained solely for peacefully exercising their rights in line with the right to liberty and safety.” They further urged Islamabad to “drop all charges against HRDs based solely on the exercise of their rights.
“Pending their release, ensure the safety of HRDs and family members, including by sharing accurate information about their whereabouts, and providing effective access to family members, legal counsel and medical treatment.
They called on Pakistan to “conduct a thorough, impartial, effective and transparent investigation into the allegations of torture and mistreatment by Pakistani authorities of Baloch HRDs under detention.”
The organisations also urged an end to the crackdown against HRDs, journalists, protesters and dissidents by ensuring their right to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly are fully protected.
They further called on Pakistani authorities to “cease all forms” of alleged reprisals against family members of HRDs.“</p><small>2025-05-29 03:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/6837c8ce64cc4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914010/fictitious-assets' target='_blank'><strong>Fictitious assets</strong></a><br><p>SOME sort of a crypto bug seems to have gripped the government and perhaps some of it is warranted.
From the details reported in the international media we learn that at least some of the efforts of the Pakistani government in the crypto domain are geared towards procuring influence in Washington DC, with those close to the Trump administration coming to Pakistan for crypto-related discussions.
To that extent we can look at what is happening and say “it is what it is” and leave it at that. But the moment the government begins to take crypto seriously as a business proposition it becomes dangerous. And it is important to keep this distinction in mind, between crypto as an influence peddling tool versus a serious business proposition, because the resources the government will put at risk if it ventures into the world of crypto are public resources.
In the past few weeks, since the Crypto Council was announced by the government, we have seen suggestions appear in print on how Pakistan can expand its participation in the wider world of cryptocurrencies. One suggestion was to place a portion of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves in crypto, and the individual making this suggestion deployed a classic tactic used by small-time stock brokers or real estate agents selling junk to gullible clients. He pointed to the rise in the value of Bitcoin over the past decade, and asked the reader to imagine if Pakistan had placed a certain amount of its reserves in this asset, how much that value would have multiplied by today.
What was not mentioned in the article was the sheer volatility of currency over that same time period. Sovereign reserves are never gambled with in volatile assets. They are, as a rule, always invested in fixed-income instruments. It’s the same principle when managing pension funds or other institutional savings. The principles are low-volatility, low-risk, fixed return.

The resources the government will put at risk if it ventures into the world of crypto are public resources.

Another argument encouraged the state to go into crypto mining by offering the right “incentives”. The right incentives apparently include providing them with electricity at around five to six cents per unit. For comparison consider that you and I pay somewhere around 20 cents per unit for our electricity, with industry somewhere around 14 cents. The most obvious question to ask when considering this proposition is this: if Pakistan has electricity to give at five cents per unit, why should crypto miners be the first to get it?
A puzzling press release from the finance ministry a few days ago added to the confusion. It announced that the government has “allocated” 2000MW for crypto mining. It was puzzling because there was no mention of price (the single most important thing to mention in such an announcement), but more importantly, there is literally no such thing as electricity allocations in Pakistan. There are no quotas of who gets how much electricity. So what exactly is being announced in this press release?
The third suggestion that has been floated is to create on-shore crypto exchanges in Pakistan, much like we already have a commodities exchange. This is probably the most benign of the suggestions since all it does is make crypto trading a regulated activity without putting any state resources into play.
It is critical to keep in mind that crypto is a fictitious asset. It is not the first, nor the last of these. Fictitious assets are those that exist only in the mind of the holder. If enough people buy into the fiction they can become liquid, meaning you can trade them for real goods and services. Money, for example, is a fictitious asset as is gold. But both are highly liquid. I can pay my bills with money, buy my groceries, because almost everyone in my society buys into the fiction that money (or gold) represent.
Not so with crypto. This is purely a speculative asset, created for speculative purposes, given prominence by speculator interests, and currently in the process of being pumped by a massive speculative scheme being launched by the White House itself. This endows it with a great deal of speculative value. But none of it is real.
In the past we have seen fictitious assets grow to unmanageable proportions and pose risks to the entire global financial system. Collateralised Debt Obligations (CDOs) were fictitious assets when left unregulated, because those creating them were able to bundle junk mortgages by illiquid borrowers into their offering and sell them as a AAA-rated financial product. This scam became so large in the late 2000s that it lay at the root of the greatest financial collapse since the Great Depression.
CDOs are still around, but as a regulated product they now pose little risk of growing into a threat to the financial order. But speculator capital has its own ingenuity. Think of plot files being sold by unscrupulous property developers, in housing projects they haven’t even begun acquiring land for yet. That is a fictitious asset, and trading in it brings enormous risks that should not be taken by retail investors or those entrusted to manage the wealth of others, such as sovereigns or pension fund managers.
Fictitious assets have always been around in the modern world. The South Sea Bubble in the early 18th century was created by massive investments in the stock of a company that had no prospects of actually being able to do the business it was supposed to do (sell slaves to the Spanish colonies of South America). They are around in our time too and crypto is just one of their manifestations. It’s fine for those who wish to trade in these sorts of fictitious assets with their own money. But the state should beware the wiles with which the salesmen of this snake oil try to lure you into their racket.

The understanding was reached during a meeting in Tehran between Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi and his Ira­nian counterpart, Eska­ndar Momeni. The discussions focused particularly on the movement and welfare of pilgrims, the ministry said.
According to an official statement, Mr Momeni said the Iranian government “will provide boarding and lodging facilities in Mashhad for 5,000 Pakistani pilgrims”. Also, Iran “will make special arrangements from the border to Iraq for them,” he said, adding that serving the pilgrims is considered a “religious duty”.
Both countries also agreed to establish a hotline to resolve issues concerning pilgrims swiftly. A trilateral conference of the interior ministries of Pakistan, Iran, and Iraq will be convened in Mashhad before Arbaeen to discuss matters related to Pakistani pilgrims. The ministers also agreed to increase the number of flights to ensure pilgrim’s safety and convenience.
Discussions also included sending pilgrims via sea routes to Iran and Iraq. Furthermore, the leaders talked about strengthening Pakistan-Iran relations and mutual cooperation in various fields, including curbing illegal immigration, human trafficking, and drug control, with an agreement to enhance coordination for better border security management.
The Iranian interior minister emphasised that Iran and Pakistan enjoy “excellent relations” and that “Pakistan’s security is of utmost importance to Iran”.
Talks also covered the release of Iranian fishermen detained after they unintentionally entered Pakistani territorial waters. Mr Naqvi assured full cooperation in this regard at the request of his Iranian counterpart.
He expressed gratitude to the Iranian government for facilitating the pilgrims and said the establishment of a hotline would “help resolve issues promptly.”
Attending from the Iranian side were Deputy Interior Minister Ali Akbar Pourjamshidian, Deputy Minister Nader Yar Ahmadi, Adviser Hadian, Governor General of Sistan and Baluchestan Mansour Bager, and Colonel Javaheri, Head of International Affairs at the Ministry of Interior. FIA director general and senior officers from Pakistan also attended the meeting.

• Proposed bill faces criticism from both treasury, opposition benches
LAHORE: The Punjab civil bureaucracy is facing mounting criticism for its repeated failure to come up with a local government law acceptable to both the treasury and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), let alone the opposition.
Since the expiry of the last local government term in December 2021, the bureaucracy has prepared the Punjab Local Government Act (PLGA) at least four times. However, none of the drafts have passed legislative scrutiny or gained political consensus.
Irritated over the continuous delay in finalising the PLGA, the Election Commission has summoned the Punjab chief secretary and the administrative secretary of the Local Government and Community Development Department (LG&CD) in person on Thursday (today).
The PLGA, prepared by the civil bureaucracy, had drawn strong criticism from the treasury benches as they said it would “bury local governments”. The opposition has gone further, denouncing the bill as a throwback to the authoritarian policies of military rulers Ziaul Haq and Pervez Musharraf.
Treasury lawmaker Syed Zulfiqar Ali Shah warned that the proposed bill would disempower elected representatives by centralising authority in the hands of deputy commissioners. Another treasury member, Ahmad Iqbal, said the new bill would dismantle local governance.
In a notice addressed to the chief secretary and the LG&CD secretary over delay in conducting local government elections in Punjab, the ECP stated that the term of the local government in Punjab had expired on Dec 31, 2021. Since then, the ECP said it had undertaken several initiatives to facilitate the timely conduct of local government elections in the province, including convening meetings, issuing correspondence and sending reminders.
The Election Commission said it was on record that the Punjab local government laws had undergone amendments on four separate occasions and the commission had accordingly conducted the delimitation process several times.
Most recently, the ongoing delimitation process for union councils was suspended on the request of the Punjab government to allow for the finalisation of the Punjab Local Government Bill, 2025. It said the commission accepted this request and granted a four-week extension, with a clear directive that “no further extensions would be entertained”.
Subsequently, the ECP in its notice stated that the draft of the PLGA was shared with the commission on Dec 26 last year. The commission reviewed the draft and communicated its feedback to the Punjab government on Jan 23 this year.
“A full bench hearing of the commission was held on Feb 26, during which instructions were issued to the Punjab chief secretary to finalise the legislative process. However, no substantial progress has been reported by the Punjab government [to date] regarding the enactment of the requisite legislation or the conduct of local government elections,” it said.
Consequently, the ECP has summoned the chief secretary, as well as LG&CD secretary, to appear in person before the commission on Thur­sday at its Islamabad secretariat.
‘Colonial mindset’
Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar told Dawn that the civil bureaucracy had proposed non-party elections in the Punjab local government bill, reflecting dictators Ziaul Haq and Gen Musharraf’s colonial mindset.
It proposed all powers rested with the respective deputy commissioners instead of elected representatives. “The government wants all those elected be brought into the ruling party fold through incentives or pressure,” he alleged.
He said the bill proposed that the union councils’ elections would be held on a non-party basis, and the elected members would choose chairpersons of the union and district councils from among themselves instead of the chairperson’s direct election.
He claimed the design was motivated by fears that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) might sweep the polls if held on a party basis. He added that the opposition would suggest amendments and oppose the existing proposed bill tooth and nail.
In the proposed bill, Mr Bhachar said, the government was trying to wind up the Panchayat system, which was highly important in most parts of the province.
The opposition leader said the incumbent Punjab dispensation, which he said was “no less than a martial law government”, should have advertised the proposed law and sought public opinion before finalising and presenting it before the Punjab Assembly.
“It will be a sheer wastage of people’s time and money if the Punjab government tries to pass the bill and holds local government elections on a non-party basis, granting powers to deputy commissioners instead of elected representatives,” he added.

Israel stepped up its military offensive in Gaza earlier this month, while mediators push for an end to hostilities that remains elusive.
The issue of aid has come sharply into focus amid a hunger crisis after Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza for over two months, before allowing supplies in at a trickle last week.
“Since the resumption of hostilities in Gaza, the already horrific existence of civilians has only sunk further into the abyss. This is man-made,” Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East, told the Council.

US surgeon says Gaza’s health network has been systematically dismantled in a ‘sustained military campaign’

“Death is their companion,” she continued. “It’s not life, it’s not hope. The people of Gaza deserve more than survival. They deserve a future.”
The aid that is now coming in “is comparable to a lifeboat after the ship has sunk”, she said.
Kaag warned that there could be no “sustainable peace” in the Middle East without a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, adding that the occupied West Bank also is on a “dangerous trajectory”. And she called for collective action to revive a two-state solution, saying that a high-level international conference next month presents a “critical opportunity”.
“It must launch a concrete path towards ending the occupation and realising the two-state solution,” she said.
When speaking of people in Gaza, “the words empathy, solidarity and support have lost their meaning”, Kaag said.
“We should not become accustomed to the number of people killed or injured. These are daughters, mothers, and young children whose lives have been shattered. All have a name, all had a future, all had dreams and aspirations.”
`Why didn’t I die?’
The UN Security Council also heard the harrowing testimony of an American surgeon on Wednesday, a few weeks after his return from Gaza.
“I am here because I have witnessed what is happening in Gaza with my own eyes, especially to children, and I cannot pretend not to have seen it. You too, cannot claim ignorance,” said Dr Feroze Sidhwa.
The medical system in Gaza has not failed, he said. “It has been systematically dismantled through a sustained military campaign that has wilfully violated international humanitarian law.”
Children are “supposed to be protected”, he said, but “in Gaza, those protections are simply gone”.
“Most of my patients were pre-teen children, their bodies shattered by explosions and torn by flying metal. Many died. Those who lived often awoke to find their entire families gone,” he said.
“According to the War Child Alliance, nearly half of Gaza’s children are suicidal,” he said.
“They ask, why didn’t I die with my sister, my mother, my father? Not out of extremism, but out of unbearable grief. I wonder if any member of this Council has ever met a five-year-old child who no longer wants to live.” The Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, blamed Hamas for the situation in Gaza.
“There is suffering in Gaza, but the blame is on the shoulders of Hamas … so they will continue to be suffering until Hamas understands that they will not stay in Gaza,” he told reporters.
Israel claims killing Sinwar’s brother
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Mohammad Sinwar, Hamas’s Gaza chief and younger brother of the Palestinian group’s deceased leader Yahya Sinwar, had been killed in an air strike last week.
Mohammad Sinwar had been the target of an Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza and Netanyahu said on May 21 that it was likely he was dead.
The Israeli leader announced that Sinwar had been “eliminated” in an address to the Israeli parliament as he listed off names of other Hamas officials that Israel claimed it had killed over the past 20 months.
“In the last two days we have been in a dramatic turn towards a complete defeat of Hamas,” he said, adding that Israel was also “taking control of food distribution”, a reference to the new aid distribution system in Gaza managed by a US-backed group.
Hamas has yet to confirm Sinwar’s death.

“This is not an aspirational goal but a binding obligation under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC),” Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah wrote in a judgement on a case related to the custody of two children.
Justice Shah emphasised that courts, especially family courts, had a moral and legal responsibility to see, hear and protect every child not as a passive subject of proceedings, but as a rights-bearing individual whose dignity must be safeguarded at every stage of the judicial process.
The proceedings were initially instituted by Dr Sana Sattar (mother) who filed an application for custody of her two children before the senior civil judge (family division), Layyah. While her application was dismissed on July 14, 2023, a visitation schedule was framed to facilitate meetings between her and her children.

Review petition by father of two children dismissed

Both parents, however, filed separate appeals before the court of additional district judge, Layyah, which granted children’s custody to their mother and ordered a visitation arrangement for their father, Dr Muhammad Asif. The father then filed a constitutional petition before the Multan bench of Lahore High Court, which got dismissed on May 24, 2024. Later, an appeal before the apex court met the same fate on July 18.
Subsequently, the father moved a review petition before the Supreme Court. A two-member bench comprising Justice Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi heard the matter and maintained that the custody stands vested with the mother.
While dismissing the review petition, the court also directed the parties to strictly adhere to the visitation schedule determined by the lower appellate court though the custody of the children would continue with the mother unless and until the father moves “a fresh application for custody to be adjudicated by a competent forum in light of any material change in circumstances”.
In the 12-page judgement, Justice Shah explained that the best interests of the children, particularly the child with special needs, were best served by keeping them in the custody of their mother. No alternative caregiver can fully replicate the intuitive care, emotional constancy, and protective environment a mother is uniquely positioned to offer, the judgement emphasised, adding that even a working professional mother does not detract from her suitability as a custodial parent. On the contrary, it reflects her resilience and her commitment to providing a secure, nurturing, and dignified upbringing for her children.
The judgment asked the courts to adopt a child-friendly, participatory approach while underscoring the need that courts should deal with cases involving children through the lens of a dedicated child-centered and child justice framework, a judicial philosophy grounded in both legal and moral obligations to safeguard, nurture and empower children within the justice system.
The concept of child justice is broad and inclusive. It encompasses not only children in conflict with the law, requires rehabilitative and restorative processes rather than punitive sanctions, but children involved in custody and guardianship disputes must be treated with dignity, heard, protected, and empowered throughout judicial proceedings, the judgment emphasised.
Courts bear a heightened responsibility to prioritise the best interests of child in all decisions affecting them. This principle demands that the judiciary transcend procedural formalism and engage substantively with each child’s unique vulnerabilities, developmental needs and future potential.

Among the peacekeepers to be honoured posthumously with the Dag Hammarskjold medal the two Pakistanis are: Sepoy Muhammad Tarique and Havildar Ahsan Ullah Khan - both served with UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA).
During the ceremonies, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will lay a wreath to honour more than 4,400 UN peacekeepers who have lost their lives since 1948. He will also preside over a ceremony in the Trusteeship Council Chamber, at which Dag Hammarskjöld Medals will be awarded posthumously to 57 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers, who lost their lives serving under the UN flag last year.
Pakistan is the fifth largest contributor of uniformed personnel to UN Peacekeeping.  It currently deploys more than 2,800 military and police personnel to the UN peace operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, Congo, Cyprus, Somalia, South Sudan and Western Sahara. Peacekeeping is one of the most effective tools available to the United Nations in the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security.
Since 1948, when the historic decision was made to deploy military observers to the Middle East to supervise the implementation of Israel-Arab Armistice Agreements, in what became the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation, more than two million peacekeepers have served in 71 operations around the world.
Today, some 68,000 women and men serve as military, police and civilian personnel in 11 conflict zones across Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. 119 countries currently contribute uniformed personnel.

Jamshed Quarters police Station House Officer (SHO) Ansar Butt said, “Two siblings were passing by a petrol pump in the area when one of them fell into an open manhole.
“The victim’s brother alerted bystanders about the incident, where the boy drowned. After being inside the manhole for about 20 minutes, the boy passed away at 7pm on Tuesday.”
The incident angered locals who lodged a protest at the scene, which was joined by MQM-P lawmaker Amir Siddiqi.
Siddiqi told the media, “The Sindh government and Karachi mayor have failed to cover open manholes in the metropolis. A child fell into a 16-foot-deep drain and died.
“The city has been destroyed,” the lawmaker regretted.
Siddiqi told Dawn.com that the protest took place for four hours as the police were delaying the registering of a first information report (FIR). “The police finally registered the FIR when I personally spoke to top police officers, including the Sindh inspector general,” he said, terming the incident “a tragedy for the poor family”.
SHO Butt said the police registered a case against unidentified suspects on the complaint of the victim’s maternal uncle Mohammed Ibrahim under Section 322 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
One of the residents told Dawn.com that the victim and his 12-year-old brother used to sell french fries in the area.
“They had purchased potatoes and were on their way home when electricity in the area was cut,” the resident said.
“The owner of the nearby petrol pump had opened a car wash, whose operator would leave the manhole open when he washed cars to drain water,” they added. “The manhole was uncovered when one of the boys fell into it due to the darkness.”
The resident said that the protest continued until 1am on Wednesday, when the police, in the presence of Siddiqui, “promised” that they would try to get compensation from the petrol pump owner.
Open manholes have become a persistent hazard across Pakistan, posing serious risks to pedestrians and motorists alike. Despite repeated public complaints, authorities have failed to implement long-term solutions to prevent accidents and fatalities.
In April, the body of a minor girl was found in a drain in Karachi’s Liaquatabad neighbourhood, according to police.
A statement from the police said the minor’s body was recovered from a drain near Siddique Mosque and appeared to be one or two days old. It added that the body was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital to ascertain the cause of death.
Liaquatabad SHO Ghulam Yasin told Dawn.com that the girl’s body was found floating in the drain near Angara Goth.
“It appeared that she was drowned somewhere else and the current of the water brought her there,” he said, adding that she was reported missing within the limits of Sachal Police Station on April 15.</p><small>2025-05-28 18:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/282320335a4a115.jpg?r=232440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913895/andrew-tate-and-brother-charged-with-rape-uk-prosecutors' target='_blank'><strong>Andrew Tate and brother charged with rape: UK prosecutors</strong></a><br><p>Controversial social media influencer Andrew Tate and his brother have been charged with several counts of rape, assault and trafficking, UK prosecutors said on Wednesday.
The accusations, which date back to between 2012 to 2015, were authorised by the Crown Prosecution Service in January 2024, but have only been revealed now.
Former kickboxer Tate, 38, faces 10 charges in the UK including rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution relating to three women.
His brother, Tristan, 36, has been accused of 11 similar charges against one woman.
“A European arrest warrant was issued in England in 2024, and as a result, the Romanian courts ordered the extradition to the UK of Andrew and Tristan Tate,” prosecutors said in a statement.
“However, the domestic criminal matters in Romania must be settled first.” Andrew Tate is facing legal action in several countries, including some cases where he is accused alongside his brother.
In Romania, the Tate brothers face separate allegations of trafficking minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering.
Both men, who have dual British-US nationality, have denied all charges against them.
 
 

Andrew Tate, the figurehead of the online masculinist movement, travelled to Florida with his brother in February, marking the first time they had left Romania since their 2022 arrest.
Romanian prosecutors allege that the brothers and two women set up a criminal organisation in Romania in 2021 and sexually exploited several victims.
In a separate civil case in the United Kingdom, four British women have accused Andrew Tate of rape and coercive control.
Tate moved to Romania years ago after first starting a webcam business in Britain.
He leapt to fame in 2016 when he appeared on the “Big Brother” UK reality television show, but was removed after a controversial video emerged.
He then turned to social media platforms to promote his often misogynistic and divisive views on how to be successful. Tate is followed by more than 10.7 million people on the social network X, where he shares his angry vision of masculinity and often homophobic and racist posts.</p><small>2025-05-28 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2821032961ede12.png?r=220626' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913883/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-meet-on-june-2-sherry' target='_blank'><strong>Delegation presenting Pakistan’s stance on escalation with India to meet on June 2: Sherry</strong></a><br><p>The high-level delegation tasked with presenting Pakistan’s position on the ongoing dispute with India has scheduled to meet on June 2, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said on Wednesday.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a diplomatic delegation to important world capitals in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India. He entrusted the PPP Chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to lead the delegation.
The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
 


Speaking on DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’, Senator Rehman said that the diplomatic committee had decided to visit various countries before Eidul Azha.
“The committee, headed by Bilawal, will begin its tour of various countries on June 2, starting from New York,” she said.
She added, “The committee will first go to New York, then Washington, followed by London, and then Brussels.”
 
 

Rehman further said that Bilawal had emphasised that there was no hurry as Pakistan “is not concerned with the Indian delegation.”
“Bilawal has said that we have our own stance and that we have enough content for our defence,” she said, adding that the PPP chairman wanted a “substantive [and] quality meeting”.
Speaking about Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent remarks regarding the Indus Water Treaty, saying “No politician, especially a PM, says things like that.”
She added that Modi wanted the region to remain in “crisis” to prevent any space for negotiations.
In a separate interview with the Saudi television network Al-Arabiya, the senator warned that stability in a volatile region is not possible with Modi’s escalatory rhetoric.
“He is pushing the region toward a dangerous new abnormal, which cannot possibly be acceptable to anyone,” Senator Rehman said. “Nothing is normal or rational about this doctrinal shift in India’s foreign policy.”
She highlighted that India was also mining more groundwater than any other country in the world, especially from the Indus River Basin, while trying to cut off what they can of Pakistan’s water lifeline, stating that this is “totally unsustainable or acceptable in today’s climate-stressed world”.
 






The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad’s alleged involvement in a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam — an allegation for which it provided no evidence.
New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. It took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.</p><small>2025-05-28 18:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/282215331211353.jpg?r=221601' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913890/in-world-first-mexican-voters-to-elect-all-judges' target='_blank'><strong>In world first, Mexican voters to elect all judges</strong></a><br><p>Mexico is set to become the world’s only country to let voters elect all of their judges, sparking sharp disagreement about whether the reforms will diminish or strengthen criminal influence over the courts.
The government says the unprecedented popular vote for judges and magistrates at all levels — including the Supreme Court — is needed to address rampant corruption and impunity.
Critics argue it will undermine the judiciary’s independence and warn the participation of controversial candidates — such as a former lawyer for notorious drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman — means it is doomed to backfire.
On Sunday, voters will choose several thousand federal, district and local judges and magistrates. Another election for the remainder will be held in 2027.
Not just anybody can run for one of these jobs. Candidates must have a law degree, experience in legal affairs, what is termed “a good reputation,” and no criminal record.
Opponents, including judicial workers, have held a series of mass street protests in an unsuccessful attempt to stop the reforms.
“Justice is not something you vote for”, and it needs people with experience and specialised knowledge, said Olimpia Rojas Luviano, a 28-year-old lawyer.
But Maria del Rocio Morales, a judge who is standing to be a magistrate in the capital, said she was happy to take part.
“For the good of my city and my country, I will do it,” she said.
President Claudia Sheinbaum has played down signs that many voters are unlikely to take part in the vote.
“People are very intelligent and know who they are going to vote for,” the veteran left-winger said.
According to surveys by the El Universal and El Pais newspapers, only half of voters know the election date and only four out of 10 are certain they will participate.
‘Rotten’ judiciary
While judicial elections are not new — the United States and Bolivia, for instance, allow voters to pick some judges — Mexico will be the only nation to elect them at all levels.
The reform was championed by Sheinbaum’s predecessor and mentor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who criticised the judicial system as “rotten,” corrupt and serving the interests of the political and economic elite.
Mexico has a long history of human rights violations that remain unpunished, including the disappearance of 43 students from a teacher training college in 2014, allegedly at the hands of drug traffickers and corrupt authorities.
Despite dozens of arrests, there have been no convictions.
Mexico’s criminal justice system “is profoundly ineffective at ensuring accountability for criminal violence and abuses by security forces,” according to New York-based Human Rights Watch.
Lopez Obrador frequently clashed with the judiciary, in particular the Supreme Court, which impeded some of his policies.
Sheinbaum, who replaced him in October, is a staunch supporter of the sweeping changes. Her opponents say they will eliminate democratic checks and balances.
Sheinbaum’s ruling party already dominates both houses of Congress.
Opponents warn that elected judges could be more vulnerable to pressure from criminals, in a country where powerful drug cartels regularly use bribery and intimidation to influence officials.
Rights group Defensorxs has identified around 20 candidates it considers “high risk” for reasons including allegations of cartel links, corruption and sexual abuse, even though one of the requirements for running is to have no criminal record.
These people include Silvia Delgado, a former lawyer for “El Chapo,” the Sinaloa cartel co-founder imprisoned in the United States.
Defensorxs describes her as a candidate who “defends alleged drug traffickers.”
Delgado, who is standing to be a judge in the northern state of Chihuahua, told AFP: “Every person has the right to counsel.”
Another controversial candidate seeking to be a district judge in the northern state of Durango served prison time in the United States for drug crimes, according to Defensorxs.
A major concern for voters is the complexity of a vote that will require people in Mexico City to mark nine ballots for local and federal judges.
“I think even the people who devised it don’t know how to do it,” said Rojas Luviano.</p><small>2025-05-28 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/28202931fa4c4b3.jpg?r=203626' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913885/kremlin-rebuffs-zelenskys-call-for-meeting-with-trump-putin' target='_blank'><strong>Kremlin rebuffs Zelensky’s call for meeting with Trump, Putin</strong></a><br><p>The Kremlin on Wednesday rebuffed a call by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for a three-way summit with counterparts Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin as Kyiv seeks to force Moscow to halt its more than three-year-long invasion.
Moscow said any meeting involving Russian President Putin and Zelensky would only happen after “concrete agreements” had been struck between negotiators from each side.
Putin rejected calls to meet Zelensky in Turkey earlier this month, when Russia and Ukraine held their first direct peace talks in three years. Putin has repeatedly said he does not see Zelensky as a legitimate leader and called for him to be toppled.
US President Trump, meanwhile, has expressed frustration at both leaders for not yet striking a deal to end the war. The two sides have traded waves of massive aerial attacks in recent weeks, with Ukraine unleashing one of its largest-ever drone barrages on Russia overnight, according to the defence ministry in Moscow.
“If Putin is not comfortable with a bilateral meeting, or if everyone wants it to be a trilateral meeting, I don’t mind. I am ready for any format,” Zelensky said in comments to journalists on Tuesday that were published on Wednesday.
The Ukrainian leader said he was “ready” for a “Trump-Putin-me” meeting.
Asked about Zelensky’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “Such a meeting should be the result of concrete agreements between the two (Ukrainian and Russian) delegations.” The talks in Istanbul earlier this month failed to yield a breakthrough.
Moscow has rejected coordinated Western calls for an immediate ceasefire.
Push for sanctions
Zelensky also urged the United States to deliver a package of hard-hitting sanctions on Russia’s banking and energy sectors.
“Trump confirmed that if Russia does not stop, sanctions will be imposed. We discussed two main aspects with him — energy and the banking system. Will the US be able to impose sanctions on these two sectors? I would very much like that,” Zelensky said.
Trump called Putin “crazy” and said he was “playing with fire” in rare rebukes of the Russian leader after Moscow’s latest wave of aerial attacks.

The US president has repeatedly threatened to impose fresh sanctions on Russia, but has yet to do so. Despite months of US-led diplomacy, the two sides appear no closer to striking a deal to end the war, triggered by Russia’s February 2022 invasion.
Tens of thousands have been killed, much of eastern and southern Ukraine has been destroyed, and Moscow’s army now controls around a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including the Crimean peninsula, which Russia annexed in 2014.
Ukraine overnight fired almost 300 drones at Russia, where officials reported only minimal damage from the attacks and some air travel disruption.
The Ukrainian military said the attack hit several sites involved in missile and drone production. AFP could not verify those claims.
‘Amassing’ troops
Zelensky on Wednesday also accused Russia of dragging out the peace process and of not wanting to halt its invasion.
“They will constantly look for reasons not to end the war,” he said at a press conference in Berlin alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, criticising Russia for not having agreed to a location for the next round of negotiations.
Kyiv is yet to receive a promised “memorandum” from Russia on its demands for a peace deal that Putin said he would send to Ukraine. Work on the document was in its “final stages”, Peskov said.
Zelensky also urged allies to invite Kyiv to a Nato summit in June, warning that otherwise it would be a victory for Russia.
Merz said Germany will help Ukraine develop new long-range weapons that can hit targets in Russian territory. Neither leader provided specific details.
The Kremlin said Germany’s support to Kyiv would “hinder peace efforts”.
On the battlefield, Zelensky said Russia was “amassing” more than 50,000 troops on the front line around the northeastern Sumy border region, where Moscow’s army has captured a number of settlements as it seeks to establish what Putin has called a “buffer zone” inside Ukrainian territory.
Russia’s army said on Wednesday it had captured another village in the Sumy region.</p><small>2025-05-28 15:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606681-pakistan-india-talks-could-restore-stability-in-region-amid-fragile-ceasefire-experts' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-India talks could restore stability in region amid fragile ceasefire: experts</strong></a><br><p>

Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.
According to a press release from the Saudi Embassy, the call centre “plays a vital role in the Kingdom’s healthcare response during Haj.”
“The centre is designed to enhance access to health services, offer medical guidance, and ensure [a] timely response to emergencies,” the press release read.
“Available 24/7, the centre provides a wide range of services including real-time medical consultations, emergency assistance, handling of complaints, guidance on accessing health facilities, and support in locating missing or hospitalised pilgrims.”
The press release stated that the call centre operates in seven major languages: Urdu, Arabic, English, French, Indonesian, Farsi, and Turkish. This ensures “smooth, responsive, and inclusive service delivery regardless of nationality”, according to the statement.
The Saudi Ministry of Health called on all Haj pilgrims to utilise the services of the call centre, reaffirming it was ready to respond to all inquiries and medical emergencies.
The ministry underscored that these efforts are part of a broader strategy “to uphold the health, safety, and dignity of every pilgrim throughout their sacred journey”.
Last week, the ministry launched a health awareness kit, including one in Urdu, to promote the health and well-being of Haj pilgrims.
In a post on X, the Saudi health ministry said that the kit was available in eight languages. “In all languages, we care about pilgrims’ health. Explore the health awareness kit to promote health and well-being among pilgrims,” the post said.
 






The multilingual kit contained essential information for pilgrims, such as: preventing heat-related illnesses and managing health in extreme conditions, required vaccinations (meningitis, Covid-19, polio and yellow fever), managing chronic diseases, and accessing free health services during Haj. It also included short videos, social media assets, and printable posters.</p><small>2025-05-28 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2817474105dc4e1.jpg?r=175732' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913876/cricketer-hassan-alis-mother-mugged-in-gujranwala-police' target='_blank'><strong>Cricketer Hassan Ali’s mother mugged in Gujranwala: police</strong></a><br><p>Cricket star Hassan Ali’s mother was allegedly mugged on Wednesday in Gujranwala, a senior police official told Dawn.com.
Incidents of snatchings by armed suspects are commonplace nationwide.
According to a statement from Gujranwala City Police Officer Muhammad Ayaz Saleem’s office, Hassan’s mother was waiting on the road for her other son, Khurram to pick her up to take her to the bazaar.
“A robber snatched her purse and fled the scene,” the CPO said. “Khurram Ali said that the purse contained Rs230,000.”
The CPO added that a case had been registered and sought a report from Gujranwala Safe City. According to a copy of the first information report — seen by Dawn.com — the unidentified suspect were charged under Sections 356 (assault or criminal force in attempt to commit theft of property carried by a person) and 379 (punishment for theft) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“Police teams have been formed under the supervision of SP (superintendent of police) City Division to arrest the suspect,” CPO Saleem said. “Geo-fencing and CCTV footage from the scene of the incident is being obtained.
“The suspect will be arrested quickly and will receive exemplary punishment,” Saleem added.
The police are taking steps to combat rising incidents of theft and violent crime.
Earlier this month, the Punjab police’s e-Gadget Monitoring System, which was developed with the help of the Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB), proved effective in tracking down and recovering stolen or lost mobile phones of citizens, necessitating equipping the police with more such technology rather than investigating crime on traditional lines.
Police were able to recover over 100 mobile phones using the e-Gadget app when the criminals tried to sell them at throwaway prices on the black market.</p><small>2025-05-28 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2817041326d9d37.jpg?r=170424' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913873/kuwait-lifts-19-year-visa-ban-on-pakistanis' target='_blank'><strong>Kuwait lifts 19-year visa ban on Pakistanis</strong></a><br><p>Kuwait lifted a 19-year visa ban on Pakistani citizens and resumed issuing a wide range of visas to Pakistani nationals, the government said on Tuesday.
The country had stopped issuing visas in 2011 to citizens of Pakistan, Iran, Syria and Afghanistan, citing difficult security conditions in the countries. Since then, Pakistan made several attempts to get visas restored for Pakistani citizens but to no avail. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, during his visit to Kuwait in 2017, had also pleaded Pakistan’s case and requested for restoration of visas for Pakistani citizens.
In May 2021, Kuwait decided to resume granting visas to Pakistani families and businessmen. It was also decided during the meeting that Kuwait would issue technical visas for Pakistani workers in medical and oil fields.
According to a post on X by the government, Kuwait has now resumed the issuance of work, family, visit, tourist, and business visas, which it termed “a major diplomatic achievement and a step towards deeper bilateral cooperation.”
 






Pakistan’s ambassador to Kuwait Dr Zaffar Iqbal also issued a statement on the resumption of visas, saying: “Community members have already begun receiving approvals, marking a positive step forward,” he said.
Separately, the ambassador revealed that Pakistan and Kuwait are in the advanced stages of finalising a new labour memorandum of understanding (MoU).
Pakistan established diplomatic relations with Kuwait in October 1963. Since then, the two countries have maintained cordial relations and cooperated at various international fora, including the United Nations, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, and the Financial Action Task Force, among others. According to the Kuwaiti government estimates, the emirate hosts around 95,000 Pakistani nationals.</p><small>2025-05-28 13:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/281745043746a05.jpg?r=174523' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913863/pm-shehbaz-reiterates-willingness-to-talk-on-kashmir-terrorism-if-india-wants-in-all-sincerity' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reiterates willingness to talk on Kashmir, terrorism if India ‘wants in all sincerity’</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.
The prime minister participated in the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev. The meeting comes as the premier continued his tour to friendly countries to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the recent conflict with India.
Speaking at the summit, PM Shehbaz said: “I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region […] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, that is the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir.”
The premier also touched upon the issue of terrorism: “I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well.
“But this is a fact of life that we are the biggest victims of terrorism around the globe; we lost 90,000 valuable lives in Pakistan and $150 billion worth of economic losses over the last many decades,” he highlighted.
PM Shehbaz also expressed willingness to resume trade if India was willing to cooperate on the issues, including counterterrorism.
“There cannot be a bigger commitment and intention to beat this menace (terrorism) for all times to come, and in that, if India wants in all sincerity honest cooperation, Pakistan would be willing, along with the promotion of trade with India. All these issues need to be discussed on the table.
“I would be extremely grateful for your support in this regard,” he said, addressing the Turkiye and Azerbaijan presidents.
 


On India’s unilateral move to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, the premier said: “India tried to weaponise the Indus Waters Treaty, which is a lifeline for the people of Pakistan — 240 million people — for their agricultural use, for drinking and many other purposes.
“I think this is most unfortunate that India tried to threaten to stop our flow of water to Pakistan. This is not possible, was never possible, and will not be possible, God-willing. We are making proper arrangements to ensure that India never ever does it,” he asserted.
 
 

During his address, Shehbaz noted: “The world we live in faces numerous grave challenges, including armed conflict, climate change, diseases and economic crises.
“This is why the three of us have assembled here today, opting for compassion while rejecting conflict. We are confident that patience and wisdom will ultimately usher in peace and prosperity.”
“In today’s unpredictable and volatile world, political security, architectures, connectivity, alignments and emerging technologies are shaping the new reality. In such a situation, Pakistan is very fortunate to have sincere brothers like Turkiye and Azerbaijan who have stood together with us as impregnable rocks and whom we can trust without a second thought.”
Reiterating his gratitude to Erdogan and Aliyev for their diplomatic support during the recent conflict with India, which “was obviously very serious”. “It was an aggression from India against Pakistan for no rhyme and reason.”
He noted Erdogan’s “firm stand and solidarity with the people of Pakistan”, as well as Aliyev’s unwavering commitment to the people of Pakistan“ had earned the highest level of appreciation from his government and the nation.

The prime minister hailed the role of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir during Pakistan’s response, noting the “great bravery and the highest level of professional acumen” of the armed forces under his leadership.
“I saw him during those moments God-fearing, fearless, firm and with an iron resolve, with patience and obviously with fortitude to face that aggression.”
 
 

Addressing Aliyev, the premier thanked him for the hospitality shown to him and his delegation, noting that today’s summit “reflects the meeting of hearts and souls of genuine friends and sincere well-wishers”.
Recalling the “most fruitful discussions” at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit last year in Kazakhstan, PM Shehbaz said, “We are now eagerly looking forward to taking our trilateral partnership to new heights that would be in consonance with the wishes and desires of our people.
“This would be no surprise to anyone as Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkiye are bound together by deep historical, cultural and spiritual ties forged through centuries of shared values and mutual support,” he asserted.
“This historical relationship has been further strengthened as we have stood by each other, whether it be on Karabakh, Kashmir or northern Turkish Cyprus. Our strength lies in our solidarity and mutual respect.”
Noting the “outpouring of love and affection in both Turkiye and Azerbaijan” for Pakistan, PM Shehbaz noted: “We could not but be mesmerised by the intensity of the fervour and enthusiasm of our common citizens during Pakistan’s recent conflict with India.”
He noted that India “not only failed to bring any credible evidence against Pakistan but also rejected our sincere and generous offer of a neutral, transparent investigation into the so-called incident in Pahalgam by any international body”.
At the outset of his speech, the premier congratulated Aliyev and the Azerbaijani nation on their Republic Day. “The way the Azeri nation fought for its liberation, you earned a high position in the community of nations.”
He also felicitated the Turkish president for “very skillfully resolving the issue” of the PKK, referring to the Kurdish rebels’ recent decision to disband. “That goes to explain in volumes, my brother, your diplomatic skills to resolve this issue, and by virtue of this, you have earned a high place and influence not only in the region, but beyond.”
Turkiye ready to ‘contribute’ to India-Pakistan peace
Addressing the summit, Erdogan expressed Turkiye’s willingness to mediate between India and Pakistan: “Our hope is that the declared ceasefire will evolve into permanent peace. Turkiye is ready to make every possible contribution to this end.”
Stressing that developments in the region revealed how important “solidarity among our countries is”, Erdogan said: “We are pleased with the ceasefire that ended the tension which erupted between Pakistan and India.
“I once again congratulate our brother Shehbaz and the Pakistani authorities for the calm and prudent attitude they displayed during the process,” he added.
 


“We are three brotherly countries sharing common ideals based on mutual affection, respect and trust nourished by the same climate of civilisation. We are further strengthening the bond among our countries.”
Noting that the three countries collectively had an economic size of $1.5 trillion, the Turkish president said, “We stand behind each and every step towards transforming our relationship into a strategic partnership.”
He noted that their countries were located in a highly strategic region and faced a variety of challenges.
“In the coming period, our foreign ministers will carry out the required work to institutionalise our trilateral cooperation and they will prepare a strong framework that reflects the common vision of our countries,” he said, mentioning the trade, energy, defence and counterterrorism fields.
The president also noted plans to cooperate in transport, education, energy security, food supply security and renewable energy.
Erdogan also slammed Israel’s “relentless cruelty and expansionist policies in Palestine”, terming it the “clearest example of crisis of the international system”. He called for increased global pressure on Israel for a permanent ceasefire and uninterrupted aid into the enclave.

Kicking off the summit, President Aliyev said: “The recent tensions between Pakistan and India had troubled us the most and we watched it very closely in the hope that peace would prevail, and from the early hours we have expressed our solidarity with brotherly Pakistan.
“We would like to see dialogue and negotiations in line with the UN Charter and resolutions; this is the way to move forward in this conflict.”
Aliyev noted that there is great potential for advanced technologies, artificial intelligence, space intelligence and exploration, as well as academic collaborations and cultural events.
“Reinvigorating tourism links will only enhance the ties between our people,” he said.
He also noted that unanimous support for Azerbaijan’s candidature for becoming a full-fledged member of the Developing-8 Organisation for Economic Cooperation. “We express support to brotherly Turkiye and Pakistan.”

Earlier today, PM Shehbaz extended heartfelt felicitations to President Aliyev and his nation on the “joyous occasion of Azerbaijan’s Independence Day”.
In a post on social media platform X, he said, “Pakistan deeply values its close fraternal bonds with Azerbaijan — rooted in shared history, mutual trust and unwavering support for each other.
“This year, it gives me great pleasure to be able to celebrate this historic day in Azerbaijan, alongside President Aliyev and our Azerbaijani brothers and sisters,” the premier added.
The prime minister expressed confidence that under President Aliyev’s “wise and sagacious leadership, our multi-dimensional partnership will continue to grow from strength to strength”.
 






PM Shehbaz arrived in Lachin yesterday on the third leg of his four-nation tour after visiting Turkiye and Iran. He will later depart for Tajikistan, where he will attend the International Conference on Glaciers in Dushanbe.
A day ago, the premier held a bilateral meeting with President Aliyev and thanked him for Azerbaijan’s support during the recent confrontation with India. COAS Munir was also present on the occasion.
 
 

The prime minister thanked Azerbaijan for its “steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation in the face of Indian provocation”, a press release by the PM’s Office said.
They reaffirmed their shared commitment to diversifying the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues. The Azerbaijan side agreed to the exchange of delegations regarding the progress of Azerbaijan’s investment in Pakistan.

This is the second time in a week that a storm of such intensity wreaked havoc in many parts of the country, damaging crops, properties, and other infrastructure. At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains had battered many areas in Islamabad, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Saturday.
Four women and a man died in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and three in KP, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said, while other officials said two died in Punjab.
“One person is still missing,” Haroon Rasheed, a senior government official in AJK, told AFP, adding that 12 houses and a mosque were destroyed in one village.
According to the NDMA, stormy weather is expected to continue in northern and central parts of the country until Saturday.
Pakistan is grappling with increasingly frequent extreme weather events blamed on climate change. Temperatures reached near-record levels in April — as high as 46.5 Celsius in parts of Punjab.

Iran has long been accused by Western powers of seeking to develop nuclear weapons — a claim Tehran has consistently denied, insisting its nuclear programme is solely for peaceful, civilian purposes.
Tehran and Washington have in recent weeks held five rounds of talks aimed at the issue — their highest-level contact since the US withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal under Donald Trump in 2018.
“Countries that were hostile to us and behaved unprincipledly over the years — we have always tried not to accept inspectors from those countries,” Iran’s nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami told reporters, referring to staff from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran “will reconsider accepting American inspectors through the agency” if an agreement is reached and Tehran’s demands are taken into account, he added.
Since returning to office in January, Trump has reinstated his “maximum pressure” policy on Tehran, including the imposition of new sanctions on Iran.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Wednesday that “consultations are ongoing regarding the time and location of the next round of talks, and once finalised, they will be announced by Oman.”
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, currently on an official visit to Oman, thanked the Gulf state for its mediation efforts between the longtime adversaries, which have had no formal diplomatic ties since 1979.
‘Non-negotiable’
While welcoming the negotiations, Iranian officials have repeatedly declared uranium enrichment a “non-negotiable”. US officials, including Washington’s representative in the talks, Steve Witkoff, have also publicly identified it as a red line.
Eslami also said that the issue of enrichment “has not been raised at all” and “the enrichment percentage should not be raised politically”.
“The enrichment percentage depends on the type of use. When highly enriched uranium is produced, it does not necessarily mean military use,” he told reporters.
Baqaei said: “The continuation of enrichment in Iran is an inseparable part of the country’s nuclear industry and a fundamental principle for the Islamic Republic of Iran,” he added.
“Any proposal or initiative that contradicts this principle or undermines this right is unacceptable.”
Iran currently enriches uranium up to 60 per cent — the highest level of any non-nuclear weapons state — still below the 90pc threshold required for a nuclear weapon, but far above the 3.67pc limit set under the 2015 deal.
The European parties to the 2015 nuclear accord — France, Germany, and the United Kingdom — are weighing whether to trigger the agreement’s “snapback” mechanism, which would reinstate UN sanctions on Iran for non-compliance.
Tehran has repeatedly warned against activating the measure.</p><small>2025-05-28 11:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606628-trilateral-summit-pakistan-reiterates-call-for-dialogue-with-india-to-resolve-outstanding-issues' target='_blank'><strong>Trilateral summit: Pakistan reiterates call for dialogue with India to resolve outstanding issues</strong></a><br><p>

With a public holiday, the nation is celebrating Youm-i-Takbeer to mark the historic day of May 28, 1998 when Pakistan joined the ranks of nuclear powers after atomic tests in the hills of Chagai, Balochistan. Pakistan became the seventh nuclear nation in the world and the first Muslim state to have a nuclear arsenal.
PM Shehbaz emphasised that Youm-i-Takbeer was more than a celebration and was a solemn reminder of Pakistan’s resolve to safeguard its sovereignty, according to his statement carried by the Associated Press of Pakistan.
He linked this year’s commemoration with what he described as Pakistan’s recent success in defending itself from “an unjustified war imposed by India”. Appreciating the nation’s spirit during the confrontation, the premier said, “The joys of Youm-i-Takbeer have further increased for a nation filled with victory.”
 






President Zardari also observed: “In today’s evolving regional security situation, our nuclear capability continues to serve as a credible minimum deterrent that guarantees our peace and ensures that no one can undermine our sovereignty and national security.”
In a statement, he highlighted that the 1998 achievement was not “merely a demonstration of our technological advancement — it was a calculated decision to ensure peace through strength, to maintain the strategic balance in South Asia, and to protect our nation against any external aggression”.
Twenty-seven years ago, a team of Pakistani scientists led by Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr Samar Mubarakmand carried out nuclear tests in the Raskoh Hills in Chagai, upon Nawaz’s decision in response to Indian nuclear tests.
 
 

PM Shehbaz, in a post on X, said: “We thank Allah Almighty for His countless blessings and for granting us yet another glorious victory in the face of recent Indian aggression.”
“We commend our valiant armed forces for their unwavering resolve and determination to defend the nation’s frontiers against all external and internal threats.
“In the same spirit of unity and resolve, we pledge to build Pakistan into a strong economic power that would become the envy of the world,” the premier vowed.
He hailed his brother and then-PM Nawaz Sharif for making “Pakistan’s defence invincible with his bold and courageous decision in 1998 to go ahead with a peaceful nuclear test in the face of strong opposition from many powerful countries”.
He also paid tribute to former president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for his “visionary leadership”, as well as “brilliant scientists and engineers who turned the vision and aspirations of the entire nation into reality”.
 






In his statement on the occasion, PM Shehbaz urged the nation to carry the spirit of Youm-i-Takbeer beyond defence and into economic transformation.
Thanking patriotic Pakistanis, he said, “I salute the nation, which made immense sacrifices for the completion of the nuclear programme and wrote a proud story of its determination and faith.”
Reflecting on the historic nuclear tests conducted during Nawaz’s tenure, Shehbaz noted that the decision to respond with six nuclear tests, compared to India’s five, was a demonstration of “iron resolve” in the face of global pressure and sanctions.
“Mr Nawaz Sharif represented the aspirations and national interests of the entire nation … and made our geographical borders impregnable forever,” the premier stressed.
The premier also paid glowing tribute to the architects of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, including Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. He invoked the leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and said, “National history is a witness that the people and political leadership of Pakistan have always made the impossible possible.”
 
 

In his message on the occasion, President Zardari noted that Pakistan “demonstrated its strategic patience and commitment to peace” in the face of recent unprovoked Indian aggression.
“Our calibrated response, under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, was measured and effective, which forced the enemy to cease its hostile actions.”
He reaffirmed that Pakistan did not seek conflict and was committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law. “This day serves as a reminder of our commitment to safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of our beloved country,” the president said.
President Zardari also paid a rich tribute to Pakistani scientists, engineers, as civil and military leadership. He also appreciated Bhutto for laying the foundation of the nuclear programme and ex-premier Benazir Bhutto’s role in further strengthening it.
 






According to state-run broadcaster Radio Pakistan, rallies were staged in Muzaffarabad and Jamshoro to commemorate the occasion.
Armed forces renew ‘unflinching resolve’ to defend motherland against all threats
The armed forces of Pakistan, along with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the services chiefs, also extended their heartfelt felicitations to the nation on the 27th anniversary of Youm-i-Takbeer.
A statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) noted: “This day underscores Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity. It affirms our doctrine of credible minimum deterrence, rooted in the principle of maintaining peace and strategic stability in the region.”
 






The armed forces reiterated their “unflinching resolve to defend the motherland against all threats across the full spectrum of conflict”.
“As responsible custodians of the nation’s strategic assets, we reaffirm that our nuclear capability remains solely for defensive purposes and stands as a guarantor of peace,” the military reaffirmed.
“Youm-i-Takbeer commemorates the momentous occasion in 1998 when Pakistan emerged as a nuclear power — restoring the strategic balance in South Asia and asserting its sovereign right to self-defence,” it noted.
The ISPR highlighted that the historic achievement epitomised the nation’s resolve, unity and unwavering pursuit of a dignified and peaceful existence.
 
 

“Pakistan’s strategic capability is a national trust, reflecting the collective aspirations of its people. The commemoration of Youm-i-Takbeer is a tribute to the foresight of visionary leadership, the brilliance of our scientists and engineers, and the countless contributions of all those who rendered Pakistan’s defence unassailable,” it added.
“Let this day renew our collective pledge to remain vigilant, united and resolute in our commitment to the security, progress, and prosperity of our beloved homeland.” The armed forces honoured the “sacrifices that made this milestone possible”.
‘Pakistan’s defence is unshakable’
Nawaz, hailed for his leadership during the 1998 nuclear tests, posted on X: “Happy Youm-i-Takbeer to the nation.”
 






The ex-premier’s daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, addressing his father, said: “The service to Pakistan that Allah Almighty wrote in your destiny, has not been shared by anyone else.”
 






In his message, Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah noted: “May 28 marks Pakistan’s dignity, resolve and scientific strength.”
Paying tribute to Bhutto and Benazir, he asserted, “Pakistan’s defence is unshakable, we stand united.”
 






Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi noted that Youm-i-Takbeer had become a “metaphor for pride, determination and dignity for the Pakistani nation”.
“Youm-i-Takbeer is not just a day, but an ideology, a pledge, a message that Pakistan will always remain strong and enduring.”
The Balochistan government’s X account called the 1998 tests a “historic moment of strength, unity and deterrence”.
The PTI paid tribute to the late Dr Abdul Qadeer, saying: “The credit for making Pakistan a nuclear power goes to Dr Abdul Qadeer and his colleagues.
“The entire nation is grateful to them for this great achievement. May Allah Almighty reward them greatly for it. We pay tribute to them for this great service to the country and nation.”
 






Former foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari “credited the “foresight and unparalleled courage” of his grandfather Bhutto, who “showed the dream of making Pakistan a nuclear power and provided a practical basis for it”.
“Our nuclear defence is a symbol of the trust of these martyrs and their unparalleled sacrifices, and a strong shield for future generations. We should never forget how much struggle and sacrifice are behind it,” the MNA said in a post on X.
“Let us all work together to build a Pakistan that is a true reflection of peace, progress and the hopes of the people.”
 






In a separate statement issued by his party, Bilawal “saluted the tireless efforts of Pakistan’s scientists, engineers, armed forces and visionary political leadership”.
He also remembered his mother Benazir, who, “with her sagacity and determination, protected and advanced the nuclear programme during her tenure”.</p><small>2025-05-28 11:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2815080394331d0.jpg?r=151000' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913864/seven-rescued-two-go-missing-as-boat-sinks-in-indus-river-near-kohat' target='_blank'><strong>Seven rescued, two go missing as boat sinks in Indus River near Kohat</strong></a><br><p>Seven people were rescued while two went missing after a boat sank in the Indus River near Kohat on Wednesday, according to Rescue 1122 officials.

As of May 18, a total of 55,865 Afghan nationals including 35,975 ACC holders and 19,890 illegal migrants have left for Afghanistan since April 1, the day the second phase began after the deadline for repatriation of registered Afghan nationals ended on March 31.
The PEN International-led joint statement, signed by freedom of expression and human rights organisations, concerns the recent acceleration in the mass deportation of Afghans from Pakistan, including at-risk writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others at risk of persecution from the Taliban for their peaceful expression.
 
 

More than a dozen organisations called on the government to “immediately halt the arbitrary mass deportation of Afghan nationals in line with the country’s human rights obligations, including the principle of non-refoulement.
“We urge the international community to continue to provide safety to at-risk Afghans, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others who fled the Taliban’s persecution,” PEN International said.
It noted that the government’s decision to deport Afghan nationals, announced on October 3, 2023, drew “significant concern” from international institutions, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration, who urged the government to continue to protect at-risk Afghans.
“Despite the UNHCR’s active non-return advisory for Afghanistan and calls from UN experts to halt the deportations, the government of Pakistan has accelerated its forced returns in recent months, resulting in over 30,000 deportations in April alone,” the statement said.
“Included among those deported who are at greatest risk of persecution are writers, journalists, artists, and human rights defenders who continue to face significant threats of arbitrary arrest, torture and imprisonment for any form of expression that the Taliban deem incompatible with their ideology.
“Women and girls deported to Afghanistan will face overwhelming levels of repression impacting every aspect of their lives, amounting to what UN experts have described as ‘gender apartheid’,” the statement read.
Many of those who fled across the border into Pakistan following the Taliban’s return to de facto rule in August 2021 had planned to travel onwards to a country of safety, PEN International stated
“However, the suspension of humanitarian visa pathways and inadequate support for at-risk Afghans in countries around the world, including the US, the UK and Germany, has left many stranded in a situation of abject precarity and insecurity.”
For the over one million Afghan refugees and asylum seekers who remain in Pakistan, the intensifying crackdown by Pakistani authorities, which includes mass arrests and other forms of harassment, has instilled a renewed sense of fear in a community already blighted by conflict and marginalisation, PEN International emphasised.
“In light of the severe risk posed by the Taliban, the undersigned organisations call on the government of Pakistan to immediately suspend its ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’.
“We also call on the international community to ensure safe and legal passage for Afghan refugees and asylum seekers, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders, and others at risk of persecution for their peaceful expression.

He was also critical of the Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) performance, especially in terms of the Tajir Dost Scheme (TDS).
Under the TDS, taxes were to be collected from shopkeepers at a fixed rate of Rs100 to Rs60,000 per month based on the fair market value of the stores and sales. The scheme was implemented to bring traders and wholesalers into the formal tax structure to fulfill the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) requirement.
The former finance minister said the FBR had failed to bring more people under tax net, while responding to a query on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’ on the board’s inability to raise Rs5.6 million under the TDS.
Mandviwalla criticised the “1960’s system” at the FBR and emphasised on the need to introduce officers who could use technology to improve the taxation system, giving examples of Turkey and India.
“Every year we hear the FBR will be reformed but it doesn’t happen.”
He also confirmed that the upcoming budget will be a “standard-type budget” and will be a burden on public’s pockets.
“I have no expectation of relief from the budget.”
The chief of the Senate standing committee on finance said the petroleum levy will be increased as to offset the shortfall of Rs700 billion revenue.
“Levy will be applied, public will pay for it and this is how budget’s deficit will be will be overcome.”
Last year, the federal government had set a target to collect Rs1.28 trillion through the petroleum levy in the fiscal year 2024-25, marking a 47.4 per cent increase over the previous year’s target.
In June, the government decided not to let the petroleum prices decline from Rs80, as it could trigger increased demand, encourage carbon emissions and cost higher foreign exchange.
Moreover, the government had also given an undertaking to the IMF to impose about Rs5 per litre carbon levy as part of the $1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility with effect from July 1.</p><small>2025-05-28 10:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606609-field-marshal-munir-discusses-regional-security-dynamics-with-azerbaijani-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir discusses regional security dynamics with Azerbaijani defence minister</strong></a><br><p>

The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns as a ceasefire was reached.
In a video posted by Indian news outlet ANI, Modi, addressing India’s youth, calls into question the contents of the Indus Waters Treaty. He said, “If you study the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, you’ll be shocked.”
 






He continued, “It was decided that the dams built on the rivers of Jammu and Kashmir would not be cleaned… For 60 years, these gates were never opened. Reservoirs that were supposed to be filled to 100 per cent capacity have now been reduced to only 2pc or 3pc.”
Stating that the treaty has only been held in abeyance as of now, he added, “Right now, I haven’t done anything, and people are sweating there [Pakistan].”
Calling Modi’s remarks “unexpected”, the FO in its statement urged India to set aside its project of “historical revisionism”.
 






The FO termed India’s approach towards the treaty as a “troubling departure from international norms”, while drawing a contrast between Pakistan and India’s regional conduct and global ambitions.
“A leadership truly in pursuit of international respect might first look inward, and seek to cleanse its conscience before issuing threats to others,” the statement read.
It further added, “Pakistan urges India to return to the core principles of international order including respect for sovereign rights of others and its treaty obligations, as well as restraint in both language and action.”
The FO in its statement cautioned that “Jingoism may stir applause on the campaign trail, but it undermines long-term peace and stability”. It continued that “India’s youth, often the first casualty of chauvinistic nationalism, would do well to reject the politics of fear and instead work toward a future defined by dignity, reason, and regional cooperation”.
The statement read that such acts may serve domestic optics but cannot withstand international scrutiny or inspire India’s image as a responsible regional power, while highlighting that “the ideological followers of India’s current government have normalised mob violence, promoted hate campaigns and targeted religious minorities”.
“The Indian government is linked to extraterritorial assassinations and foreign subversion.
India is in occupation of foreign people and territories. Its record in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir is defined by systematic repression. It is ironic that such a state now attempts to claim the mantle of victimhood.“</p><small>2025-05-28 08:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/28123124a5b534c.jpg?r=124129' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913853/competition-commission-fines-housing-society-rs150m-for-misleading-advertising' target='_blank'><strong>Competition Commission fines housing society Rs150m for misleading advertising</strong></a><br><p>In a significant move to curb deceptive marketing practices, the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) imposed a hefty fine on a housing society for false and misleading advertisements.
“The commission imposed a penalty of Rs150 million on Kingdom Valley Pvt Ltd for misleading advertisements concerning its housing project,” read a statement by the CCP.
The CCP’s Office of Fair Trade initiated an investigation after taking notice and found that the company “falsely advertised its project as Kingdom Valley Islamabad, despite it being located in Mouza Choora, tehsil and district Rawalpindi”.
It added that the company misrepresented affiliations with the Naya Pakistan Housing Program (NPHP) and Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority (NAPHDA).
Furthermore, it was noted that the company publicised the project as ‘NOC [no-objection certificate] Approved’ without accurate or complete disclosure regarding its approval status.
The commission’s bench, comprising Saeed Ahmed Nawaz and Abdul Rashid Sheikh, concluded that the company violated Sections 10(2)(a) and 10(2)(b) of the Competition Act, 2010, which prohibits dissemination of false or misleading information to consumers.
Consequently, the companied imposed a fine of Rs75 million for each violation, amounting to a total fine of Rs150 million.
In addition, the commission noted serious non-compliance on behalf of the company, including its failure to submit audited financial statements.
The company has not filed financials with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan for several years, raising concerns about its governance and transparency.

The 400-foot tall (122 metre) Starship rocket system, the core of Musk’s goal of sending humans to Mars, lifted off from SpaceX’s Starbase, Texas, launch site, flying beyond the point of two previous explosive attempts earlier this year that sent debris streaking over Caribbean islands and forced dozens of airliners to divert course.
For the latest launch, the ninth full test mission of Starship since the first attempt in April 2023, the upper-stage cruise vessel was lofted to space atop a previously flown booster — a first such demonstration of the booster’s reusability.

But SpaceX lost contact with the 232-foot lower-stage booster during its descent before it plunged into the sea, rather than making the controlled splashdown the company had planned.
Starship, meanwhile, continued into suborbital space but began to spin uncontrollably roughly 30 minutes into the mission. The errant spiraling came after SpaceX cancelled a plan to deploy eight mock Starlink satellites into space — the rocket’s “Pez” candy dispenser-like mechanism failed to work as designed.
“Not looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,” SpaceX broadcaster Dan Huot said on a company livestream.
Musk was scheduled to deliver an update on his space exploration ambitions in a speech from Starbase following the test flight, billed as a livestream presentation about “The Road to Making Life Multiplanetary.” Hours later, he had yet to give the speech and there was no sign that he intended to do so.
In a post on X, Musk touted Starship’s scheduled shutdown of an engine in space, a step previous test flights achieved last year. He said a leak on Starship’s primary fuel tank led to its loss of control.
“Lot of good data to review,” he said.
“Launch cadence for next three flights will be faster, at approximately one every three to four weeks.”
 






SpaceX has said the Starship models that have flown this year bear significant design upgrades from previous prototypes, as thousands of company employees work to build a multi-purpose rocket capable of putting massive batches of satellites in space, carrying humans back to the moon and ultimately ferrying astronauts to Mars.
Risk-tolerant
The recent setbacks indicate SpaceX is struggling to overcome a complicated chapter of Starship’s multibillion-dollar development. But the company’s engineering culture, widely considered more risk-tolerant than many of the aerospace industry’s more established players, is built on a flight-testing strategy that pushes spacecraft to the point of failure, then fine-tunes improvements through frequent repetition.
Starship’s planned trajectory for Tuesday included a nearly full orbit around Earth for a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean to test new designs of its heat shield tiles and revised flaps for steering its blazing re-entry and descent through Earth’s atmosphere.
But its early demise, appearing as a fireball streaking eastward through the night sky over southern Africa, puts another pause in Musk’s speedy development goals for a rocket bound to play a central role in the US space programme.
NASA plans to use the rocket to land humans on the moon in 2027, though that moon programme faces turmoil amid Musk’s Mars-focused influence over US President Donald Trump’s administration.
Mishap probe
Federal regulators had granted SpaceX a licence for Starship’s latest flight attempt four days ago, capping a mishap investigation that had grounded Starship for nearly two months.
The last two test flights — in January and March — were cut short moments after liftoff as the vehicles blew to pieces on ascent, raining debris over parts of the Caribbean and disrupting scores of commercial airline flights in the region.
The Federal Aviation Administration expanded debris hazard zones around the ascent path for Tuesday’s launch.
The previous back-to-back failures occurred in early test-flight phases that SpaceX had easily achieved before, in a striking setback to a program that Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur who founded the rocket company in 2002, had sought to accelerate this year.
Musk, the world’s wealthiest individual and a key supporter of US President Donald Trump, was especially eager for a success after vowing in recent days to refocus his attention on his various business ventures, including SpaceX, following a tumultuous foray into national politics and his attempts at cutting government bureaucracy.
Closer to home, Musk also sees Starship as eventually replacing the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as the workhorse in the company’s commercial launch business, which already lofts most of the world’s satellites and other payloads to low-Earth orbit.</p><small>2025-05-28 08:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606599-watch-out-fraudsters-using-fake-pta-calls-messages-to-steal-personal-data' target='_blank'><strong>Watch out!

The report presented to the Punjab Assembly details the theft, disappearance and non-recovery of arms from police stores in 12 districts. The total value of the missing equipment is reported to exceed Rs245.5 million, none of which has been recovered to date.
As per the report, weapons worth over Rs83.4m went ‘missing’ from the Muzaffargarh DPO office between 2021 and 2023; arms and bullets valued at over Rs47.1m are unaccounted for in the DIG Operations Lahore office; weapons worth more than Rs46.8m missing from the Police Office Lahore have not been recovered.
Likewise, rifles and ammunition exceeding Rs7.4m value have disappeared from the CPO Multan’s office; the record of rifles issued to various officers in 2009 is missing from the Central Jail Lahore; weapons and equipment valued at Rs5.614m are missing from the DPO Sialkot office; arms worth Rs4.3m are missing from the DPO Sahiwal office; weapons and equipment exceeding Rs3.8m have disappeared from the DPO Okara office.

Home dept orders probe; house echoes with criticism of CCD, proposed Goonda Act

Arms worth Rs3.5m are missing from DPO Gujrat office; weapons and ammunition valued at over Rs2.6m have disappeared from the DPO Faisalabad office.
 
 

In response to the alarming findings, Punjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal has ordered an inquiry into the missing weapons’ report.
An inquiry committee has been formed, headed by the Additional IG Special Branch, with the Director-General Monitoring and Additional Secretary Judicial (Home) as members, says a spokesperson for the department.
The committee has been tasked with submitting a report within 10 days. It will also require responses regarding the irregularities detailed in the audit report.
The home department clarifies that it does not directly store weapons; rather, they are held by law enforcement agencies, who are responsible and accountable for the use of arms. Action will be taken against those found responsible upon receipt of the inquiry report, the spokesperson says quoting the home secretary.
Meanwhile, a general debate on law and order in the Punjab Assembly saw strong criticism from Leader of Opposition Ahmad Khan Bhachar regarding the absence of home department officials from the gallery.
“I am dismayed to see that no representative from the department was present.”
Following Bhachar’s strong objections, Panel of Chairperson Samiullah Khan expressed his displeasure, emphasising that the presence of senior home department officials is mandatory during discussions on law and order. He announced that a letter of disapproval would be sent to the home department regarding their absence.
Despite their absence, the opposition chose not to boycott the session, vowing to deliver speeches that would cause “annoyance to the government”.
Bhachar accused the government of failing completely to establish law and order in the province. He criticised the creation of a crime control department (CCD) that empowered 4,000 individuals despite the existence of a police force of 250,000.
Contradicting government claims of reduced crime, he cited alarming statistics for Lahore: 324 incidents on one day and 370 on another. He also recounted instances of police high-handedness, including stopping MPAs outside Adiala Jail, continued FIRs against them, and leaving them stranded after release. He labeled the Punjab Police as “savage beasts” serving only the “elite class.”
Bhachar condemned the government’s proposed “Goonda Act,” calling it a “black law” from the 1930s British era, designed to empower district intelligence committees and officers to intrude into people’s homes and expose them to sensitive agencies.
 
 

Opposition MPA Sheikh Imtiaz regretted that the standing committee chairmen would give protocol to the police officers summoned by the committee in different cases. He claimed that Punjab University students say that most of the ice in the varsity was sold by policemen.
Ahsan Raza, another PTI MPA, criticised the creation of CCD saying it is a system parallel to the police and leading to clash with the police.
Treasury MPA Rana Arshad defended the creation of CCD as a step to improve protection of the people.
Malik Arshad, another PML-N MPA, sought expansion of CCD to the whole province.
Opposition’s Junaid Sahi said CCD could become only a unit of the home department and not a full department. He demanded abolition of the 250,000-strong police department if 4,000 CCD officials could maintain order in the province.
Parliamentary secretary Khalid Ranjha wondered that the opposition cried hoarse on the law and order issue and when a department like CCD is established to improve the situation, it is criticised before giving it time to show performance. He asked why the opposition feared that the Goonda Act was being introduced for them.
