Finance Minister Mian Mujtaba Shuja lauded the budget as “people-friendly” and dismissed all objections from the opposition.
The session, presided over by Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, began with a three-hour and 33-minute delay.
The opposition continued their vocal protests, prompting the Speaker to humorously inquire if they were chanting against “Modi” or “Yahoodi” (Jews), which drew laughter from the treasury benches.
Summing up the five-day budget debate, the minister emphasised that it was a “progressive and balanced budget” aligning with public aspirations. He highlighted a significant increase in the development budget to Rs1,240bn for the current fiscal year, compared to Rs840bn previously. He also noted substantial reductions in non-development expenditures and the circular debt.
 
 

Opposition members led by Malik Ahmed Bhachar, however, raised concerns about rising crime rates, particularly against women, and criticised the government’s agricultural policies, despite the finance minister’s assurances of farmer-friendly initiatives and substantial allocations for the sector.
Demands for grants to the police, health services, education, and Public Health Engineering departments were approved by a majority vote, while the opposition’s cut motions were rejected.
The session was adjourned until Thursday (today) at 11am.

“It is divine justice that the man who wanted to sideline PML-N head Nawaz Sharif has himself been abandoned by his party,” the minister said in a statement here on Wednesday.
A day earlier, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan told media persons that it seemed that “minus-Imran” formula was now in effect. She was referring to the passing of provincial budget by the Khyber Pakht­unkhwa government without the approval of the PTI founder who has been in jail for nearly two years in multiple cases.
“Aleema Khan has been continuously conspiring against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, and today, Ali Amin himself openly acknowledged these conspiracies against him,” Ms Bokhari said and added that had Gandapur failed to get the provincial budget passed as the province’s chief executive, he would have been constitutionally-bound to resign.
The minister said the group backed by Aleema Khan, along with PTI’s social media wing, was actively running a campaign against Gandapur.
“The PTI at the federal level is divided into three factions, while in KP, three different groups [of the party] are operating. One group is led by Junaid Akbar, second by Atif Khan, and the third one consists of members who have already rebelled against the party,” she claimed.
PTI: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf says the ‘imposed’, ‘incompetent’ regime and those who brought them to power have tried everything, but failed and will continue to fail in their attempts to minus Imran.
Responding to information minister Azma Bukhari’s statement, PTI Punjab media cell head Shayan Bashir said Ms Bukhari and her masters have already been permanently eliminated from Pakistan’s political landscape.
He said the defeated puppets, on the orders of their masters, were trying to create divisions within the PTI through propaganda to ensure their own survival.
“Instead of spreading rumours and using foul language, these foul-mouthed handmaidens of the mandate thieves should answer for the billions in irregularities and corruption in Punjab,” Mr Bashir asked.

The bust, executed under the code name ‘Operation Yalghar’, has led to the arrest of six suspected RAW facilitators in Toba Tek Singh district.
Sources say the law enforcement agencies acted quickly when they detected audio calls of two individuals identified as Major Rawindra Rathor and Inspector Singh — both officers of RAW — to their local handlers.
The recordings reveal that the RAW officers were issuing instructions to the local handlers how to do recce of some sensitive installations and carry out an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) blast at a mosque to cause large-scale casualties and other damage.

Suspects were to carry out blasts at a mosque, Bahawalpur Railway Station

They were also being assigned some other tasks from RAW officers, including targeted killings, picking up IEDs from a Indian Border Security Force (BSF) gate, planting the explosives at the Bahwalpur Railway Station, besides passing instructions to them regarding border crossing.
In the audio recordings (also available with Dawn), they also discussed a deal to make payments with the local facilitators against each Indian-sponsored task they were to complete, and the mode of payment through their Dubai-based agents.
Meanwhile, senior police officers held a press conference here at the Central Police Office, saying they seized a cache of sensitive material, including maps of strategic locations in Pakistan, detonators and high-grade explosives.
Punjab Additional IG (Operations) Shahzada Sultan says that was not an isolated operation as in a parallel development the Bahawalpur CTD apprehended more suspects allegedly linked to the same RAW-sponsored network.
He said a Raw-sponsored Dubai-based payment facilitator, Zulfiqar, a resident of Dera Ghazi Khan, was apprehended from Bahawalpur, besides Azam alias Jajji and Manzoor alias Qari, both residents of Bahawalpur and one Amjad of Pakpattan.
These individuals, according to the CTD officials, received financial support routed through Dubai and consignments of IEDs directly from India’s BSF.
“The suspects were actively plotting attacks on a mosque and a local [Bahawalpur] railway station,” Mr Sultan said. “Had they succeeded, the consequences would have been catastrophic.”
The police officer said that perhaps most alarming was the intelligence haul accompanying these arrests.
“Forensic examination of the digital communications intercepted by the CTD has unearthed audio recordings of two individuals identified as Major Rawindra Rathor and Inspector Singh, alleged officers within RAW, who were giving direct operational instructions to the apprehended men,” he said.
 
 

In the recordings, the two RAW officers can be heard directing the execution of attacks on “sensitive installations” across Pakistan.
The police officers termed the development very significant as Pakistani authorities have not only named, but also provided “direct evidence” of Indian intelligence operatives orchestrating subversive activities on Pakistani soil.
In a statement issued late on Wednesday, the CTD vowed to safeguard the national security.
“We will not compromise on the sovereignty of Pakistan,” the agency said. “Anyone involved in aiding any foreign attempt to destabilise our country will be brought to justice.”
This crackdown reinforces Islamabad’s long-standing claims of external interference, particularly by New Delhi, in its internal security affairs.
The CTD says the proxy networks, their clandestine facilitators and hybrid warfare are fast becoming the new norm in South Asia’s security theatre.
 
 

This episode is likely to further deteriorate the already tense relations between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and will certainly feature in the diplomatic back channels between the two countries, if not escalating into open recriminations on global forums, says the agency.

The telescope, which can see farther into the universe than anything before it, has turbocharged the search for planets beyond the Solar System since coming online in 2022.
Until now, however, its deep gaze has mostly been used to probe already known exoplanets, to find out key information such as the atmospheric composition, rather than tracking down new worlds.
The discovery of exoplanet TWA 7b, revealed in a study in the journal Nature, “represents a first for the telescope”, France’s CNRS research centre said in a statement.
The large majority of the nearly 6,000 exoplanets found so far have been identified from the light they blot out when they pass in front of their star, rather than from direct images of the planet.
Webb “has spent an enormous amount of time observing planets that have never been directly imaged”, lead study author Anne-Marie Lagrange of the Paris Observatory told AFP.
‘Blinded by the light’
Capturing direct images of faraway planets is difficult because they are “very faint” due to a lack of heat, Lagrange said. Even worse, she added, “We’re blinded by the light of the star they orbit.”
But Webb has a way to get around the problem.
An attachment to Webb’s MIRI instrument called a coronagraph masks the star, creating an effect similar to a solar eclipse. The telescope’s infrared vision can then peer through and spot the planet.
Astronomers pointed Webb at the star TWA 7, which is around a hundred light years from Earth, relatively nearby in the universe.
The star, which was first spotted by the Hubble Space Telescope in 1999, was thought to be a promising target for two reasons.
It is just 6.4 million years old — a baby compared to the Sun’s 4.5 billion years — and still surrounded by a massive disc of gas and dust where planets are thought to form.
And from the direction of Earth, the disc is seen from above, giving a good view of its rings.
The three rings around the star, which stretch more than 100 times the distance separating the Sun and Earth, had previously been spotted by the Very Large Telescope in Chile.
But inside an otherwise empty section of the second ring, the Webb telescope detected something particularly bright. Astronomers ruled out that the light was coming from an object at the edge of the Solar System, or from a distant galaxy behind the star.
That could mean only that the light source was a relatively small and cold planet, with a mass at least 10 times lighter than any other exoplanet directly imaged so far, according to the study.
The hunt for smaller worlds
The researchers estimated that the planet’s mass was similar to that of Saturn, a gas giant that weighs only a third of Jupiter, the biggest planet in the Solar System.
Webb has increased the ability to detect exoplanets via direct images by a factor of 10, Lagrange said.
That is important because smaller, rocky planets similar to Earth or Mars are the ultimate target in the search for habitable worlds outside of the Solar System.
Lagrange said she would be delighted to discover “Earth-like planets” one day.
But she said astronomers needed to study all kinds of planets — and to understand how planetary systems form — to know whether the life-hosting Solar System is unique.
In the future, astronomers expect the Webb telescope will be able to spot planets even smaller than TWA 7b.
But directly capturing images of faraway worlds similar to Earth will require even more telescopic power, such as from the Extremely Large Telescope that is scheduled to come online in Chile in 2028.</p><small>2025-06-25 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610914-pakistan-uae-ink-agreement-on-visa-exemption-for-diplomatic-passports-joint-investment-body' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UAE ink agreement on visa exemption for diplomatic passports</strong></a><br><p>

Nepra Spokesperson Safeer Hussain confirmed the development to Dawn.com and said the proposal had been sent to the federal government.
 
 

Last month, against high hopes, the government sought revision in the base electricity tariff for the next fiscal year, proposing only 30 paise to a maximum of Rs2.25 per unit reduction in consumer rates under seven different scenarios.
Only in one unlikely case of normal circumstances and a stable exchange rate at Rs280, the average base tariff would reduce by Rs2.25 per unit in fiscal year 2025-26 to Rs24.75 from the prevailing rate of about Rs27 per unit.
In case of local currency depreciation to Rs300, the base tariff reduction would be around 30 paise per unit. The reduction mainly stems from lower capacity payments.
The average Power Purchase Price (PPP) would be on top of about Rs8.16 to Rs9.52 per unit fuel cost, taking the total electricity price to range between Rs34 and Rs35 per unit, excluding taxes, fees, duties and surcharges.
Electricity demand is projected to grow between three and five per cent in all cases, but only if the exchange rate remains stable at Rs280. The exchange rate has been assumed to be Rs300 in all six other cases. In addition, US inflation has been taken at 2pc, Pakistan inflation at 8.65pc, besides 11.9pc Karachi Interbank Offe­red Rate, 4.07pc international interest rate, and transmission losses at 2.80pc.
The Nepra determination would be taken to the federal cabinet for approval and subsidy allocation, and the power division would file a follow-up tariff table to Nepra for subsidy punching for various consumer categories and slabs be­­fore formal notification with effect from July 1 as already committed to the International Monetary Fund.</p><small>2025-06-25 15:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610916-impressive-great-man-trump-heaps-praise-on-field-marshal-munir-again' target='_blank'><strong>'Impressive, great man': Trump heaps praise on Field Marshal Munir, again</strong></a><br><p>

In a short statement, Nato endorsed a higher defence spending goal of 5 per cent of GDP by 2035, a response to a demand by Trump and to Europeans’ fears that Russia poses a growing threat to their security following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
“We reaffirm our ironclad commitment to collective defence as enshrined in Article Five of the Washington Treaty that an attack on one is an attack on all,” the statement said, after Trump had sparked concern on Tuesday by saying there were “numerous definitions” of the clause.
But just before the summit opened, Trump had said of fellow Nato members: “We’re with them all the way.”
Trump lauded the “tremendous” summit in the Hague as leaders wrapped up a meeting that saw the alliance back his demand to ramp up defence spending.
“I think the summit was fantastic. It was a big success,” Trump told Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof.
Spending to jump by hundreds of billions
The 32-nation alliance, for its part, heeded a call by Trump for other countries to step up their spending on defence to reduce Nato’s reliance on the US.
Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte acknowledged that it was not easy for European countries and Canada to find the extra money, but said it was vital to do so.
“There is absolute conviction with my colleagues at the table that, given this threat from the Russians, given the international security situation, there is no alternative,” the former Dutch prime minister told reporters in his home city of The Hague.
The new spending target, to be achieved over the next 10 years, is a jump worth hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the current goal of 2pc of GDP, although it will be measured differently.
Countries would spend 3.5pc of GDP on core defence — troops and weapons — and 1.5pc on broader defence-related measures such as cyber security, protecting pipelines and adapting roads and bridges to handle heavy military vehicles.
All Nato members have backed a statement enshrining the target, although Spain declared it does not need to meet the goal and can meet its commitments by spending much less.
Rutte disputes that, but accepted a diplomatic fudge with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez as part of his efforts to give Trump a diplomatic victory and make the summit go smoothly.
Spain said on Wednesday that it did not expect its stance to have any repercussions.
Rutte compares Trump to a ‘daddy’ after profane comments
Rutte on Wednesday likened Trump to a “daddy” intervening in a schoolyard brawl after the US leader used profanity when describing the war between Israel and Iran.
In comments to the press during a Nato summit in The Hague, Trump had compared fighting between Iran and Israel to children quarrelling.
“They’ve had a big fight, like two kids in a schoolyard. You know, they fight like hell, you can’t stop them. Let them fight for about 2-3 minutes, then it’s easy to stop them.”
Rutte laughed and added: “And then daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get [them to] stop.”

On Tuesday, following a ceasefire deal between Iran and Israel, Trump said the countries had been fighting “so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f*** they’re doing.”
Nato did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Trump also compared on Wednesday the impact of US bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites to the end of World War Two, when the United States bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
“I don’t want to use an example of Hiroshima, I don’t want to use an example of Nagasaki, but that was essentially the same thing. That ended that war. This ended the war,” Trump said.
Trump ‘plays nice’
Trump struck a conciliatory tone towards Nato allies on Wednesday, framing the deal on increased defence spending as a “great victory for everyone” at their summit.
Everything was carefully choreographed at the gathering in The Hague to keep the volatile US president on board: from chopping back the official part of the meeting to putting him up overnight in the royal palace.
The strategy seemed to be working, with Trump seeming keen to share the plaudits for a deal set to see the 32 countries commit to spending 5 per cent of output on defence by 2035.
“It’s a great victory for everybody, I think, and we will be equalised very shortly, and that’s the way it has to be,” said Trump. “I’ve been asking them to go up to 5pc for a number of years, and they’re going up to 5pc … I think that’s going to be very big news.
Hosting the meeting, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte told reporters that Trump was in an “excellent mood” at the dinner hosted on Tuesday by King Willem-Alexander in his royal palace, and that the US leader appeared inspired by his hosts.
“The day begins in the beautiful Netherlands. The King and Queen are beautiful and spectacular people. Our breakfast meeting was great!” he posted on the Truth Social network.
Entering the meeting, leaders lined up to declare the summit’s planned spending hike as “historic”.
Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever said: “As Europeans, we should realise that our long break from history is over.” The continent needed to take responsibility for its own security, “in a very difficult time”, added De Wever.
‘Totally committed’
With that deal all but clinched, attention turned to the basic foundation of the alliance — its mutual defence clause that says an attack on one is an attack on all.
Trump rattled his allies by appearing to cast some doubt on the validity of this promise, known as Article Five of the Nato treaty, telling reporters on the way to The Hague that it “depends on your definition.
“There’s numerous definitions of Article Five.”
But Rutte played down the comments, saying he believed that Trump and the United States were still “totally committed” to Article Five.
And when pressed about the collective pledge while meeting Rutte on Wednesday, Trump said: “We’re with them all the way.”
Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer dodged multiple questions seeking clarity over Washington’s stance.
“We live in a very volatile world and today is about the unity of Nato, showing that strength,” said Starmer.
In an earlier message, probably not designed for public consumption, Rutte heaped flattery on Trump, praising him for bringing everyone on board for the spending hike.
“Europe is going to pay in a big way, as they should, and it will be your win,” Rutte wrote in a gushing, caps-filled missive to Trump, who promptly posted it on social media. “You are flying into another big success in The Hague.”
Trump-Zelensky meeting ‘couldn’t have been nicer’
Underpinning the leaders’ discussions on defence was Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with Trump meeting the war-torn country’s president, Volodymyr Zelensky, on the summit sidelines.
Zelensky said he discussed a ceasefire in Ukraine with Trump in a 50-minute meeting, which he called “long and substantive” on social media.
“We discussed how to achieve a ceasefire and a real peace. We spoke about how to protect our people,” he said.
A source in the Ukrainian presidency told AFP Zelensky was “satisfied with the conversation and grateful to Trump.”
Meanwhile, Trump said the meeting “couldn’t have been nicer”.
Zelensky is playing a less central role here than at previous summits, to avoid a bust-up with Trump after their infamous Oval Office shouting match.
But Trump described him as a “nice guy” and added that he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin about the war, saying: “I think progress is being made.”
Rutte said that allies would send the message that support for Kyiv was “unwavering and will persist”.
But despite his insistence that Ukraine’s bid for membership remains “irreversible”, Nato will avoid any mention of Kyiv’s push to join after Trump ruled it out.
Hungary’s Kremlin-friendly Prime Minister Viktor Orban was more categorical.
“Nato has no business in Ukraine,” he said. “My job is to keep it as it is. “</p><small>2025-06-25 15:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2519511097d831f.jpg?r=195218' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920064/belarusian-man-held-for-throwing-infant-to-the-ground-at-moscow-airport-inflicting-severe-injuries' target='_blank'><strong>Belarusian man held for ‘throwing’ infant to the ground at Moscow airport, inflicting severe injuries</strong></a><br><p>A Belarusian man on Wednesday was arrested for allegedly picking up a one-year-old Afghan boy and throwing him to the ground in the arrivals hall at Moscow’s Sheremetyevo Airport, inflicting spinal and cranial injuries, Britain’s The Daily Mirror newspaper reported.
According to the newspaper, 31-year-old construction worker Vladimir Vitkov was arrested and confessed to “trying to murder” the child, who had arrived in Russia with his family after fleeing Iran due to its 12-day war with Israel.
“Yazdan, aged 18 months, is now fighting for his life with serious skull fractures and spinal injuries,” The Mirror read, adding that Vitkov was on board the same flight as the child and his mother.
Both The Mirror and British newspaper The Daily Mail reported that the boy suffered skull fractures and spinal injuries, with the latter reporting that the boy was “in a coma”.
Graphic CCTV showed Vitkov picking up the boy before “hurling him to the ground of Moscow airport’s arrivals hall”.
“The attacker — described as a ‘monster’ by a Russian official — apparently checks to see if anyone is watching and then suddenly grabs the child, throwing him hard on the floor in the arrivals section of Sheremetyevo airport,” The Mail reported.
According to The Mail, Vitkov reportedly flew to Moscow from Cyprus or Egypt and was rapidly taken into custody after the incident, amid suspicions he was under the influence of drugs.
The Mirror reported that Vitkov had been fired from a nuclear power plant construction job in Egypt after failing a spot check for drugs and alcohol and was returning home via Moscow, citing a friend of the suspect’s.
“He (Vitkov) ‘confessed’ when a police interrogator asked: ‘Explain what you did’,” The Mirror reported. Vitkov responded with, “I attempted to murder a child.”
The Mail reported that police are examining whether there was a racist or other motivation for the act against the child. However, The Mirror said that when his motive was questioned, he replied that he did not know because he was “under the influence of drugs”.
“Reports said cannabis had been found in his possession, and there were traces of the drug in his blood. Mash news outlet reported today that he had drunk three bottles of whisky and obtained cannabis in Cairo before the incident,” The Mirror reported.
Moscow region children’s ombudswoman Ksenia Mishonova was quoted as saying, “A drug-addled monster grabbed a toddler in the arrivals hall and threw him on the floor with all his might. All this is incredibly difficult to bear.
“I hope the detained monster will receive the full severity of the law. I wish the child a speedy recovery. May the parents have the strength to survive this.”
The Mirror quoted the ombudswoman as saying she hopes Vitkov receives “hard labour until he is feeble with old age”.
“I am always very, very careful, but here I no longer have the strength not to say simply [this was] a stoned drug addict, a monster,” she said after seeing the boy in hospital.“
The Iranian Ambassador to Russia, Kazem Jalali, condemned the incident as “completely inhuman”, according to Iran’s Tasnim news agency.
“A video has been circulated showing a child being brutally slammed to the ground. Some have claimed the attacker is Jewish, but I cannot confirm that,” Jalali told Tasnim.
The ambassador added that Tehran immediately contacted Russian authorities to confirm the victim’s nationality.
“It was initially reported that the child was Iranian,” Jalali said. “Russian Foreign Ministry colleagues told us that the file is officially listed under Afghanistan. The innocent child, currently in a coma, is apparently from an Afghan family.”</p><small>2025-06-25 14:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/251846353d49eff.jpg?r=184907' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920059/pakistan-uae-sign-mou-on-visa-exemption-at-12th-jmc-session-held-after-13-year-gap' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UAE sign MOU on visa exemption at 12th JMC session held after 13-year gap</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on mutual visa exemption during the 12th session of the Pakistan-UAE Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), the Foreign Office (FO) said on Wednesday.
The session was held following a hiatus of 13 years after it was scheduled in October 2024. The last session was held in Islamabad from November 6-7, 2013.
The FO said in a statement that the session, held in Abu Dhabi a day ago, was co-chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan.
“Prior to the formal proceedings, a working group meeting of the JMC was held under the leadership of Special Assistant to the PM Tariq Bajwa and Minister of State of the UAE Ahmed Ali Al Sayegh, the statement said.
“The JMC reviewed the full scope of bilateral relations and agreed on concrete measures to strengthen cooperation in trade, banking, culture, investment, aviation, railways, energy, food security, climate change, defence, healthcare, manpower, higher education and information technology.”
 






It also said that both sides emphasised promoting institutional mechanisms and inter-ministerial coordination, and discussed regional and global developments.
“A protocol, outlining procedural frameworks for follow-up actions, coordination through sectoral working groups and facilitation for reciprocal visits, was also signed,” the statement added.
According to FO, “In addition to the protocol of the session, MoU on ‘Mutual Exemption of Entry Visa Requirements’ and ‘Establishment of a Joint Task Force to Promote Investments’ as well as an Agreement on ‘Artificial Intelligence and Digital Economy’ were signed.”
In a post on X, Dar said that he signed an agreement with Al-Nahyan on “mutual visa exemption for the holders of diplomatic and official passports of our two countries”.
“This important step reflects our shared resolve to further strengthen our fraternal ties and deepen institutional collaboration across all levels,” he added.
 






The FO said that both sides expressed satisfaction with the outcomes and agreed to hold the 13th Session of the JMC in Pakistan on mutually agreed-upon dates.
“The successful convening of the JMC session underscores the deep-rooted and multifaceted relationship between Pakistan and the UAE and their shared vision for a dynamic and progressive partnership,” it added.
The UAE is Pakistan’s third-largest trading partner after China and the United States, is home to more than a million Pakistani expatriates and is the second-largest source of remittances after Saudi Arabia.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Tirmizi, had said that the bilateral trade between Pakistan and the UAE exceeded US$10.9 billion in the fiscal year 2023–24, including goods and services.
Earlier this month, PM Shehbaz Sharif met UAE President and Ruler of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan during his official one-day visit to the Gulf state, where he discussed matters of bilateral and regional interest.
The high-level engagement aimed at reaffirming Pakistan’s gratitude to friendly nations that supported Islamabad’s position during its recent standoff with New Delhi.</p><small>2025-06-25 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610901-undemocratic-behaviour-leads-to-exclusion-from-politics-sanaullah-on-minus-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>'Undemocratic behaviour leads to exclusion from politics', Sanaullah on minus-Imran</strong></a><br><p>

The negotiations are part of a broader push to reset economic ties at a time of shifting geopolitical alignments and Pakistan’s efforts to avoid steep US duties on exports.
“Both sides showed satisfaction on the ongoing negotiations and resolved to conclude the trade negotiations next week,” the finance ministry said in a statement, adding that a longer-term strategic and investment partnership is also under discussion.
“The discussion focused on meaningful engagement in trade, investment and deepening economic ties mutually beneficial to both sides, with technical-level trade-related discussions to be concluded next week,” it added.
Pakistan faces a 29 per cent tariff on exports to the US under President Donald Trump’s measures to target countries with large trade surpluses with the US. Pakistan’s surplus was around $3 bn in 2024.
To offset the imbalance and ease tariff pressures, Islamabad has offered to import more US goods, including crude oil, and to open up investment opportunities through concessions for US firms in Pakistan’s mining sector.
Earlier this week, the two countries co-hosted a webinar promoting investment in Pakistan’s mineral sector, including the $7bn Reko Diq copper-gold project.
Senior officials from both governments and US investors discussed public-private partnerships and regulatory reforms.

However, the video is from May, when people in Libya were protesting against their government.
Today, Iran’s National Security Council confirmed that it carried out a retaliatory missile strike on the US military base at Al Udeid in Qatar. The attack came in response to American airstrikes on Iran’s nuclear facilities. In its official statement, Iran emphasised that the number of missiles launched matched the number of bombs used by the US, framing it as a proportional response. The council also clarified that the strike did not pose any threat to Qatar, describing the Gulf nation as a “friendly and brotherly country”.
A video was shared today on X by a pro-military account, based on its bio, past posts and profile picture, showing people protesting.
The caption of the post said: “For the first time in history, the Qatari people are protesting, and that too against the American base built on 12 square kilometres of land in a small country like Qatar.”
The post was viewed by over 122,000 people.
The same claim was also shared by a pro-PTI account, where it received more than 52,000 views.
Several other X users shared the same video with similar captions as can be seen here, here and here.
The video also spread across other social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and TikTok.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the Iran-Israel conflict and the subsequent involvement of the US and Qatar in it.
A reverse image search led to a TikTok video uploaded on May 15. In the video, the person was heard speaking in a foreign language.
  @user3980856610581  ♬ الصوت الأصلي - عبدالمنعم المريمي  
Processing the video through the AI transcription tool Turboscribe, which generated an English transcript, showed that the person mentioned Libyan capital Tripoli and was calling for some official’s resignation.
The same video was also shared by Libyan news outlet Libya Alhadath on Facebook on May 15 with the following caption: “Watch | Protesters in front of the Prime Minister’s Office on Al-Sikka Road are calling for Dbeibah to step down.”
A keyword search for “Libya”, “protest”, “resign” and “Al-Sikka Road” led to a news report by Libyan publication The Libya Observer on May 17, titled: “Protests against Dbeibah government amid resignations by some ministers”.
According to the report, protests took place in Tripoli on May 16 at Martyrs’ Square and outside the Prime Minister’s Office on Al-Sikka Road, with demonstrators demanding the resignation of the Government of National Unity and Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibah. The protests were sparked by recent security tensions in the capital that resulted in casualties and material damage. In response, several ministers resigned in solidarity with the protesters.
A keyword search for news reports on protests in Qatar against any US airbase to corroborate the alleged development also yielded no news reports or videos of any such incident.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a video shows people in Qatar protesting against a US air base is false. The video is from May, when people in Libya were protesting against their government.

The Lancet is a 200-year-old peer-reviewed weekly medical journal from the United Kingdom. Since its launch, the journal has expanded into a family of more than 20 speciality journals and has set up several global Lancet Commissions on various important issues in medicine and healthcare.
In a press release issued a day ago, the journal said that since its inception in 1974, the World Health Organisation’s Essential Programme on Immunisation (EPI) achieved “unprecedented progress”, averting the deaths of an estimated 154 million children worldwide through routine childhood vaccination.
However, it said that as per a major new analysis from the Global Burden of Disease Study Vaccine Coverage Collaborators, “Despite the progress of the past 50 years, the last two decades have also been marked by stagnating childhood vaccination rates and wide variation in vaccine coverage.
“These challenges have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, leaving millions of children vulnerable to preventable diseases and death.”
The authors of the study, titled: “Global, regional, and national trends in routine childhood vaccination coverage from 1980 to 2023 with forecasts to 2030: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023”, said that the latest estimates should be taken as a “clear warning” that global immunisation targets for 2030 would not be achieved without “transformational improvements in equity”, according to the press release.
In 2019, the WHO set ambitious goals for improving vaccine coverage globally through the Immunisation Agenda 2030.
According to data from 2023, which the analysis is based upon, more than half of the world’s 15.7 million unvaccinated children were living in just eight countries, with 53 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa and 13pc in South Asia.
“Despite the monumental efforts of the past 50 years, progress has been far from universal. Large numbers of children remain under and un-vaccinated,” senior study author Dr Jonathan Mosser from the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) was quoted as saying.
The journal pointed out that the Covid-19 pandemic exacerbated challenges with global coverage rates of the original EPI-recommended vaccines declining sharply beginning in 2020, resulting in an estimated 15.6m children missing the full three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine or a measles vaccine between 2020 and 2023, as well as 15.9m children not receiving any polio vaccine and 9.18m missing out on the tuberculosis vaccine.
“The Covid-19 pandemic also reversed previous gains in reducing the number of unvaccinated zero-dose children globally, which peaked at 18.6m before falling to 15.7m by 2023. The study estimates that disruptions to immunisation services during the Covid pandemic resulted in around 12.8m additional unvaccinated zero-dose children globally during the four pandemic years (2020-2023).”
It stressed that “accelerated progress” would be necessary to achieve the 2030 target of halving the number of zero-dose children compared to 2019 levels, with only 18 of 204 countries and territories estimated to have already met this target as of 2023.
It added that population pressures would also add a “double burden to already overstretched healthcare systems that are ill-equipped to handle the substantial growth in vaccine target populations”.
The study’s authors called for more concerted efforts to tackle vaccine misinformation and hesitancy to increase vaccine acceptance and uptake.
Pakistan’s situation
The study also found that Pakistan had the highest number of children with zero doses of vaccines after India in South Asia, with 419,000 children falling into that category.
“Increasing numbers of wild-type polio cases have been reported in Pakistan and Afghanistan,” the press release stated.
Last month, the Pakistan Polio Programme launched the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
In April, in a bid to support routine vaccination, Unicef handed over 31 refrigerated trucks to the Federal Directorate of Immunisation, with the support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.</p><small>2025-06-25 12:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/25143500d4f0825.png?r=143850' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920033/pakistan-through-to-asian-doubles-squash-final-after-defeating-malaysia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan through to Asian Doubles Squash final after defeating Malaysia</strong></a><br><p>Top-ranked Pakistani duo Nasir Iqbal and Noor Zaman stormed into the men’s final of the 2nd Asian Doubles Squash Championship after beating hosts Malaysia 2-1 in the semi-finals on Wednesday.

The astronaut team lifted off from Nasa’s Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, at about 2:30am EDT (11:30am PKT), beginning the latest mission organized by Texas-based startup Axiom Space in partnership with Elon Musk’s rocket venture SpaceX.
The four-member crew was carried aloft on a towering SpaceX launch vehicle consisting of a Crew Dragon capsule perched atop a two-stage Falcon 9 rocket.
Live video showed the towering spacecraft streaking into the night sky over Florida’s Atlantic coast trailed by a brilliant yellowish plume of fiery exhaust.
 






Cameras inside the crew compartment beamed footage of the four astronauts strapped into their pressurized cabin, seated calmly side by side in helmeted white-and-black flight suits as their spacecraft soared toward space.
“We’ve had an incredible ride uphill,” Whitson radioed back to the SpaceX mission control near Los Angeles as Falcon’s upper stage delivered the crew capsule to its preliminary orbit about nine minutes after launch.
Dubbed “Grace” by the Axiom crew, the newly built Crew Dragon launched on Wednesday was making its debut flight as the fifth vehicle of its kind in the SpaceX capsule fleet.
It also marked the first Crew Dragon flight since Musk briefly threatened to decommission the spacecraft after United States President Donald Trump threatened to cancel Musk’s government contracts in a high-profile political feud earlier this month.
Two weeks in orbit
Axiom 4’s autonomously operated Crew Dragon was expected to reach the ISS after a flight of about 28 hours, then dock with the outpost as the two vehicles soar together in orbit some 400 kilometres above Earth.
If all goes according to plan, the Axiom 4 crew will be welcomed aboard the orbiting space laboratory Thursday morning by its seven current resident occupants — three astronauts from the US, one from Japan and three cosmonauts from Russia.
Whitson, 65, and her three Axiom 4 crewmates — Shubhanshu Shukla, 39, of India, Sawosz Uznaski-Winiewski, 41, of Poland, and Tibor Kapu, 33, of Hungary — are slated to spend 14 days aboard the space station conducting microgravity research.
The mission stands as the fourth such flight since 2022 arranged by Axiom as the Houston-headquartered company builds on its business of putting astronauts sponsored by private companies and foreign governments into Earth orbit.
For India, Poland and Hungary, the launch marked a return to human spaceflight after more than 40 years and the first mission to send their astronauts to the ISS.
The Axiom 4 participation of Shukla, an Indian air force pilot, is seen by India’s own space program as a kind of precursor to the debut crewed mission of its Gaganyaan orbital spacecraft, planned for 2027.
The Axiom 4 crew is led by Whitson, who retired from Nasa in 2018 after a pioneering career that included becoming the US space agency’s first female chief astronaut, and the first woman to command an ISS expedition.
Now a consultant and director of human spaceflight for Axiom, she has logged 675 days in space, a US record, during three Nasa missions and a fourth flight to space as commander of the Axiom 2 mission in 2023.
 
 

Wednesday’s blast-off marked SpaceX’s 18th human spaceflight since Musk’s privately funded rocket company ushered in a new era for Nasa five years ago, providing American astronauts their first rides to space from US soil since the end of the space shuttle era in 2011.
Axiom, a nine-year-old venture co-founded by Nasa’s former ISS program manager, is one of a handful of companies developing a commercial space station of its own intended to eventually replace the ISS, which Nasa expects to retire around 2030.
Nasa, besides furnishing the launch site at Cape Canaveral, assumes responsibility for astronauts venturing to the space station once they rendezvous with the orbiting outpost.</p><small>2025-06-25 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/25133602f2ce631.jpg?r=134202' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920014/punjab-predicted-to-receive-25pc-more-monsoon-rains-this-year-pdma' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab predicted to receive 25pc more monsoon rains this year: PDMA</strong></a><br><p>Punjab is predicted to receive 25 per cent more monsoon rains this year, Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said on Wednesday.

ENGLAND opener Ben Duckett plays a shot during the first Test against India at Headingley on Tuesday.—Reuters

LEEDS: A superb century from Ben Duckett helped steer England to a sensational five-wicket win in the first Test against India after a thrilling day five on Tuesday, the hosts reaching a target of 371 — the 10th highest successful run chase in Test history.
Having turned the match on its head at Headingley after India had been 430-3 in their first innings, England appeared to be cruising to a dramatic win as openers Duckett and Zak Crawley eased their side to lunch on 117-0 in their second innings.
 






Duckett continued his imperious form with another four through the covers to reach his sixth Test hundred, before Crawley fell for 65, their 188-run partnership the second-highest England opening fourth-innings stand in Tests.
Two wickets in two balls — Duckett and Harry Brook — dragged India back into the enthralling contest and when Ben Stokes fell for 33 attempting an ambitious reverse sweep, England’s hopes of victory lay precariously in the balance.
Joe Root’s unbeaten 53 calmed the nerves around his home ground, with the former skipper and Jamie Smith, who hit a six to seal victory, seeing England home as India, having scored five centuries in the match, somehow contrived to start the five-Test series in defeat.
“Incredible, what a Test match. It was a huge number of runs and we have been lucky with the weather,” Duckett said. “I am lost for words.
“We only had to look at the scoreboard to know that if we batted the overs, we would win the game. There were moments when I thought about stepping into another gear but the breaks in the game helped us to stay calm.
“To start this series with a 1-0 win is huge for us. It felt calm in the dressing room. To have Root out there, it’s pretty easy to be calm.”  Resuming day five on 21-0, uncharacteristically for a team renowned for their ultra-aggressive batting, Crawley and Duckett took 99 balls to bring up their 50 partnership — the longest it has taken the pair to do so for England — before upping the ante.
There was slight concern for England when first-innings centurion Ollie Pope quickly followed Crawley back to the pavilion midway through the afternoon session, the number three becoming Prasidh Krishna’s next victim in back-to-back overs.
Duckett continued to accumulate runs quickly, however, before attempting one big shot too many to fall to Shardul Thakur for 149 — the second-highest test fourth-innings score by an English opener.
The contribution of Duckett, in such a pressurised situation, cannot be underestimated — it is 15 years since an England opener last scored a fourth-innings hundred: Alastair Cook at Mirpur in 2010.
Nerves set in around the ground when Brook departed for a golden duck, two in two balls for Thakur, with further scares forthcoming as England looked edgy.
Stokes was left shaking his head at the way he fell to Ravindra Jadeja shortly after tea, but Root and Smith both dug in, stopped offering up chances and got the runs required, with Smith rounding off a remarkable victory in style.
Plenty of dropped catches and two batting collapses ultimately cost India. From 430-3 in the first innings, they lost their final seven wickets for just 41 runs, with the tail crumbling again in the second innings, 31 runs accumulated for the fall of the final six wickets.
It is the first time in history a team has managed five centuries in one Test and not emerged victorious, but also the first time those five centurions have been joined by six batsmen who fell for ducks three in each innings — in the same match.
“We had our chances,” Indian captain Shubman Gill said. “A few dropped catches and the lower order not contributing as much as we would like (cost us) but I am proud. Our young team is learning.
“It just didn’t go our way in this match. We have to rectify (the batting collapses) in the upcoming matches.”
For England, at the start of a crucial period with the Ashes to come later this year, their summer could not have got off to a more promising start, with their aggressive approach, even if it has been toned down and refined, achieving their second-highest run chase in their Test history.

Earlier on Tuesday, both Iran and Israel signaled that the air war between the two nations had ended, at least for now, after Trump publicly scolded them for violating a ceasefire he announced at 5am GMT (10am PKT).
As the two countries lifted civilian restrictions after 12 days of war — which the US joined with an attack on Iran’s uranium-enrichment facilities — each sought to claim victory.
Trump said over the weekend that the US deployment of 30,000-pound bombs had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear programme.
But that claim appeared to be contradicted by an initial assessment by one of his administration’s intelligence agencies, according to three people familiar with the matter.
One of the sources said Iran’s enriched uranium stocks had not been eliminated, and the country’s nuclear programme, much of which is buried deep underground, may have been set back only a month or two.
Iran says its nuclear research is for civilian energy production.
The White House said the intelligence assessment was “flat out wrong”.
According to the report, which was produced by the Defence Intelligence Agency, the strikes sealed off the entrances to two of the facilities, but did not collapse underground buildings, said one of the people familiar with its findings.
Some centrifuges still remained intact after the attacks, the Washington Post said, citing an unnamed person familiar with the report.
Trump’s administration told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that its weekend strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities had “degraded” Iran’s nuclear programme, short of Trump’s earlier assertion that the facilities had been “obliterated”.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that the attack on Iran had removed the threat of nuclear annihilation and was determined to thwart any attempt by Tehran to revive its weapons programme.
“We have removed two immediate existential threats to us: the threat of nuclear annihilation and the threat of annihilation by 20,000 ballistic missiles,” Netanyahu said. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said his country had successfully ended the war in what he called a “great victory,” according to Iranian media.
Pezeshkian also told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that Tehran was ready to resolve differences with the US, according to official news agency IRNA.
Israel launched the surprise air war on June 13, attacking Iranian nuclear facilities and killing top military commanders in the worst blow to the Islamic Republic since the 1980s war with Iraq.
Iran, which denies trying to build nuclear weapons, retaliated with barrages of missiles on Israeli military sites and cities.
‘Great victory’
Israel’s military lifted restrictions on activity across the country at 8pm local time (10pm PKT), and officials said Ben Gurion Airport, the country’s main airport near Tel Aviv, had reopened.
Iran’s airspace likewise will be reopened, state-affiliated Nournews reported.
A White House official said Trump brokered the ceasefire deal with Netanyahu, and other administration officials were in touch with the Iranian government.
The truce appeared fragile: Both Israel and Iran took hours to acknowledge they had accepted the ceasefire and accused each other of violating it.
Trump scolded both sides but aimed especially stinging criticism at Israel, telling the close US ally to “calm down now.”
He later said Israel called off further attacks at his command.
Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, said he told his US counterpart, Pete Hegseth, that his country would respect the ceasefire unless Iran violated it.
Pezeshkian likewise said Iran would honour the ceasefire as long as Israel did, according to Iranian media.
Whether the Israel-Iran truce can hold is a major question given the deep mistrust between the two foes. But Trump’s ability to broker a ceasefire showed Washington retains some leverage in the volatile region.
Israeli armed forces chief of staff Eyal Zamir said a “significant chapter” of the conflict had concluded but the campaign against Iran was not over. He said the military would refocus on its war against Hamas in Gaza.
Iran’s military command also warned Israel and the US to learn from the “crushing blows” it delivered during the conflict.
Iranian authorities said 610 people were killed in their country by Israeli strikes and 4,746 injured. Iran’s retaliatory bombardment killed 28 people in Israel, the first time its air defences were penetrated by large numbers of Iranian missiles.
Oil prices plunged and stock markets rallied worldwide in a sign of confidence inspired by the ceasefire, which allayed fears of disruption to critical oil supplies from the Gulf.
Ceasefire violations?
Earlier on Tuesday, Trump admonished Israel with an obscenity in an extraordinary outburst at an ally whose air war he had joined two days before by dropping massive bunker-buster bombs on Iran’s underground nuclear sites.
Before departing the White House en route to a Nato summit in Europe, Trump told reporters he was unhappy with both sides for the ceasefire breach but particularly frustrated with Israel, which he said had “unloaded” shortly after agreeing to the deal.
“I’ve got to get Israel to calm down now,” Trump said. Iran and Israel had been fighting “so long and so hard that they don’t know what the f*** they’re doing.”

Netanyahu’s office acknowledged Israel bombed a radar site near Tehran in what it said was retaliation for Iranian missiles fired three-and-a-half hours after the ceasefire was due to begin.
It did not explicitly say whether the strike on the radar site took place before or after they spoke. The Islamic Republic denied launching any missiles and said Israel’s attacks had continued for an hour-and-a-half beyond the time the truce was meant to start.
“Who mediated or how it happened doesn’t matter,” said Reza Sharifi, 38, heading back to Tehran from Rasht on the Caspian Sea, where he had fled with his family.
“The war is over.

DPO Habibullah said police teams reached the site of the explosion in Sharamkhel, Pewar, and launched an investigation. He confirmed that four people were killed and four others were injured in the explosion.
The medical superintendent of DHQ Parachinar Hospital Mir Hassan Jan identified the victims as Nawab Ali, Amir Hussain, Hidayat Hussain, and Manzar Ali.
He added the injured namely, Muhammad Konain, Shafaat Hussain, and Hassan Ghulam were provided first aid and have been taken to Peshawar for further treatment.
Speaking to media, an injured victim Hassan Ghulam said they were heading towards a hill to collect firewood when the explosion occurred on the roadside.
“The incident is very unfortunate. The terrorists should be caught and punished,” he said. Besides his four companions, two horses were also killed in the explosion.
The tribal elders of the area condemned the incident and called for arresting the terrorists immediately for attempting to sabotage peace efforts. They called for conducting a high-level investigation into the incident.
In December last year, Kurram remained cut off from the rest of the country due to violent tribal clashes that claimed more than 100 lives.
All roads in Kurram, including the Parachinar-Peshawar highway, remained closed to traffic for a month after a vehicular convoy was attacked in Bagan area, in which at least 50 people were killed.</p><small>2025-06-25 06:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/25111951898da38.jpg?r=112251' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919991/trump-says-china-can-buy-iranian-oil-but-urges-it-to-purchase-us-crude' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says China can buy Iranian oil, but urges it to purchase US crude</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that China can continue to purchase Iranian oil after Israel and Iran agreed to a ceasefire, a move that the White House clarified did not indicate a relaxation of US sanctions.
“China can now continue to purchase oil from Iran. Hopefully, they will be purchasing plenty from the US, also,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social, just days after he ordered US bombings of three Iranian nuclear sites.
 


Trump was drawing attention to no attempts by Iran so far to close the Strait of Hormuz to oil tankers, as a closure would have been hard for China, the world’s top importer of Iranian oil, a senior White House official told Reuters.
“The president continues to call on China and all countries to import our state-of-the-art oil rather than import Iranian oil in violation of US sanctions,” the official said.
After the ceasefire announcement, Trump’s comments on China were another bearish signal for oil prices, which fell nearly 6 per cent on Tuesday.
Any relaxation of sanctions enforcement on Iran would mark a US policy shift after Trump said in February he was re-imposing maximum pressure on Iran, aiming to drive its oil exports to zero, over its nuclear program and funding of militants across the Middle East.
Trump imposed waves of Iran-related sanctions on several of China’s independent “teapot” refineries and port terminal operators for purchases of Iranian oil.
“President Trump’s greenlight for China to keep buying Iranian oil reflects a return to lax enforcement standards,” said Scott Modell, a former CIA officer, now CEO of Rapidan Energy Group.
In addition to not enforcing sanctions, Trump could suspend or waive sanctions imposed by executive order or under authorities a president is granted in laws passed by Congress.
Trump will likely not waive sanctions ahead of coming rounds of US-Iran nuclear talks, Modell said. The measures provide leverage given Tehran’s demand that any deal includes lifting them permanently.
Jeremy Paner, a partner at law firm Hughes Hubbard & Reed, said if Trump chooses to suspend Iran oil-related sanctions, it would require lots of work between agencies.
The US Treasury would need to issue licences, and the State Department would have to issue waivers, which require Congressional notification.
Oil traders and analysts in Asia said they did not expect Trump’s comments to have a near-term impact on Chinese purchases of oil from either Iran or the US.
 
 

Iranian oil accounts for roughly 13.6pc of China’s oil purchases this year, with the discounted barrels providing a lifeline to margin-squeezed independent refineries. US oil accounts for just 2pc of China’s imports, and Beijing’s 10pc tariffs on US oil deter further purchases.
Pressure on China
China has long opposed what it has called Washington’s “abuse of illegal unilateral sanctions”. China’s embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Trump’s post.
Larger purchases of Iranian oil by China and other consumers could upset US ally Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter.
The impact of US sanctions on Iran’s exports, however, has been limited since Trump’s first administration when he cracked down harder on Tehran.
Trump has “flashed the Glock” this year with sanctions on Chinese trading companies and terminals, Modell said, referring to revealing a gun. But the results have been far more “minimum pressure” than maximum, Modell added.
State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters that Trump had signalled what he wanted to happen and that his administration is focused on delivering that. She would not say what the process would entail.
“But clearly we are focused on making sure that (the) guiding hand of President Trump prevails and moves this government forward, so we will have to wait and see when it comes to what that ends up looking like,” Bruce said.</p><small>2025-06-25 06:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/251048236cc894e.jpg?r=104830' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919931/punjab-cm-orders-crackdown-on-hateful-content-on-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM orders crackdown on hateful content on social media</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has issued directions for a crackdown on those involved in spreading hateful content on social media.
Presiding over a meeting to review arrangements regarding Muharram here on Tuesday, the CM sought an emergency plan from the administration.
“Those found involved in spreading hateful content on social media should be arrested forthwith,” the CM said and directed the authorities to ensure a complete ban on displaying banners, posters and wall-chalking throughout the province. She also directed to arrest of those violating the ban on flying drones during Muharram.
She asked the ministers, commissioners, deputy commissioners, RPOs and DPOs to personally oversee the security arrangements for Muharram.
The CM sought the strict implementation of the code of conduct and a zero-tolerance policy. She asked the officer to launch mock drills of security arrangements and install sabeels for processions and gatherings of Muharram. She also directed to provide refreshing drinks, lemon water and cold water bottles during processions along with identification and monitoring of sabeels.
The CM said that water sprinklers should be set up to protect the mourners from the heatstroke and humidity. She instructed the officials to set up field hospitals and clinics on wheels for Ashura processions and further directed to issue effective traffic management plans as well as timely traffic advisories. She also instructed the authorities to make arrangements for the timely drainage of water in case of rainfall.
“The spirit of Muharram should be implemented. Hanging electric wires poses a big risk; emergency operations should be carried out in this regard. There should be no power outage during Ashura and streetlights should not be turned off,” she said and directed the officers to ensure that the manholes were properly covered in all areas, including private housing societies.
“Patchwork is done every year on Muharram, how come potholes resurface on the procession routes again? In the context of war, Muharram should be considered highly sensitive; Pakistan’s enemies will not let this opportunity go. Negative forces are unnerved at the success of Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos. All stakeholders must remain alert,” she said.
PUNJAB POLICE: The Punjab Police finalised security arrangements for Majalis and mourning processions across the province during Muharram.
Punjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar chaired a meeting via a video link at the Central Police Office to review the security arrangements.
Punjab Additional IG Operations Shahzada Sultan briefed the meeting about the security measures taken to ensure a peaceful and safe Muharram.
According to the Punjab Police spokesperson, over 38,000 Majalis will be held and more than 9,200 mourning processions will be taken out across Punjab during Muharram. He said over 232,000 officers and personnel would perform security duties during the first 10 days. In Lahore, he said, more than 28,000 officials would be deployed for Muharram security.
Similarly, over 53,000 community volunteers and more than 38,000 volunteers would assist in the security of majalis and mourning processions, respectively.
Addressing the meeting, the IGP directed the officers to ensure implementation of security SOPs, saying that due to the prevailing situation in the region, the security of Muharram had become more challenging. Any attempt by anti-state elements to incite sectarianism, religious hatred, or disturb law and order should be thwarted by using all the available resources, he said.
“Any trouble or flash points should be resolved in consultation with stakeholders before Muharram,” he said.
The IGP directed the RPOs and DPOs to ensure coordination with peace committees, scholars of various sects and organisers of mourning processions and majalis.
The Punjab Police would have the full support from the Pakistan Army and Rangers, as well as other security institutions during the first 10 days of Muharram, he said.

The State Bank’s latest update for May shows that foreign inflows in T-bills during the month (up to May 23 of FY25) reached $73.6 million. This was strange since India attacked Pakistan on May 6. It is believed that foreign investment quickly leaves a country during an international crisis.
The war did not hurt inflows in t-bills, but outflows from the equity market reflected its negative impact.
The State Bank data for May shows that while inflows in T-bills were $73.5m, outflows amounted to $66m.

The highest inflow of $50 million came from UAE, while Britain received the biggest outflow of $62m

But figures for foreign investment in equity market show that during May, inflows were $38.7m and outflows totaled $64.6m.
Although the situation has remained calm in Pakistan so far despite the war, India has hurling threats of another attack. But the threats have not scared away the investors.
The highest inflow of $50m came from the UAE, while the biggest outflow of $62m went to Britain.
Since Pakistan has not been a popular choice for foreign investors for over a decade, foreign direct investment has stagnated around $2bn every year.
The Indian aggression did not, however, change the scenario.
Pakistan has been trying hard to attract foreign investments and a council has been established to persuade investors with lucrative incentives, but the result has remained insignificant so far.
The July-May period of FY25 saw an inflow of $1.247 billion through T-bills while outflows amounted to $1.447bn during the same period. The big outflow was due to declining returns on T-bills.
Since the State Bank has slashed the interest rate to 11 per cent from 22pc since June last year, the diminishing returns on T-bills has taken the shine off the instrument for investors.
The financial sector believes that overseas Pakistanis were making investment in T-bills as the instrument is secure and risk-free. The government is also borrowing through the stock exchange by selling Sukuk bonds.
The State Bank’s data shows that so far the government has borrowed Rs3.7 trillion from banks despite a hefty profit of Rs2.7tr provided by the State Bank in the beginning of the current financial year.
Borrowing through banks during July-May FY25  was, however, much lower than last year. The government had borrowed Rs7.76tr during the same period of the previous fiscal.

In brief remarks to supporters, Cuomo, 67, who had been seeking a political comeback four years after resigning amid sexual harassment allegations, said he had called Mamdani to congratulate him.
“Tonight is his night,” Cuomo said while conceding the race to Mamdani.
 






Mamdani, who entered the campaign as a virtual unknown, was ahead of Cuomo 43.5 per cent to 36.4pc with nearly 95pc of ballot scanners reporting, according to the city’s elections board. Nine other Democratic candidates trailed far behind.
The outcome will not be final until next week, due to New York’s ranked-choice system that allows citizens to pick up to five candidates in order of preference.
But Mamdani’s lead in Tuesday’s preliminary results appeared too large for Cuomo, or any other candidate, to overcome, particularly since the third-place finisher on Tuesday, City Comptroller Brad Lander, encouraged his supporters to list Mamdani second.
The race was seen as an early read on the direction Democrats believe the party should take five months into Republican President Donald Trump’s tumultuous second term.
Their differences were clear: Cuomo, a moderate backed by the establishment who served a decade as governor, or Mamdani, a progressive newcomer who promised a break with the past.
Mamdani will likely be the favourite in November’s general election in a city where Democrats dominate. The current mayor, Democrat Eric Adams, will also appear on the November ballot as an independent, but a series of corruption scandals and his perceived ties to Trump have weakened his standing.
The Republican candidate is Curtis Sliwa, a radio host best known as the founder of the Guardian Angels anti-crime patrol, who lost to Adams in 2021.
For some voters, Mamdani represented a chance to usher in a new era for the party.
“I think it’s time for somebody young, a person of colour, something different,” Ignacio Tambunting, a 28-year-old actor, told a Reuters reporter outside a polling station in Manhattan after putting Mamdani atop his ballot.
Another voter, Leah Johanson, said she listed Mamdani first even though she was concerned he was too liberal. But she did not rank Cuomo.
“No. God, no,” said Johanson, 39, who voted on Tuesday in Queens, where Mamdani lives. “I’m not gonna vote for a man who is credibly accused of molesting women.”
Cuomo has denied the harassment accusations, which he has characterised as ill-conceived attempts to be affectionate or humorous.
Self-described democratic socialist
Born in Uganda to a family of Indian descent, Mamdani, who would be the city’s first Muslim mayor, has a history of pro-Palestinian activism.
He was elected to a state assembly seat in New York’s Queens borough and has garnered the support of US Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, two prominent progressives.
Cuomo accused Mamdani of lacking the experience required, while Mamdani attacked Cuomo over the harassment allegations.
 
 

Cuomo, who emerged as a vocal critic of Trump during his first term as president, won the endorsements of former President Bill Clinton and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
In ranked voting, the last-place candidate is eliminated after each round, and their votes are redistributed to the second choice marked on the ballots of their supporters. The process is repeated until one candidate achieves 50pc of the total.
Mamdani seems likely to expand his lead when the additional counts are conducted, after he and Lander endorsed one another and urged their supporters to rank the other as their second choice.
Lander, who was the first choice on 11.6pc of ballots counted on Tuesday, made national headlines last week when he was briefly detained while escorting a defendant out of an immigration court.</p><small>2025-06-25 05:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/25112118e701a8c.jpg?r=112122' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919962/kurram-to-be-handed-over-to-army-during-muharram' target='_blank'><strong>Kurram to be handed over to army during Muharram</strong></a><br><p>KOHAT: At least 10,000 personnel of army, police and other agencies would perform security duty during Muharram in Kohat division with the restive Kurram district to be handed over to the army.
This was decided at a meeting of the Kohat divisional jirga presided over by General Officer Commanding of the Army’s 9th Division Maj-Gen Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti.
The handing over of Kurram to army was because the district has witnessed worst sectarian killings in the past.
Held at the Kohat Police Club, the jirga was also attended by chief secretary Shahab Ali Shah, IGP Zulfiqar Hameed, regional police officer Abbas Majeed Marwat, divisional commissioner Syed Mutasim Billah Shah, deputy commissioners, and district police officers of Kohat, Hangu, Orakzai, Karak, Kuram districts, and prominent elders of the Shia and Sunni sects.

Jirga also decides to deploy 10,000 personnel across Kohat division

Provincial law minister Afab Alam Advocate, MNAs Shehryar Afridi, Hameed Hussain, and Yousaf Khan, MPAs Shafi Jan, Aurangzeb Orakzai, and Ali Hadi were also in attendance.
“Our enemy cannot defeat us militarily, but it continues its efforts to weaken us internally,” the chief secretary said, pointing specifically to the involvement of the Indian intelligence agency RAW in fomenting sectarian divisions.
He strongly denounced the use of violence in the name of religion, stating, “When we all share the same faith, there is absolutely no justification for taking up arms against one another,” chief secretary noted.
Regarding the situation in Kurram district, Shahab Shah shared that peace was gradually being restored in the region, and expressed the hope that the main highway would soon be reopened to traffic. He urged locals to expedite the voluntary surrender of illegal arms, warning that failure to do so would result in confiscation by the state.
The chief secretary said sustainable and lasting peace in any region was only possible through the sincerity, hard work, and mutual cooperation of people.
He emphasised the importance of inclusive dialogue and trust-building among all stakeholders to ensure enduring peace.
Shahab Shah said that community leaders were united in their message of solidarity, adding that such sentiments of patriotism must also be inculcated in youth. “We must remind our younger generation that we are all Muslims and brothers; there is no room for division among us,” he said.
Shahab Shah warned of threats aimed at destabilising the country from within.
Expressing optimism for the upcoming holy month, he hoped that, as in the past, both Sunni and Shia communities would observe Muharram with mutual respect and brotherhood.
“God willing, not only Muharram but every coming month will pass peacefully, and our enemies will never succeed in their malicious designs,” he concluded.
The Sunni and Shia elders assured the participants that they would abide by the agreements reached between them to restore calm and avoid fighting in Kurram.
Meanwhile, a control room was established for the monitoring of central mourners’ processions through CCTV cameras in Kohat.
Mohammad Waqas, the tehsil in-charge of the municipal service, while briefing tehsil municipal officer Mohammad Shoeb on Tuesday, said the control room would also provide backup power supply, wireless connectivity, and other technical facilities.
The control room has been set up by TMA.
TALENT HUNT: Lahore Qalandars cricket team announced on Tuesday to launch a talent hunt in the Kohat division from July.
Rana Atif, chief executive officer and owner of Lahore Qalandars, visited the new cricket ground prepared by the army at the regional sports complex, where he along with players inspected the preparations for organising the talent hunt programme.
He visited the district on the special invitation of regional sports officer.
