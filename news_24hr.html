Bannu Police Spokesperson, Aamir Khan, told Dawn.com, “A big group of terrorists attacked the Basia Khel police station in the early hours of Friday using heavy weapons. However, the cops present at the police station bravely thwarted the attack.”
Terming the attack “cowardly”, he added that all the police personnel present at the station were safe.
“Station House Officer (SHO) Asmatullah Khan Niazi led the operation, and the collective and timely response of the police team forced the terrorists to flee,” said Khan.
Regional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and District Police Officer Saleem Abbasi commended the Basia Khel police station personnel for “braving the situation and responding promptly to protect the police station and their colleagues from harm”, the statement said.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.
Attacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Over the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this month.
On Thursday, a Frontier Corps (FC) constable was killed and two others were injured when terrorists attacked their vehicle in the Daryoba area of Bannu.
Six Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were also injured on Wednesday in a “terrorist attack” at a checkpoint in Bannu, according to a police spokesperson.
On Monday, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was martyred when terrorists attacked him in the district while he was returning home from duty.
On July 21, over a dozen terrorists attacked a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.
On July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter attack on Bannu’s Miryan police station.</p><small>2025-07-25 09:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615708-pakistan-china-army-top-brass-reiterate-coordination-to-confront-hybrid-threats' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, China reiterate coordination to confront hybrid threats</strong></a><br><p>

“Seven children have lost their lives so far and 26 others are injured,” Nand Kishore, a police officer in the state of Rajasthan, told AFP.
There were around 60 students, teachers and staff members in the single-storey building when the accident happened in Jhalawar district, some 322 kilometres (200 miles) from the state capital Jaipur.
Kishore said the structure collapsed when students were attending their classes early on Friday.
Villagers rushed to the site and rescued many injured children who were taken to the closest medical facilities.
Local media reports said the building was in a dilapidated condition and several complaints had been previously been raised about it.
It had also been raining heavily in the area over the past few days.
According to local news outlets, the children who died were between eight and 11 years of age, while two of the injured students were in critical condition.
Television news footage showed heavy earth movers removing debris and concrete from the site.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he was deeply saddened by the tragic incident.
“My thoughts are with the affected students and their families in this difficult hour,” Modi said in a statement posted by his office on X.
“Praying for the speedy recovery of the injured. Authorities are providing all possible assistance to those affected,” the premier added.
 






Rajasthan state education minister Madan Dilawar announced that there would be a probe into the cause of the “very unfortunate” incident.
“I will get a high-level inquiry done today to find out why this incident happened,” Dilawar said in a statement.
He added that local authorities were making “arrangements for the treatment” of the injured students.
Government schools in India face chronic funding shortages, with students complaining of absent teachers, dilapidated buildings, and a lack of basic amenities like clean drinking water or toilets.
The situation has improved in urban areas in recent years but the pace of change in rural India still remains slow.
Earlier today, local media had reported that at least four children had been killed and 17 were injured, with dozens still feared trapped under the rubble.
A local police officer, who declined to be named, told Reuters the school building was old and the roof might have fallen in as a result of heavy rainfall in the region.
“There were 25-30 children in the room when the roof fell after the morning prayers,” Rajasthan education minister, Madan Dilawar, told AajTak news channel.
Visuals from news channels showed locals gathered around the site of the collapse. Distressed family members could be heard crying as authorities used a crane to remove the debris.
Local media reported that 32 students had been pulled out safely, but rescue operations were ongoing.
“Instructions have been given to the concerned authorities to ensure proper treatment for the injured children,” Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma said on X.
 






Some of the injured children were critical, local police officer Amit Kumar told the PTI news agency, according to the Economic Times newspaper.</p><small>2025-07-25 09:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2511485465fbf40.jpg?r=123944' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926492/maritime-minister-underscores-850m-export-potential-of-gwadars-value-added-seafood-date-industries' target='_blank'><strong>Maritime minister underscores $850m export potential of Gwadar’s value-added seafood, date industries</strong></a><br><p>Maritime Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry stated on Friday that the Gwadar Port had the potential to generate over $850 million in annual exports through consistent investment, strategic policymaking, and improved infrastructure, a press release issued by the ministry said.
Gwadar Port is a deep-sea port located in Balochistan, strategically positioned near the Strait of Hormuz. Touted as a game-changer for Pakistan’s economy, the port is meant to boost regional trade, create jobs, and attract foreign investment.
Speaking during a high-level meeting on the operationalisation of Gwadar Port today, Minister Chaudhry stated that “with consistent investment, strategic policymaking, and improved infrastructure, the port had the potential to generate over $850m annually through value-added fisheries and date exports.”
According to the statement, the meeting was attended by officials from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs (MoMA) and representatives from relevant ministries and organisations, including Gwadar Port Authority and the ministries of commerce, industries, and communication.
The minister laid out a comprehensive strategy to boost economic activities in Gwadar, reaffirming the government’s commitment to utilising local resources and empowering local businesses to operationalise the port and stimulate the regional economy.
He emphasised that fisheries and dates were the key economic drivers of the region, saying, “Gwadar has a rich fish catch potential, and we must focus on local value addition to maximise benefits.”
The minister pointed out that 34 fish processing units are currently operating in Balochistan, but most require technological upgrades to meet export standards.
“Transforming these units to add value through packaging and processing before exporting is critical for uplifting the sector,” he said.
He added that Balochistan’s coastline makes up 76.2 per cent of Pakistan’s total coastal length, yet its fish production significantly lags behind its actual potential.
“Balochistan has an estimated annual fish catch potential of around 300,000 tonnes. With proper value addition, this could generate approximately $645m each year. However, current production is nearly half of that due to limited fishing capacity, obsolete technology, and regulatory hurdles,” he said.
 
 

The minister also stated that the Panjgur and Turbat (Kech) districts together produce over 225,000 tonnes of dates annually — more than half of Pakistan’s total. He said that with value addition, the sector could generate “up to $200-$205m in revenue each year”.
To support business and connectivity in the region, the minister announced steps to improve air travel, saying that Pakistan International Airlines would increase its weekly flights to Gwadar from one to three.
“Two weekly flights between Gwadar and Karachi and one between Gwadar and Islamabad are under consideration,” he said.
He added that the possibility of introducing a chartered flight mechanism to facilitate travel for businesspersons and investors was also under consideration.
Earlier this month, MoMA announced an ambitious plan to expand Gwadar Port’s operational capacity by introducing additional shipp­ing lines and launching a ferry service connecting Pak­istan with Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
Speaking on the development of the plan, Chaudhry said that the initiative was part of the government’s strategy to “enhance regional connectivity, boost maritime trade and position Gwadar as a major hub in the Arabian Sea”.
“We aim to transform Gwadar into a strategic transhipment and logistics centre, benefiting Pakistan and the wider region,” he said.</p><small>2025-07-25 08:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/251217137bdcc78.jpg?r=122130' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926498/thailand-warns-of-war-with-cambodia-as-138000-flee-fighting' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand warns of war with Cambodia as 138,000 flee fighting</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai warned on Friday that cross-border clashes with Cambodia that have uprooted more than 130,000 people “could develop into war”, as the countries traded deadly strikes for a second day.
A long-running border dispute erupted into intense fighting with jets, artillery, tanks and ground troops on Thursday, and the UN Security Council is set to hold an emergency meeting on the crisis later on Friday.
A steady thump of artillery strikes could be heard from the Cambodian side of the border, where the province of Oddar Meanchey reported one civilian — a 70-year-old man — had been killed and five more wounded.
More than 138,000 people have been evacuated from Thailand’s border regions, its health ministry said, reporting 15 fatalities — 14 civilians and a soldier — with a further 46 wounded, including 15 troops.
“We have tried to compromise as we are neighbours, but we have now instructed the Thai military to act immediately in case of urgency,” said Wechayachai.
“If the situation escalates, it could develop into war, though for now, it remains limited to clashes,” he told reporters in Bangkok.
In the Cambodian town of Samraong, 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the border, AFP journalists saw families speeding away in vehicles with their children and belongings as gunfire erupted.
“I live very close to the border. We are scared because they began shooting again at about 6am,” Pro Bak, 41, told AFP.
He was taking his wife and children to a Buddhist temple to seek refuge.
“I don’t know when we could return home,” he said.
AFP journalists also saw soldiers rushing to man rocket launchers and speeding off towards the frontier.
Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, whose country currently holds the chair of regional bloc ASEAN, said he held talks with both countries’ leaders on Thursday and called for a ceasefire and dialogue.
“I welcome the positive signals and willingness shown by both Bangkok and Phnom Penh to consider this path forward,” he said in a Facebook post late on Thursday.
But despite Anwar’s optimism, fighting resumed in three areas around 4am on Friday (2am PKT), the Thai army said.
Cambodian forces carried out bombardments with heavy weapons, field artillery, and BM-21 rocket systems, the army said, and Thai troops responded “with appropriate supporting fire”.
Calls for calm
The fighting marks a dramatic escalation in a long-running dispute between the neighbours — both popular destinations for millions of foreign tourists — over their shared 800-kilometre (500-mile) frontier.
Dozens of kilometres in several areas are contested, and fighting broke out between 2008 and 2011, leaving at least 28 people dead and tens of thousands displaced.
A UN court ruling in 2013 settled the matter for over a decade, but the current crisis erupted in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a new clash.
Fighting on Thursday was focused on six locations, according to the Thai army, including around two ancient temples.
Ground troops backed up by tanks battled for control of territory, while Cambodia fired rockets and shells into Thailand, and the Thais scrambled F-16 jets to hit military targets across the border.
Both sides blamed each other for firing first, while Thailand accused Cambodia of targeting civilian infrastructure, including a hospital hit by shells and a petrol station hit by at least one rocket.
Thursday’s clashes came hours after Thailand expelled the Cambodian ambassador and recalled its own envoy after five members of a Thai military patrol were wounded by a landmine.
Cambodia downgraded ties to “the lowest level” on Thursday, pulling out all but one of its diplomats and expelling their Thai equivalents from Phnom Penh.
At the request of Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet, the UN Security Council will hold an emergency meeting on Friday to discuss the deadly clashes, diplomatic sources told AFP.
The United States urged an “immediate” end to the conflict, while Cambodia’s former colonial ruler France, made a similar call.
The EU and China — a close ally of Phnom Penh — said they were “deeply concerned” about the clashes, calling for dialogue.</p><small>2025-07-25 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/251216044afe882.jpg?r=122319' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926499/fm-dar-in-washington-to-meet-us-counterpart-rubio-discuss-ways-to-strengthen-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar in Washington to meet US counterpart Rubio, discuss ways to strengthen bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar arrived in Washington, DC on Thursday night, on the second leg of his eight-day visit to the United States, the Foreign Office said in a statement.
Dar arrived in New York on Monday to attend “high-level signature events” of Pakistan’s United Nations Security Council (UNSC) presidency, including a conference on Palestine.
Upon arrival in the US capital, the foreign minister was received by Ambassador of Pakistan to the US, Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and senior embassy officials, the Foreign Office said on X.
Dar is scheduled to meet his counterpart, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, for a bilateral meeting at the Department of State on Friday, the FO said.
“The meeting will discuss important facets of Pak-US relations, exploring ways and means to strengthen bilateral ties, with a particular focus on promoting trade, investment and economic cooperation,” FO said.
He is also scheduled to speak at the US think tank, The Atlantic Council, “sharing Pakistan’s perspective on regional and global issues as well as the future of Pak-US relations.”
 






Dar’s visit comes as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan assumed the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.
Addressing a reception hosted by Pakistan’s Mission in New York on Wednesday, Dar called for an inclusive dialogue and cooperative diplomacy over confrontation amid growing turbulence across the world.
The deputy PM asserted that Pakistan’s leadership has been guided by “these very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure”.
The UNSC unanimously adopted Pakistan-sponsored Resolution 2788, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.
Dar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy. Pakistan last held the membership from 2020 to 2023.
Gaza ceasefire
Chairing the UNSC’s Quarterly Open Debate on the “Situation in the Middle East including the Palestinian Question”, Dar urged the UNSC and the international community to bring about an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, along with unrestricted humanitarian access amid a food crisis in the besieged territory.
“It is time to give the Palestinian people what they have been denied for too long: justice, freedom, dignity, and a state of their own. That is the path to durable peace and stability in the Middle East,” FM Dar said.
He emphasised that the path to lasting peace lay in upholding international law, ending foreign occupation, rejecting the use of force and advancing solutions through dialogue and diplomacy.</p><small>2025-07-25 08:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/250028021fc4af1.jpg?r=002814' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926308/with-stability-in-sight-its-time-for-pakistan-to-unlock-sustainable-growth' target='_blank'><strong>With stability in sight, it’s time for Pakistan to unlock sustainable growth</strong></a><br><p>After years of relentless crises, ranging from sky-high inflation to back-breaking unemployment, Pakistan’s economy has finally reached the much-awaited milestone of stability. The macroeconomic data for the fiscal year 2024-25 is proof that policies pursued over the last two years have had their intended effect.
Inflation is down to 3.2 per cent from May 2023’s 38pc despite a fuel price hike. The FY25 closed with a $2.1 billion current account surplus in a dramatic turnaround that has helped stabilise the external sector and exchange rate. Exports have surged nearly 5pc. Remittances have hit a record $38.3bn, a 27pc year-on-year increase. Even external debt is managed, easing the liquidity crisis.
As celebratory as it may sound, stabilisation — delivered at the cost of economic activity — is not the end goal; in fact, it is not even new to Pakistan. The country has been here before, and a time too many.
But what this period of stability does do is open up a window of opportunity to chart a different path forward, for which three strategic priorities demand urgent attention: energy reform, export-oriented industrialisation and critical minerals strategy.
A future-ready energy ecosystem
Pakistan’s energy sector is struggling financially and losing industrial competitiveness. Cross-subsidies and politically managed pricing have created an irrational system where productive industries are punished through higher tariffs, which reduces demand and worsens the circular debt problem. In recent months, a lot of work has been put into ensuring that the circular debt stabilises, but this has been done through pricing adjustments that are creating an excess supply challenge in the system.
To deal with this, meaningful pricing reform is the need of the hour, starting with marginal cost pricing — especially for natural gas and electricity — and a phased end to distortive subsidies that crowd out efficiency and innovation.
 
 

But pricing alone isn’t enough. Pakistan must recognise that the future of energy lies in decentralisation. With per capita electricity consumption among the lowest in South Asia, an unreliable grid, and a rapidly evolving solar-storage-battery ecosystem, the country must pivot from 20th-century central planning to 21st-century distributed generation.
Rooftop solar, industrial microgrids, and battery energy storage systems are already being scaled up by industrial and residential users alike. This can transform the energy landscape, with cheaper, more reliable electricity directly improving export competitiveness and attracting globally mobile capital looking to relocate out of China and other high-cost economies.
Coastal industrial zones for export takeoff
Just energy, however, cannot solve the problem at hand. A key issue plaguing Pakistan’s industrial policy has been a heartland approach to development. This cuts against the global trend of coastal areas being engines of growth, particularly export-based manufacturing. Shifting this strategy is the need of the hour, because despite record remittances and a modest rise in export receipts, Pakistan’s goods-export base remains narrow and underscaled.
Given its population and economic size, Pakistan should by now have developed multiple coastal cities with regionally competitive manufacturing and port infrastructure. Coastal areas have excess power, which means that thousands of megawatts of reliable and affordable energy can be provided at marginal costs to unlock new industrial activity and manufacturing output.
It is still not too late, and what is needed now is a bold coastal development strategy — one that brings together labour availability, energy cost advantages, and global trade access. Growing inflows of remittances can also be meaningfully leveraged to not just be used for consumption, but to help pay for imports of industrial equipment necessary to finance best-in-class manufacturing units on the coasts.
 
 

Special economic zones along the coast— particularly around Gwadar, Karachi, and Port Qasim — can become hubs for value-added manufacturing, especially if paired with the right tariff reforms and investment incentives.
Pakistan should actively court global manufacturers disrupted by the ongoing trade war. This is feasible in particular because of the dramatic turnaround in relations with the United States — a trade deal with the Trump administration is near, and it could accelerate investments, provided policy provides the right enabling environment.
Capital should be flowing into Pakistan at this point. Unfortunately, this isn’t happening because of the high cost of doing business, lack of cheap and reliable energy, and a legal system that can neither enforce contracts nor resolve disputes. It is not politically complex to solve these issues on the ports, and some of these conversations are occurring with both Chinese and western investors.
From Reko Diq to a critical minerals value chain
This is where Reko Diq offers a ray of hope and a framework for doing more in a shorter time period. The resolution of the dispute has made the mine a case study in what a resolution of key disputes can do to unlock value for all.
Today, Reko Diq is being developed and operated by a Canadian company, which has contracted a Finnish firm to provide power and a Japanese company to provide mining equipment. This equipment is being developed by American labour, turning the mine into an asset in which global powers and international investors, including the World Bank and the International Finance Cooperation, have a stake.
It’s a story of what happens when global capital, governance standards, and local alignment come together.
To build on this success, Pakistan must now seek to successfully close out ongoing engagement with the United States to get American capital into the country’s critical minerals sector, while also working with multilateral and regional investors out of the Gulf to develop infrastructure and power around mining corridors.
 
 

This would lay the groundwork for a value-added critical minerals industry with refining, smelting, and manufacturing supply chains — instead of just raw material exports. Finally, having companies from multiple jurisdictions could also help alleviate the proxy war that is unfolding in Balochistan — where the Reko Diq mine is located — given that the economic interests of global companies are likely to reshape the behaviour of both global and regional powers, including potential spoilers.
Ultimately, the investment, development, and job creation could also support long-term efforts needed to resolve long-standing issues in Balochistan, including those related to local empowerment and development.
This strategy would also allow Pakistan to position itself not just as a source of ore but also as a node in the clean energy and digital economy supply chain, with western and Chinese businesses contributing to innovation, development, and economic activity.
Pakistan has seen stability before — and squandered it. This time must be different. Macro data tells us that the balance-of-payments pressure has eased. But inflation can return, and capital can flee. The only sustainable stability is that which is rooted in exports, competitiveness, and global integration. The world is changing fast, but this change offers Pakistan to finally start leading — not lagging — in that change.</p><small>2025-07-25 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615691-dpm-dar-to-meet-top-us-diplomat-rubio-in-washington-today' target='_blank'><strong>DPM Dar meets top diplomat Rubio in Washington today</strong></a><br><p>

The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as the region experienced cloudburst-induced floods that claimed lives and damaged infrastructure. On Monday, floods triggered by heavy rain swept through GB’s Babusar area in Diamer district and Naran, leaving many stranded. Subsequently, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a landslide alert for the northern areas of the country.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, in a statement, confirmed that nine people have lost their lives in the floods and landslides across the region — including two women and two children — while the search for people swept away by the flood is still underway.
In his statement, he estimated that the “number of people swept away by floodwater could be around 12-14.” On the other hand, more than a dozen people were reported to be injured in the floods.
“Over 300 stranded tourists have been rescued so far,” he said, adding that rescue operations have been challenging as floods and landslides continue to ravage parts of the region.
Detailing the property damage caused by floods and landslides, he stated, “In total, more than 500 houses have been destroyed due to the floods and about 12 kilometres of roads have been destroyed as well.”
 
 

He went on to say: “A total of 27 bridges and 22 vehicles were also destroyed by the floodwaters across the region, along with countless shops, cattle sheds and logs of timber.”
Both the Pakistan Army and GB scouts played an active role in the rescue and search operation, he said.
“Efforts are also underway to provide water and electricity to thousands of people who are now deprived of these facilities as a result of damage to the water supply and electricity grids,” Faraq said in his statement.
Search for drowned teenager continues in Punjab
Meanwhile, a search operation was underway to find the body of 17-year-old Arman, who was swept away while crossing a nullah in Gujar Khan on Wednesday, a Rescue 1122 official said on Friday.
“Rescue divers have combed through an area 12 km from the site of the accident without any success”, District Emergency Officer Rescue 1122 Rawalpindi Sibghatullah said in a statement.
“The heirs of the victim have expressed their satisfaction over the rescue efforts,” he added.
On Thursday, residents of the housing society where the teenager lived blocked Rawalpindi’s Grand Trunk Road after the rescue teams could not recover the body.
The boy was walking on a small passage when high-speed torrents swept him away in deep waters.
Two of his relatives jumped into the water to rescue him, but they told Dawn.com that the water was moving at high speed and the boy could not be saved.</p><small>2025-07-25 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/25114415a804d34.jpg?r=114422' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1926490/nine-people-killed-16-injured-as-bus-crashes-in-vietnam' target='_blank'><strong>Nine people killed, 16 injured as bus crashes in Vietnam</strong></a><br><p>At least nine people, including children, were killed in central Vietnam when a bus crashed early on Friday, the government said.

According to the statement, police were conducting a search operation on Thursday night in various areas within the limits of Kalu Khan police station, led by Deputy Superintendent of Police Circle Shakeel Khan, Station House Officer Abdul Wali Khan, along with a police team, against the presence of drug dealers and criminals.
“Police received a tipoff from an informant that notorious drug dealers and wanted suspects were spotted at Wazir Shaheed Road,” the statement said.
“A police team was immediately formed to arrest them. Upon seeing the team, the drug dealer opened fire to evade arrest. The police also returned fire using the right of self-defence. The drug dealer was arrested in an injured condition.”
Police recovered 400 grams of methamphetamine (crystal meth) and a pistol with cartridges from the suspect’s possession, the police added. The suspect was wanted in seven cases, including drug trafficking and burglary, police said.
Per the statement, operations were underway across the district on the orders of the District Police Officer, Swabi, Ziauddin Ahmed, until the elimination of drug dealers.
In March, a cop was martyred while another three were injured during an operation in Swat district as police killed a wanted drug smuggler who was also allegedly behind an officer’s murder.

Gaza, he declared, had become a “graveyard for innocent lives as well as for international law”.
Presiding over the UNSC’s quarterly open debate on the Palestinian question, Mr Dar condemned what he described as a “genocide in full view of the international community — one that the UN seems unable or unwilling to stop”. It was a rare moment of moral clarity in a chamber that has too often offered empty words while an entire people are being systematically starved, bombed and erased. Indeed, Gaza today is a “nightmare of historic proportions”, in the words of Khaled Khiari, the UN assistant secretary general for the Middle East.
Over 59,000 Palestinians have been killed. Aid convoys are shelled. UN schools and hospitals are reduced to rubble. A third of Gaza’s population is reportedly going days without food. Just this week, the Palestinian envoy recounted the deaths of two children — one just six weeks old — from starvation. “Children in Gaza are not starving,” he said, “they are being starved.” Yet the UN has failed to act decisively.
Mr Dar rightly described the situation as a “litmus test” for the credibility of the UN and the international order. The UNSC’s inaction — paralysed by geopolitical alignments and veto politics — is not mere indifference; it is complicity. Each day of delay costs lives. It emboldens impunity. It makes a mockery of international humanitarian law.
Pakistan’s six-point plan — calling for an unconditional ceasefire, full humanitarian access, support for UNRWA, an end to illegal settlements and forced displacement, a reconstruction framework, and a genuine two-state solution — reflects what the global consensus should be.
Against this backdrop, efforts towards a ceasefire are teetering. Hamas has reportedly given a “positive and flexible” response to a US-backed 60-day truce proposal, agreeing to Israeli troop withdrawals and UN-supervised aid corridors. Mediators — including Qatar, Egypt and the US — remain engaged.
However, Israel has recalled its negotiators from Doha for consultations, signalling unease over Hamas’s conditions, especially guarantees that fighting will not resume once the truce expires. Israel also insists on maintaining a limited military presence. Despite these differences, diplomatic channels remain open — but time is quickly running out.
The horror unfolding in Gaza is a collapse of the very global norms the UN was founded to uphold. The Paris peace conference, co-chaired by Saudi Arabia and France, may present a diplomatic opening, but it cannot be a substitute for immediate and forceful action. The UN’s moral failure in Rwanda and Bosnia must not be repeated in Gaza. This time, the world must not look away.

In fact, the poor and powerless are the worst sufferers of a constitutionally degenerated order — mainly resulting from the failure of both the political leadership and the judiciary.
Barring some exceptions, the political leadership has largely played a deplorable role in the history of our democratic struggle. Both democracy and the people’s rights and liberties have been sacrificed at the altar of personal and political benefits. In many cases, ‘people’s power’ has been leveraged to get a better ‘deal’ from powerful quarters. Ideology and morality have given way to the consolidation of dynastic politics, again motivated by the relentless pursuit of power and pelf.
One or the other among the mainstream leadership has lent a shoulder to non-democratic forces at critical junctures of constitutional struggle. Until some years ago, the PTI-led coalition upheld the hybrid regime, acting as the junior adjunct of the establishment-dominated dispensation, while the opposition — particularly the PML-N and PPP —was mercilessly persecuted. The shoe is now on the other foot; the PTI is being battered by the PML-PPP coalition ostensibly at the behest of the powers that be.
The latter’s alternating cycle of conflict and conciliation with one or the other component of the political leadership has over the years crystallised into what has aptly come to be described as a hybrid regime — a combination of authoritarianism and plutocracy. Dominated by non-political influential quarters, it also includes an array of other forces — compliant politicians, ambitious elements in the judiciary, crony capitalists, landed interests and a highly politicised bureaucracy. These elites hold the handles of power, and can also be charged with appropriating much of the national wealth and resources, keeping the majority of the populace out of the politico-economic calculus.
It is no wonder then that 40 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line; every third child is out of school in this age of AI; three out of four persons are deprived of clean drinking water and sanitation; and millions live in appalling conditions in squatter settlements. Social disparity has also touched new heights. Pakistan’s top 1pc monopolises more wealth than the bottom 70pc, while 42pc of the country’s income is earned by the top 10pc of households; the bottom 50pc earn only 13pc. Yet, the minimum wage remains almost unchanged even during inflation. In contrast, the salaries and allowances of the top functionaries — judges, parliamentarians, the military brass and senior bureaucracy — have been substantially raised. Likewise, the industrial, financial and propertied classes also regularly receive generous subsidies and tax exemptions.

Who will or should protect the citizenry against state capture by a selfish elite?

Thus, the elitist state has, for ages now, ‘abandoned’ the masses — millions of jobless, underpaid, landless, homeless, marginalised, disenfranchised and caste-religion-gender-battered people. Many of the jobless youth are taking to drugs and even dying by suicide. Except for handing some periodic cash transfers to the poorest communities to garner support, the state and political elites are not willing to share the common wealth and resources with the people. Instead, the latter’s democratic voice and peaceful protests are met with force on the pretext of ‘national security’ and the maintenance of order. Interestingly, certain elements have lately started highlighting the tragic plight of the people caught up in the war-torn states in the Middle East and Africa, expecting to earn the people’s gratitude for keeping this country ‘safe’ and ‘unified’.
This raises questions: the country may be safe, but for whom? Are the common men and women safe — physically, economically, environmentally, socially, politically? Or, are they at the mercy of criminals, terrorists, inept and corrupt public functionaries, crony capitalists and retrogressive feudal-tribal forces? How is the country ‘unified’ when there exists a plethora of fault lines — social, political, ethnic, sectarian, regional, institutional and civil-military? Only a small and close-knit group of elites is unified, bonded by their common interest in keeping the current exploitative politico-legal order alive.
Against such a reality, the question that arises is: who will or should protect the citizenry against state capture by a selfish elite? The first responders in such situations are always the judges, who are regarded as the custodians of citizens’ fundamental rights, and are bound by their oath to “preserve, protect and defend” the Constitution. Aggrieved people — those who pay taxes, direct and indirect — go to the courts to seek redress against the wrongs committed by errant public functionaries. The annals of democratic struggles are replete with instances of the glorious role played by judges in support of the rule of law, particularly in India, America and Britain.
Unfortunately, in our case, with the exception of some courageous and independent-minded judges, the overall performance of our judiciary has been dismal in the context of the constitutional struggle. In fact, some of the saddest episodes of the continuing constitutional debacle have been overseen jointly by opportunistic politicians and ambitious judges, with the latter often providing authoritarian and rigged systems with legal and political crutches to prop them up. The 26th Amendment is a recent instance of the dubious role played by them. They have helped the powers that be create a ‘super executive’ at the cost of judicial independence, integrity and collegiality. Predictably, the newly created Constitutional Bench has already passed a series of controversial judgements. It has legalised civilians’ trial by military courts, validated the ‘permanent’ transfers of judges from one high court to another, and handed the ruling coalition the game-changing ‘reserved seats’ to further amend the Constitution, thus upgrading the existing hybrid system to, perhaps, ‘hybrid plus’.
Thus, it is clear that the emerging politico-legal order is going to make the rapacious elites all the more extractive and repressive, and yet, immune to accountability, with the hapless people being the easy prey. Until, of course, the wheels of history are turned against them.

They reflect the national vision and priorities.
A general view about budget 2025-26 is that it is a lost opportunity. With some macroeconomic stability and inflation under control, many economists think it was time to prepare a reformist budget. The government should have checked its own expenditure, given relief to the salaried class and reset national priorities.
Today, with almost half of Pakistan’s population below the internationally comparable poverty line and 16.5 per cent living in extreme poverty, and with over 25 million children out of school and 40pc suffering from stunting, it’s not rocket science to work out where the needs are and where public money should be spent. Sadly, it is no wonder that Pakistan’s Human Development Index ranking has been declining consistently over the last 10 years. We ranked 147 in 2015; according to this year’s report, we’ve plummeted to 168 among 193 countries.
Against this backdrop, let’s look at health budget 2025-26, with the knowledge that Pakistan is among the lowest spenders on health. To put things in perspective, according to the World Bank, domestic general government health expenditure per capita in international dollar terms in 2022 in Pakistan was 68.11; in the same year, it was 475.01 in Iran, 245.91 in Sri Lanka, 623.19 in China, and 106.83 in India. To meaningfully progress towards achieving universal healthcare (UHC), governments need to spend at least 5pc of GDP. Pakistan’s spending hovered around 1pc in 2022, whereas in the same year Iran spent 2.63pc, Sri Lanka 1.76pc, China 2.95pc and India 1.29pc.

Pakistan is among the lowest spenders on health.

At the federal level, the combined non-development and development budget for the Ministry of National Health Services has been cut from Rs54.87 billion in FY 2024-25 to Rs46.10bn in FY 2025-26 — a reduction of Rs8.77bn. More importantly, the non-development budget, which mainly goes towards salaries, has been increased from Rs28bn to Rs32bn, whereas the development budget has seen a huge 47pc cut — down from Rs27bn to Rs14bn.
In Balochistan, where needs are dire, the health budget has increased by only 6pc from the previous year to Rs87bn. This is a province with serious political unrest and economic problems, where educated young people have joined the uprising because of lack of opportunities and public services. According to an official estimate, 60pc of primary healthcare facilities in the province are without medical officers, and in some districts up to 75pc of children are not routinely immunised. Of all the provinces, Balochistan is the worst off in terms of UHC Service Coverage Index, which is 40 on the scale of zero to 100. In some districts, it is as low as 18. The SCI is calculated by measuring the coverage of 14 basic health services. In this budget, Rs4.5bn are allocated for the Health Card Programme. There is almost doubling of the budget for PHC in Balochistan in relative terms, which is appreciable.
The KP government has allocated Rs276bn to the health sector in the current budget, which is a 19pc increase from the previous year. The allocation for the Sehat Card Plus programme has been increased from Rs28bn to Rs35bn, with an additional Rs6bn for the merged districts. The programme is universal, with coverage of the broadest spectrum of treatments, even including bone marrow transplants and cochlear implants. The PHC, however, remains underserved in the province. With 80pc of the province’s population living in the rural areas, according to the 2023 census, strengthening PHC in these areas and expanding health insurance to PHC in the private sector should be prioritised. In my view, the Sehat Sahulat programme in KP needs serious rethinking in terms of its universal coverage at the tertiary level and no coverage at the PHC level in the private sector.
The Sindh government has increased its health budget by almost 7pc, from Rs347.57bn to Rs371.87bn. Out of this, the non-development budget is 87.7pc, ie, Rs326.5bn, with only 12.3pc remaining for the development budget, ie, Rs45.37bn. The development budget increase is less than 1pc compared with the previous financial year. Sindh continues with its heavy focus on high-cost tertiary-level care, rather than on low-cost and long-lasting preventive care at the PHC level. Tertiary hospitals, mainly in Karachi, are serving people well, but unless the prevention of diseases becomes a financial priority, we’ll continue to mop the floor. Governance and misuse of allocated funds, for both the recurrent and development budget, continue to be huge challenges for Sindh.
Punjab has substantially increased its health budget to Rs630.5bn from Rs539bn last year — ie, an increase of Rs91.5bn or almost 17pc. Out of this, Rs181bn are for the development budget. While it is an impressive increase, Punjab has three major healthcare issues. First, it continues to spend high amounts on tertiary care and pays relatively less attention to PHC. Secondly, inequity in healthcare is a big issue in the province. Most new schemes are in Lahore, and this time there is a hefty allocation of Rs109bn for the establishment of a medical district in Lahore, which the government call its flagship initiative. According to a district-level analysis in 2024 by the Ministry of National Health Services, per capita government health expenditure in Lahore was above $70, but less than $1 in 24 out of 36 districts in Punjab. These figures speak for themselves. The third issue is that everything in Punjab is unabashedly and heavily politically motivated. Left, right and centre, everything is in the name of the chief minister. There was an attempt even to change the name of the Jinnah Institute of Cardiology, but then better sense apparently prevailed.
Seemingly, there has been increase in the health budget all around, but this is still far less than desired keeping in view the public health crisis in the country and the minimum required to achieve UHC. Our priorities continue to be lopsided in healthcare spending. We are ready to spend heavily on transplants and cancers but not appropriately on preventing non-communicable diseases and organ failures. Last, but not least, governance issues and lack of population control will continue to drown all our efforts, even increasing budgets, to improve health in Pakistan.

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) reported the Indus River at medium flood levels in Kalabagh and Chashma, while Tarbela, Taunsa, Guddu, and Sukkur are experiencing low floods. Flash flood warnings have been issued for hill torrents in DG Khan Division and nullahs of East Balochistan.
In northern Punjab, districts like Sialkot, Gujranwala, and Jhelum have been particularly hard-hit. Gujranwala recorded 82mm of rainfall in People’s Colony, while Sargodha city reported 69mm, exacerbating flood conditions.
Hundreds of families in riverine (Katcha) areas have been forced to vacate as waters inundate villages and destroy crops, especially rice and sugarcane.

The central Punjab, including Mandi Bahauddin (50mm rainfall) and Hafizabad (44mm), faces similar challenges, with relief camps being set up for displaced residents.
The southern Punjab remains on high alert as floodwaters advance toward Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur, and Dera Ghazi Khan. The Chenab at Marala is flowing at 115,100 cusecs, while the Ravi at Balloki has reached 38,500 cusecs, posing risks to adjoining areas. The PMD warns of isolated heavy falls in Bahawalpur and DG Khan divisions over the next 24 hours, which could worsen the situation.
The district administrations of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur launched an evacuation campaign due to flooding in hill torrents. Hundreds of families were being relocated to safe places in these districts.
Rescue 1122 said 40 people trapped in a canal at Shinka in Attock district were evacuated. .
Earlier, Lahore witnessed three spells of rain in its different areas. The rain started around 8:45am and continued till 4:30pm with intervals. The rain made movement of the people difficult after causing flooding in streets and major roads of the city.
According to Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa), maximum rain 43 mm was recorded in Iqbal Town, 39 mm at Nishtar Town, 28 mm at Chowk Nakhuda, 26 mm at Samanabad, 22 mm at Wasa head office Gulberg, and less than 20 mm at other areas of the city.
Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) workers were deployed across key areas including Jail Road, Mall Road, Data Darbar, Circular Road, Aik Moria Pul, Do Moria Pul, and McLeod Road to ensure uninterrupted cleaning operations. Over 6,000 waste containers were cleared regularly as part of the ongoing waste collection system, which continued smoothly even during the rain.Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said as many as 143 citizens died, 200 houses were affected and 488 citizens were injured due to monsoon rains in a month.
He said the PDMA arrangements are complete in view of the possible flood threat. “There is a risk of urban flooding due to monsoon rains in Lahore, Sialkot, Faisalabad and Gujranwala.“Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed the relevant stakeholders to redress the loss of farmers whose crops were badly affected due to flood torrents.
She directed provision of financial assistance to the residents of mud houses which collapsed due to the flood torrents.
Meanwhile, Multan also witnessed heavy rain in different areas of the city. Multan Wasa Director General Khalid Raza Khan imposed a rain emergency. He directed the workers to start efforts to clear all major localities from rain water.

“This position reflects France’s commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of our independent state,” Sheikh said.

In a presidential statement ado­pted by consensus on Wednesday, the 15-member Council acknowledged OIC’s efforts in coordination with the United Nations.
It hailed OIC’s contributions to “conflict prevention, confidence-building, peacekeeping, conflict resolution and post-conflict rehabilitation, mediation and preventive diplomacy”.
The Council stressed these efforts must remain consistent “with the UN Charter and relevant resolutions of the Council.”

Dar says 57-member group is ‘collective voice of Islamic world’

The statement recognised the 57-member OIC as “one of the regional and sub-regional organisations that are appropriate for cooperation with the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security”.
It emphasised the importance of “establishing institutionalised cooperation” between the UN and such organisations, especially in preventive diplomacy, peacemaking, peacekeeping, and peacebuilding efforts.
The statement also encouraged increased collaboration between the UN and the OIC through joint meetings, consultations, and joint activities.
In his address, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar called the OIC “the collective voice of the Islamic world”.
He said the group has played a central role in addressing conflicts in member states, like Palestine, Jammu and Kashmir, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Afghanistan.
“Pakistan welcomes the Council’s decision to strengthen the UN-OIC partnership and stands ready to support this effort,” Mr Dar said.
Referring to the conflict in Gaza, the foreign minister said: “We strongly believe that an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza and the provision of humanitarian aid must be ensured.”
He said a two-state solution, with the “pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as the capital of Palestine” was the “only viable path to sustainable peace”.
Mr Dar said the OIC not only condemned Israeli aggression in Gaza but also mobilised global opinion in support of the Palestinian people.
Mr Dar reiterated Pakistan’s position that Kashmiris must be allowed to exercise their right to self-determination as guaranteed by the relevant UN Security Council resolutions.

• Judge says Shah Mehmood proved his presence in Karachi, Islamabad on day of arson
LAHORE: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) judge, who sentenced PTI leaders in the case of violence at Sherpao Bridge on May 9, has said the convicts conspired to commit arson and were present at the site of violence.
PTI leaders, including Dr Yasmin Rashid, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid have been convicted on 10 charges of terrorism, criminal conspiracy, rioting and injuring police personnel and damaging properties.
The verdict was announced by ATC-III Judge Arshad Javed on Tuesday.
The judge also convicted four local PTI leaders, Afzaal Azeem Pahat, Khalid Qayum Pahat, Ali Hassan Abbas, and Riaz Hussain.
The convicts have been awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment each under section 7(i)(h) of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 and section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Pakistan Penal Code, besides minor jail terms on eight charges.
They have also been awarded five-year imprisonment each under section 505 of the PPC for making statements conducing to public mischief. All sentences will run concurrently.
In the detailed order released on Thursday, the judge stated the four convicted senior leaders of PTI were exonerated of the charges of waging or conspiring to wage war against the country.
The judge observed most of the convicts, including Dr Rashid, Senator Chaudhry and Mr Rashid, didn’t dispute their presence at the site where the violence took place but claimed not to have committed any violence.
However, the prosecution produced video recordings in which the convicts were visible at the site of violence along with a mob. The defence did not challenge this evidence, the verdict added.
The judge said the record indicated the mob, armed with sticks, stones and petrol bombs, committed several acts of violence and rioting.
On the convicts’ role in violence, the judge noted once the hatching of a criminal conspiracy was established, it was not necessary for every person part of the mob to have committed violence.
On the charge of criminal conspiracy, the judge relied on the prosecution’s evidence, wherein two witnesses, who were police officials, claimed to have secretly attended PTI meetings.
In these meetings, the witnesses said, PTI Imran Khan instructed other leaders to attack military installations in case of his arrest from the Islamabad High Court.
These meetings were held at Mr Khan’s Zaman Park residence on May 7, 8 and 9, 2023.
The judge said both witnesses sufficiently described the conspiracy meetings in their statements and the defence failed to “create any plausible dent or doubt” in respect to the charge of conspiracy.
The judge maintained the conspiracy was further corroborated by a chain of events that took place soon after the arrest of Mr Khan.
“It is now an open secret that fateful incidents of 9th May 2023 took place all over the country and the modus operandi of the miscreants was to target military installations and law enforcement agencies,” the judge noted.
Qureshi’s acquittal
On the acquittal of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi and five other suspects in the case, the judge observed Mr Qureshi successfully proved his presence in Karachi and Islamabad on the day of violence.
Moreover, Mr Qureshi had attended only one meeting on May 7 and was not involved in any violence that took place as per the instructions given in the meetings. Tuesday’s verdict was the first decision in any of the cases related to May 9 riots in Lahore.

• Scholars say family planning ‘permissible in Sharia’ for medical reasons
ISLAMABAD: The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) is split over endorsement for birth spacing to ensure maternal and child health, sources told Dawn on Thursday.
The CII, which advises parliament on how to align legislation with the principles of the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), held a one-day consultative session in collaboration with the Population Council on Thursday.
In the declaration issued after the session, CII members declared appropriate birth spacing essential for the health of mothers and children.
These methods also “align with Islamic teachings and social responsibility”.
Sources in the Council told Dawn the CII members were divided on the issue.
One group of traditional clerics opposed the term family planning and expressed concerns over concepts like birth spacing.
However, another group oppo­sed their peers and expressed serious concerns over the rising population and called for the active promotion of birth control methods.
The commission decided that Islam’s principle of ‘Mizan’ (balance) supported a responsible approach to parenting.
The session titled ‘The Concept of Mizan and Ihsan (excellence) in Islam: Balancing Resources and Population — Our Survival, Our Future’ was presided over by CII Chairman Allama Dr Raghib Hussain Naeemi.
The meeting explored Islamic and constitutional perspectives on family protection, maternal and child health, and rising population.
The scholars unanimously agreed that in cases of legitimate medical or social need — such as risk to the mother’s life, severe weakness, multiple surgeries, or breastfeeding needs — temporary family planning is permissible in Shariah.
In his opening remarks, Dr Ali Mohammad Mir, senior director of programmes and research at the Population Council, said the rising birth rate was linked to serious challenges, particularly in maternal and child health, including complications and diseases that could impact future generations.
He highlighted the national narrative titled “Tawazun” (balance), which the government developed in consultation with religious leaders to promote responsible family planning.
The declaration issued after the meeting noted that Islam placed great importance on protecting life and lineage, two of the core objectives of Shariah.
“Ensuring maternal and child health and family wellbeing is, therefore, a religious duty,” the declaration said.
While the declaration added birth control methods should be used “within Islamic bounds” and not involve “harmful or impermissible practices”, it did not elaborate on permissible methods.
The scholars noted the Holy Quran encouraged mothers to breastfeed for two years, which naturally leads to spacing between births. This ensures that children receive proper health, nutrition, and education.
The session decided that the Constitution also obliged the state to ensure public welfare, quality health and education, and family security.
“Therefore, balancing population and resources, securing a healthy future generation, and promoting women’s participation are national responsibilities”, the declaration said
The scholars also pledged to spread awareness among the public, clarify misconceptions and guide society toward family wellbeing.
Talking to Dawn, CII member Allama Tahir Ashrafi said that issues like birth spacing and traditional misconceptions associated with them cannot be handled alone by clerics only. “The state too has to play an active role.”

Officials said Bibi Gul Jan was detained by the Serious Crimes Investi­gation Wing (SCIW) and produced before the Anti-Terro­rism Court (ATC) the same day. Investigators requested her rem­and, which the court approved for two days, handing her over to SCIW officials.
So far, police have arrested 16 people in connection with the Dagari killings, including Sardar Sherbaz Khan Satakzai and Basher Ahmed, both of whom were remanded to SCIW custody for 10 days earlier this week.
Sardar Sherbaz was the chief of the Satakzai tribe, from which the victim Bano Bibi also belonged and was killed along with a man identified as Ehsanullah Samalani in the name of so-called honour.
However, the main suspect, Jalal Satakzai, remains at large.
He was seen in a viral video firing shots at his sister, Bano  “We are making all efforts to arrest the main accused,” a senior police officer said.
In a video statement that surfaced on Wednesday night, Gul Jan claimed that Sardar Sherbaz was not involved in the decision to kill Bano and Ehsanullah.
“The decision to kill Bano and Ehsan was taken by her family according to Baloch traditions and customs, and Sardar Sherbaz Satakzai had no role in it,” the woman said.
She also revealed Bano was the mother of three sons and two daughters.
The killings sparked outrage after footage of the double murder went viral, highlighting that “honour killings” continue to persist in Balochistan despite strict laws criminalising such acts.
Human rights groups have long criticised the slow enforcement of these laws, particularly in tribal areas where jirgas and traditional councils continue to wield influence.

People gather along a precipice as locals work to clear the water channel of a powerhouse damaged by floods in the Tangir area of Gilgit-Baltistan.—Dawn

GILGIT: Dozens of houses were damaged after heavy rainfall and ‘cloudburst’ triggered flash floods in multiple villages of Gilgit-Baltistan, severing road links and destroying agricultural land.
Flash floods caused damage in Tangir, the hometown of the Gilgit-Baltistan chief minister, Ghanche, and Gilgit’s Sikarkoi and Kundas villages.
Police said flash floods damaged public and private properties, including administrative offices, markets, power infrastructure, and communication systems in Tangir Valley. The water entered the local police station, destroying official records and equipment, and the residences of the police officers were also damaged.
Likewise, the offices of the assistant commissioner and additional deputy commissioner sustained heavy damage, while a residential house near the AC office completely collapsed in the flash flood.

Spokesperson says six people killed so far; Babusar Road remains blocked

In Ghanche district, more than 60 houses in various areas were damaged by the flash floods, which also washed away a bridge. The rise in water level in the Shyok River intensified erosion along the riverbank, whereas roads in the area remained blocked.
 
 

In the Chogo Grong area of Kondus in Ghanche, water damaged mosques, a school, a dispensary, roads, agricultural land, and livestock. Flash floods in the Sikarkoi and Kundas areas in Gilgit damaged several houses, shops, roads, and other infrastructure in multiple locations.
The flash flood also damaged motorcycles and cars parked outside houses. The floodwater affe­cted several shops at Tangir Bazar and damaged the water channel of the Shekho powerhouse, which led to electricity outages.
 
 

According to GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, over one hundred homes collapsed in Gilgit-Baltistan over the past few days, and six people have also died in flash floods this week. He said search and rescue operations were underway in Babusar Valley for missing tourists.
He said more than 300 stranded tourists had been rescued from Babusar and shifted to Gilgit, Ska­rdu, and Chilas.
The Babusar Road remained closed to traffic on Thu­rsday; but the Karakoram High­way remained open for light traffic.

• Says fresh operations not acceptable; wants military to stop using ‘quadcopters’ to avoid harming civilians
• MPC says grand jirga planned next month to devise implementation plan; ANP, PML-N, JUI-F boycott moot
• Naqvi says all options to end militancy will remain on the table, takes dig at CM for paying ‘protection money’ to militants
PESHAWAR: Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Ganda­pur railed against the policy of harbouring ‘Good Taliban’ — a euph­emism used to describe militants who have laid down arms — following a multi-party moot organised by the KP government to find a solution for the militancy plaguing the province.
The conference came amid a significant rise in terrorism across the province, particularly in districts bordering Afghanistan, which has prompted calls for a renewed military offensive to eradicate militancy in the region.
The KP chief minister opposed these calls, saying that while operations were conducted in the past, they failed to achieve the desired objective despite widespread destruction. While sharing details of the declaration following the moot, CM Gandapur said several operations were carried out against the ‘Good Taliban’ apparently by the police, but the militants were being supported allegedly by the ‘institutions’.
The CM claimed these ‘Good Taliban’ were arrested and areas were cleared by the police, but they were allegedly released by the intelligence agencies.
“Now they (Good Taliban) have come again. Please, these ‘Good Tali­ban’ are not acceptable and if you really want to keep them, give them uniform, and send them to [India-occupied] Kashmir,” he said, adding that the government would take action against anyone carrying arms.
“Anyone who is keeping these Good Taliban should expel and eliminate them,” the CM demanded.
The chief minister said that several offensives were carried out against militants in the province but all of them ended up in the loss of lives, leaving behind many martyred, but still failed to achieve the desired objectives. He said that border management was the responsibility of the federal government but it never fulfilled this responsibility since militant infiltration from Afghanistan continued.
“Deploy the military on the border. We have the capacity to manage things inside the province,” the chief minister said, adding that he would be responsible if the police failed to fulfil its responsibilities in the province. According to the CM, they want clearly defined roles so that whoever failed in their job could be held accountable. The participants of the meeting were of the view that the police were trained enough to maintain law and order in the province.
 


“They [the military] are not doing their core job and instead are roaming in an area, which falls within my jurisdiction,” he claimed, adding that military operations caused damages without any positive results. No other operation would be allowed, he reiterated.
Quadcopter attacks
Reading further from the declaration, the CM said the “drone attacks” being carried out by both sides – the security forces and the terrorists – were causing civilian deaths. The MPC declared quadcopters would not be used anymore for action against militants, he added.
 
 

The MPC also discussed the federal government’s refusal to fulfil its commitments made with people from the merged districts. He also said that mines and minerals were the province’s property and would remain with the province. He said the provincial government would never allow taxing Malakand Division and asked the federal government to withdraw this move.
He further said the MPC approved convening a jirga, comprising elders, parliamentarians, and stakeholders from every district, adding that after 15 days, a grand jirga, whose members will be nominated by the first jirga, would be organised to devise a strategy for the implementation of this declaration.
The MPC was attended by Jamaat-i-Islami, Qaumi Watan Party, JUI-Sami, the PML-N (only one member attended), and the PTI-Parliamentarian. The PML-N, JUI-F, PPP, and the ANP, however, boycotted the conference.
In response, particularly over the opposition to the use of quadcopters announced by the KP CM, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi responded on X that all resources would be used for the elimination of terrorism. He also took another potshot at the CM, asking how much money “an important KP government leader in D.I. Khan pays to the Taliban”.
 






Separately, PPP senators Palwasha Khan and Senator Quratulain Marri criticised the KP CM for not inviting other political parties to the MPC, saying those who had rendered sacrifices were being criticised.

• Dar to meet Rubio today for wide-ranging talks; expected to discuss India-Pakistan dynamics
ISLAMABAD: The Foreign Office on Thursday said the Afghan Taliban were showing “receptivity” to Pakistan’s concerns over sanctuaries of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP) in Afghanistan, signaling cautious optimism about progress on one of the most sensitive issues straining bilateral ties between the two countries.
“One of the stumbling blocks is the sanctuaries enjoyed by terrorists there. There is an active engagement going on between the two sides, and Afghan side is showing receptivity to our concerns communicated to them in this regard,” Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan told reporters at a weekly briefing.
 
 

The presence of TTP militants in Afghanistan has long been a point of contention between Islamabad and the Taliban administration. Since the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul in 2021, Pakistan has accused the group of sheltering thousands of TTP fighters, who have escalated attacks on Pakistani security forces, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Balochistan provinces.
The violence intensified after a fragile ceasefire between Pakistan and the TTP collapsed in November 2022. Pakistani officials estimate that between 3,000 and 4,000 TTP fighters operate from within Afghanistan, emboldened by what Islamabad sees as ideological affinity and inaction from the Afghan Taliban. Kabul has consistently denied providing safe havens.
Tensions between the two countries have remained high in rec­ent years, with Pakistan warning that continued cross-border militancy could derail ties. However, relations began to improve following Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s visit to Kabul on April 19, during which both sides discussed trade, border management and security cooperation. That visit led to what officials described as a “tactical thaw” encouraged by Beijing.
The resumption of high-level engagements, including the upgrade of diplomatic representation from chargé d’affaires to ambassador level, has signaled a renewed willingness to address long-standing grievances.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s visit to Kabul on Sunday, accompanied by Pakistan’s special envoy for Afghanistan, Ambassador Muhammad Sadiq, further built on that momentum.
Mr Naqvi held talks with Afghan Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, focusing on cross-border security, the threat posed by the TTP, and efforts to curb drug trafficking and manage refugee repatriation.
According to Pakistani officials, the Taliban administration agreed in principle to a “phased process” to disarm and relocate TTP fighters away from the border - a step seen as a rare acknowledgment of the issue.
“The technical discussions are ongoing. The two sides are positively engaged, and cooperation in security area has to be seen in the broader ambit of overall positivity and improvement of relations between the two brotherly neighboring countries,” Mr Khan said.
“There have been issues, or multiple issues, ranging from logistics, customs, procedure etc. impacting trade. So all of these are being addressed, and you can see the momentum it is generating. So, there is good progress on the trade,” Mr Khan said.
Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is expected to visit Islamabad in the coming weeks for follow-up discussions.
Dar-Rubio meeting
The FO spokesman also said that Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar is scheduled to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington today (Friday) for wide-ranging talks.
“I can confirm that the meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, and the entire range of issues on the bilateral agenda, as well as important regional and global issues including the situation in the Middle East, and Iran will be discussed,” Mr Khan said.
“Exchange of views will also take place on the Pakistan-India question, for which we remain grateful for the role played by the US in de-escalation of tensions leading to ceasefire,” he added.
Mr Dar is on an official visit to US for participating in events of Pakistan’s UN Security Council Presidency in New York, as well as for bilateral engagements with US in Washington.
The Pakistan-India dispute returned to global focus after a brief but intense military clash in May, triggered by an April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam, Indian-occupied Kashmir, that killed 26 people.
India blamed Pakistan-based militants and launched strikes on May 7 against alleged terrorist camps in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. Pakistan responded with Operation Bunyan-un-Marsoos, targeting Indian military sites in the fiercest exchange since 1971.
Fearing escalation, the US intervened diplomatically, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance mediating between both sides. A ceasefire was announced on May 10, which Islamabad credits to US efforts.
“Our position is that the issues have to be resolved through diplomacy and peaceful means, and we remain committed to it,” Mr Khan said.
“We engage with all countries in good faith, and we continue to invite India to come to the negotiating table and move towards a peaceful settlement of disputes. But the key question is for India to decide what kind of policy it wants to adopt.
“As far as Pakistan is concerned, our position is very clear,” he added. “We have acknowledged and thanked the US intervention and the role it played in the de-escalation of the recent crisis. But again, it is for India to decide the route it wants to take, the policy it wants to adopt,” the FO spokesman said.

After KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur led a multi-party conference, attended by the leaders of Jamat-i-Islami, Qaumi Watan Party, JUI-S, PML-N and PTI-Parliamentarian, a delegation of tribal leaders also met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
The meeting between the PM and tribal elders was also attended by JUI-F emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman and KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi.
 
 

“The meeting was aimed at countering the surge of terrorism with the help of tribal elders,” a participant of the meeting told Dawn on the condition of anonymity.

In meeting with jirga, premier restores admission quota of students from ex-Fata

The prime minister announced a number of incentives for the merged tribal areas, but the meeting categorically ruled out the reversal of the former Fata’s merger with KP.
During the meeting, Federal Minister for Safron and Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam reiterated the federal government had no intention to roll back the merger or alter the existing constitutional arrangement.
 
 

It is important to note the tribal elders have expressed grievances over the mer­ger and Mr Rehman, the JUI-F leader, had called the move “a big mistake”.
Mr Muqam, who heads the committee to revive the jirga system in tribal areas, said the body will make recommendations within the existing constitutional framework on matters concerning justice, development and security.
“There is no plan to withdraw [the merger] or amend the Constitution”, Mr Muqam told the jirga members who had voiced concerns over the committee’s mandate.
The PM also assured the tribal elders the committee’s TORs will be enhanced and they will be given representation in it.
“The committee will now include representation from tribal elders to ensure inclusive decision-making,” said a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.
Admission quota
The PM also announced the admission quota for students from tribal areas in the federal government’s universities will be restored.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that tribespeople have rendered “immense sacrifices for the peace and security of Pakistan”.
He reaffirmed that ensuring law and order in the merged areas was among the government’s top priorities.
The PM paid tribute to the armed forces, police and other law enforcement personnel for their bravery in fighting terrorism, and urged unity among all communities.
Highlighting the government’s commitment to the socio-economic uplift of the region, the PM said his government was investing heavily in education, healthcare, skills training, and employment opportunities for the youth of the merged districts.
He said substantial funds have been allocated for improving infrastructure, including the Fata University and police.
The PM directed an expansion in the scope of the federal committee working on the issues of merged districts, chaired by Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam.
The tribal delegation appreciated the restoration of educational quotas, inclusion in the federal committee, and overall developmental initiatives.
The premier assured the participants that such consultative sessions would be held regularly to ensure that the voices of the tribal people are heard and their issues addressed effectively.
Meeting with Gilani
Earlier, the 90-member tribal jirga, led by Governor Kundi, met Senate Chairman Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani.
The Jirga included prominent tribal elders, including Dr Alamzeb Mohmand, Malik Khan Marjan Wazir, and Bismillah Khan Afridi.
Mr Gilani said cooperation from tribal elders was vital to achieve lasting peace.
He announced the issues of the merged districts will be discussed in the Senate to formulate a clear and comprehensive national policy.
Governor Kundi highlighted the merged districts were assured a three per cent share in the NFC Award under the Accelerated Implementation Programme.
However, the commitment has not been fully implemented and the federal government has often allocated amounts lower than originally pledged.

NEWLY elected PTI senators Mirza Muhammad Afridi, Noor ul Haq Qadri and Faisal Javed take oath.—White Star

• Resolution rejects justification for such crimes on cultural grounds
• House passes Whistleblower Protection Commission Bill, okays 20pc reward for exposing corruption
• Navy Ordinance amended with stricter penalties for misconduct
• Eight new senators sworn in
ISLAMABAD: Alarmed by a brutal act of vigilante justice in Balochistan, where a man and woman were executed in broad daylight under a jirga verdict in the name of “honour”, the Senate on Thursday called for an immediate and transparent investigation to bring all perpetrators — inclu­ding those who convened or sanctioned the jirga — to justice.
In a resolution adopted almost unanimously, the Senate declared that so-called honour killings were not “honourable”, rather constituted murder under the law and must be prosecuted as such.
The resolution, tabled by PPP parliamentary leader Senator Sherry Rehman, was supported by all parties across the aisle except JUI-F, which refused to sign.
 
 

Lawmakers stressed that the rule of law could not be selectively applied and that tribal or informal justice systems must not override constitutional protections and due process.
The resolution rejected any justification of such crimes on cultural, tribal or traditional grounds and condemned attempts to legitimise them under the guise of “ghairat” (honour), describing them as victim-blaming.
The resolution recalled previous legislative reforms aimed at curbing honour crimes, particularly by disallowing compoundability or conciliation in such cases. However, it expressed concern that despite these legal safeguards, implementation remains weak and justice is often subverted, especially in high-profile cases targeting women.
The House stressed that law enforcement agencies must treat such cases strictly under the relevant provisions of the Pakistan Penal Code, without compromise or discretion.
It also urged the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Mini­stry of Human Rights to conduct a thorough review of the enforcement gaps in existing laws dealing with the so-called honour crimes and reco­­mm­end actionable reforms.
 
 

“This premeditated act of vigilante murders constitutes an abhorrent crime; it is a gross violation of human rights, the Constitution and the laws of Pakistan,” it said.
Whistleblower commission
Another highlight of the day’s proceedings was the passage of a bill to establish an independent Whistleblower Protection and Vigilance Commission, aiming to protect whistleblowers from retaliation, promising a reward for those exposing corruption in public institutions.
As per the bill, the Commission will have civil court powers to assess complaints and conduct judicial proceedings. Whistle­blowers will be entitled to 20 per cent of any recovered amount and a certificate of appreciation.
However, submitting false or frivolous information will carry a penalty of up to two years’ imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs200,000, which will be paid to the falsely accused. Those facing retaliation can seek redressal from the Commission, whose orders will be binding.
The whistleblower’s identity will remain confidential unless disclosed with written consent. Violators will face fines of up to Rs500,000 and imprisonment of up to two years.
Law ministry officials noted that the existing 2017 law lacked effective enforcement mechanisms. The new Commission, headquartered in Islamabad, will operate autonomously and may set up offices across Pakistan if needed. It will consist of at least three members, including a chairperson, with the government authorised to expand membership when required.
Navy Ordinance amendments
The Senate also passed the Pakistan Navy (Amendment) Bill, allowing the Navy to engage in activities linked to national development or strategic interests with federal or provincial consent.
The relevant naval authority may retire or discharge any individual and has the right to accept or reject resignations. In times of war, individuals over 60 years of age may be retained in service upon the recommendation of the naval chief.
According to the bill, officers who fail to defend ships and other assets may face the death penalty or long-term imprisonment. Refusal to fight in the event of an attack, cowardice or abandoning a ship in danger may also lead to similar punishments.
Naval personnel involved in extortion or corruption will face lengthy jail terms, as will those who accept bribes, agree to bribery or cause harm or favouritism.
Disclosing official information could lead to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment, and if the information harms national security or the armed forces, the individual will be tried under the Official Secrets Act.
One of the amendments reads, “A person who is or has been subject to this Ordinance commits an offence under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Act XL of 2016) or relevant electronic, digital, social media laws, with the mala fide intention to undermine, ridicule, or scandalise, the armed forces of Pakistan, may be proceeded under this Ordinance and on conviction by a court constituted under this Ordinance, shall be punished in the prescribed manner with the same punishments as provided for in the said Act XL of 2016 or such other laws, as the case may be.”
Meanwhile, Minister for Power Awais Leghari dismissed reports that Nepra had approved a multi-year tariff for K-Electric to recover its losses from consumers. Responding to a calling-attention notice by Senator Faisal Sabzwari, he explained that the reports related to the 2023-24 financial year, when the current government was not in power.
Sworn in
In a separate development, eight of the 11 recently elected senators from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa took the oath of office on Thursday, hours after the ECP issued their victory notifications. Those who were sworn in on Thursday included Noorul Haq Qadri, Faisal Javed Khan, Rubina Khalid, Talha Mehmood, Niaz Ahmed, Dilawar Khan, Attaul Haq and Mirza Muhammad Afridi.
