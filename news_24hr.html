The outage had sent shares down 4.5 per cent in premarket trading.
In updates posted on its status page, the company said it was investigating issues with Cloudflare Dashboard and related APIs.
Minutes later, it said a fix had been implemented and it was monitoring the results. On 9:20 UTC, it said the incident had been resolved.
Canva, an online graphic design tool, in a post on X, initially informed its users that the issues were impacting its services.
“Our CDN, Cloudflare, is experiencing an outage that’s impacting Canva,” it said, adding that it was working with the company to get things back up and running. The post was later deleted.
Once the fix was implemented, Canva said its platform was functional again.







Meanwhile, users of social media platform X also complained about their inability to access several websites.
Cloudflare runs one of the world’s largest networks that helps websites and apps load faster and stay online by protecting them from traffic surges and cyberattacks.
Last month, Cloudflare experienced a global outage that affected access to web services worldwide.
In October, an outage of Amazon’s cloud service had caused global turmoil as thousands of popular websites and apps, including Snapchat and Reddit, were inaccessible due to the disruption.</p><small>2025-12-05 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637508-audio-leaks-case-islamabad-court-issues-non-bailable-arrest-warrant-for-gandapur-again' target='_blank'><strong>Audio leaks case: Islamabad court issues non-bailable arrest warrant for Gandapur, again</strong></a><br><p>

After receiving approval from the incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, the PTI in October formally nominated Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas to lead the opposition in the NA and Senate, respectively. However, the government has not yet formally recognised the nominations, with NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq terming the matter “sub judice”.
In an interview with Nadir Guramani on the Dawn News TV programme Doosra Rukh on Thursday evening, Qamar said that it was not the authority of the speaker to decide not to act upon the nomination.
“At one time it was definitely the entitlement of the speaker,” he said, referring to 2002, when Maulana Fazlur Rehman was made the opposition leader instead of the PPP’s Amin Fahim, even though the PPP had a greater representation in the house, “which was manifestly not politically correct”.
“After that, we changed the Rules of Procedure,” he said, adding that under the new rules, “whoever votes against during the election of the leader of the house becomes the opposition bloc.”
In this opposition bloc, Qamar added, whoever had the most members submits the nomination and “that person will be made the leader of the opposition”.
“So, this is not the discretion of the speaker,” he said. “Whoever has the majority among (opposition) members — it is in their hands, and whoever they decide on, that person should be the opposition leader.”
The nominations of Achakzai and Abbas came after the Election Commission of Pakistan in August disqualified PTI’s Omar Ayub Khan as the NA opposition leader and Shibli Faraz from the same role in the Senate, along with other opposition MNAs and MPAs, following their convictions in May 9 cases.
Ex-premier Imran had in October voi­ced concern over the government’s continued delay in officially recognising his party’s nominees.</p><small>2025-12-05 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637519-provinces-resist-centres-bid-to-shift-hec-bisp-psdp-costs' target='_blank'><strong>Provinces resist Centre's bid to shift HEC, BISP, PSDP costs</strong></a><br><p>

The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said: “In exercise of the powers conferred under Article 243 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, read with Section 8A of the Pakistan Army Act, the president on the advice of the prime minister, is pleased to appoint Field Marshal Asim Munir (NI) M as the chief of army staff, concurrently the chief of defence forces for a tenure of five years.”
A separate notification issued by the ministry also notified Zardari’s approval of the prime minister’s advice regarding the leadership of the air force.
“In exercise of the powers conferred by Article 243 of the Consitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, read with Section 10B of the Pakistan Air Force Act, 1953, the president on the advice of the prime minister is pleased to extend the appointment of Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar (NI) M, as chief of the air staff for a tenure of two years with effect from March 19, 2026,” a separate notification said.
The extension will take effect upon completion of his current five-year term in Mar­­ch next year, keeping him in office until March 2028.
The army chief has been named the first CDF in the most sweeping restructuring of the military command since the 1970s.
The new arrangement consolidates operational, administrative and strategic authority in a single office established through amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution under the 27th Amendment.
The revised Article 243 provides that the president, acting on the prime minister’s advice, shall appoint the chief of the army staff, who will concurrently serve as the chief of defence forces.
The amendment also abolished the office of chairman joint chiefs of staff committee (CJCSC), dismantling the tri-service coordination system in place since 1976 and transferring joint command integration to the CDF.
PM Shehbaz, in a post on X, again congratulated Field Marshal Munir on his “historic” appointment.
“As the sentinel of our nation’s security, his leadership has been pivotal in guiding our brave armed forces to a decisive victory in the battle for truth,” he said.
“The people of Pakistan will always remember his bold and courageous leadership in wartime, that unified the armed forces, galvanised the entire nation and secured a historic victory for our homeland,” he said.







He also congratulated the air chief marshal. “Under his exemplary command, the Pakistan Air Force destroyed seven enemy aircraft and sophisticated missile defence systems with unmatched professionalism and reinforced Pakistan’s air superiority,” he said in an apparent reference to the May conflict with India.
“All national institutions stand united for the defence, development, and prosperity of Pakistan,” he said, adding that “together we will make our country’s defence truly invincible”.
‘Pakistan’s defence has strengthened’
Today, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said Pakistan’s defence had strengthened after the army chief’s appointment as the CDF.
He expressed these views while speaking to the media, during which he also appeared to be referring to speculation surrounding the notification for appointment to the CDF post.
“They had brewed a storm in a teacup,” he said, adding, “Those who were spreading rumours on social media and electronic media should feel ashamed in front of the nation today.”
He said Pakistan’s defence had now strengthened, and “the enemy will now be worried that Pakistan has established a unified command for all forces by making structural changes”.







Five-year tenure reset
To translate the constitutional overhaul into the military’s legal framework, the government amended the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) of 1952 in the wake of the 27th Amendment.
Sub-section (i) of PAA’s Article 8A now states that “for the first appointment of the chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces […], the tenure under this section shall commence from the date of notification of the said office”.
It explains that upon the issuance of the notification for the first COAS-plus-CDF, the “existing tenure of the incumbent chief of the army staff shall be deemed to have recommenced from the date of such notification”.
Under sub-section (iii) of Article 8A, the “terms and conditions” of the COAS concurrently with the CDF shall be determined by the president on the prime minister’s advice.
Field Marshal Munir was appointed army chief on Nov 29, 2022, becoming the 17th army chief to assume the command of the Pakistan Army.
In November 2024, the government brought changes to the PAA, extending the tenure for all three services chiefs from three to five years, keeping the CJCSC’s tenure unchanged at three years. The same amendments allowed the services chiefs to be reappointed and/or their tenures to be extended for up to five years, instead of up to three years.
Therefore, in line with the restructuring under the 27th Amendment, the recent PAA changes allow the president, on the prime minister’s advice, to reappoint the COAS-plus-CDF for another five years, or extend his tenure by up to five years, creating legal space for him to retain his position till December 2035.
Delay in notification
The prolonged delay in issuing the notification had triggered intense speculation, especially after the post of CJCSC was abolished on Nov 27 when Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza retired.
The absence of a notification on Nov 29, the date when Field Marshal Munir’s original three-year term as army chief (prior to last year’s amendment) ended, fuelled further uncertainty about whether the government was holding back the appointment to negotiate upcoming four-star postings.
Political circles suggested the delay may have been used to bargain over the selection of the new Commander National Strategic Command (CNSC), the Vice Chief of the Army Staff (VCOAS) and potentially a future ISI chief.
The army had already clarified that no VCOAS was being appointed. Under the amended law, the appointments of the CNSC and any VCOAS are tied to the CDF’s recommendations.
Government officials repeatedly denied any tensions with the military, maintaining that procedural requirements and the prime minister’s travel itinerary dictated the timeline. None­t­heless, the silence was widely viewed as unusual, especially after the speed with which the 27th Amendment was rushed through parliament.
The amendment also empowers the federal government to define the CDF’s functions, including multi-domain integration, restructuring and enhancing jointness across services.
New organogram
Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said on Thursday the defence ministry was finalising a new organogram for the CDF and had shared a draft with the Prime Minister’s Office a day earlier.
He dispelled the impression of differences over a CDF notification, stressing that it was delayed since the premier was out of the country.
Officials say the organogram will lay out the command flows between the CDF, the service chiefs and the newly established strategic command.</p><small>2025-12-05 09:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051339148f2f464.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959331/putin-and-modi-discuss-trade-peace-in-new-delhi-summit' target='_blank'><strong>Putin and Modi discuss trade, peace in New Delhi summit</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi began summit talks in New Delhi on Friday, as New Delhi rolled out the red carpet for the Russian leader and Modi told him India supported peace efforts in Ukraine.
Putin is on his first visit to India in four years, aiming to boost trade with the top buyer of Russia’s arms and seaborne oil as Western sanctions squeeze their decades-old ties.
The visit comes at a time when New Delhi is engaged in talks with the US for a trade deal to cut punitive tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on its goods over India’s Russian oil purchases.



Moscow has been India’s top arms supplier for decades and has said that it wants to import more Indian goods in an effort to grow trade to $100 billion by 2030 that so far has been skewed in its favour due to New Delhi’s energy imports.
Since European countries cut their reliance on Russian energy after Russia invaded Ukraine nearly four years ago, India ramped up its purchases of discounted Russian crude, only to reduce them under pressure from US tariffs and sanctions this year.
Efforts to end Ukraine conflict
“India is not neutral. India has a position, and that position is for peace,” Modi told Putin as they opened their talks. “We support every effort for peace, and we stand shoulder to shoulder with every initiative taken for peace.”
Putin, in response, thanked Modi for his attention and efforts aimed at resolving the conflict.
“We had the opportunity — and you gave me that opportunity — to speak in detail about what is happening on the Ukrainian track and about the steps we are taking jointly with some other partners, including the United States, toward a possible peaceful settlement of this crisis,” Putin said.
“As our countries and economies grow, the opportunities for cooperation expand,” Putin said. “New areas are emerging — high technologies, joint work in aviation, space, and artificial intelligence.
We have a very trusting relationship in the field of military-technical cooperation, and we intend to move forward in all these areas.”
21-gun salute welcome
Putin landed in Delhi on Thursday to a warm welcome from Modi, who greeted him with an embrace on the tarmac of the airport. The two men then travelled together in the same vehicle for a private dinner hosted by Modi.
On Friday, Putin was given a ceremonial welcome on the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, the colonial-era presidential palace, with a 21-gun salute as his convoy drove in.
The two sides are expected to announce a raft of deals at the end of formal talks.
Indian firms are expected to sign an agreement with Uralchem group, Russia’s top potash and ammonium nitrate producer, to jointly set up a urea plant in Russia, Reuters reported on Thursday.
Russian lenders Gazprombank (GZPRI.MM) and Alfa Bank have also sought approval to begin operating in India to help Moscow boost its trade with India, Reuters reported.
Putin Challenges Washington
Modi and Putin are also expected to discuss topics including labour and civil nuclear energy.
A large business and government delegation has accompanied Putin for the visit, including Defence Minister Andrei Belousov who held talks with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh on Thursday.
Belousov stated that “the Russian defence industry is ready to support India towards becoming self-reliant in the field of defence production,” India’s defence ministry said after the talks.
In an interview with broadcaster India Today that was aired late on Thursday, Putin challenged US pressure on India not to buy Russian fuel when the US could purchase Russian nuclear fuel.
“If the US has the right to buy our fuel, why shouldn’t India have the same privilege? This question deserves thorough examination, and we stand ready to discuss it, including with President Trump,” Putin said.
He also said that while there was a minor dip in India-Russia trade during the first nine months of this year, energy trade was “running smoothly”.
India has said Trump’s tariffs are unjustified and unreasonable and pointed at ongoing US trade with Moscow. The US and European Union continue to import billions of dollars’ worth of Russian energy and commodities, ranging from liquefied natural gas to enriched uranium.
‘India’s Conundrum’
Putin arrived in India a day after holding talks with Trump’s top envoys on a possible peace deal to end the war in Ukraine, but they did not reach a compromise.
India has resisted condemning Russia over the war and called for peace through dialogue and diplomacy, while saying that its ties with Moscow were being unfairly targeted by Western nations that it said continued to do business with Moscow when it was in their interest.
“India faces a conundrum; by taking steps to strengthen ties with Moscow or Washington, New Delhi risks setting back ties with the other,” Michael Kugelman, senior fellow at Washington’s Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in Foreign Policy magazine this week.</p><small>2025-12-05 09:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051346000a0d4bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959330/hrcp-condemns-police-action-against-aurat-march-activists-in-karachi-urges-authorities-to-respect-peoples-access-to-civic-spaces' target='_blank'><strong>HRCP condemns police action against Aurat March activists in Karachi, urges authorities to respect people’s access to civic spaces</strong></a><br><p>The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Friday condemned police action against Aurat March activists in Karachi a day earlier, calling on authorities to respect people’s access to civic spaces.
On Thursday, a rights activist was ‘briefly detained’ from outside the Karachi Press Club (KPC), ahead of a press conference by Aurat March over the alleged abduction of two Baloch girls.
The organisers said classical dancer and human rights activist Sheema Kermani was also manhandled by police, while other women participants were also “mistreated” by female officers on their way to the press club. Journalist Zofeen Ebrahim was also barred from attending the press conference, which was eventually held at the KPC.
In a post on social media platform X today, the HRCP said it condemned the police obstruction of Aurat March’s scheduled press conference and the brief detention and manhandling of activists and reporters, including Kermani.
“We are also alarmed that journalist Ebrahim was barred from entering the press club. The HRCP urges the authorities to respect all people’s access to civic spaces and investigate the alleged police misconduct,” the commission said.







While the authorities refused to give any official account of yesterday’s incident, a police officer who wished not to be named, said that “extreme vigilance and heightened security measures” had been put in place in the Red Zone, particularly around the KPC, because of security concerns.
The officer said there was a “terrorist threat” and that security had therefore been tightened. The officer denied the arrest of any woman activist.</p><small>2025-12-05 09:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051400201ca52b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957937/health-when-disinformation-can-be-fatal' target='_blank'><strong>HEALTH: WHEN DISINFORMATION CAN BE FATAL</strong></a><br><p>Vaccine campaigns have long been a controversial subject in Pakistan, from the fake polio drive organised by the CIA to track Osama bin Laden to the many conspiracy theories that surrounded the Covid vaccine. Hence, the recent rollout of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine against cervical cancer also faced public scrutiny.
This time, however, the alarm was amplified, since the campaign focused on girls aged 9 to 14, leading to concerns and questions about its impact on fertility and reproductive health.
The HPV vaccine drive’s initial campaign was planned from September 15-27, 2025, but was later extended to October 1. It aimed to immunise 13 million girls aged 9-14 across Punjab, Sindh, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and the federal capital Islamabad. In the drive, the vaccine — which has a retail price of Rs7,500 — is being provided free of charge through a partnership between the government of Pakistan, the World Health Organisation and vaccine alliance GAVI.
While vaccinators and public health experts expected resistance, the rate of refusal was shockingly high. On September 24, the state minister for national health revealed that only 34 percent — around 4.5 million girls — had been vaccinated.

The misinformation around the HPV vaccine was so great that it threatened an entire campaign. It was yet another demonstration of how viral online lies can have deadly consequences

A few days earlier, federal health minister Mustafa Kamal had his own daughter vaccinated in front of the press. “The refusal rate was extremely high in the first few days,” Kamal tells Eos. “I realised that the best way to allay parents’ concerns was to get my daughter inoculated,” he adds. Kamal says that it worked, with coverage improving drastically during the remainder of the campaign.
By the end of the campaign, nine million girls had received the shot. But that number could have been higher, if not for the many disinformation campaigns that amplified suspicion and mistrust.
THE DISINFORMATION ECHO CHAMBER
A video on a YouTube channel, called Eon Podcast Reloaded with 176,000 followers, claimed that HPV only affects those with multiple sexual partners and its vaccine causes infertility. The host in the clip, Amanullah Tariq, tied HPV with promiscuity, calling for that to be stopped instead of vaccines to be administered.
In the video, Tariq claims, “as a fact that can be Googled”, that the vaccine’s introduction in India led to the death of 125 girls. A 2010 HPV vaccine pilot in India targeting 30,000 girls was indeed suspended after seven girls died, but an Indian government investigation revealed that none of the deaths were caused by the vaccine.
The podcast has since been removed from the YouTube channel, but snippets remain available online. Tariq claims he is unaware if the video was removed or deleted due to a YouTube strike. The podcaster, who continues to host high-profile guests, also doubled down on his opinions, asserting that he has the right to them, even if they are based on misinformation.
Misinformation also spread through viral videos, including one which has 350,000 views on one post on X (formerly Twitter). It shows schoolgirls fainting, with the caption claiming it was the after-effect of the HPV vaccine. This is just one metric for a video that has been shared multiple times and across platforms, including WhatsApp groups. By the time fact checkers revealed that the claim was fake and the video was from a different event, the damage had already been done.
These are only two examples from an ever-expanding digital universe powered by clicks and views — easiest to acquire through fearmongering — that adversely impacts individuals and families. One such example is Bushra, a schoolteacher in Islamabad, who convinced her sister not to get her niece vaccinated, as she was suspicious of the government. “It could be that Pakistan’s rapidly growing population might have pushed the government to accept an IMF condition to make girls infertile,” she tells Eos.
UNDERSTANDING VACCINE MISINFORMATION
“Whenever vaccines are free or mandatory, people start questioning intentions,” says Dr Naeem Majeed, a public health professional based in Karachi. “Anti-vaxxer movements exist worldwide and have grown stronger with increased online polarisation,” he tells Eos.
Within Muslim-majority countries, Dr Majeed continues, there is a recurring fear that vaccines, especially those targeted at women and girls, will interfere with fertility or family planning. “This perception resurfaces every few years, even though it has no basis in science.”
The HPV vaccine, however, had an added layer of controversy from the start because it targeted adolescent girls. Many young girls themselves began asking why boys were not receiving the vaccine, as misinformation online often framed HPV as exclusively linked to female sexual behaviour.
“Parents dislike the implication that the HPV vaccine is only for people who are sexually active,” Dr Majeed says. “They don’t realise that ‘sexually active’ can mean being active with a single partner later on, even a husband. It has nothing to do with promiscuity.”
While HPV is transmitted through sexual contact and most infections clear naturally, certain strains can cause cervical cancer years or decades later. The vaccine prevents these cancer-causing infections, which is why it’s administered before girls become sexually active — offering protection for their future health.
GENDERED DISINFORMATION
Surprisingly, HPV resistance was higher in urban centres as compared to rural areas, which is the opposite of what public health campaigns usually encounter. Dr Majeed explains that this is largely because urban populations, such as Karachi, consume far more social-media content, where gendered misinformation is spreading aggressively. Rural families, by contrast, are less aware of the vaccine and its controversies, and show lower levels of organised resistance, he adds.
Government restrictions around messaging, imposed due to security concerns, also prevented health workers from addressing misconceptions with full transparency. “Technical experts were not allowed to answer certain questions and that vacuum was quickly filled by online disinformation,” says Dr Majeed.
Beyond misinformation, awareness itself remains low. Cervical cancer has relatively low visibility in Pakistan because most cases are detected after age 45, while the HPV vaccine is administered years earlier. “People know breast cancer,” Dr Majeed continues, “but many have never even heard of cervical cancer, so they assume it’s a new disease or something created by the state.”
However, according to the Aga Khan University Hospital, cervical cancer remains a significant public health threat in Pakistan, with over 5,000 new cases and approximately 3,000 deaths reported annually in the country.
Despite these challenges, the campaign managed to achieve 77 percent coverage, lower than previous drives but still higher than what many other countries achieved in their first HPV rollout. Routine HPV immunisation will now be incorporated into Pakistan’s schedule for all girls aged nine, beginning January. The campaign phase will not be repeated in the covered regions unless major outbreaks or multi-year gaps occur. However, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and Gilgit-Baltistan are still pending implementation and are scheduled for campaigns in 2026 and 2027.
But before rolling out the next phase, the government and health experts need to ensure that online misinformation — which has real, offline consequences — is tackled and debunked. In the case of the HPV vaccine, denying an adolescent girl access to immunisation means potentially putting her future health at risk. Parents, teachers, opinion leaders and health experts share a responsibility to exercise due diligence, verify facts and approach public health guidance with care, rather than dismissing it as a state conspiracy without evidence.
Unless that happens, Bushra and many others like her, will continue to resist the vaccine, leaving out girls facing another potential challenge that could have been avoided.

Monsoon rains paired with two tropical storm systems dumped record deluges across Sri Lanka, and parts of Indonesia’s Sumatra, southern Thailand, and northern Malaysia last week. The death toll from the floods and landslides in all affected areas has surpassed 1,000.
Today, PM Shehbaz, “on behalf of the people and government of Pakistan, extended heartfelt condolences to the Malaysian prime minister over the precious loss of lives and damage to property due to rains, flooding, and massive landslides triggered by the recent storm,” a post on PTV News’ X account said.







PM Shehbaz expressed his condolences over the loss of lives and prayed for the swift recovery of citizens who had been injured or displaced, the state broadcaster reported.
He also expressed solidarity with the Malaysian people, and offered “all possible assistance” from Pakistan in Malaysia’s ongoing relief and rescue operations.
According to PTV News, he assured his Malaysian counterpart that Pakistan “will provide to the Malaysian government whatever assistance it may require in the relief operations”.
The PTV News report said that Malaysian PM Ibrahim thanked PM Shehbaz, saying that “sentiments of sympathy and concern” expressed by him, as well as him reaching out at this difficult time, were a “manifestation of the close brotherly relations between Pakistan and Malaysia”.
Pakistan has also provided assistance to Sri Lanka in the wake of ravages caused by Cyclone Ditwah, which has killed over 450 people there. On Wednesday, Pakistan sent an urban search and rescue team to the flood-hit country by air for assistance in relief efforts.</p><small>2025-12-05 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637502-interior-minister-unveils-ai-based-app-to-curb-illegal-immigration' target='_blank'><strong>Interior minister unveils AI-based app to curb illegal immigration</strong></a><br><p>

The move, the latest in a sweeping immigration crackdown by the administration of US President Donald Trump, took place just two days after it halted immigration applications for citizens from 19 nations.
Under the new rules, the maximum validity period for initial and renewal EADs has been shortened from five years to 18 months for categories including refugees, asylum seekers, those granted withholding of deportation or removal, and applicants with pending adjustment-of-status or relief applications.
Additional categories, including those paroled as refugees, granted temporary protected status (TPS) or under entrepreneur parole, will see the validity of their work permit reduced to one year or the end date of their authorised parole or TPS period, whichever is shorter.
These changes apply to applications pending or filed on or after Dec 5, 2025, or Jul 22, 2025, depending on the category.
“The reduced maximum validity periods will result in more frequent vetting of aliens who apply for authorisation to work in the US,” the agency said.
The agency added that after the attack on National Guard service members in Washington earlier this month, “it’s even more clear that USCIS must conduct frequent vetting of aliens”.
USCIS Director Joseph Edlow linked the change directly to safety concerns.
“Reducing the maximum validity period for employment authorisation will ensure that those seeking to work in the US do not threaten public safety or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,” he said.
US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday the US plans to expand the number of countries covered by its travel ban to more than 30.
After a meeting with Trump on Monday, she said she recommended a full travel ban on “every damn country that’s been flooding our nation with killers, leeches, and entitlement junkies.”
All asylum cases on hold
Earlier this week, the Trump administration has imposed the most sweeping internal freeze on immigration benefits in decades, ordering USCIS to halt all asylum adjudications and suspend a wide range of applications from nationals of 19 “high-risk” countries, while reopening thousands of previously approved cases for fresh security screening.
The directive, issued to USCIS field offices, followed a series of violent incidents involving Afghan nationals admitted under earlier programmes. Those cases prompted the White House to conclude that vetting procedures between 2021 and 2024 were “dangerously insufficient”, triggering a system-wide overhaul of immigration screening.
The USCIS memorandum directed officers to place an immediate hold on all asylum applications, regardless of nationality. This included applicants from countries rarely associated with security concerns. Immigration attorneys said they were not aware of any previous instance in which asylum adjudications were frozen across the board.
The order also suspended all immigration benefit applications filed by nationals of the 19 restricted countries. These included green card petitions, replacement green cards, travel documents, parole extensions and applications to preserve continuous residence for naturalisation. Even routine services — such as replacing a lost green card — were paused.
USCIS officers were also instructed to reopen and re-examine all approved immigration benefits granted to nationals of the listed countries who entered the US on or after Jan 20, 2021. Mandatory interviews — with no possibility of a waiver — would be required in many cases, and cases may be referred to law enforcement if concerns arose during the review.

The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered the case against Akbar in July this year over allegedly defamatory and controversial remarks shared on his social media account.
According to the court order, issued by Judicial Magistrate Muhammad Abbas Shah, the decision was taken after Akbar failed to appear before the court despite multiple summons.
The order also directed the authorities concerned to issue an arrest warrant for Akbar to ensure his production before the court. The order noted that the accused did not cooperate with the investigation and remained absent during the legal proceedings.
A challan in the case has already been submitted to the court.
With the proclamation order now in place, law enforcement authorities are expected to intensify efforts to apprehend the former aide on accountability as the trial moves forward.
Interior minister hands extradition requests to UK envoy
The development comes a day after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi met UK High Commissioner Jane Marriott and he handed over the extradition papers for Akbar and YouTuber Adil Raja.
“The extradition papers for Akbar and Raja from the government of Pakistan were handed over [to Marriott],” a statement issued by the interior ministry said.
“Both individuals are wanted in Pakistan. They should be handed over to Pakistan immediately,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. He also provided evidence against Pakistani citizens who were spreading propaganda, the statement said.
“I fully believe in freedom of expression, but fake news is a problem for every country,” he said, as per the statement.
“No country can allow slander and defamation against state institutions from those sitting abroad,” the minister said. Naqvi also said that Pakistan would welcome British cooperation for the return of those who “spread anti-Pakistan propaganda”.
While Pakistan does not have a formal extradition treaty with the UK, both countries do have an agreement in place whereby London can repatriate Pakistani nationals involved in crimes and violating immigration laws.</p><small>2025-12-05 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/051211183d52f0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959322/trump-set-for-soccer-or-football-diplomacy-at-world-cup-draw' target='_blank'><strong>Trump set for soccer — or football — diplomacy at World Cup draw</strong></a><br><p>Donald Trump still seems unsure whether to call it soccer or football. But the US president’s aim is truer when using the world’s favorite sport to score diplomatic goals.
Trump will try to do so again Friday when he meets the leaders of 2026 World Cup co-hosts Canada and Mexico at the tournament’s draw in Washington.
As the first World Cup hosted by three countries simultaneously, it should be a golden opportunity to show North American unity, with the three leaders reportedly set to take part in a ceremonial draw.
But Trump’s aggressive stance towards his allies on trade, migration and drug-trafficking since his return to power means they will have thorny issues to tackle on the sidelines of the gala event.
For Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum it will be her first meeting with Trump. She told reporters they would discuss bilateral trade during the “small meeting” before the draw, in which the 48 qualifying teams are divided into 12 World Cup groups.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has visited the White House twice but it will be his first encounter with Trump since briefly meeting in South Korea in November, after Trump suspended trade talks in a bizarre row over an anti-tariff ad.
They will have a “brief meeting during their time together at the Kennedy Center,” the venue for the tournament draw, Carney’s office told AFP Thursday, adding that he would also meet briefly with Sheinbaum.
Trump has slapped steep tariffs on exports from Canada and Mexico that do not fall under the USMCA trade agreement that Washington is seeking to renegotiate next year.
He has threatened further punishment if they fail to curb cross-border migration and drug trafficking — and irked Sheinbaum by saying he would be “OK” with airstrikes on Mexico to tackle traffickers.
Canada meanwhile was outraged by Trump’s calls earlier this year for it to become the 51st US state.
FIFA ‘peace prize’
Yet the three countries now find themselves hosting the world’s biggest sporting event together, having launched their joint bid in 2017 during Trump’s first term in the White House.
He has unashamedly seized on the World Cup to score political and diplomatic points — even though the golf fan’s knowledge of the beautiful game mainly comes from his son Barron, 19.
The US president has struck up a close friendship with FIFA boss Gianni Infantino, who also has close ties with a number of authoritarian leaders including Russia’s Vladimir Putin.
Trump dangled the carrot of the chance to compete at the 2026 World Cup as a possible “incentive” for Russia — banned from international football since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine — to end the war.
Infantino is set to play to Trump’s love of flattery when he presents a new FIFA “peace prize” on Friday that the US leader is widely expected to win.
Trump has hosted Infantino several times at the White House — as he did Portuguese superstar Ronaldo at a dinner for visiting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November.

But Trump’s football diplomacy has also risked colliding with his domestic priority of a massive crackdown on immigration.
Trump recently unveiled a special fast-track visa process for people with World Cup tickets, but Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that a ticket would not guarantee admission to the United States.
More recently, Trump responded to an Afghan national allegedly shooting two National Guard members in Washington by slapping a freeze on all asylum decisions from 19 countries.
They include World Cup participants Haiti and Iran.
Trump has also caused jitters at FIFA and in foreign capitals by threatening to move World Cup matches from Democratic-run cities where he has launched anti-crime and immigrant operations.</p><small>2025-12-05 07:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05134308b713719.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957084/going-back-in-time-on-the-banks-of-the-indus' target='_blank'><strong>Going back in time on the banks of the Indus</strong></a><br><p>The journey began the moment we veered onto the newly built Hakla-D.I. Khan Motorway, leaving Islamabad for a landscape that felt almost primordial.
Within minutes, the view changed: rolling mountains unfurled on either side and gorges plunged unexpectedly beside us, at times intercepted by small mountain streams. We were bound for Kalabagh (about two hours from Islamabad) for a boat journey along the mighty Indus.


On the banks of the Indus River

At Tarap, we took a short detour to visit a centuries-old baoli — a traditional Indian stepwell once used for drinking water and everyday domestic needs. This one was impressively well preserved, and the tourism department is now working to restore it, along with several other baolis across Punjab. From there, we drove to a beautifully kept farmhouse overlooking fruit orchards and the River Soan, where we paused for tea. With miles still ahead of us, we eventually tore ourselves away, promising to return one day to spend a night there under a star-studded, smog free sky.

One of the unintended pleasures of travelling through Pakistan’s hinterland is encountering colonial-era buildings in the most unexpected places: a quaint, decrepit dak bungalow (a government-run rest house in British India); a quiet, small railway station where trains no longer stop; or a Glasgow-manufactured iron girder railway bridge standing steadfast over a stream for more than a century. As we left, we again drove through Potohar’s backyard, the sun setting as we crossed the Soan River, which originates in the Murree Hills before merging with the mighty Indus — but more on the Soan in a bit.
We reached Kalabagh by evening and checked in, delighted, to the renowned Bohr Bangla on the Indus, only to discover we were being placed in an annexe rather than the historic bungalow itself, contrary to what had been stated on the online booking site. After a brief protest and an unyielding management, we shifted to an Irrigation Department dak bungalow next door. It was a typical government rest house but comfortable enough for three friends on the road. We ended our day with tea on the floating barge outside, watching the vast river drift by as the lights from the 19th-century Kalabagh Bridge shimmered across its dark waters.


The historical Bohr Bangla at Kalabagh

The journey upstream
The next morning, a boat arrived from the Punjab Tourism Department’s facility on the eastern bank of the river. A guide and a pilot accompanied it.
We set off around 10am, heading about two hours upstream toward our destination: Makhad Sharif, a small, historic town on the Indus in District Attock.
As we pulled away, we captured some striking photographs of Bohr Bangla and the tiered steps of Kalabagh — a town known for its salt mines, its tillay wali chappal (ornamental shoes), and, of course, the legendary Nawab of Kalabagh. On our left was Kalabagh town; on our right, the tourism facility and the historic Mari Indus railway station slid past. Soon we crossed the Kalabagh Bridge and passed a restaurant-cum-hotel recently opened by a local entrepreneur.
To our right rose a massive mound marking the ancient town of Mari Indus. At its summit stood abandoned Hindu temples, their silhouettes stark against the sky, while below lay the river port that once bustled with trade.
That era has long faded with the advent of railways, roads, and faster means of transport. As we crossed Mari Indus, the locally famed village of Kukran Wala appeared on our left (perhaps the only village in Punjab situated west of the Indus, reachable only by passing through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa).
Beyond Kukran Wala, the landscape grew quieter. The river narrowed, funnelling us into a gorge, with Punjab on one side and KP on the other. About 30 minutes into our journey, the remains of rusting cables and weathered structures came into view along the bank. This was the proposed site of the hotly contested Kalabagh Dam — a project that was debated for decades but ultimately never built.


Soan River on the right merges with Indus River on the left

We were marvelling at the raw wilderness when a foul stench hit our noses. Our guide explained that we were approaching the point where the Soan River meets the Indus, and that the Soan, carrying all the sewage from Rawalpindi, makes this section of the river particularly odorous.
All we could do was silently hope for some sense to prevail. After all, whenever humans tamper with nature, it often strikes back, as the recent floods along the Soan had painfully shown. But expecting better judgement seemed optimistic at best.
We pressed on and soon crossed the magnificent confluence of the Soan and Indus. The merging of the two rivers was a spectacle to behold, etched permanently in my memory. Beyond the intersection, the water grew clearer, and the gorge deepened. At times, the cliffs seemed barely a couple of hundred metres apart, hinting at the immense depth of the river below.


Kalabagh town on the river

Along the way, we passed a few fishing huts under construction by the tourism department. Whether they would ever be actively used remained a question; building infrastructure is one thing, running it successfully is another. I sincerely hoped for their success.
Further along, we spotted multiple excavators along the riverbanks (mostly on the KP side) digging for gold, apparently all illegal. Judging by the number of operations, it seemed like a surprisingly profitable venture.
Eventually, we stopped at a private hut belonging to a friend near Makhad Sharif. We sat under a sprawling banyan tree, sipping tea and watching the Indus flow past. In such moments, the concepts of time and space dissolve. You feel part of another world, moving at its own pace. far removed from phones, emails, and the constant buzz of the internet.


The revered shrine of the Pirs of Makhad

Gold mining along the riverbank
We strolled along the riverbank and learned about the gold mining process from a group of young boys working manually with simple tools: fine steel meshes and a few pans.
By sifting river soil through the mesh, they could gather tiny golden specks, which they then separated into raw gold using mercury. The yield from such manual operations is minimal, unlike those using excavators and mechanised equipment to extract gold from the riverbed. I believe the government should permit these small-scale manual operations to support local livelihoods, while banning commercial excavation except for licensed government operators.
Resuming our journey to Makhad Sharif, we arrived at the historic town’s banks about two hours later. An elaborate ancient Hindu temple graces the riverbank, but it awaits attention from the Archaeology Department to explore its historical significance. We wandered through the bazaar, alive with local crafts and, of course, the famous Makhadi halwa, celebrated for its unique flavour and now available as far afield as Peshawar, Mianwali, and Rawalpindi.
We visited a library maintained by a local religious leader, which claims to be the largest in the Potohar region, before paying our respects at the shrines of the saints for whom Makhad Sharif is named.
The shrines are majestic, adorned with intricate blue tile work, and even the surrounding graveyards narrate the town’s ancient history. During the annual urs, Makhad comes alive with thousands of disciples, who are provided free boarding and lodging, reminiscent of the arrangements at Kartarpur. Finally, we rested and enjoyed tea at a friend’s house before beginning our journey back to Kalabagh.

The return journey was faster as it was with the flow of the river. The sun was setting and the whole gorge and Indus before us was glowing. The wilderness was awe inspiring but in less than two hours, we reached Kalabagh. The sunset afforded us some great photography, but it also made one feel that the sun has probably set over an otherwise historic town by the river.
This relatively small corridor along Indus offers a glimpse into ancient Hindu heritage, colonial heritage, railways heritage, religious landmarks, a peek into the Nawabs of Kalabagh and Pirs of Makhad Sharifs’ heritage besides a breath-taking landscape. Together, this endowment makes this corridor an excellent eco-tourism site for Punjab as well as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Eco-tourism potential of the Indus corridor
Reviving the Kalabagh-Indus River-Makhad Sharif corridor could begin with a comprehensive masterplan to develop the area into an ecotourism zone, supported by a dedicated tourism authority to manage and regulate activities
Introducing speed boats and water sports at Kalabagh and Makhad Sharif, alongside technical assistance to develop the towns on the model of Lahore’s Walled City, would enhance their appeal.
River-facing buildings in Kalabagh, Makhad, Mari Indus, and surrounding villages could be whitewashed or blue-washed, while robust solid waste management and strict measures to prevent untreated sewage from entering the Indus and Soan rivers would protect the fragile ecosystem.


The ancient port of Mari Indus, with the temples perched at the top

Cable cars across the river, revival of the Mari Indus railway, timely completion of fishing huts, and the establishment of riverfront boutique hotels by recognised chains, complemented by substantial tax and other incentives for private operators, would further energise the region.
The impact of such ecotourism initiatives on local livelihoods, heritage preservation, and economic growth cannot be overstated, offering Pakistan and Punjab a much-needed tourism destination while restoring the historic glory of these towns.

US Space Agency Nasa states that a supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with the Moon’s closest approach to Earth in its elliptical orbit, a point known as perigee.
According to CNN, the moniker ‘Cold Moon’ indicates that it’s the full moon event closest to the winter solstice, the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere.
Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission has said that the supermoon, which was visible on Thursday night, will also be visible in the country tonight.
Here are some pictures of the supermoon dazzling stargazers across the world.

The issues of undervalued customs assessments will be taken up with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and Customs Valuation, he informed the local vehicle assemblers during a meeting held in Islamabad on Thursday.
The government remains committed to ensuring a fair and competitive playing field. “Fixed valuations and import trade prices (ITPs) for used vehicles must be updated and reviewed annually. The Ministry of Industries will continue prioritising local manufacturing, job creation, and a progressive auto policy to encourage competitive pricing, which ultimately benefits Pakistani consumers,” Mr Akhtar stated.
He assured the delegation that the government is fully aware of the industry’s concerns regarding the import of used vehicles.
On the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, new legislation and regulatory frameworks will be introduced to address these issues comprehensively, he said, adding that only those used vehicles that meet safety and environmental standards will be allowed to enter Pakistan.

PM’s aide promises all vehicles will meet strict safety, quality regulations

He added that open competition would promote efficiency and lead the auto sector toward low-cost and competitive local manufacturing.
Secretary Industries Saif Anjum informed the meeting that, for commercial imports, three years of overseas residency and one year of registration under the owner’s name will remain mandatory.
He further said that the safety and quality standards of imported vehicles will be verified through pre-shipment inspections.
22,000 used vehicles
Industry representatives noted that nearly 22,000 used vehicles entered the country under the baggage scheme between July and November 2025, capturing almost 25 per cent share of the market. If this trend continues, they warned, total imports could surpass 50,000 units this year, posing a serious threat to local investment, production, and employment.
“Because of outdated and significantly lower fixed customs valuations, used vehicles brought in under the baggage scheme pay far less in duties and taxes than locally manufactured cars. This imbalance is deeply concerning,” said Nadeem Malik, Chairman, Master Changan Motors.
Director Lucky Motor Corporation, Babar S. Khan said the delegation emphasised that these imports do not comply with UN safety regulations, which all local manufacturers must meet.
“No Government agency is currently checking whether these imported vehicles meet basic safety regulations. This puts both consumers and the public at risk,” he added.
Hyundai Nishat Motors COO Sohail Nawaz said the industry also highlighted the strain on local operations, which are running at only 35pc capacity.
“It is unfortunate that despite such low capacity utilisation, used vehicle imports under the baggage scheme continue at this scale,” he said.
Director NexGen Auto, Aqib Zulfiqar noted that local manufacturing creates jobs, supports value addition, drives technology transfer, and strengthens large-scale manufacturing — the backbone of our economy. In contrast, uncontrolled used car imports burden the economy while putting lives and long-term investments at risk.
Reflecting on the changing market dynamics, COO of Sazgar Haval, Mian Ali Hameed, said the original justification for allowing used imports no longer exists.
Consumers today have so many choices — 16 new players offering modern vehicles with full safety and advanced driver assistance features, zero-interest financing options, and immediate availability with no waiting periods.
Auto assemblers also emphasised that tax reforms and effective control over used car imports could help stabilise domestic production.
They cautioned that liberal policies on used car imports could undermine the hard-earned gains made by the local auto industry.

Noem, in an interview on Fox News’ ‘The Ingraham Angle’, was asked to confirm whether the administration of US President Donald Trump would be increasing the number of countries on the travel ban list to 32.
“I won’t be specific on the number, but it’s over 30, and the president is continuing to evaluate countries,” she said.
Trump signed a proclamation in June banning the citizens of 12 countries from entering the United States and restricting those from seven others, saying it was needed to protect against “foreign terrorists” and other security threats. The bans apply to both immigrants and non-immigrants, such as tourists, students and business travellers.
Noem did not specify which countries would be added to the list.
“If they don’t have a stable government there, if they don’t have a country that can sustain itself and tell us who those individuals are and help us vet them, why should we allow people from that country to come here to the United States?” Noem said.
Reuters previously reported that the Trump administration was considering banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable.
An expansion of the list would mark a further escalation of migration measures the administration has taken since the shooting of two National Guard members in Washington, DC, last week.
Investigators say the shooting was carried out by an Afghan national who entered the US in 2021 through a resettlement program under which Trump administration officials have argued there was insufficient vetting.
Days after the shooting, Trump vowed to “permanently pause” migration from all “Third World Countries,” although he did not identify any by name or define “third-world countries.”
Prior to that, officials from the Department of Homeland Security said Trump had ordered a widespread review of asylum cases approved under the administration of his predecessor, Democratic president Joe Biden and Green Cards issued to citizens of 19 countries.
Since returning to the office in January, Trump has aggressively prioritised immigration enforcement, sending federal agents to major US cities and turning away asylum seekers at the US-Mexico border.
His administration has frequently highlighted the deportation push, but until now, it has put less emphasis on efforts to reshape legal immigration.</p><small>2025-12-05 05:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/05085503d6323f6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959195/despite-stakeholders-criticism-sindh-govt-pushes-ahead-with-plan-to-detach-iccbs-from-ku' target='_blank'><strong>Despite stakeholders’ criticism, Sindh govt pushes ahead with plan to detach ICCBS from KU</strong></a><br><p>• Minister Rahu says draft bill sent to charter evaluation body for review• Inaugurates e-marking, digital examination system for Sindh boards

However, the minister told reporters that teachers, staff, donors and all other stakeholders would be taken into confidence before any step is finalised.
He was speaking at a meeting of the Inter-Board Coordination Commission (IBCC) at a local hotel to inaugurate Sindh’s new e-marking and digital examination system on Tuesday.

 

Mr Rahu said that the government is not planning to “split KU”, adding on the contrary that a draft bill has been forwarded to the said inspection committee to grant ICCBS the powers to independently award degrees.
It may be mentioned that in recent weeks, teachers’ bodies, political parties and other stakeholders have raised concerns over a government plan to detach ICCBS from KU. Teachers and other stakeholders had maintained that the move would prove harmful to the quality of research, besides hindering students’ access to the ICCBS, as the institute could become very expensive if privatised.
E-marking system launched for Sindh boards
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Rahu also said that the federal government has handed over all e-marking softwares to the Sindh government’s educational boards, marking the formal beginning of a new phase of examination digitalisation in the province.
The inauguration ceremony of the e-marking and digitalisation project was held under the IBCC. It was attended by Secretary for Universities and Educational Boards Muhammad Abbas Baloch, Faqeer Muhammad Lakho, as well as chairpersons of all educational boards across the province and representatives of federal boards.
Mr Rahu stated that annual examinations for grades IX and XI across Sindh will now be conducted through e-marking, ensuring transparency, quality, and timely results in the examination system.
He added that a system is being developed in which complete transparency will be maintained from the preparation of question papers to the conduct of examinations, making it possible to eliminate issues such as paper leaks.
He further said that under the current traditional system, there are delays in preparing results, whereas through e-marking this stage will not only become faster but also error-free. He shared that some boards in Sindh have already begun limited e-marking of certain papers.

According to Met Off­i­­ce, a shallow westerly wave is likely to affect the northern areas of the country from the night of Dec 4 to 5.
Under the influence of this weather system, mo­­stly cloudy conditions are expected, with light rain and snowfall over the mountains at isolated pla­ces in Gilgit-Baltistan, Ka­­shmir and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Dir, Chit­ral, Swat, Kohistan, Shan­gla, Battagram) today.







Cold and dry weather is likely to persist in other parts of the country.
Smoggy and foggy conditions are expected to continue in the plain areas of Punjab (Sialkot, Naro­wal, Lahore, Sheikhupura, Gujran­wala, Gujrat, Jhe­lum, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Multan, Khanewal, Lay­yah, Kot Addu and Ba­­ha­walpur) and Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa (Peshawar, Swa­bi, Mardan. Dera Ismail Khan) during night and especi­ally in the morning hours.
Regarding the possible impacts of the new weather system in the northern parts, the Pakistan Meteorological Department stated that smog and fog may affect transportation in parts of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
It added that snowfall may cause road closures and slippery conditions at Babusar and surrounding areas.
Daytime temperatures are likely to drop by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius from normal in the upper parts in the coming days.

WASHINGTON: US Pres­ident Donald Trump has indicated that the next stage of his administration’s plan for Gaza is poised to begin soon, making the declaration even as violence flared anew in the region.
Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office on Wednesday when phase two will commence, Trump avoided answering directly, saying the process is “going along well”, the Times of Israel reported.
“It’s going on very well. We have peace in the Middle East. People don’t realise it,” Yeni Safak quoted him as saying — a claim immediately challenged by the reported casualties from Israeli airstrikes.

 

The attacks followed a threat from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netan­yahu to respond after soldiers were injured in clashes with Palestinian fighters in the city of Rafah.
“Phase two is moving along. It’s going to happen pret­ty soon,” he added. Tru­mp had previously declared on October 14 that phase two “had already begun”.
According to the Middle East Monitor, during a recent phone call between the US president and Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, the former raised several issues where he wanted Netanyahu to adjust his approach, starting with allowing the second phase of the agreement intended to end the war in Gaza.
During the call, Trump asked Netanyahu: “Why they were being killed rather than allowed to surrender,” referring to Hamas fighters reportedly killed in Rafah. Netanyahu reportedly replied that they were “armed and dangerous”, so they are being eliminated.
Negotiations
Meanwhile, negotiations on the next stage of the Gaza ceasefire continue without significant progress at a moment when the truce appears particularly fragile, AFP reported on Thursday.
The first phase included a withdrawal of Israeli forces on October 10 to a line that still gave them military control of over half of Gaza, the release of all prisoners, living or dead, held by Hamas or its allies, and an increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza.
Though all living prisoners were released on October 13, one body is still said to be in Gaza.
For now, the Israeli government demands that the last hostage’s remains are returned before any talks begin on the second phase via mediating countries: United States, Egypt, Qatar and Turkiye.
Egypt will also host a conference on Gaza’s reconstruction that will focus on the territory’s humanitarian needs but no date has yet been set.
The process seems to be stuck mainly due to the Trump plan’s grey areas.
“Israel doesn’t really seem to be putting any serious thought into what the post-war phase is supposed to look like,” said Michael Milshtein, a researcher at Tel Aviv University.

The PTA believes these measures are necessary to ensure fair competition in the telecom sector, particularly given PTCL’s dominant market position.
In line with an earlier decision by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP), the PTA has also treated PTCL and its mobile arm Ufone (Pak Telecommu­nication Mobile Ltd, PTML) as separate legal entities, barring any cross-subsidy bet­ween them and requiring the maintenance of separate accounts.

 

Cross-subsidisation is the practice of using profits from one product, service or customer group to finance another that is losing money or sold at a lower price.
In an order issued on Thursday, the PTA granted merger approval for Telenor Pakistan, Telenor LDI Company (TLDI) and Orion Towers — which operates Telenor’s radio base towers — with PTCL (collectively termed the “notifying parties”).

New operator barred from exclusive deals, discriminatory pricing, cross-subsidisation

However, the newly emerged mobile operator comprising Ufone and Telenor Pakistan has been designated as “MergedCo” by the PTA.
The order has been signed by PTA Chairman Hafeezur Rehman, member finance Muhammad Naveed, and Dr Khawar Siddique Khokhar, member compliance and enforcement.
The PTA said the notifying parties and the MergedCo will be req­uired to maintain separate, detailed accounts for all business units, in line with prescribed standards.
Given PTCL’s status as the largest telecom service provider, the regulator has barred it from entering into agreements, directly or indirectly, or exclusive deals that would prevent other licensees from procuring bandwidth from PTCL to serve their own customers. All liabilities and obligations related to Telenor Pakistan, TLDI and Orion Towers will be assumed by PTCL. The notifying parties and PTML/MergedCo, individually and collectively, have also been directed not to introduce or modify brand names without prior written approval of the PTA.
PTCL and the MergedCo will not be allowed to discriminate among other telecom operators in matters relating to interconnection for local or international termination. Their pricing may not be used in a way that impedes or restricts other operators’ access to PTCL or MergedCo customers, and no preferential treatment is to be given to their affiliates or subsidiaries.
The PTA has prohibited cross-subsidisation between PTCL and MergedCo and directed both to maintain transparent pricing structures for wholesale and retail services. PTCL shall not cross-subsidise its retail or downstream services through revenues derived from upstream services, nor offer unreasonably low or predatory prices intended to foreclose competition in any market.
The order also states that the merged company will be required to participate in upcoming spectrum auctions to enhance coverage and resolve capacity issues.

LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Thursday was moved against the Punjab government’s deci­sion to lift the ban on Basant celebration thro­ugh an ordinance that revived the festival after 18 years, with strict conditions to prevent any potential loss of life.
The Judicial Activism Panel (JAP), a self-styled public interest litigation organisation, filed the petition assailing the law on multiple grounds. The petition filed through Advocate Azhar Siddique stated that the government issued the ordinance despite the provincial assembly being in session.
It expressed concern that kite flying had caused numerous deaths in the past in different cities of the province and even the Supreme Court had previously ruled against the activity. The petition feared that allowing kite flying again may lead to further loss of life while the Constitution guaranteed the safety of every citizen’s life and property.

 

It states that before any revival, it should be remembered that last year, PML-N President Mian Nawaz Sharif and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz visited the home of one Asif Ashfaq, who died due to a kite string in Faisalabad. The petition noted that the chief minister had then termed kite flying a ‘bloody sport’, expressing her sympathies with the bereaved family.
It asked the court to declare that the purported exercise of power under Article 128 of the Constitution for promulgating the impugned ordinance without any lawful or emergent circumstances was mala fide and constituted an abuse of the governor’s ordinance-making power. The petition requested the court to declare the ordinance, along with the notification permitting kite flying, null and void.
‘Safe and regulated’
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said the festival would be “completely safe, regulated, and strictly monitored”.
The iconic festival of Basant, which heralded the coming of spring and saw the skies over Punjab’s cities spring to life with thousands of colourful kites, has been revi­ved by the provincial government after an 18-year hiatus. The Punjab government imposed a full ban on kite-flying in 2007, following several deaths — especially of motorcyclists and children — due to sharp kite string.
In a statement issued here on Thursday, the minister said that Basant would no longer be a dangerous activity but a secure cultural celebration, and no one would be allowed to violate the law.
“The business of deadly, metallic, and chemically coated kite strings has been permanently eradicated from the province,” she claimed. According to the minister, the use or sale of metal or chemically coated string will result in three to five years of imprisonment and fines up to Rs2 million.
She said that violations of the Kite Flying Act by children would incur a Rs50,000 fine for the first offence and Rs100,000 for the second.
Additionally, registration has been made mandatory for those who manufacture or sell kite string, with QR-coded identification required on every roll.
Azma Bokhari explained safety measures for motorcyclists had also been tightened. She clarified that the objective of Punjab’s new traffic laws was not punishment, but the protection of every citizen’s life, home, and family. Traffic violations would lead to fines, and repeated offences may result in the auction of the vehicle.
The minister said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif had strictly banned the handcuffing of minors, ensuring that underage offenders would only be fined, not arrested. She said that legislation was also being drafted to provide legal cover for underage motorcyclists.

ISLAMABAD: Building the case on overburdening and rising debt servicing costs post-2010, the federal government on Thursday proposed mobilising additional consolidated revenues amounting to more than five per cent of GDP over the next three years (roughly Rs6.5 trillion per annum at the current exchange rate).
The suggestion came during the much-delayed inaugural meeting of the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC), which also sought legal opinion on whether provinces are bound by federal expenditure priorities.
The Centre urged the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to increase the tax-to-GDP ratio by 3 to 3.5 percentage points from around 10pc at present in three years and asked the provinces to enhance their share of revenues to 3pc of GDP — through taxes on property, agriculture income and sales tax on services — from the existing 0.28pc.
It argued that the measure was necessary to stabilise the rising fiscal deficit, which had gone up from close to 4pc to over 6.6pc now after the fiscal imbalance created since 2010 under the 7th NFC award, resulting in massive deterioration of the debt-to-GDP ratio.
The meeting, held over an official lunch in a “very good atmosphere”, was chaired by Federal Minister for Finance and Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb and was attended by the chief ministers of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (both holding the finance minister portfolio), finance ministers of Punjab and Balochistan, four provincial non-statutory NFC members, KP chief minister’s adviser Muzammil Aslam, and federal and provincial finance secretaries.







Participants told journalists outside the Ministry of Finance that there was no demand for reducing the provincial share in the divisible pool from the existing 57.5pc as being speculated, nor any discussion about more or less responsibilities, as they were subjects of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and the National Economic Council (NEC).
Fiscal requirements of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan would also be deliberated at a working-group level.
The participants decided with consensus to form seven different thematic working groups and call a second meeting of the NFC between Jan 8 and 15, depending on the reports of working groups before Jan 8.
These groups would deliberate on horizontal and vertical distribution of resources, how the provinces should advance taxation policies based on the latest experiences, impacts of debt servicing, poverty and so on.
A special working group was also agreed upon on the request of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as to the fiscal and social impact of the merger of tribal districts and how to move forward with adequate resources.

 

Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah said the meeting was held in a very good environment and all stakeholders — the Centre and the provinces — explained their fiscal positions.
“It was agreed to form six to seven working groups. They will continue their consultations to take the process forward before the next NFC meeting,” he said, adding that a joint statement would be issued by the federal finance ministry.
Mr Aslam, the KP chief minister’s adviser on finance, said the beauty of the inaugural meeting was that the Centre acknowledged the issues facing Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s merged districts (formerly Fata), and the larger provinces — Sindh and Punjab — supported KP’s cause in this regard.
He said the Sindh chief minister raised the issue of questions and discussions in certain quarters on provincial expenditures.
Mr Shah reminded that under Article 160 of the Constitution, the NFC was a forum of only revenue sharing and the provinces were not bound to follow “federal dictations” on the expenditure side, meaning that provinces were autonomous in setting their spending priorities. Their item-wise expenditure details are publicly available through respective budget documents and official websites.
Federal Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal reportedly suggested that a legal opinion might be required from the Attorney General of Pakistan for interpreting the constitutional provision and whether the provincial and federal spending priorities are in national alignment, and if a reduction or an increase in shares means absolute numbers or a percentage of the pie.
Centre’s fiscal challenges
The Centre put on the table its fiscal challenges following the 7th NFC award in 2010 and its continuation for more than 15 years, putting a squeeze on the country’s defence and development expenditure that compromised infrastructure development and social standards, as a major part of the resources went into interest payments. This financially weakened the Centre and, as a result, the provinces as well.
This could only be addressed with the best revenue efforts, both by the Centre and the provinces. All participants agreed that a strong federation could transform strong federating units and vice versa.
Earlier, Finance Minister Aurangzeb recalled the constitutional importance and collaborative spirit of the NFC process and noted the inaugural gathering reflected a shared resolve to fulfil a vital constitutional responsibility. He promised Centre’s commitment to transparent and sincere dialogue, ready to listen to the provinces and work collectively in the national interest, an official statement said.
He also commended the provinces for their cooperation in signing the National Fiscal Pact and in achieving mandatory fiscal surpluses to support Pakistan’s compliance with IMF requirements.
KP CM thanks Centre
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi was quoted as expressing gratitude to the federal government for holding the NFC meeting. “A strong federation and strong provinces will guarantee a strong and united Pakistan,” he said.







He highlighted the sacrifices of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa made in the ‘war on terror’, which he said had resurfaced again.
Mr Afridi hoped the NFC would “address the ultra vires of the 7th NFC since June 2018 and include the population and other variables of the newly merged districts in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and update the share of the province to give them due representation”.
Punjab’s Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman also emphasised the need for consensus but stressed that “consensus-building will take a lot of effort on everyone’s part”, according to the statement.
Balochistan’s Finance Minister Shoaib Nosherwani said the province would continue the path of cooperation and consensus and mentioned his province’s efforts in strengthening the federation through projects like Sui Gas, Saindak and Reko Diq.
After the meeting, KP Chief Minister Afridi told reporters that it was held in a cordial atmosphere and a decision was taken to form sub-committees for different issues, including the merged districts’ share.
“I raised the issue and said that it was unconstitutional to deprive KP of its due share. It was decided that the next meeting will be held in January,” he said.
When asked why the PTI government did not address the issue of provincial share when it was in power, he said it was because his party’s government, which came to power in 2018, was toppled in 2022.

The effort is led by Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal and Congressman Greg Casar, and includes signatures from Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, two Muslim members of the House known for their advocacy on Palestinian and other Muslim issues.
In the letter, made public on Wednesday, the lawmakers called for targeted measures, including visa bans and asset freezes on officials responsible for threatening US citizens and residents who criticise Pakistan’s military establishment, as well as their family members in Pakistan.
There was no immediate reaction from Pakistan’s Foreign Office, or the embassy in Washington.

More than 40 lawmakers write to Marco Rubio, ask for sanctions against officials involved in ‘transnational repression’

The letter emphasises the need for Washington to act against those who “weaponise state power to jail political opponents, intimidate citizens abroad, and crush democratic freedoms”, said First Pakistan Global, a rights group sympathetic to the PTI, which distributed the letter.
“In recent years, US citizens and residents who have spoken out against authoritarian abuses in Pakistan have faced threats, intimidation, and harassment — often extending to their families in Pakistan. These tactics include arbitrary detentions, coercion, and retaliatory violence, targeting diaspora individuals and their relatives,” the letter stated.
The lawmakers warned that Pakistan was experiencing a deepening authoritarian crisis: opposition leaders have been detained without charge, journalists intimidated or forced into exile, and ordinary citizens arrested for social media activity. Women, religious minorities, and ethnic communities — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate repression, they claimed.
“This authoritarian system in Pakistan is sustained through relentless repression. Opposition leaders are held without charge, denied fair trial, and kept in indefinite pretrial detention. Independent journalists are harassed, abducted, or forced into exile. Ordinary citizens are arrested for social media posts, while women, religious minorities, and marginalised ethnic groups — particularly in Balochistan — face disproportionate violence and surveillance,” the letter read.
The lawmakers cited specific cases, including that of Virginia-based investigative journalist Ahmad Noorani, whose brothers were allegedly abducted and held for over a month after his reporting on military corruption.
They also raised concerns about the 2024 elections, noting irregularities documented by independent observation reports.
The US State Department had previously expressed concern over these irregularities and called for a full investigation.
The letter urged the US administration to impose measures such as Global Magnitsky sanctions, visa bans, and asset freezes against officials credibly perpetrating systematic and transnational repression.
It also called for the release of former prime minister Imran Khan and other political prisoners. “Such steps would reinforce US commitment to human rights, protect American citizens from transnational repression, and promote regional stability,” the lawmakers wrote.
To strengthen congressional oversight, the lawmakers submitted five detailed questions to the State Department regarding sanctions, conditions for targeted measures, and steps to protect US residents from threats directed at their families abroad. The lawmakers have requested a response from Secretary Rubio by Dec 17, 2025.
Earlier this year, more than 50 lawmakers submitted another resolution in the House, named the “Pakistan Freedom and Accountability Act”. It sought legal sanctions against those responsible for “undermining democracy in Pakistan”.
That resolution, HR 5271, is in queue for voting at the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

• ‘Flouts rules himself’ by prohibiting lawmaker from participating in session for pointing out quorum                    
ISLAMABAD: In a strange ruling that left many red-faced, Senate Deputy Chairman Syedal Khan Nasir on Thursday barred criticism of ‘national heroes’ and political leadership in the House.
“You cannot speak against political heroes who suffered martyrdom, went into exile, worked for the nation and the country, conducted nuclear tests, and made [the] nuclear bomb,” he remarked just after finishing the day’s agenda of Senate amid voices of dissent from the opposition benches.
The Senate deputy chairman asserted that he could place such a bar declaring that the House would now run under the law.
“Nobody can speak against institutions, national heroes and leaders of political parties,” he added. 
When Awami National Party (ANP) chief Aimal Wali Khan asked as to who these “national heroes” were, Mr Nasir replied that they included former premiers Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir Bhutto, and Nawaz Sharif; nuclear scientist Dr A. Q. Khan; and all those who signed the 1973 Constitution.
“A handful of elements cannot hold the House hostage,” he said before abruptly adjourning the House to meet again on Friday (today).
Minutes earlier, Mr Nasir said he needed a minute to say something crucial and had assured a senator, who wanted to speak on a point of public importance, that he would be given time.
The Senate deputy chairman said maintaining dignity of the House was a shared responsibility and it was the chair’s job to run it in accordance with the rules.
He added that the chair had the power to issue a strict order for the sake of decorum of the House. “This also includes the power under Rule 246 to suspend a member obstructing proceedings of the House,” he continued.
Mr Nasir recalled that he had given a ruling to this effect on Feb 18 as well but regretted that certain members from the opposition benches were continuously disrupting proceedings of the House.
He warned that he would not refrain from taking extreme steps to smoothly run the proceedings, if the unruly conduct continued.
Without naming the PTI, the deputy chairman said he would write a letter to the parliamentary leader of the party, seeking instructions for their members to act as per law and the rules.
He expressed alarm over the practice of members gathering around the chair’s podium.
Mr Nasir stressed that the chair and its rulings must be respected.
The Senate deputy chairman, who stressed the need for running the proceedings as per the law and the rules, surprised many during the Question Hour, by punishing an opposition lawmaker for pointing out the quorum.
Prohibiting the opposition senator who had pointed out the quorum from participating in the session, Mr Nasir said: “This is my ruling”.
However, the ruling was seen by many as something against the rules provide and an established parliamentary practice.
Govt negligence
Earlier, during the Question Hour, PPP Senator Shahadat Awan regretted the delay in disbursement of postal life insurance claims to around 34,000 individuals including widows and orphans, terming it a failure on the part of the government his party was allied with.
Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan candidly conceded that it was indeed the government’s incompetence and “negligence” that disbursement under the Postal Life Insurance Company Limited (PLICL) could not be delivered to the people on time.
The minister also agreed with Mr Awan that as per the Insurance Ordinance, 2000, the PLICL was liable to pay liquidated damages for delays beyond 90 days, calculated at monthly base with a 5 per cent additional rate over the prevailing base rate.
“This escalating financial exposure underscores the immediate need for additional budgetary allocation,” the minister noted, holding the finance ministry responsible for it.

At least nine higher education institutions have placed the two countries in a “high-risk” category for student visas and have tightened their enrolment policies to protect their ability to sponsor international applicants, according to the report published on Thursday.
The move follows a surge in asylum claims lodged by international students, prompting UK ministers to warn that the study route “must not be used as a backdoor” to settlement.
Among the universities taking action, the University of Chester has suspended recruitment from Pakistan until autumn 2026, citing a “recent and unexpected rise in visa refusals”.
The University of Wolverhampton is not accepting undergraduate applications from either Pakistan or Bangladesh, while the University of East London has paused recruitment from Pakistan altogether.
Other institutions, including Sunderland, Coventry, Hertfordshire, Oxford Brookes, Glasgow Caledonian and private provider BPP University, have also halted or scaled back admissions from the two countries under what they describe as risk-mitigation measures.
The restrictions come after a regulatory overhaul that took effect in September, reducing the maximum visa refusal rate allowed for institutions sponsoring international students from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
However, refusal rates for Pakistani and Bangladeshi student visa applications stand at 18pc and 22pc respectively, far exceeding the new limit, FT reported.
Together, applicants from the two countries make up half of the 23,036 student visa refusals recorded by the Home Office in the year to September 2025.
Asylum claims from both nationalities have also risen, many involving students who first entered the UK on study or work visas.
International higher education consultant Vincenzo Raimo told FT the crackdown had created a “real dilemma” for lower-fee universities heavily dependent on overseas enrolments. Even limited numbers of problematic cases, he warned, could jeopardise compliance with the tightened thresholds.
The measures have drawn frustration from education advisers. Maryem Abbas, founder of Lahore-based Edvance Advisors, described the decisions as “heartbreaking” for genuine students whose applications were being rejected at the final stage.
She argued that weak oversight of recruitment agents had contributed to the rise in misuse of the student route, turning it into a “moneymaking business”.
Universities UK International said some institutions would need to diversify international recruitment and strengthen application checks to retain their sponsorship rights. While the new rules may prove “challenging”, it said they were essential to maintain confidence in the system.
A Home Office spokesperson told FT that the government “strongly values” international students but is tightening rules to ensure those who come to Britain are genuine and that education providers uphold their responsibilities.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/041837543a280bd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959169/govt-rules-out-meetings-for-uzma-khan-other-violators-of-prison-code' target='_blank'><strong>Govt rules out meetings for Uzma Khan, other violators of prison code</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Thursday ruled out any further meetings for Uzma Khanum and others who violated the prison code while meeting PTI founder Imran Khan.
Uzma met the party founder in prison on Tuesday after weeks of effort. The meeting took place as rumours regarding Imran’s health began circulating in local and foreign media, despite claims by the government and PTI leaders that the former prime minister was in good health.
These speculations, however, gained traction due to the government’s reluctance to let visitors, including his family members and legal team, meet Imran over the past few weeks. Uzma subsequently detailed instructions from Imran to the party regarding political and other matters.
Addressing a press conference with Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar on the entire situation, the information minister announced: “There is no room in the [prison] rules for political discussions and it was reported that political discussions occurred, so meetings are now banned for Uzma Khan. This won’t happen.”

He added that reports of incitement against the state and its officials had surfaced. “Meetings are banned for anyone who violates the rules,” Attaullah said, adding that it was not right for people to hold meetings and then go on to peddle “Indian and Afghan stances and orchestrate posts against the army and the army chief”.
The minister added that a chance was provided, and now “the meeting has been banned for whoever committed the violation.”
Attaullah said the government would tolerate no more violations and would deal with anyone who did so with an iron hand.
“There is zero room for a circus.”
The law minister also said that the prison rules for allowing meetings were the same as always and laid out specific provisions that contained restrictions on how they should be conducted.
PTI slams press conference against Imran’s family
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram lashed out at what he described as “political clowns and puppets” for their “relentless campaign” against Imran and his family.
He said the onslaught “exposes the imposed and petrified regime’s sheer desperation to divert public attention from the chronic crises the country is grappling with as a result of its myopic, shortsighted, and self-serving policies”.
The PTI spokesperson expressed his astonishment that the “Sharif courtiers and political pawns” would now “presume to distribute certificates of patriotism and nationalism”, even though, he said, they were the very ones who hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Jati Umra and attended his family’s wedding functions.
Akram emphasised that the PTI founder never hosted any Pakistani adversaries in Bani Gala, nor did he establish business links with anti-Pakistani elements. He alleged that it was only the Sharif dynasty that compromised the country and state interests for its personal and business gains, showing little regard for the nation itself.
He made it clear that the “imposed regime’s false and fabricated rhetoric” was nothing more than a “desperate attempt to divert media and public attention, as self-serving sycophants have plunged the country headlong into the whirlwinds of economic, political, social and constitutional crises”.
Akram said that “disinformation minister Atta Tarar’s press conference was completely devoid of facts, driven by panic and dripping with political vengeance,” adding that it was a reflection of the ruling circle’s “fear” and what he called “Imran Khan phobia”.
He vowed that the “daily circus of jokers” unleashed to spew venom against Imran and the PTI may pollute the political environment, but it could no longer fool a nation that was now wide awake, fully aware of the real culprits and how state power was being weaponised for revenge.
Commenting on the government’s claims of providing all facilities to Imran, the PTI spokesperson asserted that the PTI patron-in-chief was kept in arbitrary detention under death-cell conditions in solitary confinement, being denied all entitlements as per jail rules.
He also blasted the “hybrid regime” for repeatedly denying meetings between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and Imran, refusing access to personal physicians and preventing his sons from speaking with him for several months.
Akram stated that the hue and cry was a clear reflection that Imran remained a nightmare for them, so much so that they could not even sleep peacefully due to their “fear”.
He vowed that neither the nation’s leader nor the now-awakened public would allow these “fraudulently imposed rulers” to escape accountability for their crimes.
The PTI spokesperson asserted that the days of this “cabal of crooks” were numbered, and that soon the public would punish them for their “transgressions, corruption, theft of the public mandate, and tyranny”.
Akram reaffirmed that Imran and his party, together with the nation, would continue their just struggle to uphold democracy, the rule of law, constitutional supremacy and the independence of the judiciary.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637437-sindh-launches-e-marking-system-to-minimise-errors-in-examination-results' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh launches e-marking system to minimise errors in examination results</strong></a><br><p>

According to a senior intelligence officer, who spoke to Dawn on condition of anonymity, the report was an “an attempt to malign Pakistan”.
“There is not an iota of truth in it,” he stressed.
The official was referring to a claim made in the Amnesty International investigation, titled “Intellexa Leaks”, which described the story of a human rights lawyer based in Pakistan. The lawyer, according to the report, had approached Amnesty International in the summer of 2025 after receiving a suspicious link on WhatsApp from an unknown number.
Amnesty Security Lab investigated the link and identified it as a Predator attack attempt based on the technical behaviour of the infection server. Predator is a highly invasive spyware manufactured by the Israeli company Intellexa.
According to Amnesty International, the investigation was based on a combination of highly sensitive documents and other material leaked from the company, including internal company documents, sales and marketing materials, and training videos.
The months-long investigation was published in collaboration with Inside Story in Greece, Haaretz in Israel, and WAV Research Collective in Switzerland.
In 2023, Intellexa was fined by the Greek Data Protection Authority for failing to comply with its investigations into the company.
Google started sending spyware threat notifications to several hundred of its users across various countries, including Pakistan. The accounts were identified as Predator spyware targets.
How Predator works
Intellexa’s Predator relies on “1-click” attacks to infect a device, which require a malicious link to be opened in the target’s phone. The malicious link then loads a browser exploit for Chrome or Safari to gain initial access to the device and download the full spyware payload.
Once the spyware is installed, it can access encrypted instant messaging apps like Signal and WhatsApp, audio recordings, emails, device locations, screenshots and camera photos, stored passwords, contacts, and call logs. It also activates the device’s microphone.
The spyware then communicates with, and uploads surveillance data to, a Predator backend server physically located in the customer’s country.
All data from the spyware is first relayed through a chain of anonymization servers, termed the “CNC Anonymization Network” to prevent the risk of exposure for the operator with the 1-click attack link.
The surveillance company overcame the limitation of exposure by using different approaches to trigger the opening of an infection link on the target’s phone, without requiring the target to manually click the link.
Intellexa also developed a strategic infection vector, ‘Aladdin,’ which could enable silent zero-click infections of target devices anywhere in the world. The vector exploits the commercial mobile advertising ecosystem to carry out these infections.
Intellexa is a surveillance company that develops spyware, with Predator as its signature product, and sells it for use by governments. According to the investigation, the company’s internal operations remained largely unknown to researchers.</p><small>2025-12-04 18:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/04221352049af93.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959164/russias-putin-in-india-for-defence-trade-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Russia’s Putin in India for defence, trade talks</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in India on Thursday for a two-day visit aimed at deepening defence ties, as New Delhi faces heavy US pressure to stop buying oil from Moscow.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi was at the airport to welcome the Russian leader in person, greeting him on the red carpet with a hug, before riding together in the same car.

Putin, on his first visit to India since the Ukraine war, is accompanied by his Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, with possible deals on fighter jets and air defence systems expected to be discussed.
In an interview with India Today, Putin said he was “very happy” to be meeting “my friend” Modi.
“The range of our cooperation with India is huge,” he said in remarks translated by the broadcaster, citing ship and aircraft manufacturing, nuclear energy and space exploration.
The Indian premier said he was “delighted to welcome my friend, President Putin to India”.
“Looking forward to our interactions later this evening and tomorrow,” Modi said in a post on X.
He will host Putin for a private dinner on Thursday evening, followed by a summit meeting on Friday.
“India-Russia friendship is a time tested one that has greatly benefitted our people,” Modi added, posting a picture of them from inside the car.
Trade relations are expected to feature prominently as India walks a diplomatic tightrope – relying on strategic Russian oil imports while trying not to provoke US President Donald Trump during ongoing tariff negotiations.
Energy imports
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said talks to expand the supply of Russia’s advanced S-400 air defence systems had an “important place on the agenda”.
Indian media reports suggested Moscow may also offer co-production of Russia’s Su-57 fighter jets.
India is one of the world’s top arms importers, and Russia has long been a principal supplier.
But New Delhi has also sought alternative suppliers, as well as boosting domestic production – with the Russian share of India’s arms imports falling from 76 percent in 2009-13 to 36 percent in 2019-23, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
Putin’s visit comes after Trump imposed 50-percent tariffs on most Indian products in August, citing Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil – revenue Washington argues helps fund the war in Ukraine.
India, the world’s most populous nation, has become a major buyer of Russian oil, saving itself billions of dollars and providing Moscow with a much-needed export market after it was cut off from traditional buyers in Europe because of the war.
But Delhi has recently cut down on crude imports under pressure from sanctions on Russia’s top oil producers Rosneft and Lukoil.
The Indian government fears any fresh energy or defence deals with Russia could irk Trump, with possible ramifications on trade negotiations with Washington.
Peskov said Moscow wanted to “maintain and increase the volume of our bilateral business with India, without allowing anyone to interfere”.
Nandan Unnikrishnan, of the New Delhi-based think-tank Observer Research Foundation, told AFP: “There may be some reduction in energy purchases – under US pressure – but the overall direction of the ties will be maintained because both countries need each other at the strategic level.”
‘Critical moment’
A senior Indian foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was a need to address the trade imbalance “one way or the other”.
Bilateral trade reached $68.7 billion in 2024-25 – almost six times higher than the pre-pandemic levels – but Indian exports accounted for only $4.88 billion.

Delhi has been pressing Moscow for expanded market access for its key industries including pharmaceuticals, automobiles and the service sector.
Harsh V Pant, a professor of international relations at King’s College London, said the visit was an attempt by “to reset their relationship at a critical geopolitical moment for both”.
“For India, the optics is a statement of intent for strategic autonomy, and Putin, who rarely travels, is sending a message about the importance of the relationship by travelling here,” Pant told AFP.
The Indian foreign ministry official described the ties between Moscow and Delhi as the “most stable relationship in modern times”.
The official acknowledged the global geopolitical significance, but insisted that the meeting should seen in the context as “just another annual summit”.</p><small>2025-12-04 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637432-cdf-field-marshal-asim-munir-a-brief-profile' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Asim Munir — a brief profile</strong></a><br><p>

It said the Saudi Fund for Development (SFD), on behalf of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has rolled over the deposit, which was set to mature on Monday.
“The extension of the term of the deposit is a continuation of the support provided by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which will help in strengthening the foreign exchange reserves of Pakistan and contribute to the country’s economic growth and development,” the bank said.







The $3bn deposit was initially agreed upon in 2021 and rolled over in 2022, 2023 and 2024.
Last week, the SBP said its forei­­gn exchange reserves rose by a meagre $9 million to $14.560bn during the week ending Nov 21.
However, the country’s total liquid foreign reserves decreased to $19.605bn from the previous week’s $19.738bn due to a decline in commercial banks’ foreign exchange holdings, which fell from $5.186bn to $5.044bn in the latest week.
