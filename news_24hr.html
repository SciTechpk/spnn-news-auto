The US president’s special envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News on Saturday that Trump was “curious” about Iran’s resolve to resist his warnings if a deal was not reached on Tehran’s nuclear programme.
There are straightforward reasons to explain Iran’s refusal to surrender as Trump wants. But they may not make much sense to the world of pelf and plunder that the US president subscribes to like an addict. Let’s say the answer, if the so-called ‘most powerful man on the planet’ is indeed interested in one, lies in defiant deaths people throughout history have preferred to abject surrender.
One need not go too far from US shores to observe an instance in 1775 when an American patriot, for goodness sake, Patrick Henry, gave the world the slogan: “Give me liberty, or give me death.” Henry eventually succeeded in persuading Virginia to join the American war of independence against colonial Britain. Around 80 years later, Patrick Henry’s call was picked up by a host of Indian rebels against British rule and gave rise to a metaphor: 1857.
More recently, again not far from America, Trump and Witkoff should be able to understand Iran by simply reading about the life of 23-year-old American peace activist Rachel Corrie. While in Rafah on March 16, 2003, the activist-diarist joined other International Solidarity Movement volunteers in efforts to non-violently stop Israel’s demolition of Palestinian property; she was killed by an Israeli bulldozer that crushed her. The list only grows.

Trump and Witkoff should be able to understand Iran by simply reading about the life of American peace activist Rachel Corrie

The Vietnam war, the occupation of Afghanistan and the ignominious escape of the American forces from Kabul are worthy examples at par with the regime change effected in Iraq. They bear witness to the fallacy of the invincibility and problem-solving capacity of American military might. As for the current state of play underway in the Gulf — once described by Lord Curzon imperiously as a “British lake” — one would do well to revisit the circumstances and the ideological moorings that propelled the success of the 1979 Iranian revolution under Ayatollah Khomeini’s watch. The Islamic revolution was not an Islamic revolution when Iranians first began to rock the throne of the Shah of Iran.
The revolution was actually framed and led by the pro-Soviet Tudeh Party and the pro-China Mujahideen-i-Khalq, both secular radicals who saw the rural Shia populace as their mass base. It was an error of judgement they did that. Remember that Khomeini arrived in Tehran on board an Air France flight from Paris, that too after the Shah had been kicked out. A Soviet defector, meanwhile, gave away the file on Tudeh activists to London. It was duly passed on to the Shia clerics manning the upheaval.
When I met Tudeh chief Noureddin Kianouri in Tehran, he was lodged in the notorious Evan prison where he had turned into a calligraphist of religious texts. Pro-West leaders like president Abolhassan Banisadr fled to Europe, while others like foreign minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh were executed. In walked Ronald Reagan with the treasures of Contra arms package as a reward for Khomeini’s help in not releasing US hostages before the results of the 1980 presidential elections. It was thus that Iran enabled the Republican candidate to defeat Jimmy Carter whose chequered political career it abruptly ended.
Secularism or religiousness of Muslim leaders was never the West’s concern. It toppled secular regimes in Libya, Syria and Iraq and it now wants a secular autocrat to supplant the clergy as rulers. The West has backed a religious autocrat like Ziaul Haq and aligned with a secular dictator like Pervez Musharraf. It courts a religious revivalist like Narendra Modi after blackballing him when ties were flourishing with the secular Manmohan Singh. The common thread between the CIA-led coup against Iranian prime minister Mohammed Mosaddegh in 1953 and the kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro in a murderous assault on his home in Caracas are of a piece with the West’s all weather backup plan for faltering finance capitalism: colonial plunder.

 

Above all, the most important clue to answering Trump’s anxiety about Iran’s refusal to surrender to his bullying lies in the 680 AD battle of Karbala from where Shia Islam draws its main inspiration. The martyrdom of Hussein ibn Ali and his family by the forces of Yazid ibn Muawiya holds the key. Indian nationalist leader Maulana Mohammed Ali Jauhar put the equation succinctly in a verse that seems to nicely describe the leitmotif of the current rulers of Iran. “Qatl-i-Hussein asl mein marg-i-Yazid hai/ Islam zinda hota hai har Karbala ke baad.” (The killing of Hussein in fact marked Yazid’s demise/ Islam thus became the martyr’s prize.) How does Trump hope to defeat a people whose battle cry craves martyrdom? Has the CIA not translated the Persian chant on the streets of Tehran and Qom to him: “Hussein Hussein Shah-i-ma/ Shahaadat iftekhar-i-ma!” (Hussein rules my heart and soul/ martyrdom fills my spirit’s bowl!)
Years ago, in the middle of an eight year-long lacerating war in which the West backed Saddam Hussein against Khomeini, a 13-year-old Iranian boy became the hero of his nation by standing his ground (not unlike Rachel Corrie) against Iraqi troops in Khorramshahr.
Hossein Fahmideh, according to Iranian lore, saw an Iraqi tank advancing. Having run out of ammunition for his RPG, he wrapped himself in a grenade belt, jumped under the Iraqi tank, and blew it up. Upon hearing of the event, Khomeini said: “Our leader is that 13-year-old child who, with his small heart, far greater than hundreds of our tongues and pens, threw himself with a grenade under the enemy tank… .” Does that make sense to Messrs Witkoff and Trump?

For me. To bore the readers by continuing with the theme of a recent piece where the eye spied some kaalakaala in the khichri of our politics. Little ol’ me thinks the problem continues. But it’s not the same dark shadow spotted in the past; there is a new one in another corner of the dish called Punjab.

 

Punjab is not just the biggest province in the country but also the most prized. The battle for Islamabad is always waged here and chances are for Lahore to be awarded to those who are the favoured ones for the centre. And it was no different this time around where N bagged the centre and Takht-i-Lahore (while PTI won both in 2018). And as the regime consolidated its hold, it was clear the government in Punjab was the most cherished.
The kind of coverage provided to Maryam Nawaz, chief minister Punjab, on mainstream media was unmatched, in comparison to her counterparts elsewhere. In fact, at times it seemed Punjab got more coverage than the prime minister himself. And the general opinion being expressed on these platforms was that she and her team were doing an excellent job of all things governance. Perhaps, there was space to say the ‘work’ might not be winning over voters but it was rare if not impossible to say that the governance was anything but superb. That was the general tone of the reporting and the commentary and the live coverage was lengthy too.
By the time Basant rolled around, the reporting and commentary became even more ‘gushing’.

Much of the Basant goodwill has been squandered by news of an unnecessary expense.

And then came the twist. The government of Punjab bought a plane — ostensibly for the use of the chief executive, for it is said to be one of those small aircraft used by corporates around the world for travel. When exactly this purchase happened is unclear for the knowledge of this became public via social media. An account on X tweeted the news recently. Not much is known about this account but people let their imagination run wild because the name/ handle can easily be associated or assumed to be associated with a certain actor in our political sphere.
Interestingly, the tweet was far from critical; in fact, it was rather positive, commending the government for its acquisition. But the impact, predictably, was the opposite. It unleashed a storm of criticism — but this time around it wasn’t just on social media, where anonymous and troll accounts can have a go at anyone, with safety. This time around, the usually generous mainstream media took umbrage at the lavish spending by the Punjab government, criticising its decision to buy an expensive executive plane at a time when the economy is not doing well, the people are suffering hardship and there is ample evidence of malnutrition and poverty.
Since then, there have been some efforts to stop the criticism and commentary but it still continues here and there. And even more intriguing is the identity of some of the ‘critics’ — the ones who are said to be close to the ‘powerful’ ones in this country and claim to not just know what they are thinking but also communicate it to the rest of us commoners. So the assumption is that their commentary, at the moment, also reflects more than just their own views.
Second, their analysis runs along very similar lines; Maryam had earned considerable goodwill from her decision to revive Basant, and now much of that has been squandered by the news of this unnecessary expense. It is a line of argument being heard again and again. Some commentary went further to communicate that there is concern in powerful quarters about the lavish events she holds to launch projects and how this expense might attract scrutiny at some vague moment in the future. Others still linked the reported purchase of the plane to the NFC and excessive spending by the provinces in these difficult times. Some of these could be personal flourishes but the consensus is that Basant has been undone by the purchase of the plane.
A further twist is the reaction of the Punjab government. Usually, it pounces on criticism with hawk-like precision. The journalist who was picked up for tweeting a clip of Maryam Nawaz’s slip of the tongue during a speech is a case in point. Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari rarely ignores any criticism, not even in tweets; this time around she made an early appearance to explain the plane was part of the new airline that the province was going to launch. But once questions were raised about this assertion, she has gone quiet as have the rest of her colleagues. This silence, too, is hard to understand. Has the assault quietened them or is it because there is realisation that this criticism is not organic? In the latter case, governments do tend to get paralysed.
And in our conspiracy-addled brains, all of this is adding up; or shall I say our brains are feverishly trying to put together jigsaw pieces?
Indeed, this is a long-winded way of saying that, some of us who are familiar with past events wonder if this newfound ‘story’ of bad decision-making by a government and the storm of criticism is yet another sign of change in the air. This is not to say the change is dramatic enough to signal the end of this set-up or that it is clear enough as to where it is headed. But something is up; some of us think we can smell it in the air.
We have been at this crossroads far too many times in the past to not recognise the signs.

Last week, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif warned that Pakistan would target Afghanistan if the terrorist violence continued. The latest strikes reported on Sunday bear out the minister’s comments.
The state says several TTP and IS-K camps have been hit in the neighbouring country, specifically in the Nangarhar and Paktika provinces, with security sources observing that at least 80 terrorists have been killed. Commenting on the military action on Monday, the parliamentary secretary for information has said that the country’s security is non-negotiable.
For its part, the Taliban regime says it will respond in an “appropriate” manner. Afghan officials have also claimed that civilians were hit, although Pakistani authorities term these allegations “false and malicious”.
In this month alone, there have been several major terrorist attacks in Pakistan, including the bombing of an imambargah in Islamabad, which was traced to IS-K. More recent incidents include attacks in Bajaur and Bannu, which martyred several security men. These attacks were believed to be the handiwork of the banned TTP. Therefore, it appears that the state had little choice but to hit terrorist targets across the border.

 

As the information ministry noted, the regime in Kabul has failed to take any substantive action against violent actors on Afghan territory. The UN has pointed out in several reports that IS-K maintains a presence along Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan. Though the Afghan Taliban oppose the IS-K, they have done little to dislodge the terrorist group from its perches along the border. In contrast, the TTP are ideological comrades of the Kabul regime, and it should be within the Afghan Taliban’s power to control their allies and prevent them from staging cross-border attacks.
Dialogue is always preferable to armed hostilities. However, when the other side does not make any attempt whatsoever to rein in terrorism emanating from its soil, then there remains no option but to target those who spill blood again and again. In the long term, the escalation of hostilities is in the interest of neither state, and all outstanding issues — particularly that of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan — need to be resolved diplomatically.
No state believes the Taliban when they say they do not host terrorist groups; the presence of lethal terrorists on Afghan soil is internationally well-documented. Therefore, the onus is on Kabul to put enough pressure on the TTP and other hostile actors to end attacks on Afghanistan’s neighbours. Achieving this would lead to better ties between Afghanistan and these countries. Left unaddressed, the issue will create a perilous regional situation.

Ducky Bhai appeared before the court along with his wife, Aroob Jatoi, and their legal counsel.
During the proceedings, Magistrate Naeem Wattoo ordered the restoration of Ducky Bhai’s previously frozen bank accounts. He also granted him limited permission to upload videos on his YouTube channel.
However, the magistrate directed that the YouTuber must not discuss the sub-judice matter on his channel.
The magistrate observed that the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) raised objections to 27 videos uploaded on the suspect’s channel.
He said those videos should not be deleted at this stage.
A technical witness from the NCCIA appeared before the court for his testimony, however, the agency’s prosecutor was absent.
Due to the prosecutor’s absence, the magistrate adjourned the hearing till March 11.
The NCCIA had registered a case against several YouTubers and TikTokers on charges of promoting gambling apps on their social media accounts.
The agency had arrested Rehman during August last. The Lahore High Court had released him on bail on Nov 24, 2025.
After his release on bail, the YouTuber had accused the NCCIA officials of subjecting him to physical torture and humiliation during the custody.

According to a doctor of hospital, Mr Khan was brought to hospital for second dose of anti VEGF intravitreal injection on Feb 24.
“Prior to the procedure, he was examined by a board of specialists: consultant cardiologist who also performed echocardiography and ECG (result: normal) and consultant physician.”
He said Mr Khan was “clinically stable”.
“After obtaining informed consent, and under standard monitoring, precautionary measures and protocols in the operation theatre, he was injected with second dose of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF under guidance of microscopy by consultant phthalmologist, and consultant vitreo-retinal surgeon of PIMS and Al Shifa Eye Hospital.”
The procedure was performed as a day care surgery, he added.
During the course of his stay, he remained vitally stable before, during and after the procedure, and was discharged along with instructions for care, follow up advice, and the documents, he stated.

The prosecutors at the Hague-based war crimes court have charged Duterte with three counts of murder as a crime against humanity, involving dozens of victims that accusers say were only a fraction of the real death toll in his clampdown on alleged drug users and criminals.
“Duterte’s so-called war on drugs resulted in the killings of thousands of civilians and many of these victims were children,” prosecutor Mame Niang said at the opening of pre-trial hearings meant to confirm charges.

 

“Mr Duterte must be held to account and this case should be confirmed for trial,” he said. Under the ICC rules, judges will have to confirm charges before the case can move to trial. Duterte served as president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022 and was arrested and taken to The Hague last March.
According to the prosecutors, Duterte created, funded and armed death squads to target and kill alleged narcotics peddlers and users. Duterte has long insisted he instructed police to kill only in self-defence and has always defended the crackdown.



“Mr Duterte played a pivotal role in the committing of the charged crimes. His contribution was essential, as he was at the very heart of the plan to neutralise alleged criminals including through murder,” Niang said.
Opponents of Duterte gathered outside the court building, chanting “Hold Duterte accountable!” in Tagalog. “I hope, and I am quite confident, that the charges of murder and attempted murder will be confirmed” and Duterte’s guilt ultimately proven, Cristina Palabay, a worker at the human rights alliance Karapatan, said outside court. Duterte, 80, will not be present at the hearings, as his defence said he would not be able to understand proceedings due to his cognitive decline.
“For us, it’s cowardice,” said Sheerah Escudero, whose brother was killed during the war on drugs. “We know that Duterte will not be able to escape accountability.” After the hearings conclude on Friday, judges will take up to 60 days to decide if there is sufficient evidence to move the case to a trial.
‘High value targets’
Duterte faces three counts of crimes against humanity, with prosecutors alleging his involvement in at least 76 murders between 2013 and 2018. The true number of killings during his campaign in the Philippines is thought to be in the thousands, and lawyers for the victims have argued that a full trial could encourage more families to come forward.
Niang said the murders charges were “merely a fraction” of the real numbers killed.
Another prosecutor, Julian Nicholls, said: “The evidence shows… that Mr Duterte murdered thousands of his own people, Filippino men, women, and children.” Showing multiple videos of Duterte threatening to kill criminals, Nicholls said: “He repeatedly promised to kill people. He said it. He did it. That is who he is.” Duterte, who was president from 2016 to 2022, was arrested in Manila in March last year, flown to the Netherlands and has since been held at the ICC’s detention unit at Scheveningen Prison.

Now the 60-year-old, who makes a modest living selling dried seafood, is determined to return to his birthplace, having already missed the deaths of his parents and first wife in Bangladesh.
Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh finally resumed last month after a 14-year pause, reflecting a warming of ties.
Shah Alam has already started planning his trip to be reunited with remaining family.
“I will go,” he told AFP with teary eyes. “I am facing some financial issues but will certainly go with my son after Eid al-Azha,” referring to the festival expected in late May.
Shah Alam, who married again in Pakistan, still owns agricultural land and his family home in Bangladesh.
“Everything is there. I was stuck here,” he told AFP in Karachi, near the well-known Bengali market where he sells desiccated fish and prawns.
“I wanted to go back, but there was no way. The relationship [between Pakistan and Bangladesh] was not good. I had no money as well to go back home,” he said.
“Now, I want to see my elder brother and my married daughter who live in Bangladesh,” he added.
Hussain Ahmed, 20, whose family lives in Machhar Colony does not have Pakistani nationality or an identity card.
“How can I go [to Bangladesh]? I want to go there,” the fish factory worker told AFP. “Even my father doesn’t have an identity card. How can I get it then?” he added.
Most Bengalis rarely venture outside their home areas owing to fear of being interrogated by law enforcement agencies to prove their “identities” as Pakistani citizens.
Local politician Muhammad Rafiqul Hussain, who was born in Karachi, told AFP that Bengalis like him live across Pakistan and contribute to the economy like other Pakistanis.
He is one of the seven elected leaders from the Bengali community in Karachi’s municipal government.
For Hussain, the “cordial relationship” between Pakistan and Bangladesh has made a big difference for Pakistani Bengalis.
However, community activist and lawyer Hafiz Zainulabdin Shah said Bengalis living in Pakistan have lost some of their identity by adopting local languages.
But despite Pakistan-based Bengalis living “with a sense of deprivation”, Shah said “they feel content with the newly developed relationship between the two countries”.

“Any country that wants to ‘play games’ with the ridiculous supreme court decision, especially those that have ‘Ripped Off’ the US for years, and even decades, will be met with a much higher tariff, and worse, than that which they just recently agreed to,” Trump posted on social media.







However, China urged the United States to cancel the ‘unilateral’ tariffs announced by President Trump after the US Supreme Court struck down the oft-trumpted tariff measures on imports.
China’s commerce ministry said it was conducting a “comprehensive assessment” of the ruling’s impact, and called on Washington to lift the tariffs.

China urges US to cancel unilateral measures, warning that ‘there are no winners in a trade war’

“China urges the US to cancel its unilateral tariff measures on its trading partners,” the ministry said, reminding the US that there were no winners in a trade war and that “protectionism leads nowhere.”
EU plans to freeze trade deal
EU lawmakers said they would put on hold a key trade deal with the United States after the SC struck down many of President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
European Parliament negotiators will meet to formally agree to freeze plans to approve the deal agreed last year.
The parliament’s trade committee had been due to give its green light on Tuesday to remove tariffs on US industrial goods as part of the accord.

GENEVA: The United Nations Secretary General on Monday called for a renewed international security architecture in response to a rapidly shifting global order.
“We are living through a period of chaos and change…The international order that defined security relations for nearly eight decades is shifting rapidly,” said UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.
“Moving forward, we need to create a renewed international security architecture. This needs to be based on sober analysis of the international situation,” he added.
“Human rights are under a full-scale attack around the world,” he told the opening of the UN Human Rights Council’s annual session in Geneva.
“The rule of law is being outmuscled by the rule of force.” The UN secretary-general stressed that “this assault is not coming from the shadows, or by surprise. It is happening in plain sight — and often led by those who hold the greatest power”.
He did not mention specific situations, although he did voice outrage at Russia’s war in Ukraine, where he said more than 15,000 civilians had been killed in four years of violence.
“It is more than past time to end the bloodshed,” he said.
Guterres also highlighted the “blatant violations of human rights, hum­an dignity and international law in the occupied Palestinian territory”.
He charged that the trajectory in the conflict-torn territories under Israeli occupation was “stark, clear and purposeful: the two-state solution is being stripped away in broad daylight”. “The international community can­­not allow it to happen,” he insisted.
Rights attacked ‘deliberately’
In his final in-person address to the UN’s top rights body, Guterres said the worst conflict-hit areas were not the only places where rights were eroding.
“We are living in a world where mass suffering is excused away, where humans are used as bargaining chips, where international law is treated as a mere inconvenience.”
UN rights chief Volker Turk echoed the concerns.
In a “deeply worrying trend”, he warned that “domination and supre­macy are making a comeback”.
“A fierce competition for power, control and resources is playing out on the world stage at a rate and intensity unseen for the past 80 years,” he warned. “The use of force to resolve disputes between and within countries is becoming normalised.”
Turk highlighted how “the gears of global power are shifting”, calling for people to band together to protect rights and create “a strong counterbalance to the top-down, autocratic trends we see today”. Turk lambasted leaders, without naming them, who seem to believe “that they are above the law, and above the UN Charter”.
“They claim exceptional status, exc­eptional danger or exceptional moral judgement to pursue their own agenda at any cost,” he said, poi­nting to how “some weaponise their economic leverage”.

RAWALPINDI / GILGIT: The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday warned that rising temperatures might accelerate glacier melt and increase the risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in northern areas of the country.
According to the Met Office, rainfall and snowfall in northern Pakistan remained below normal during the winter season, consistent with the seasonal forecast issued by the PMD.
“Reduced precipitation and persistent clear-sky conditions have resulted in stable atmospheric patterns and significantly elevated temperatures across Gilgit-Baltistan during the first two decades (Feb 1-22) of February 2026,” it stated.
Daytime (maximum) temperatures were recorded 3-5°C above normal, while night-time (minimum) temperatures remained 1-3.5°C above the 1981-2010 climatological average.
The highest warming has been observed in Gilgit and Bunji, while Chilas and Bunji have shown notable increases in minimum temperatures, reducing overnight refreezing.

 

The sustained above-normal temperatures are accelerating snow and glacier melt, particularly at mid to lower altitudes. Reduced night-time cooling further enhances meltwater runoff into glacial lakes. Rapid melting increases water accumulation in both moraine- and glacier-dammed lakes, raising the likelihood of Glof events in downstream valleys.
Feb-April outlook
The PMD’s outlook for Febr­uary-April 2026 indicates a high probability of above-normal temperatures over northern Pakistan, including GB and Kashmir. If this warming trend persists, the risk of accelerated glacier melt and potential GLOF occurrences may increase in vulnerable areas such as Gilgit, Ghizar, Hunza, Bunji, Chilas and Astore.
The department said it would continue to closely monitor temperature trends, glacier melt conditions and hydrometeorological parameters, and issue timely advisories to relevant authorities and communities.
From Feb 1 to 22, the PMD stated that the average temperature in Astore was recorded at 4.3°C, with a minimum of 1.3°C; Bunji at 4.5°C, with a minimum of 2.6°C; Chilas at 4.1°C, with a minimum of 3.4°C; Gilgit at 4.7°C, with a minimum of 2°C; Gupis at 3.1°C, with a minimum of 1.6°C; and Skardu at 3.1°C, with a minimum of 1.8°C.
‘Changing pattern’
Experts in Gilgit-Baltistan said that over the past three years, snowfall in the region had started later, with many areas receiving less snow and temperatures remaining higher than usual. Snowfall was received in late January this year, raising concerns about flooding in the summer.
According to Gilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEPA) Director Khadim Hussain, the region’s fragile ecosystem is being disturbed by climate change and environmental degradation. He said snowfall had increasingly shifted to mid-January and February, reducing the chances of snow compacting and turning into ice on mountains and glaciers.
“Late snowfall does not compact and can melt rapidly when the summer season starts, which increases the risk of floods downstream,” he said.
Rapidly melting glaciers, Glofs and cloudburst incidents severely affected residents of GB last summer. Experts said residents of the region, particularly those living downstream of rivers and glacial lakes, faced serious threats this summer.
Locals said snowfall usually began in late November. They added that temperatures remained unusually high until the end of December.
According to the GBEPA, the average temperature in GB rose by about 0.6°C between 1987 and 2013. The region has faced a rise in flash floods, accelerated glacial melt and other climate-linked hazards in recent years.

Saifullah Abro chaired the meeting of the Sub-Committee of the Senate Standing Committee on Interior and Narcotics Control to examine the theft case. The committee expressed strong displeasure at the FBR chairman’s absence and emphasised that his presence at the next meeting is mandatory to ensure the timely conclusion of this matter of significant public importance.
The committee was informed that the confiscated consignment was seized in 2024 and that three officials — a chowkidar, a Naib Qasid, and a driver — were dismissed on the recommendations of an internal inquiry committee.
However, serious concerns were raised regarding anomalies in the inquiry report. The convener questioned the rationale for dismissing lower-grade officials, given that reports from the police and FIA indicated that the godowns’ seals, ceilings, and locks were found intact. He further questioned whether such officials could have executed the theft with such precision.
The committee also expressed concern that the exact date of the theft remains unknown. It was observed that responsibility appeared to be limited to lower-tier staff while officers in higher grades remained unaccountable.
Members showed dissatisfaction over the submission of incomplete working papers. The FIA investigation team informed the Committee that, despite repeated requests, CCTV footage, stock registers, and the internal inquiry report had not been provided. The committee expressed serious concern about the failure to provide critical case records to the FIA.
The committee also questioned the decision to shift the confiscated consignment from a CCTV-monitored godown to another facility lacking surveillance cameras.
The convenor directed FBR to provide complete documentation, including the authority responsible for ordering the transfer and the proceedings of the internal inquiry committee.
While the committee was apprised that FBR has strengthened its security mechanisms and devised comprehensive SOPs, members highlighted recent theft incidents and sought detailed records of similar cases from 2012 onwards.

ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court on Monday issued a detailed 116-page judgement on the removal of one of its judges, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, declaring that his appointment to the bench was “without lawful authority” as he did not possess a valid law degree.
An IHC division bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Muha­mmad Azam Khan held that ex-Justice Jahangiri’s foundational law degree was void ab initio, rendering his elevation to the high court a “legal nullity”.
The judgement relied heavily on original academic records produced by the University of Karachi (KU) registrar, concluding that the respondent’s academic credentials were tainted by fraud, impersonation and a deliberate attempt to circumvent a disciplinary ban.
According to the verdict, Mr Jahangiri first appe­ared in his LL.B. Part-I examination in 1988 under a fake enrolment number. He was later caught using un­f­air means and was debarred for three years thro­u­gh a university disqualification circular issued in 1989.
Instead of complying with the ban, the court held, he “chose a course of deliberate misrepresentation” and reappeared in the 1990 examinations under a different identity — “Tariq Jahangiri” — using an enrolment number originally issued to another student, Imtiaz Ahmad. He later appeared in the LL.B. Part-II examinations under his actual name but with yet another enrolment number.
Quoting the KU Controller of Examinations, the bench observed that a university issues only one enrolment number per programme and that it was “impossible” for a student to be allotted two numbers for the same degree. Consequently, the mark sheets and degree were declared invalid.
The principal of Government Islamia Law College also informed the court that Mr Jahangiri “was never admitted” to the institution — a claim the bench described as particularly damaging. Invoking the settled principle that what is void from the outset cannot be validated by subsequent administrative acts, the court declared the judge’s LL.B. degree a nullity in the eyes of law.
A key aspect of the judgement was the court’s criticism of Mr Jahangiri’s conduct during proceedings. Despite being granted repeated opportunities to submit a written reply and produce original documents, he failed to do so.
Instead, he filed applications seeking the constitution of a full court, recusal of the chief justice and adjournment sine die on the ground that related proceedings were pending before the Sindh High Court.
The bench termed these moves “dilatory tactics” and held that once prima facie documentary evidence had been produced by the petitioner, the burden shifted to the respondent to establish his lawful qualification. His failure to produce primary evidence, the court ruled, warranted an adverse inference.
Mr Jahangiri’s plea seeking recusal of Justice Dogar — on the basis that he had earlier challenged the chief justice’s transfer — was rejected.
The bench held that mere apprehension of bias was insufficient and reiterated that the constitution of benches was the sole prerogative of the chief justice.

 

It further described the attempt to exclude certain judges while implicitly favouring others as a “classic textbook manifestation of mala fide and bench-hunting”.
Addressing the question of maintainability, the IHC relied on a precedent of the Supreme Court in Malik Asad Ali v. Federation of Pakistan, holding that the constitutional bar under Article 199(5) applies to judicial acts of a judge, not to questions relating to personal qualifications.
The bench clarified that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) under Article 209 pertains to misconduct or incapacity during tenure and does not extend to determining whether an appointment itself was void from inception. “The SJC cannot cure a void appointment,” the court observed.
The appeal
The plea challenging ex-judge Jahangiri’s degree had been filed by lawyer Mian Dawood and was declared maintainable by the same division bench on Dec 9, 2025. Mr Jahangiri has already challenged both the maintainability order and subsequent proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
In his appeal, the former judge had contended that the IHC’s order declaring the petition maintainable, a Sept 16 order restraining him from performing judicial work, and what he termed the “unnecessary haste” of the division bench reflected bias, particularly on the part of the chief justice.
The appeal had stated that when the case was heard on Dec 2, 2025 and adjourned till Dec 9, no notice had been issued to him.
However, the Dec 2 ruling recorded the presence of two advocates as his counsel.
Mr Jahangiri had argued that the maintainability question — framed as one relating to “eligibility” rather than “conduct” — had been decided without issuing notice to him, thereby violating his fundamental right to due process and fair trial under Article 10-A of the Constitution.
He had contended that KU’s declaration cancelling his degree on Sept 25 had been suspended through an Oct 3, 2025 order of the Sindh High Court — a fact he alleged was not properly disclosed before the IHC.
Terming the IHC order unconstitutional and unlawful, the appeal had maintained that disputed factual questions regarding the validity of a degree could not be decided in constitutional jurisdiction and instead required a full-fledged trial involving recording of evidence before a competent court.

Pakistan carried out airstrikes on Afghanistan in a retaliatory operation late on Saturday night, targeting groups responsible for recent attacks in its territory.
The strikes were conducted in retaliation for a series of suicide attacks in Islamabad, Bajaur, and Bannu that had claimed the lives of Pakistani security personnel and civilians.
Mentioning these incidents, Chaudhry said they were “linked” to Afghanistan-based actors, adding that it was subsequently decided to give a “decisive response” to the neighbouring country.







“As a result, our Air Force carried out strikes in three Afghan provinces, Paktika, Nangarhar and Khost on February 21,” he said, adding that there were reports of  the deaths of over 100 militants who “controlled terrorist networks” in the operation.
He said the February 21 strikes were “precise” and “intelligence-based”.
The minister insisted that they only targeted terrorists’ hideouts and training camps. He dispelled what he described as “false propaganda of civilians, mosques and seminaries getting hit” during the strikes.
Chaudhry warned that if terrorist attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil continued, Pakistan reserved the right to carry out strikes in its defence.
“We are not supposed to just attend funerals. The civilian leadership and armed forces are resolute that this cannot be tolerated anymore,” he asserted.
He said, “Every drop of blood of our martyrs, be they from the security forces or civilians, will be avenged. Every corner of the country will be defended.”</p><small>2026-02-23 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23234330049a0ac.' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975228/uk-police-arrest-ex-envoy-peter-mandelson-in-epstein-case' target='_blank'><strong>UK police arrest ex-envoy Peter Mandelson in Epstein case</strong></a><br><p>London police on Monday arrested Britain’s former ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson, amid allegations over his ties to disgraced US financier Jeffrey Epstein.
“Officers have arrested a 72-year-old man on suspicion of misconduct in public office,” the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.
Images on UK television appeared to show Mandelson being driven away from his north London home accompanied by a man and a woman, after police raided his properties earlier this month.
“He was arrested at an address in Camden on Monday, 23 February and has been taken to a London police station for interview,” the Met added.
The arrest comes days after ex-prince Andrew, King Charles III’s younger brother, was arrested in a misconduct in public office probe also related to the latest release of documents related to Epstein.
Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics, is being probed over allegations that he sent sensitive documents to the late US sex offender Epstein when he was a government minister, including during the 2008 financial crash.
The ex-politician was sacked by Prime Minister Keir Starmer as envoy to Washington last year when an earlier release of documents linked to Epstein showed the extent of their friendship.
The latest Epstein files released by the United States on January 30 have resulted in the high-profile UK investigations.
Starmer has apologised to Epstein’s victims and accused Mandelson of lying about the extent of his ties to the financier during the vetting process for his appointment to Washington.
But Mandelson’s appointment has unleashed a political storm with two of Starmer’s top aides resigning over the row.
The government is to release tens of thousands of emails, messages and documents on Mandelson’s vetting procedure, which could ramp up the pressure on the prime minister and other senior ministers.
Mandelson, also a former European Union trade commissioner, stood down from parliament’s unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, earlier this month.
Officers from the Met’s specialist crime team were also deployed earlier this month to search two of his addresses, one in the western English county of Wiltshire and the other in London, according to the police.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23210449dc30531.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975221/abandon-this-dangerous-fantasy-senate-echoes-with-ppps-displeasure-over-remarks-on-creating-karachi-province' target='_blank'><strong>‘Abandon this dangerous fantasy’: Senate echoes with PPP’s displeasure over remarks on creating Karachi province</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The upper house of Parliament on Monday echoed with the PPP’s displeasure over recent statements regarding the creation of a separate Karachi province, asserting that it was an inseparable part of Sindh.
The development comes two days after the Sindh Assembly passed a resolution terming Karachi an “inseparable” part of Sindh and opposed any move that suggested otherwise. Opposing the resolution in the Sindh Assembly, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) had also declared it unconstitutional.
On Monday, PPP’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, Sherry Rehman, denounced recent statements by certain federal ministers, ostensibly a reference to MQM-P’s Mustafa Kamal and Khaliq Maqbool Siddique.
Rehman said that such reckless talk was not only unconstitutional but also a direct provocation to the unity of the federation.
“Let me be clear: the PPP is the custodian of Sindh’s unity and no one will be allowed to undermine it,” she said.
She said Sindh had always opened its arms to everyone, adding that the province’s resources had always been shared with the country since 1947.
“To hear suggestions about dividing Karachi or Sindh is deeply alarming. This is not just an attack on a province, it is an attack on Pakistan itself,” she remarked.
Rehman reminded the House that altering a province’s boundaries was a constitutional matter that required a two-thirds majority.
“Those floating these ideas should first read the Constitution. Constitutional divisions require democratic majorities, not press conferences,” she remarked.
Speaking about coalition partners, she said, “Our friends in MQM-P have always been part of the federal government. They have governed with every administration. May God grant them even more respect, but let no one confuse local political debates with a licence to redraw provincial maps.”
She also stated that Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto had said that no one would be allowed to divide Pakistanis based on language or identity.
“This party has shed blood, borne lashes, and endured imprisonment to uphold that principle,” she said. She further warned that Sindh had historically faced backdoor conspiracies.
“Let me say it plainly: the majority in Sindh belongs to the PPP. If that bothers someone, what can we do? If they want a majority, then earn it the democratic way — face the people, earn their votes, and withstand the political struggle like PPP workers have always done,” she said.
“From Shaheed Benazir Bhutto to President Asif Ali Zardari, our leadership has spent years behind bars for democracy. We have always put Pakistan before politics,” she said.
“Anyone dreaming of dividing Sindh should abandon this dangerous fantasy. We know how to resist, we know how to oppose, and we will not tolerate any assault on Pakistan’s federal unity. This behaviour is unacceptable and will never be allowed to succeed,” she maintained.
PPP Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi said that his party had always served the people without going into politics, whether or not people of any area voted for it.
He pointed out that both MQM-P and Jamaat-i-Islami each had three leaders who served as Karachi mayor.
“What had these six mayors given to Karachi? Nothing,” he said. He then said that the PPP’s mayorship of Karachi had delivered better results than MQM-P’s.
He pointed out that an education conference was held at the Governor’s House, which was also attended by Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui. However, nothing about education was discussed, he lamented.
Meanwhile, MQM-P Senator Khalida Ateeb opposed the resolution passed by the Sindh Assembly, terming it against the Constitution.
Speaking on the floor of the Senate, she said the proposal to divide Sindh into rural and urban areas was initiated by the PPP-led Sindh government. She also questioned who introduced the quota system.
She made it clear that the MQM-P never advocated for dividing Sindh but said there were calls for administrative units in all provinces across the country.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232257121f26f07.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975227/food-delivery-rider-killed-after-speeding-car-overturns-crashes-into-his-motorcycle-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Food delivery rider killed after speeding car overturns, crashes into his motorcycle in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A food delivery rider lost his life after a speeding vehicle flipped over and crashed into his stationary motorcycle in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA) area, according to police.
The video of the incident that took place on Sunday was widely shared on social media.
South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) told Dawn that the food delivery rider was on his motorcycle outside a bungalow in DHA’s phase IV when a speeding car turned over and crashed into his vehicle.
“Both the rider and the car driver were injured in the incident,” he said, adding that they were initially taken to a private hospital in the Clifton area. The rider was later taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in critical condition and died during treatment, the official said.

Shimron Hetmyer blasted 85 off 34 balls as the West Indies piled up 254-6, the second-highest total in the history of the tournament.
Zimbabwe, who stunned Australia and Sri Lanka to reach the Super Eights, got off to an awful start chasing a monumental 255.
They were reduced to 20-3 in the third over when two wickets fell to Akeal Hosein’s left-arm spin and never threatened to get close.
They were all out for 147 in 17.4 overs with Brad Evans hitting some lusty late blows before being last man out for 43 off 21 balls with five sixes.
Left-armer Gudakesh Motie was the pick of the West Indies bowlers with 4-28 as he found some sharp turn. Hosein took 3-28.
Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza won the toss and opted to bowl, then saw his bowlers flogged to all parts of the Wankhede stadium.
Only Sri Lanka, who made 260-6 against Kenya in 2007, have scored more in a T20 World Cup match.
Coming in at 17-1, the left-handed Hetmyer was given a life Zimbabwe would come to regret.
A routine catch at deep fine leg was spilled by Tashinga Musekiwa when the batsman was on nine.
Hetmyer took full advantage, racing to his fifty off 19 balls, equalling South Africa’s Aiden Markram for the fastest half-century of the tournament so far.
Hetmyer and Rovman Powell, who came in at 54-2, completed their century stand in 45 balls.
They had added 122 off 52 balls when Hetmyer became the third wicket to go down with 176 on the board in the 15th over.
Hetmyer, having been dropped for a second time on 70 by the hapless Musekiwa, this time was held in the deep by Brian Bennett having smashed seven sixes and seven fours.
Powell was out soon after for 59, off 35 balls, with four sixes.
Sherfane Rutherford took up the mantle and guided his side past 200 and then 250 as he scored 31 not out off 13 balls with two sixes.
Romario Shepherd joined in the fun by smacking 21, and Jason Holder took 13 off three balls as 38 runs were bludgeoned off the final two overs.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/232226111d1c1eb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975225/lets-sit-together-and-strengthen-charter-of-democracy-govt-invites-opposition-for-talks' target='_blank'><strong>‘Let’s sit together and strengthen Charter of Democracy’: Govt invites opposition for talks</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The government invited the opposition on Monday to hold talks and “strengthen and take forward” the Charter of Democracy — a 2006 document signed by PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif and late Benazir Bhutto, with the commitment to struggle against dictatorship.
“Let us sit together to strengthen and take forward the Charter of Democracy”, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said while addressing a Senate session in response to a speech by Opposition Leader Raja Nasir Abbas.
Sanaullah said the government was willing to hold dialogue with the opposition, which would strengthen democracy, rather than opting for confrontation and deadlock.
“We are ready to sit with you for the betterment of the country,” he asserted, maintaining that parties in the ruling coalition had stressed the need for talks even when the PTI was in power.
However, PTI founder Imran Khan was not ready to talk to politicians, he said, saying that his “stubbornness is a big hurdle” in the way of talks.
Without naming anyone but seemingly referring to the establishment, Sanaullah went on to say that the opposition wanted talks with those who did not want to talk to it.
He added that the government wanted the PTI to “become a part of Parliament by rejoining its standing committees”.
The PTI had resigned from the standing committees in September last year.
Sanaullah criticised the party on Monday for what he described as its “reluctance to become a part of the political process”.
Continuing his rebuke of the opposition, the PM’s adviser stated: “You don’t want to talk to those who desire so.” But, he added, the government was ready to move forward in a democratic manner.
He invited the opposition to collaborate on economic and democratic pacts, emphasising that negotiations were held between political parties and not “through external forces”.
On Imran’s health, he said the matter was before the court, and the government had implemented court directives regarding the PTI founder’s treatment.
“On the PTI’s request, even an eye specialist was included in the medical board that examined Imran,” he highlighted.
The incarcerated ex-prime minister’s health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
Meanwhile, the government and the opposition have also been engaged in a blame game, with the latter accusing the former of a lack of transparency on the matter, not ensuring appropriate treatment for Imran and not allowing his personal physicians to access him. The government denies these allegations.
Speaking before Sanaullah, Opposition Leader Abbas criticised the authorities in connection with a recent days-long sit-in at the Parliament House over concerns regarding Imran’s health.
He claimed that “Parliament was shut down to block the entry and exit of parliamentarians who were staging a peaceful protest”.
“Is this not an insult to Parliament?” he questioned.
Abbas said the protesters’ only demand was Imran’s medical treatment should be carried out in the presence of his personal physicians and to the satisfaction of his family.
He neither wanted a release from jail, nor his family made any such demand, Abbas said, adding that the PTI founder only sought a fair trial for himself.
Calling for the need to restore confidence on both sides, he urged the government not to transform this issue into a “full-blown crisis” and move forward.
He also gave the assurance that the opposition would “never become part of any conspiracy to topple the government at the dictation of any dictator, despite the legitimacy of the [incumbent] government being questioned”. But, he stressed, the government should address and resolve the issue of Imran’s eye ailment and treatment.
He also reiterated his demand that a parliamentary committee should be formed to meet the jailed ex-premier and examine his health conditions.
While Sanaullah was responding to Abbas’ allegation of “shutting down Parliament”, he said the opposition’s call to its workers to reach the protest venue prompted the police to “make security arrangements”.</p><small>2026-02-23 18:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23214345b45f9ec.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975223/israeli-minister-says-army-will-occupy-all-gaza-if-hamas-does-not-disarm' target='_blank'><strong>Israeli minister says army will occupy all Gaza if Hamas does not disarm</strong></a><br><p>Israeli far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said on Monday that Hamas may soon be given a deadline to lay down its weapons.
“We estimate that in the coming days, Hamas will be given an ultimatum to disarm and completely demilitarise Gaza,” Smotrich said in an interview with public broadcaster Kan.
Israel invaded the Gaza Strip in 2023, in retaliation for Hamas’s unprecedented October 7 attack.
Under the first phase of a US-sponsored ceasefire in Gaza intended to halt two years of Isreali onslaught in Gaza, the Israeli army withdrew to positions behind a so-called Yellow Line, but still controls over half of the territory.
Both Hamas and Israel accuse each other of near-daily ceasefire violations, with the health ministry in Gaza reporting 615 people killed by Israeli forces since the truce started.
The Israeli military says it has lost five of its soldiers during the same period.
If Hamas does not comply with the Israeli ultimatum to disarm, the army “will have international legitimacy and American backing to do it itself, and the IDF (military) is already preparing for this and is making plans”, said the minister, who is a member of Israel’s security cabinet charged with approving large-scale military operations.
The second ceasefire phase, which officially began last month, calls for a gradual withdrawal of the Israeli army and the disarmament of Hamas, which the militant group has vehemently opposed.
“The (Israeli military) will definitely enter and occupy Gaza if Hamas does not disarm,” Smotrich said.
Asked how the military would do this, he said, “There are two or three alternatives right now that we are examining”.
The peace plan put forward by US President Donald Trump also calls for the establishment of a 20,000-strong peacekeeping force, called the International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which several countries have committed troops.
Asked how the Israeli army would operate against Hamas when foreign soldiers were deployed on the ground, Smotrich said the latter would “pull out very quickly and allow the (Israeli military) to enter. This is coordinated with the Americans.”
“By the way, I don’t yet see them going in that fast,” he added of the ISF.
A security source in Gaza, meanwhile, said on Monday that Israeli forces shelled Beit Lahia in the north.
The source also said that Israeli tanks opened fire in the southern Gaza city of Khan Yunis, where at least two air strikes were also conducted.

He was received by Qatari Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Muhammad bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Qatar Muhammad Aamer and other diplomatic staff at King Hammad International Airport, a post by PTV News on social media platform X said.
The premier is accompanied by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and his aide, Tariq Fatemi, according to the post.
Earlier, the Foreign Office (FO) said the premier would meet the Qatari emir during the visit.
The visit is being undertaken at the invitation of Qatar’s Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, the FO said in a press release.
During his visit, PM Shehbaz will hold a bilateral meeting with Sheikh Tamim, “covering the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, including political engagement, economic collaboration, energy partnership, and people-to-people exchanges”, the FO added.
“The two sides will also explore new avenues of cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, energy, infrastructure development, and manpower export.”
The FO highlighted that both countries shared a “longstanding partnership characterised by mutual trust and close coordination at regional and international forums”.







“The visit will also provide an opportunity for both leaderships to exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest, reaffirming their resolve to work closely for peace, stability, and prosperity in the region,” the statement added.
“The visit reflects the deep-rooted fraternal ties between the two countries and underscores their shared commitment to further strengthening multifaceted cooperation,” the FO noted.
Qatar and Pakistan share strong diplomatic ties, rooted in their shared faith and values.
PM Shehbaz undertook two visits to Doha in September 2025 — one to express solidarity after Israeli attacks on the country and a second to attend a joint summit of the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
He had held meetings with the Qatari emir on both occasions, reaffirmed Pakistan’s “all-out support and solidarity” for the Gulf state.</p><small>2026-02-23 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652491-sindh-boards-told-not-to-hold-exams-during-holi-easter' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh boards told not to hold exams during Holi, Easter</strong></a><br><p>

India came into the T20 World Cup as hot favourites on home soil but were thrashed by 76 runs in the Super Eights as 80,000 fans at the massive Narendra Modi stadium were stunned into silence.
In their first chase of the tournament, India’s batting came up woefully short in the face of some disciplined South Africa bowling.
India collapsed to 111 all out in 18.5 overs in response to South Africa’s 187-7 as their 12-match win streak in the T20 World Cup came to a crashing end.
The magnitude of the defeat has left India with a desperate net run-rate of -3.8 and likely needing to win their last two Super Eight matches convincingly to make it to the semi-finals.
Anything less and India will need to rely on a combination of other results going their way.
“Very disappointed in the performance,” said Ryan ten Doeschate.
“When you set out to win a World Cup, don’t expect someone to come and deliver it to you halfway through,” the assistant coach added.
“We’ve messed up on a grand scale and now the onus is on this group of guys to turn it around and put in two solid performances.”
India are grouped with South Africa, the West Indies and Zimbabwe in Super Eights, with the top two advancing to the semi-finals.
India next face giant-killers Zimbabwe, who have already beaten Australia and Sri Lanka, on Thursday in Chennai.
South Africa play the West Indies the same day in Ahmedabad where Aiden Markram’s side could put one foot firmly in the semi-finals with another win.
‘Cloak came off’
“Obviously, with the way the group goes, you need at least four points to get through now, and it’s going to need two big performances and a big bounce back from everyone,” said Ten Doeschate.
India’s fragile batting was exposed against an in-form bowling attack led by left-arm quick Marco Jansen, who returned figures of 4-22 from 3.5 overs.
Keshav Maharaj took 3-24 with his left-arm spin.
India’s media tore into the team on Monday morning.
“The night the cloak came off,” blazed a headline in The Indian Express newspaper.
“Sloppy India reach point of no return,” said the Hindustan Times.
India’s ultra-aggressive left-handed opening pair have failed to fire, leaving a shaky middle order to pick up the pieces.
Ishan Kishan was out without scoring to Markram on Sunday, while the world’s top- ranked T20 batter Abhishek Sharma fell to Jansen for 15, his only runs of the tournament so far after three ducks.
“It’s certainly not panic stations,” said Ten Doeschate, who hinted there could be discussions about India’s batting line-up.
“If those guys (Ahbishek and Ishan) bat for six overs, the score is going to be 70-plus,” said Ten Doeschate.
“So can we get them to temper the way they’re playing and be a little bit smarter?
“Or do we just let them go on the way they are?
“Or do we bring in a right-hander at the top and make a change somewhere in the middle?”
Captain Suryakumar Yadav agreed India need to use their brains in the first six-over power play when only two fielders are allowed on the boundary.
“Chasing 180-185, you can’t win the game in the power play, but you might lose it,” he said after his side stumbled to 31-3 after six overs, which became 43-4 a few balls later and then 51-5.
“We lost too many wickets in the power play.”
The 2024 champions also have the weight of history against them. No team has ever retained the T20 World Cup and no side have ever won the trophy on home soil.</p><small>2026-02-23 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2320093981ff743.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975219/trump-renews-attack-on-us-supreme-court-vows-other-tariffs-and-licences' target='_blank'><strong>Trump renews attack on US Supreme Court, vows other tariffs and licences</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump renewed his condemnation of the Supreme Court on Monday after it ruled against his sweeping tariff programme last week, vowing to turn to other tariff powers and licences but giving no details.
“The court has also approved all other Tariffs, of which there are many, and they can all be used in a much more powerful and obnoxious way, with legal certainty, than the Tariffs as initially used,” he wrote in a social media post.







Trump said on Saturday he would raise a temporary tariff from 10 per cent to 15 pc on US imports from all countries, the maximum level allowed under the law, a day after the court ruled that Trump had exceeded his presidential authority when he imposed an array of higher tariff rates under an economic emergency law.
In his post on Monday, Trump also pointed to the potential use of licences to pressure countries, writing that “incomprehensibly, according to the ruling, (I) can’t charge them a Licence fee — BUT ALL LICENCES CHARGE FEES, why can’t the United States do so? You do a licence to get a fee! The opinion doesn’t explain that, but I know the answer!”







Wall Street futures and the dollar dropped early on Monday amid confusion over the US trade policy, while oil prices initially fell over uncertainty for global growth and fuel demand over the latest tariff hike before being steadied by news of planned US-Iran talks.
The decision and Trump’s subsequent actions are already impacting his trade deals struck over the past year, with China urging Washington to scrap tariff measures, the European Union set to freeze its agreement and India delaying planned talks.
Trump used his social media post to again lash out against the justices who ruled against him, which included two whom he had appointed during his first term in the White House.
In its ruling, authored by conservative Chief Justice John Roberts, the court reasserted its power to check the power of the president.
The president also expressed concern that the top court could rule against his administration’s bid to restrict birthright citizenship in its forthcoming decision in that case.</p><small>2026-02-23 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/231610285f09b0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975204/3-federal-constabulary-men-martyred-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-karak' target='_blank'><strong>3 Federal Constabulary men martyred in terrorist attack in KP’s Karak</strong></a><br><p>LAKKI MARWAT: Three Federal Constabulary men were martyred in a terrorist attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district on Monday, according to officials.
In a statement, Karak police spokesperson Shaukat Khan said terrorists initially carried out a quadcopter attack on the Federal Constabulary fort in the Dargah Shaheedan area.
The spokesperson said that during the initial attack, the terrorists detonated four rounds of explosives, causing injuries to four Federal Constabulary personnel. However, the Federal Constabulary personnel retaliated.
The exchange of fire went on for a long time, he added. He said that Rescue 1122 teams arrived at the site of the incident to rush the injured to a nearby hospital; however, the ambulances were ambushed by the terrorists near Ghole Banda Dam, leading to the martyrdom of three Federal Constabulary personnel.
Three Rescue 1122 officials were left injured, he said. He added that following the attack, the ambulances caught fire and were destroyed.
Karak District Police Officer Saood Khan also confirmed that three Federal Constabulary men were martyred as the ambulance carrying the injured came under attack.
Separately, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Asif Khan, in a statement, said that two of the injured rescue personnel were in critical condition.
Meanwhile, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari condemned the attack, terming it “cowardly and inhumane,” as per a statement issued by the PPP’s media cell.
“Those who opened fire on an ambulance have proven that they reject the teachings of Islam,” Bilawal was quoted as saying.
Bilawal, as per the statement, paid tribute to the martyred personnel and offered condolences to their families.
He stressed that “a Muslim cannot even think of harming an animal, let alone a human being, in the holy month of Ramazan”.







Last week, a terrorist attack, involving an explosive-laden vehicle, on a checkpost in KP’s Bajaur district martyred 11 security personnel.
On February 18, two Federal Constabulary personnel were injured when unidentified assailants attacked a checkpost in the Salgazi area of Wazir subdivision.
In November last year, in a major attack on the force, three Federal Constabulary personnel were martyred in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area.
KP has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the past year. According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
This marked an “absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82 per cent of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province”.</p><small>2026-02-23 14:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/23131658217cbfa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975194/opposition-leaders-stage-protest-outside-supreme-court-demand-immediate-scheduling-of-imrans-cases' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition leaders stage protest outside Supreme Court, demand immediate scheduling of Imran’s cases</strong></a><br><p>Members of the opposition protested outside the Supreme Court (SC) on Monday to demand that the cases of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan be immediately scheduled for hearing and that he be allowed to meet his family.
Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja participated in the protest, which ended at around 2pm.
Other leaders present included chief whip Amir Dogar, MNAs Ali Muhammad Khan and Shahid Khattak, MPA Shafiullah Jan, and Muhammad Hussain.
The protest participants also demanded that “a complete medical examination be conducted through his personal doctors”, according to a post by the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on X.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at Rawalpindi’s Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and was convicted in another case regarding state gifts recently.
His health has been garnering attention in recent days, with his family and party raising concerns since his eye ailment — right central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) — came to light in late January.
Abbas urged the government to take “confidence-building measures”, which included allowing Imran’s family and personal physicians to meet him.
“We consider these rulers Form-47 ones but any talks would still be held with them,” the Senante opposition leader said.







Speaking to reporters, the PTI secretary general said the party does not trust “any government report”, apparently referring to one submitted to SC by the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims).
“This is not a moment where we organise a movement or hold talks,” Raja said, noting the concerns of Imran’s sister Uzma Khanum regarding her brother’s life.
Raja further lamented that they were unable to meet with Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, adding that he would again attempt to meet him.
“Not just the PTI founder’s eye but his body needs a checkup,” he contended.
Ali Muhammad also demanded that Imran be taken to a hospital, adding that the ex-premier was “not asking for anything special”.
“It is through the leader’s eye that the nation sees its future,” the MNA remarked, calling for the PTI founder to be taken to Islamabad’s Shifa International Hospital as demanded by his personal doctors and family.







“With so much concerns being raised about Imran Khan’s eye issue everywhere especially at the level of apex court of the country, it’s strange the government has taken so long to take the critical decision of shifting him to hospital. It’s about time that government shouldn’t delay more,” he had said earlier on X.







Meanwhile, Khattak lamented that “our leaders’ treatment has been made into an issue of ego”.
He further said that Imran’s wife Bushra Bibi was also jailed in “political cases”. The lawmaker asserted that he and other party leaders would “again and again come here (to SC) and keep reminding” of the matter.
A video shared by the TTAP earlier in the day showed the opposition members sitting on the lawn outside the SC and talking amongst themselves.







Imran’s family and associates had been barred from visiting him for several weeks until the SC’s intervention earlier this month led to PTI lawyer Salman Safdar being allowed to visit him. Following his visit, he submitted a report to the SC, which said only 15 per cent vision was left in the PTI founder’s right eye, prompting outrage and protests from the opposition against his treatment.
The TTAP had held a sit-in at the Parliament House the previous week for the fulfillment of its demands for Imran’s treatment and examination, eventually calling it off after five days in deference to the holy month of Ramazan.</p><small>2026-02-23 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/2319353519a4146.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975150/security-forces-kill-9-terrorists-during-intelligence-based-operations-in-balochistan-kp' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 9 terrorists during intelligence-based operations in Balochistan, KP</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed nine terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to statements issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Monday.
According to the military’s media affairs wing, an IBO in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan was conducted on Monday, on the “reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Khawarij”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term that the state has designated for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban.
The ISPR said that security personnel “effectively engaged the khawarij location” during the operation, and after an intense exchange of fire, four terrorists were killed.
It added that weapons and ammunition were recovered from “Indian-sponsored killed khawarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
Earlier in the day, ISPR shared the details of the IBO in Balochistan’s Pishin in a separate statement.
It said security forces had killed five terrorists, including a suicide bomber, during that IBO on Sunday.
The military’s media wing said the terrorist tashkeel (formation) was engaged with multiple weapons. “After an intense fire exchange, suicide bomber kharji cowardly blew himself up and four other Indian sponsored khawarij were hunted down and sent to hell.”
Weapons, ammunition, and explosives were recovered from the killed terrorists during the Pishin IBO as well, said the ISPR, and added that the militants were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
Both statements by ISPR stated: “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorists found in the area. Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i -Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.“
Separately, the spokesperson for Balochistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) also confirmed the IBO in Pishin and the losses suffered by the terrorists in an earlier statement.
He said that the terrorists had “planned to attack the police lines and Cadet College Pishin”.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in their separate statements, commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Pishin, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The president said the IBO “against the Indian-backed Fitna al Khawarij reflects the nation’s resolve in the fight against terrorism”.
He said the war against terrorism will continue until the “complete eradication of this menace”.
In his statement, PM Shehbaz highlighted that the security forces were making great progress against terrorist groups “every single day with courage, determination and strength”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The premier reaffirmed that the entire nation stood with armed forces and law enforcement authorities in the war against terrorism.







Last week, on February 18, the CTD said a total of 14 suspected militants were killed in separate security operations in Quetta and Barkhan districts.
These included eight armed men killed during a security operation in Quetta’s Darakhshan area and “six terrorists were killed” during an IBO in Barkhan, according to the CTD.
A day later, ISPR said security forces had also killed four “Indian-sponsored” terrorists in an IBO in KP’s Lakki Marwat district.
The operations come as the state intensifies its counter-terrorism operations amid a tense security situation in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The ordinance was on the agenda for Monday’s session but could not be tabled due to a lack of quorum.
The amended ordinance, promulgated on Feb 17, introduces jail terms of up to 10 years and fines up to Rs10 million for the illegal possession of immovable property, while mandating that cases be decided within 30 days.
It amends the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025 — operation of which was suspended by the Lahore High Court last year — to strengthen protection for lawful owners and streamline adjudication through newly empowered district-level tribunals.
Under the ordinance, a key structural reform is the establishment of the Punjab Property Tribunal in each district, to be presided over by a serving additional sessions judge, with exclusive jurisdiction to try offences under the Act and determine questions of title.
The tribunal is required to proceed on a day-to-day basis and conclude cases within 30 days of receiving a report from the scrutiny committee, limiting adjournments to no more than seven days at a time. Under the previous law, retired sessions judges were to be appointed to the post.
Further, now the tribunals cannot take up the cases already being heard by the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), Supreme Court (SC) and the LHC.
The district scrutiny committees. headed by deputy commissioners and comprising senior police and revenue officials, will examine complaints, scrutinise records, summon relevant persons and attempt amicable settlements within 30 days before submitting their reports to the tribunal.
Any person who directly or indirectly occupies property through fraud, force, coercion, forgery, misrepresentation or other illegal means will face a minimum of five years’ imprisonment, extendable to ten years, along with heavy financial penalties.
Even attempts, abetment or facilitation of such offences will attract prison terms ranging from one to three years and fines up to Rs1m.
In a significant deterrent against misuse of the law, the tribunal has been granted powers to punish false, frivolous or vexatious complaints with imprisonment of up to five years and fines up to Rs500,000.
The tribunal may also award monetary compensation to lawful owners, not less than the officially notified value of the property, along with recovery of any profits gained through illegal occupation.
To prevent further complications during litigation, the ordinance declares that any sale, lease, gift, mortgage or other form of alienation of a disputed property after the filing of a complaint shall be null and void unless specifically permitted by the tribunal.
Appeals against final judgments will lie only before the LHC within 30 days, while interim orders will not be appealable. Bail for accused persons arrested under the ordinance may only be granted by the high court, reinforcing the exclusive authority of the tribunal system.
According to the statement of objects and reasons, the amendments are aimed at strengthening the legal framework protecting property rights, ensuring faster dispute resolution, enhancing penalties to deter illegal occupation and removing obsolete provisions to create a more coherent and effective enforcement mechanism across Punjab.</p><small>2026-02-23 14:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652472-four-india-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-di-khan-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Four India-sponsored terrorists killed in DI Khan IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The agency on Monday produced Hamza Ahmad Khan before a magistrate, who sent him to jail for 14 days on judicial remand.
On Sunday, police registered a case on kidnapping charges on the complaint of his friend. According to the first information report, Hamza went missing in the early hours of Feb 19 after leaving his residence in DHA Phase 10, according to the first information report (FIR) registered at the Defence-A police station.
On Monday, it emerged that Hamza was in NCCIA custody for allegedly making anti-state posts on social media platforms X and Instagram.
In the FIR registered against him by the NCCIA, the cybercrime agency said that during routine cyber patrols, accounts associated with Hamza were actively “disseminating misinformation and disinformation targeting the state institutions”.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn, was registered under sections 20 (offences against the dignity of a natural person), 24 (cyber stalking) and 26A (spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act.
“An initial analysis indicates that the content in question is being published intentionally and is publicly accessible. The nature of these posts is inflammatory and appears designed to incite public unrest, spread animosity, and undermine social order,” the FIR said.
It added that the propagation of such malicious content posed a “significant risk”, with the potential to cause severe reputational damage to the state of Pakistan, both domestically and internationally.
It added that during the course of inquiry, it was verified that Hamza was uploading “derogatory posts against the state functionaries and state institutions with the intention to harm the reputation of the state functionaries”.
It further added that the suspect was posting derogatory content to “defame and malign constitutional and political leadership of Pakistan, incite hatred and undermine the integrity of the state”.
“Such mischievous statements/posts render dire consequences nationally and internationally for the state of Pakistan,” the NCCIA said.</p><small>2026-02-23 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/231757279da491f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1975215/ihc-declares-chief-justice-sole-master-of-the-roster-recalls-july-2025-order-in-aafia-siddiqui-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC declares chief justice sole ‘master of the roster’, recalls July 2025 order in Aafia Siddiqui case</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A larger bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) reaffirmed in a detailed judgement on Monday that the chief justice was the sole “master of the roster”, ruling that a July 2025 order by Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan in the Aafia Siddiqui case was recalled for being issued by a forum that was not “lawfully constituted”.
Last year in July, Justice Khan had issued contempt notices to the prime minister and the entire federal cabinet over non-compliance with the court’s directions in a petition filed by Dr Fowzia Siddiqui seeking the release of her sister, Dr Aafia, from a US prison.
However, the registrar’s office did not execute the notices because the judge was not included in the duty roster approved by the chief justice. Later, the court registrar’s report had recommended that a larger bench should address questions concerning the validity of the July 21 hearing.
The central issue identified was that Justice Khan’s bench was not authorised to hear cases on July 21. The weekly roster approved by the chief justice had not assigned him any bench duties that day, and the official summer vacation roster also listed him as being on leave.
On Monday, the matter was fixed before the larger bench, comprising Justices Arbab Muhammad Tahir, Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Muhammad Azam Khan.
The judgement, authored by Justice Minhas, stated that no bench could legally exercise jurisdiction unless constituted through a roster duly approved by the chief justice.
The bench observed that Justice Khan’s leave schedule had been publicly notified in advance, and in line with that schedule, his name was excluded from the weekly roster prepared by the deputy registrar (judicial) and approved by the IHC chief justice.
Despite this, the judge held court on July 21, 2025, heard cases, and issued directions, including those for the initiation of contempt proceedings against members of the federal government, the bench noted.
It observed that under the high court rules, the constitution of benches fell within the exclusive domain of the chief justice.
Moreover, the judgement recalled that in view of institutional and constitutional implications, the matter was referred to the IHC chief justice for the constitution of a larger bench to settle questions arising from the July 21 order.
The larger bench framed three key questions for determination: whether a bench existed in law merely because judges were present or only upon approval of the roster by the chief justice; whether a judge could self-assign or assume jurisdiction in a case; and whether the chief justice is legally obliged to obtain consent of a bench before consolidating identical petitions and reallocating them for hearing.
The bench examined Articles 175(2) and 202 of the Constitution in this regard, and noted that the former stated that no court shall exercise jurisdiction except as conferred by the Constitution or by or under law.
It held that jurisdiction was “not an abstract concept” attached to a “judge personally” but “flows from the lawful constitution of a bench in accordance with prescribed rules”.
The bench explained that while judicial power was vested in the high court, but exercising this power in a particular case required its “activation” through a lawfully constituted bench under the approved roster.
Merely the physical presence of judges in a courtroom did not create a bench in the eyes of law, the judgement said, adding that a bench came into “juridical existence” only when constituted by the chief justice through an approved roster or specific order.
It referred to chapter 10 of the High Court Rules and Orders, with the judges asserting that the constitution of benches is declared to be the “exclusive concern” of the chief justice.
The deputy registrar (judicial) may prepare a draft roster, but it would acquire legal force only upon approval by the chief justice, the judgement said. It declared that no judge or committee could independently constitute a bench or allocate judicial work.
To reach its conclusions in the judgement, the larger bench also relied on the Supreme Court’s precedents, including a decision in which it was held that benches could not self-constitute, self-select cases, or self-propagate proceedings.
The larger bench observed that permitting judges to sit and assume jurisdiction outside the approved roster would “undermine institutional discipline” and effectively make each judge the master of his own roster, a situation that it deemed would be incompatible with constitutional design.
On the question of self-assignment, the bench held that a judge could not take up or retain a case unless it had been lawfully assigned through the roster.
Any such assumption of authority amounted to exercising jurisdiction “without legal conferment and renders resulting orders void”, the judgement said.
Addressing the consolidation of cases, the bench ruled that the chief justice was not required to obtain consent of individual benches before withdrawing or consolidating identical or substantially similar petitions.
Consolidation, it held, was an institutional measure aimed at preventing conflicting judgements and ensuring coherence in the court’s jurisprudence.
Concluding its findings, the larger bench held that the proceedings conducted on July 21, 2025 in the Aafia Siddiqui case were undertaken by a forum that had not been “lawfully constituted” under the approved roster.
Consequently, it declared that the July 21 order was made without jurisdiction and recalled.
The judgment emphasised that adherence to the roster system was not a matter of administrative convenience but a constitutional requirement, designed to safeguard the rule of law and maintain orderly administration of justice within the high court.</p><small>2026-02-23 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652450-opposition-wont-let-govt-collapse-if-it-improves-ties-with-jailed-imran-abbas' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition won't let govt collapse if it improves ties with jailed Imran: Abbas</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan batsman Sahibzada Farhan told reporters that England struggled to 146-9 against Sri Lanka’s spinners on Sunday.
Farhan said that England can expect more of the same from Pakistan’s spinners when they meet on the same Pallekele ground in Kandy on Tuesday night.
Pakistan desperately need a win after their first match against New Zealand was washed out.

 

A defeat would put England, who skittled Sri Lanka for 95 to win by 51 runs, through to the semi-finals with a game to spare.
Pakistan would then need to beat Sri Lanka in their final Super Eights match and hope other results go their way to reach the last four.
“What we saw in the Sri Lanka-England game was that the ball was gripping and England struggled against spin,” said the in-form opener Farhan on Monday.
“Sri Lanka have one or two spinners but we have five in all so we will give England a tough time on a pitch that looks good and will grip,” said Farhan.
Pakistan’s spinners have taken 26 wickets in the four matches so far. Their seamers have dismissed only seven batsmen.
History will be against Pakistan as they have never beaten England in the three previous Twenty20 World Cup clashes.
“We are confident and our morale is high,” said Farhan, who scored an unbeaten 100 against Namibia in Pakistan’s final group match.
“We are focused on this match to win and progress.”
Farhan, who tops the T20 World Cup run-scoring chart with 220, said he was ready for the threat of England’s express pace bowler Jofra Archer.
“Facing Archer will not be difficult because I have faced similar bowlers in Pakistan,” said Farhan. “So if he has plans against me, I also have plans against him.”
Pakistan are likely to bring in spinner Abrar Ahmed in place of seaming all-rounder Faheem Ashraf.
England may name an unchanged side for the fifth match in succession with Liam Dawson, Will Jacks, Adil Rashid and Jacob Bethell providing their spin options.
Sri Lanka and New Zealand are the two other teams in Pakistan and England’s Super Eights group. They face each other in Colombo on Wednesday.
The top two teams will qualify for the semi-finals.</p><small>2026-02-23 11:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/652425-three-fc-personnel-martyred-in-terrorist-attack-in-kps-karak-police' target='_blank'><strong>Three FC personnel martyred in terrorist attack in KP's Karak: police</strong></a><br><p>

“With respect to your first question concerning the limited strike, I think there is no limited strike,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said at a briefing in Tehran attended by an AFP journalist.
“An act of aggression would be regarded as an act of aggression. Period.
“And any state would react to an act of aggression as part of its inherent right of self-defence ferociously so that’s what we would do.”
Trump said on Friday he was considering a limited strike if Tehran did not reach a deal with the US.
“I guess I can say I am considering that,” he replied following a question from reporters.
The two countries concluded a second round of indirect talks in Switzerland on Tuesday under Omani mediation, against the backdrop of a major US military build-up in the region.

 

Further talks, confirmed by Iran and Oman but not by the US, are scheduled for Thursday.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is leading the negotiations for Iran, while the United States is represented by envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
Trump is wondering why Iran has not “capitulated” in the face of Washington’s military deployment, Witkoff said in an interview with Fox News broadcast on Sunday.
Baqaei responded on Monday by saying that Iranians had never capitulated at any point in their history.
