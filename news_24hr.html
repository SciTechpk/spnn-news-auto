Infirmities in the plan include the history of the Trump-Netanyahu axis to lure quarries with syrupy promises into death traps, as they did with Iran and Qatar. The trust deficit is thus an overarching challenge.
Suppose the hostages were released, as the plan envisages — and it is way past the time they were since their living or dying is immaterial to Netanyahu’s murderous Hannibal Doctrine. What if Israel, with Trump’s support, then launches another widely expected attack on Iran? The discourse would change, wouldn’t it? And the idea of peaceful coexistence would in all likelihood be back to square one. This has happened before. People have won Nobel Prizes by promising Arab-Israeli peace. Why must this one be different, given that Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu are the key players?
 
 

Already, components of the genocidal ruling coalition in Israel see it as their religious duty to spit on Christians whose faces they get close to. They deal more viciously with Muslims, of course, whose lands they covet and claim ownership of through a dodgy and supremacist religious edict. The festering strife suits global hegemons. A potential trigger could be a Russian and Saudi agreement to step up oil production with adverse fallout for American hydrocarbon businesses. An Israeli-Iranian shootout would cynically staunch a potential oil glut.
The flip side is that interdiction of oil flows would hand Russia a windfall. As the slaughter in Gaza showed, the region is enduring deeper ethnic polarisation. Britain mastered the use of religion and race to divide and rule, something it successfully carried out in Ireland before unleashing devastating experiments in Asia and Africa. The 1917 Balfour Declaration was timed to check the spread of Bolshevism in the Middle East. The antidote would forcibly truncate Palestine on religious grounds. Along the way, Lyndon Johnson loosened JFK’s tight leash on Israel to recraft the Zionist state as America’s unsinkable ship in the Mediterranean. The ties have never looked back.
Trump’s Gaza plan is deemed to have the approval of Saudi rulers, though they are visibly absent from the negotiations. The prospect of Riyadh turning the settler colonial state into an equitable space for all three inhabitants of old Palestine would be tantamount to a miracle. Egypt, whose military dictatorship is funded by Riyadh as a quid pro quo for keeping the lid on the Egyptian hub of the religio-nationalist Muslim Brotherhood, is representing the paymaster in the talks with a grudging Netanyahu-led Israel.
Before the events of Oct 7, 2023, Hamas was deemed a threat to Arab regimes more than to Israel. Netanyahu had reportedly aligned with Qatar to shore up hard-line Hamas as a foil to a moderate two-state-accepting Fatah.

Was the Fahd plan a sleight of hand, an illusion, or the bus the Arabs missed?

The plan was jolted when Muslim Brotherhood won the 2012 presidential elections in Egypt in the footsteps of Hamas outvoting Fatah in 2006. Both elections were cancelled by the West whose habit of dissolving uncomfortable democracies is legendary. The Anglo-American overthrow of Mohammad Mosaddegh’s elected government in 1953 in Iran reinstated the Shah as the first blow in the murky politics of oil.
Israel’s prompting later foiled a religio-nationalist victory in the oil-rich former French colony of Algeria. Secular allies of the former USSR were next. Iraq, Libya and Syria were dismantled at Israel’s behest, with Saudi Arabia playing the staging post in all cases.
Why then did the Saudis conjure a charming proposal on the Palestinian question in 1981? Was it to pre-empt the tide of mass fervour the Iranian Revolution threatened to unleash against incipiently anti-Palestinian Arab regimes?
The Saudis unveiled their plan at the 1981 Fez summit of Arab leaders. It was barely two years into the Khomeini phenomenon. The threat became more dire when the Ayatollah met Yasser Arafat at his home in Tehran and set up an elite military guard called the Quds Force named after Jerusalem, sacred to Muslims.
The Cold War was peaking as Crown Prince Fahd unveiled his proposals to the tense Fez meeting. For the first time in Arab discourse, it included the implicit recognition of Israel. Predictably, Iraq, Syria and Libya rejected Fahd’s implied two-state solution.
Remember, in 1973, Saudi Arabia was leading the Arab oil embargo against US support for Israel. Shortly thereafter, the king who led the protest was shot dead by a royal nephew. The new incumbent promptly rowed back from a future stand-off with Israel. Trump’s so-called municipal deal for a greatly abridged Palestinian homeland is rooted in the Arab rulers’ fear of Palestine. It’s a slippery slope for both sides. The Zionist press is projecting Trump as a headscarf-wearing Hamas protégé and Netanyahu as a traitor to the cause of a ‘Greater Israel’.
Was the Fahd plan a sleight of hand, an illusion, or the bus the Arabs missed? Consider the treasure on offer to decide: 1) Israel to withdraw from all Arab territory occupied in 1967, including Arab Jerusalem. 2) Israeli settlements built on Arab land after 1967 to be dismantled, including those in Arab Jerusalem. 3) A guarantee of freedom of worship for all religions in the holy places. 4) An affirmation of the right of the Palestinian Arab people to return to their homes and compensation for those who do not wish to return. 5) The West Bank and the Gaza Strip to have a transitional period under the UN’s auspices for a period not exceeding several months. 6) An independent Palestinian state should be set up with Jerusalem as its capital. 7) All states in the region should be able to live in peace in the region. 8) The UN or its member states to guarantee the carrying out of these provisions.

Justice Shakeel Ahmad, a member of the five-judge constitutional bench who dissented from the majority decision on the seniority issue of IHC judges, observed that the transfers not only posed a threat to judicial independence but also revealed procedural irregularities.
 
 

By a three-to-two majority, the Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar-led constitutional bench upheld on June 19 the transfer of three judges to the IHC from three different high courts, ruling that the move fell within the framework of the Constitution. However, the matter was remanded back to the President to promptly determine inter-se seniority among the judges based on their service records.
Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shakeel Ahmad dissented, describing the permanent transfers from the Lahore, Sindh, and Balochistan High Courts as a development that caused ripples within the judiciary, carried out through a flawed exercise of discretion under Article 200(1) and effectively rendering Article 175A redundant.

What is done once, if it is allowed, may be done again, judge observes

In his 23-page additional dissenting note, Justice Ahmad cited Lord Justice Pearce in the 1966 Liyanage case to stress the gravity of the precedent: “What is done once, if it be allowed, may be done again and in a lesser crisis and less serious circumstances.”
Justice Ahmad asserted that while constitutional provisions must prevail if clearly permitted, any such course must still be restrained through established principles of constitutional interpretation, warning that failure to do so would be a dereliction of duty. “In the larger interest of our country, in fidelity to the rule of law, and in unwavering defence of constitutionalism, it is our bounden obligation to ensure that transient convenience does not become a precedent for permanent erosion,” he stated.
Justice Ahsan’s visit
Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Ahsan from Supreme  Court of Denmark visited the apex court, as part of his official tour on an invitation of Pakistan’s apex court.
An eminent jurist with a distinguished career in constitutional and administrative law, Justice Ahsan has served in various judicial and academic roles in Denmark and is recognised for his contributions to judicial reform.
He was warmly received by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi.

Special Judge Central Shahrukh Arjumand directed the couple to appear before the court on Wednesday to record their statements under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).

Court summons Imran, wife to record their final statements tomorrow

The case pertains to the alleged retention of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set — comprising a necklace, earrings, bracelets and rings — gifted by the Saudi royal family, which the couple allegedly acquired at a nominal price, causing a substantial loss to the national exchequer.
According to the prosecution, the PTI founder retained the jewellery set, valued at approximately Rs80 million, after paying only Rs2.9m. During the proceedings, the prosecution produced 21 witnesses, including Mr Khan’s former military secretary, who made what the court described as a “damaging” revelation.
The former military secretary testified that the ex-PM had instructed him not to deposit the Bulgari set in Toshakhana and instead retained it.
A key witness, Sohaib Abbasi, admitted to undervaluing the jewellery set at Rs5m “under pressure” from Mr Khan’s former personal secretary, Inamullah Shah.

The nomination letters will be submitted to the secretariats of both houses today (Tuesday).
The decision was taken after the Peshawar High Court vacated the stay orders against disqualification of Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz, former leaders of the opposition in the lower and upper houses of parliament, respectively.
Sheikh Waqqas Akram, the party’s information secretary, told Dawn that the decision had been made on the orders of Imran Khan.

Aleema says only sisters will convey Imran’s messages

He said the letter of nomination for the opposition leader in the NA was submitted on Monday while that for the Senate slot would be submitted on Tuesday.
Asad Qaiser, the former National Assembly speaker, confirmed the decision, but added that nomination letters for both positions would be submitted on Tuesday (today).
Mr Qaiser said both Mr Achak­zai and Allama Nasir Abbas were seasoned politicians and never “compromise on principles”.
“As the country is passing through a crisis, Mr Achakzai is outspoken and is a perfect choice to speak in the lower house on behalf of the opposition.
“Imran Khan’s decision will strengthen the opposition alliance as Mr Achakzai is also head of Tehreek Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP),” he said.
In reply to another question, Asad Qaiser said the decisions were made because stay orders for both Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz were vacated by the PHC.
After the disqualification of Omer Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz, the PTI chief nominated Mr Achakzai and Azam Swati as opposition leaders in the National Assembly and the Senate, respectively, on Aug 20.
Salman Akram Raja, the PTI’s secretary general, gave his assent to the decision.
Only Imran’s sisters can share his views, says Aleema
Separately, Aleema Khan asserted on Monday that only Imran Khan’s sisters would now carry the responsibility of conveying his messages, as directed by the incarcerated PTI founding chairman himself.
Speaking outside Adiala Jail, she said Imran also warned he may soon be shifted to an unknown location and placed in solitary confinement.
Imran Khan reportedly expressed concern over a campaign targeting the family members, allegedly because his sisters shared his messages with the masses.
“He said others cannot bear the burden of his words,” Aleema said, stressing that the sisters have never interfered in party matters in 30 years and visit jail solely for him.

Some 350 trekkers had reached the small township of Qudang, while rescuers had made contact with more than 200 others still in the mountains, state broadcaster CCTV reported on Sunday. An evening news bulletin on Monday provided no further updates on the rescue operation.
The visitors were in the remote Karma valley, which leads to the eastern Kangshung face of Everest, taking advantage of an eight-day National Day holiday in China, which brought hundreds to the area this week.
“It was so wet and cold in the mountains, and hypothermia was a real risk,” said Chen Geshuang, who was part of an 18-strong trekking team that made it to Qudang.

Locals say blizzard in October is highly unusual; claim to have ‘never encountered such weather’ so suddenly during peak season

The severe weather, which began on Friday evening, was a shocking and dangerous turn for what is normally a peak trekking season.
“The weather this year is not normal. The guide said he had never encountered such weather in October. And it happened all too suddenly,” Chen said.
Chen’s party descended from the mountains on Sunday and was greeted with sweet tea by villagers after enduring a harrowing evening of heavy snowfall combined with thunder and lightning.
An earlier report by state-backed Jimu News said nearly 1,000 people had been trapped by the storm. Hu­­ndreds of local villagers and rescue teams were deployed to help clear snow blocking access to the area.
The remaining trekkers will arrive in Qudang in stages under the assistance of rescuers organised by the local government, CCTV reported.
The CCTV report did not say if local guides and support staff for the various trekking parties had all been accounted for.
Regional havoc
Snowfall in the valley, which lies at an average elevation of 4,200 metres (13,800 feet), began on Friday evening and persisted throughout Saturday.
The Karma valley, first explored by Western travellers a century ago, is a relatively pristine part of the Everest region. Unlike the peak’s arid north face, it boasts lush vegetation and untouched alpine forests, fed by meltwaters from the Kangshung glacier at the foot of the world’s highest mountain.
It was unclear if trekkers near the north face, which draws large numbers of tourists due to its easy access by paved road, had been affected by the weather.
October is typically a peak trekking season, when skies usually clear at the end of the Indian monsoon, offering clear views and stable conditions. The severe weather has caused havoc across the broader Himalayan region.  To the south of Tibet in Nepal, heavy rains triggered landslides and flash floods that have blocked roads, washed away bridges and killed at least 50 people since Friday. Thirty-seven of those people died in separate landslides in the eastern Ilam district bordering India.
A South Korean trekker died in Nepal, and his body was recovered by a rescue helicopter on Monday, said Tulsi Gurung, president of the Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. His guide was rescued.
The hiker, whose name was not released, had climbed the 6,476-metre (21,246-foot) Mera Peak on Saturday.

Markets were abuzz with shoppers, banks were swarmed by cus­­tomers, and roads in major towns, particularly Muzaffa­rab­­ad, rem­ained choked with long qu­­eues of vehicles throughout the day.
Attendance in government of­­fices — thin last week due to the unavailability of public transpo­rt and non-use of official vehicles — was reported to be near normal.
The biggest crowds, however, were witnessed at banks, which had technically remained open during the lockdown, but saw little or no activity. Government and private sector employees thro­n­g­­ed the branches to withdraw their long-delayed salaries, while pensioners stood in queues for cash.
Many ATMs were either empty or out of order, having not been replenished for days due to the uncertain situation. Ironically, fe­­­­deral minister Ahsan Iqbal, a member of the federal negotiating team, was also seen returning empty-handed last Thursday eve­ning after trying his luck at four different ATMs in the capital.
Even those using mobile banking apps faced disappointment as internet and data services had been drastically throttled during the week, disrupting electronic transactions.
 
 

“I had money in my account but no way to access it,” said Rakhshanda Maqbool, a schoolteacher, expressing frustration after finally withdrawing her salary on Monday.
With fresh cash in hand, cro­wds also poured into grocery sto­res and markets, where sales far exceeded the usual day’s turnover. Many households had run out of food supplies during the weeklong closure, while shortages of medicines and household goods had also deepened.
“Today’s footfall was extraordinary,” said Zafar Mir, owner of a local grocery chain. “People were desperate to restock after a week of uncertainty and shortages.”
Pharmacies, though technically exempt from the shutdown, had also remained largely closed. Faisal Javed, owner of a leading pharmacy in Muzaffarabad, said, “We had to call in all our staff to­­day. Many customers prefer buying medicines only from us, and they had been waiting for days.”
Educational institutions, too, regained their usual hustle and bustle, with students returning to classrooms after an unplanned break.
Meanwhile, a meeting of 16 government secretaries was held under the chairmanship of AJK Chief Secretary Khushhal Khan to review implementation of the decisions reached in the agreement between the federal ministers and the JAAC.
“We have already moved a summary for cabinet approval of the agreement,” Mr Khan told Dawn. “A reference has also been sent to the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs for ratification by the federal cabinet.”
He confirmed that all detained JKJAAC activists had been released.

Senior police officials told Dawn a group of armed men stormed into the Qazi Court building in the Maskan Kalat area, about 30 kilometres from Kharan city, at around 11:30am, while the judge was hearing cases.
They held Judge Muha­mmad Jan and other court staff hostage, ransacking records and damaging office furniture and other items on the premises.
“Armed terrorists stor­med into the court and set the courtroom and other sections of the Qazi Court on fire,” Deputy Inspector General of Police for Rak­h­shan region, Abdul Ha­yee Aamir Baloch, told Dawn.
The court building was gutted, and the attackers also destroyed the court’s records.
While fleeing after torc­hing the courtroom and other offices, the assailants kidnapped the judge at gunpoint. “The terrorists kidnapped the Qazi Court judge and also made off with two vehicles, including the judge’s official vehicle and that of a lawyer,” DIG Baloch said.
Security forces, including the Frontier Corps, rushed to the site soon after receiving information about the incident. They cordoned off the area and launched a search operation to trace those involved in the attack and the kidnapping. No group has claimed responsibility for the incident so far.

• Trump looking for swift resolution, but insiders say it may take days to iron out all the details
SHARAM EL SHEIKH / WASHINGTON: Two years since the events of Oct 7, 2023, delegations from Israel and Hamas began indirect negotiations in Egypt on Monday, which the US hopes will bring an end to the war in Gaza.
However, in a surprising turn of events, the White House on Monday appeared not to outright reject the prospect of recognising a Palestinian state in the future.
 
 

The talks between the two sides facing contentious issues, such as demands that Israel pull out of the enclave, and the disarming of Hamas.
Egyptian state TV reported that the talks had begun at the Red Sea resort of Sharm El Sheikh.
“I am told that the first phase should be completed this week, and I am asking everyone to MOVE FAST,” Trump said in a social media post.
But both sides are seeking clarifications of crucial details, including over issues that have wrecked all previous attempts to end the war and could defy any quick resolution.
Though Trump says he wants a deal quickly, an official briefed on the negotiations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he expected the round of talks kicking off on Monday would require at least a few days.
An official involved in ceasefire planning and a Palestinian source said Trump’s deadline to send all hostages back within 72 hours could be impossible to meet in the case of bodies of dead hostages, some of which would need to be located and recovered from burial sites scattered across the battlefield.
A Palestinian official close to the talks was sceptical about prospects of a breakthrough given deep mutual mistrust, saying Hamas and other Palestinian factions were worried that Israel might ditch negotiations once it recovered the hostages.
Negotiators from Hamas will seek clarity on the mechanism to achieve a swap of remaining prisoners — both alive and dead — for Palestinian prisoners held in Israel, as well as an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and a ceasefire, according to a statement put out by the Islamist group late on Sunday.
A thorny issue is likely to be the Israeli demand, echoed in Trump’s plan, that Hamas disarm, a Hamas source told Reuters. The group has insisted it will not disarm unless Israel ends its occupation and a Palestinian state is created.
White House briefing
In a surprising turn of events, the White House on Monday appeared not to outright reject recognising a Palestinian state in the future, after being asked about the matter.
“If Hamas does agree to relinquish power and give it up, cede power to this transitional technocratic government, if that does happen, would the Trump administration then recognise a Palestinian state?” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked during a press briefing on Monday.
“Look, I don’t want to get ahead of the technical talks right now… they’re extremely sensitive,” she responded.
“There’s many things to discuss. Of course, this is hopefully – we expect, and we hope – going to be one of the greatest peace deals this world has ever seen. And the Trump administration is working diligently and working very hard to get there”.

• Minister underscores limited window to support farmers; forms three task forces
• KP minister urges committee to formulate aid package proportionate to provincial NFC shares
• Punjab announces tax break for flood-hit areas, will start handing out compensation cheques to survivors from today
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: A high-powered cabinet committee on agriculture, climate change and flood emergencies on Monday put out in the open a nonchalant approach of the federal ministers and provincial governments towards flood-loss assessment ahead of a support package by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expected by the end of this month.
At the start of the first meeting of the cabinet forum, committee convener Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal was irked by the absence of federal ministers for finance, water resources, housing, climate change and power and their subordinates from the meeting.
Similarly, he also took exception to the lack of representation from Punjab and Sindh, saying he would report this non-serious attitude on such a grave issue to the prime minister.
 
 

Subsequently, the water, climate, power, and housing ministers showed up at the meeting. Sindh was apparently conspicuous by its absence, coinciding with PPP’s walkout from the National Assembly due to a political rift with the PML-N, while flood-ravaged Punjab was represented by a special secretary.
Balochistan’s minister for agriculture was present along with KP’s ministers for agriculture and finance, whose preparedness and contribution were appreciated by Mr Iqbal.
The planning minister deplored that the Rabi season was now starting that offered a window of no more than two weeks for the government to support the flood-affected farmers and lead them towards a new crop with greater financial value. Instead, he suggested the use of canola, priced around $700 per tonne in the international market, compared to $250-300 per tonne for wheat.
KP’s agriculture minister reported that his province was already at the cusp of an olive revolution with the plantation over around 700,000 acres, potentially sufficient to meet all of Pakistan’s requirement within a period of 3-4 years.
The province had also been fortunate to have successful plantation of saffron to follow soon. In the short term, he reported, the KP government was providing free seeds and fertilisers from its own resources and was in touch with the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank for a comprehensive support package for rain- and flood-affected people.
 
 

KP’s Finance Minister Muzammil Aslam proposed that the PM’s package for flood-affected people should not be Punjab and Sindh centric in the name and cost of smaller provinces.
He demanded that it should be proportionate to provincial National Finance Commission (NFC) shares so that gas subsidy for fertilisers was not consumed only in Punjab or for political reasons in Sindh, given the fact that KP ultimately also faced the difficult situation from a ban on the wheat trade. The sources said the planning minister acknowledged that KP’s stance over the past 18 months at all national forums had been from a national perspective and above provincial and political angles.
Mr Iqbal was unhappy to know that despite flood devastations, the Ministry of National Food Security and the provinces had poor coordination over flood losses and both sides were waiting for each other. “We do not have unlimited time to waste while the opportunity is slipping through,” he was quoted as saying.
A representative of the Punjab government reported that the chief minister had been informed about the loss of crops planted on 2500,000 acres and the CM had set a target of wheat sowing over 16.5 million acres, up from 16.25m acres last year. Mr Iqbal hoped this target was also backed by an implementable plan.
The minister assured the provinces that a cabinet committee at the federal level had been constituted by the prime minister for a joint and coordinated plan and did not mean any federal intrusion. At the planning division, “we are here to provide you all a helping hand” for a better response.
Task forces formed
He also formed three dedicated task forces in consultation with the federal ministries concerned and the provincial governments. These task forces will prepare detailed reports within 15 days covering immediate agricultural relief and provision of seeds, climate change impacts and resilience strategies, and strengthening infrastructure to make it climate-resilient in the long term. These reports will be presented to the PM for final consideration.
 
 

He said providing short-term, medium-term, and long-term relief to farmers was the government’s foremost priority. “Provincial governments, in partnership with the federal government, must take swift steps to ensure that affected farmers are compensated and supported for the upcoming Rabi season,” he said, underlining the urgency of supplying canola seeds to farmers within the next 15 days, taking advantage of the soil moisture left behind by the floods. “I have arranged a 5,000-acre canola seed pilot project in Narowal through corporate sponsorship, because we cannot afford to lose time. This is a moment for urgent action—we must not waste it,” he said.
He also indicated the importance of extending interest-free loan schemes to the farmers through financial institutions and to gradually moving towards private insurance mechanisms to protect them from recurrent climate shocks.
It may be noted that the PM had constituted the committee last month to formulate, in collaboration with provincial governments, an agricultural support package to provide immediate relief to farmers affected by the recent floods.
Tax exemption for Punjab
Separately, the Punjab government announced tax exemptions for flood-hit areas, initiating compensation from Oct 7. The Punjab cabinet meeting presided over by Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz approved a 171-point agenda, endorsing a series of initiatives mainly focused on flood rehabilitation.
“The distribution of compensation cheques among flood-affected families will begin from October 7,” the CM said. Compensation for damaged houses, livestock losses, and crop destruction was also approved, along with waivers on ‘Aabiana’ and agricultural income tax in 2,855 flood-affected villages in the province.
The cabinet approved the flood relief package under which Rs1 million would be given to the family of a deceased while Rs500,00 and Rs300,000 would be paid to a person with permanent and partial disability, respectively.
“The family of a fully damaged concrete house will get Rs1 million in compensation, while partially damaged concrete house will have Rs300,000. The family of fully damaged mud house will be paid Rs500,000 while Rs150,000 for a partially damaged mud house.”

• Leaders stress need to shed dependency on ‘one country, one system’
• Several accords signed; Kuala Lumpur offers more collaboration in defence, cybersecurity, tourism
PUTRAJAYA: The leaders of Pakistan and Malaysia resolved on Monday to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc.
The resolve came during the course of several meetings betw­een Prime Minister She­hbaz Sharif and his Malaysian counterpart Anwar Ibrahim. The former is currently on a three-day official visit to Malaysia, where he spent a productive Monday, snapping up six accords and several trade and bilateral agreements.
His host, Malaysian PM Ibrahim, pointed out that relations between their countries, though long-standing, had become “somewhat stagnated” and need a renewed, practical approach anchored in clear policies, The Star Malaysia reported.
Speaking at the Pakistan-Malaysia Business and Investment Conference, he said the two countries should “work on existing partners, but to open up new avenues, and Pakistan is one of the countries that we look forward to [working with]”.
Anwar noted that Malaysia and Pakistan share deep cultural, educational and intellectual connections, but stressed that modern cooperation must also be grounded in economic pragmatism.
“We have traditional relations in trade and partnership. We have realised that dependency on one country, one system, will be futile. We need, therefore, to expand trade relations. That is why we will work for a strong, formidable Asean in terms of trade, in terms of investments,” The Star Malaysia quoted PM Ibrahim as saying.
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, PM Shehbaz congratulated his Malaysian counterpart on Malaysia becoming the chair of Asean, and thanked PM Ibrahim for reaffirming Malaysia’s support for Pakistan’s bid to become a Full Dialogue Partner of Asean.
Both leaders also agreed to remain in close consultation to follow up on the important decisions taken to enhance bilateral cooperation between both sides, as well as to keep each other informed of their perspectives on major international affairs.
Both leaders also held detailed discussions on major regional and international developments, including the situation in the Middle East.
The Malaysian prime minister also praised Pakistan’s constructive role in the ongoing peace efforts in Palestine, including US President Donald Trump’s recent initiative for Gaza.
Meanwhile, both countries also agreed to further strengthen cooperation in defence, aviation, public health and cybersecurity as part of ongoing efforts to deepen bilateral ties.
In a joint statement issued following their bilateral meeting, both prime ministers expressed satisfaction with the strong and ongoing defence collaboration under the Joint Committee on Defence Cooperation (JCDC) established in 1997, The Star Malaysia reported.
“Cooperation between the two countries has been tremendously strengthened through high-level visits, regular bilateral meetings at ministerial and military levels, military-to-military engagements and defence industry linkages.
“Both sides also agreed to further deepen bilateral defence cooperation particularly in the fields of defence science, technology and industry, through knowledge and technology transfer,” the statement read.
Recognising the importance of aviation in fostering greater connectivity and promoting people-to-people exchanges, both leaders agreed to enhance air travel services and explore opportunities for increased connectivity between Malaysia and Pakistan.
“Efforts will focus on increasing air traffic rights to enable the expansion of flight routes and facilitating the growth of air travel, thereby strengthening economic, business and tourism ties between the two nations,” the statement read.
Anwar and Shehbaz also agreed to explore collaboration in healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical devices with the aim of enhancing public health and commercial exchanges in these sectors.
Both leaders underscored the critical importance of regional cooperation in disaster management and risk reduction, and committed to enhancing the exchange of knowledge and best practices in humanitarian assistance, emergency response and post-disaster recovery and reconstruction. The leaders also expressed their commitment to enhancing cooperation in cybersecurity and efforts in combating trans-national organised crimes, terrorism, terror financing as well as cybercrime.
“They agreed to continue exchanging information and expertise to address emerging security challenges,” the statement stated.
MoUs signed
Officials from Pakistan and Malaysia also exchanged a number of pre-signed accords in different sectors.
An MoU on Exchange of Notes was signed between the Institute of Diplomacy and Foreign Relations (IDFR) and the Foreign Service Academy of Pakistan on cooperation in the field of training for diplomats.
Another agreement was signed on cooperation in the field of higher education, with the documents being exchanged by Pakistan National Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain and Malaysia’s Higher Education Minister Dr Zambry Abd Kadir.
Minister of Tourism of Malaysia Tiong King Sing and Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar exchanged the documents of an MoU between the two governments for cooperation in the field of tourism.
Meanwhile, both countries also inked an MoU to expand cooperation in combating and preventing corruption. The documents were exchanged by Chief Commissioner of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission Azam Bin Baki and National Accountability Deputy Chairman Bureau Sohail Nasir.

Informed sources told Dawn that the Prime Minister Office (PMO) reached out on Sunday night to federal officers posted at the provincial capitals to use their good offices in streamlining the progress on pending matters and upcoming targets in line with commitments to the IMF, not only under the EFF but also the climate-related $1.4bn Resilience and Sustainability Facility. Similar instructions were also issued to key federal ministries.
The provincial chief secretaries and finance secretaries were directed to submit an update on their implementation status within 24 hours and to provide clear justifications for any unmet targets or delays. Informed sources said the Ministry of Finance had reported to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) that the governments of the larger provinces were not as forthcoming in cooperating on matters related to IMF commitments.
While the provincial governments — particularly Sindh and Punjab — had missed their targets for providing cash surpluses in line with commitments for the period ending June 30, they have also shown signs of lapses in the current fiscal year. Sindh has already announced a budget with a deficit of around Rs40bn. At the same time, Punjab has expressed discomfort with the stringent conditions, citing concerns over self-respect, even in the context of flood-related assistance.

Backlogs risk derailing review ahead of crucial weekend deadline

The PMO has also requested that the provincial bureaucracy share its updated reports with the Ministry of Finance. Informed sources said the IMF had already directed the authorities to put on hold disbursements for development schemes in flood-hit areas until clear need and loss estimates were available. The fund also expects the federal and provincial authorities to remain fiscally prudent.
The IMF has remained firm that flood support would be unacceptable at the cost of cash surpluses committed under the national fiscal pact, one of the key themes of the ongoing programme to ensure primary budget surplus targets. For FY26, Punjab is required to provide Rs740bn cash surplus to the Centre, followed by Rs370bn by Sindh, Rs220bn from KP and Rs185bn from Balochistan.
This comes amid discussions between the IMF and the federal authorities over revisions in macroeconomic indicators to account for flood-related losses. This may involve a downward official revision of the economic growth projection to around 3.5pc from 4.2pc in the budget, and higher than the anticipated inflation, now exceeding 8pc, compared to the budgeted 7pc. That would involve cascading impact on many other sectors, including revenue collection, imports and exports, besides fiscal and current account targets.
Under the national financial pact, the provinces had amended their agricultural income tax regimes to align with federal income tax rules but they appeared unwilling or unprepared, or both, to ensure effective collections by the Sept 30 deadline linked to the end-October structural benchmark.
The provinces were also required to transition the goods and services tax (GST) on services to a negative list, effective FY26, and on moving to a capital-based property tax.
There are several reform measures committed to under the RSF, which involve greater responsibilities for provinces, requiring considerable preparation and homework, although their deadlines have yet to be met. These initiatives pertain to improving water system resilience and disaster response, financing water charges, and enhancing transparency through digitised records, particularly in Sindh and Punjab.
All the provinces had given an undertaking to the IMF that they would not introduce any policy or action that could be considered to undermine or run counter to any of the commitments or policies outlined in Pakistan’s sovereign agreement, as outlined in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.
The Centre had committed that “provinces agree to consult with the IMF through the federal Ministry of Finance before modifying or adopting any measures that could affect or undercut the program specified in the MEFP or which deviates from the goals of the programme”.

Malik and Justice Aqeel Abbasi, was released on Monday, highlighting divisions within the bench over last year’s dismissal of government appeals.
In June 2024, the Supreme Court of Pakistan declared Imran Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) eligible for seats reserved for women and minorities, dealing a major setback to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s ruling coalition. The verdict was announced by a 13-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa.
Following the verdict, the PPP, PML-N and the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) filed review petitions, which were later rejected. Justice Abbasi and Justice Malik then released a dissent.
The dissenting note stated that all three review petitions were filed against the brief verdict issued on July 9, 2024, and only the ECP submitted additional petitions based on the detailed verdict dated September 23, 2024.
“All arguments raised by the petitioners had already been addressed in the detailed verdict issued on September 23, 2024.“
The note asserted that all arguments were already addressed in the detailed verdict. It further added that lawyers attempted to reopen the case through fresh arguments; however, the scope of review is limited and a new case can not be initiated.
“Through these reviews, lawyers merely attempted to re-argue the case, which is outside the scope of a review jurisdiction.”
It stated that only those judgments are subject to review where a clear legal error exists and minor irregularities or differences of opinion cannot be grounds for review.
The dissenting note further stated that the judgments of the apex court are final and delivered after thorough consideration and also emphasised that a review is not like an appeal and can’t become routine procedure.
“Turning reviews into routine proceedings would disrupt the balance of the justice system.”
It elaborated that the coalition partners, the PML-N and the PPP did not raise any specific objections to the detailed decision, and both parties only challenged the short order. The petitions were filed on July 13, 2024, whereas the detailed verdict came out on September 23, 2024, the note highlighted.
“Despite the long gap between the short and detailed verdicts, no new legal arguments were presented.,“ concluded the dissenting note.
Reserved seats case
Through its March 25, 2024 order, the Peshawar High Court (PHC) had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) — the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024, polls — of reserved seats.
In a 4-1 verdict, the electoral watchdog ruled that the SIC was not entitled to claim quota for reserved seats “due to having non-curable legal defects and violation of a mandatory provision of submission of party list for reserved seats, which is the requirement of law”.
The SIC — joined by PTI-backed independents who won the elections sans their electoral symbol — had filed the petition through its chairman, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, seeking directives of the court for the ECP to allocate reserved seats to the council based on their strength in the national and provincial assemblies.
The commission had also decided to distribute the seats among other parliamentary parties, with the PML-N and the PPP becoming major beneficiaries. The decision was challenged by the PTI in the top court.
On July 13, the apex court, in a unique majority verdict, declared the PTI eligible to receive reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the national and provincial assemblies, giving it a new lease of life in the legislature by declaring it to be a parliamentary party.
However, the ruling was not implemented by the National Assembly, while the ECP had raised some objections. The review petitions against the SC order had been filed by the PML-N, the PPP and the ECP.
On the date of the first hearing of this case, Justices Ayesha A. Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had rejected outright the review petitions filed by the PML-N, ECP and PPP.
Subsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of the Constitutional Bench, even though they were considered part of the bench.
Meanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail had partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.
In his July 12 dissenting order, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.
The July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgment.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.
However, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all 80 returned candidates, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.</p><small>2025-10-06 19:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/062235013093452.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947043/sindh-cabinet-approves-waiver-of-death-certificate-fee' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh cabinet approves waiver of death certificate fee</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh cabinet on Monday approved the waiver of the death certificate registration fee for the general public across the province at the municipal, union council and town committee levels.
The decision was taken in a provincial cabinet presided over by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah at the CM House.
A press release issued today said that under the new arrangement, the Sindh government will bear the cost of the National Database & Registration Authority service charges, ensuring that citizens can obtain death certificates free of cost.
“This step aims to facilitate citizens, promote digital registration of vital events under the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013, and strengthen the province’s CRVS (Civil Registration and Vital Statistics) system,” the press release said.
It added that the decision followed the cabinet’s approval of free birth registration in September 2024 in line with the Sindh government’s commitment to the United Nations and international partners for improving CRVS coverage.
In other important measures, the cabinet also approved important amendments to the Sindh Letters of Administration and Succession Certificates Act and Rules, 2021, to streamline the issuance of inheritance documents, remove procedural gaps, especially for minor and mentally disabled heirs, and make the process more transparent and efficient.
“Major changes include deletion of the clause treating the presence of a minor as a legal controversy. Applications may be filed by heirs or their power of attorney with the required documents. Certificates for minor or mentally disabled heirs will take effect only after a guardianship certificate is issued under the Guardian and Wards Act, 1890. False declarations will be punishable under Section 198 of the Pakistan Penal Code,” the press release said.
CM Shah said the above reforms would make the system more “accessible, transparent, and people-friendly”, protecting the rights of all legal heirs.
Surrender policy for riverine bandits:  The provincial cabinet also approved the Surrender Policy for Dacoits in the Katcha Areas of Sukkur and Larkana Divisions, aimed at consolidating peace, upholding the writ of the state and promoting socio-economic development in the riverine belt.
The cabinet members and meeting participants were informed that many dacoits had expressed willingness to surrender voluntarily following successful security operations and extensive negotiations with local communities.
The press release said the policy established a “transparent and humane mechanism for surrender under the due process of law”.
It explained that the main features of the policy included mandatory disarmament, protection of families, rehabilitation and livelihood support, and access to education, healthcare, and vocational training. It added that the government would also revive schools, health, veterinary and development projects in the riverine areas to sustain peace and stability.
CM Shah directed the Sindh Home Department to ensure transparent implementation of the policy through Monitoring and Implementation Committees, and to carry out public awareness campaigns promoting surrender as a “path to peace and reintegration”.
Wheat Release Policy 2025–26: The cabinet further approved the release of 1.265 million metric tonnes of wheat to flour mills and chakkies at Rs9,500 per 100 kilogramme bags to stabilise wheat flour prices and ensure financial discipline.
The press release added that phased releases would begin this month with an emphasis on transparency and market stability, adding that the policy was designed to achieve two objectives: to stabilise the prices of wheat flour and provide relief to the public, and to ensure financial discipline by using wheat sale proceeds to repay bank loans and reduce liabilities.
“The chief minister emphasised the need for transparent implementation to ensure benefits reach the public and prevent market manipulation,” the press release said.
Ban on operation of tyre burning plants: Among other decisions, the Sindh Cabinet also approved the complete ban on the operation of tyre pyrolysis plants across the province to curb severe air pollution and protect public health with firms involved in the business asked to close their operations within a month.
The decision, taken on the recommendation of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency, followed reports linking pyrolysis activities to the release of toxic pollutants and hazardous emissions contributing to Karachi’s deteriorating air quality, the press release said.
It added that the cabinet also approved the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Prevention of Use of Sub-Standard Fuel/Tyres) Rules, 2025 under the Sindh Environmental Protection Act, 2014, providing a regulatory framework to prohibit the production, sale, and use of substandard fuels, including Tyre Pyrolysis Oil.</p><small>2025-10-06 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627306-pti-finalises-achakzai-as-na-opposition-leader-nasir-abbas-for-senate' target='_blank'><strong>PTI finalises Achakzai as NA opposition leader, Nasir Abbas for Senate</strong></a><br><p>

The May conflict, the worst between the old foes in decades, was sparked by an attack on Hindu tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, said was backed by Pakistan. Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry having questioned the credibility of India’s account of the events, saying it was “replete with fabrications”.
 
 

Both sides used fighter jets, missiles, artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, before agreeing to a ceasefire.
PM Shehbaz is currently in Malaysia on an official visit. After tallying up press releases from the Foreign Office about the prime minister’s foreign visits, it emerges that he conducted 10 foreign visits from May to October — a period of five months.
Tour of friendly nations — May 25-30
In his first foreign trip after the war, the PM toured the friendly nations of Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan. According to the FO, he held “wide-ranging discussions” with the four nations while acknowledging their support during the conflict.
Beginning his tour in Turkiye, PM Shehbaz met Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and thanked him for his support during the war. Both sides held a delegation-level meeting in which Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and Minister of Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar took part.
The next day, PM Shehbaz flew to Tehran and met Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, expressing gratitude for his support of Pakistan. At a joint press conference, the PM said, “We are ready to talk, for the sake of peace on water issues with our neighbour (India).”

For the third leg of his tour, the PM travelled to Azerbaijan to meet President Ilham Aliyev and express gratitude for his “steadfast support”. The pair also discussed the “full spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed satisfaction over the upward trajectory of political, economic, defence, and cultural cooperation”, according to Radio Pakistan. Additionally, the PM took part in a trilateral summit with Turkiye and Azerbaijan.
To cap off the tour, PM Shebaz landed in Tajikistan, where he met President Emomali Rahmon and addressed the International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation. At the conference on May 30, he warned that Pakistan would not allow India to cross the red line by holding the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance and endangering millions of lives for narrow political gains.
Visit to Saudi Arabia — June 5-6
The PM travelled to Saudi Arabia for a two-day visit, where he expressed gratitude to the kingdom for supporting Pakistan and also performed Umrah, offering prayers for the country’s success. This was the first of two visits to the kingdom that PM Shehbaz would embark upon since the war concluded.

The delegation arrived in Saudi Arabia at the invitation of Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman for a visit from June 5 to 6. The visit focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation in key areas between the nations.
The meeting reaffirmed the deep-rooted, strategic, and fraternal ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
Visit to the UAE — June 12
The week after his trip to Saudi Arabia, the prime minister headed to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where he discussed regional peace and stability and explored ways to deepen bilateral ties during an official day-long visit.
Thanking the Emirati leadership for their support during the war, Shehbaz and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al-Nahyan discussed bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest and reaffirmed commitment to further enhance cooperation in key areas.
ECO Summit in Azerbaijan — July 3-4
In a second trip to Azerbaijan, the PM travelled to Khankendi to attend the 17th Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) Summit, where he urged stronger regional cooperation in the face of increasing geopolitical tensions, including the Iran-Israel conflict and Indian hostility towards Pakistan.
The prime minister also voiced concerns over the situation in Gaza and the ongoing Israeli onslaught, which has killed at least 67,000 Palestinians since October 2023.

Visit to China and SCO Summit — Aug 30-Sept 4
Over a month after his last trip, PM Shehbaz headed to China for a state visit, where he was also due to participate in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Heads of State summit in Tianjin.
Alongside raising the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty, the PM also met with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bolster bilateral ties and vowed to strengthen Islamabad’s “iron-clad and all-weather strategic cooperative partnership” with Beijing.
 


Emergency visit to Qatar — September 11
PM Shehbaz reached Qatar on September 11 for a one-day visit, where he met Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to express solidarity and regional unity after Israel launched an airstrike on the Qatari capital Doha.
 
 

During the meeting, which took place two days after the attack, the PM urged unity in the Muslim world to confront Israeli provocations following Tel Aviv’s airstrikes.
Second visit to Saudi Arabia — September 17
PM Shehbaz travelled to Saudi Arabia once again, where he and Crown Prince Muhammad Bin Salman inked the “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement”, a pact which pledged to treat aggression against one nation as aggression against both.
“This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” a statement from the PM’s office read.
United Nations General Assembly — September 22-28
The prime minister also attended the 80th session of the UN General Assembly in New York, where he was one of eight Muslim nations to work on a Gaza peace proposal with US President Donald Trump.
He highlighted the need for “proactive” rather than “provocative” leadership for South Asia in his address to the UN.
 
 

During his time in the US, PM Shehbaz took a detour to Washington, DC, with Field Marshal Munir, where they met Trump in what was the PM’s first visit to the White House.
PM Shehbaz thanked Trump for “his public endorsement of Pakistan’s role in counterterrorism and stressed the need to further enhance cooperation in security and intelligence,” as the two discussed matters of regional security.
Visit to Malaysia — October 5-7
The PM is currently in Kuala Lumpur on an official visit at the invitation of his Malayian counterpart Ibrahim, where he had a “most productive exchange of views with my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya today”, according to a post on his X account.
“We held wide-ranging discussions on ways to further strengthen our historic partnership — focusing on trade and investment, climate, defence, education, and tourism.”

The 45-vessel flotilla, with activists and politicians on board, left Spain last month to break Israel’s blockade of Gaza, where the United Nations has warned of famine.
The flotilla was intercepted by the Israeli navy, with commandos boarding the boats and arresting participants. Former Pakistani senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan was also on board and is currently in Israeli custody.
In her first public comments since her release by Israeli authorities, Greta emphasised that the real story is not the interception of the flotilla, but the genocide being carried out in the Gaza Strip.
“The Global Sumud Flotilla was the biggest-ever attempt to break Israel’s illegal and inhumane siege by sea,” the Swedish activist said. “It is a story of global, international solidarity, of people stepping up when our governments fail to do so and people are saying ‘my leaders … who are supposed to represent me continue to fuel a genocide … they do not represent me’.“
She added that the mission even existing was “a shame”, condemning Israel’s “illegal and inhumane” siege of the enclave, as well as blocking routes for humanitarian aid.

“Under international law, states have a legal obligation to act to prevent … to stop a genocide, including ending complicity, applying real pressure and ending arms transfers,” Thunberg said.
“We are not even seeing the bare minimum from our governments,” she lamented. “Our international systems are betraying Palestinians. They are not even able to stop the worst war crimes from happening.“
Thunberg said she could “talk for a very, very long time” about her imprisonment and abuse at the hands of Israeli jailers, but insisted that it was not the story.
She said the story was “Israel … continuing to worsen and escalate their genocide and mass destruction with genocidal intent; attempting to erase an entire population in front of our very eyes”.
The Israeli onslaught in Gaza began in October 2023 following an attack by Hamas in Israel. Since then, more than 67,000 Palestinians have been killed, thousands injured and millions displaced.
Last month, UN investigators said that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza in a bid to “destroy the Palestinians”, accusing Israel’s prime minister and other top officials of incitement.</p><small>2025-10-06 17:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/062132395f5fc10.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947039/gb-police-arrest-8-facilitators-of-attack-on-religious-leader-say-culprits-to-be-caught-soon' target='_blank'><strong>GB Police arrest 8 facilitators of attack on religious leader, say culprits to be caught soon</strong></a><br><p>The Gilgit-Baltistan Police on Monday said they had arrested eight facilitators of an attack the previous day on a religious leader from the proscribed Ahl-e-Sunnat Wal Jamaat (ASWJ) near the Central Police Office (CPO).
Maulana Qazi Nisar Ahmed, who is the emir of the group’s GB and Kohistan chapter, was travelling along with police guards and a driver when the convoy came under fire. Police officials said the guards retaliated immediately, injuring some of the attackers, who managed to escape with the help of accomplices. The same day, a judge of the Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Court had also survived a brazen gun attack.
Following the incidents, protests erupted across the region. Demonstrators blocked main roads, including the Karakoram Highway, Gilgit–Shandur Road, and Baltistan Road, demanding the immediate arrest of the culprits. Shops and markets in Gilgit remained closed in protest.
Addressing a press conference to provide further updates, Inspector General of Police (IG) Gilgit-Baltistan Afzal Mahmood Butt said: “Eight actual culprits have been identified. Eight facilitators of theirs … have been arrested and in police custody,” he said. The police chief added that four vehicles used in the attack were also seized.
He was holding a press conference alongside GB Home Secretary Captain (r) Syed Ali Asghar and Gilgit Deputy IG Raja Mirza Hassan.
The GB police chief elaborated that eight suspects of the assassination attempt on the ASWJ leader and two suspects of the attack on the judge were identified, while four vehicles used in the former incident were also seized.
IG Butt said the suspects involved in the attack would be arrested in a day or two and produced in court soon.
He further added that a case was also registered after the two suspects who opened fire on Justice Malik Inayatur Rehman’s vehicle were identified.
The police chief said that fingerprints and blood samples were obtained from the scene of the incident, which helped in identifying the suspects.
The region’s top cop said that the police and investigation agencies are jointly investigating and based on initial evidence, they have identified the accused.
Religious leaders from all sects had condemned the attacks, describing them as a conspiracy to sabotage peace in the region.
Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON, Engineer Amir Muqam had also condemned the assassination attempt and ordered a high-level investigation.
The minister directed authorities to use all available resources to ensure the swift arrest of the attackers. “Those involved in this heinous crime will not escape justice,” he said.
GB Chief Minister Gulbar Khan had reiterated that no conspiracy against the peace of the region would be allowed to succeed. He had ordered the IG and law enforcement agencies to conduct a transparent investigation and immediately arrest the culprits.
Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Speaker Nazir Ahm­ed Advocate, Deputy Spe­a­ker Sadia Danish, Oppo­sition Leader Kazim Mes­um, cabinet ministers, reli­g­ious leaders from var­ious sects, and civil society activists had all condem­ned the incidents and dem­anded a fair and tran­s­parent investigation.</p><small>2025-10-06 17:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06210343140bcb7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947033/pakistan-urges-international-community-to-help-with-afghan-repatriation-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan urges international community to help with Afghan repatriation efforts</strong></a><br><p>Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam on Monday pressed the international community to help Pakistan in repatriating Afghan refugees to their country.
Muqam was speaking at the 76th Session of the Executive Committee of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Geneva, which is running from October 6-10, according to a press release from the ministry.
“It is now our shared responsibility to facilitate safe and dignified return of displaced Afghans to their country. However, durable returns require investments, in countries of refugee origin for peace, stability, schools, clinics, and livelihoods to make return viable,” he was quoted as having said.
Pakistan announced the phased repatriation of millions of Afghans in 2023 over security concerns and reasoning that the decades-long conflict had ended in Afghanistan.
 
 

Currently, the repatriation of nearly 1.3 million registered Afghans is underway.
Muqam said repeated calls for such support, alongside predictable multi-year funding for host countries such as Pakistan, had yet to be fully realised amid donor fatigue and delayed disbursements.
The federal minister informed the delegates that for over four decades, Pakistan had generously hosted over 4m Afghan nationals, managing one of the world’s largest and most protracted refugee situations.
“Despite our domestic problems, including economic pressures, security challenges and overstretched public services, we have upheld humanitarian principles by providing safety, access to education, healthcare, and livelihoods to the extent possible,” Muqam said.
In the first phase, those who did not have any documents were repatriated, which was followed by the repatriation of those who held Afghan Citizen Cards.
Muqam said Pakistan remained one of the most climate-vulnerable countries, adding that it had endured repeated climate-induced calamities, with this year’s devastating floods displacing millions, destroying infrastructure and causing huge economic losses.
He further said the international community must support the UNHCR in creating conditions that make the return of Afghan refugees both desirable and sustainable.
“When returnees are welcomed back with meaningful support, they can contribute to the recovery and progress of their societies. Provision of adequate, predictable, and flexible resources to UNHCR remains critical.”
The minister pointed out that Pakistan continued to combat terrorism, which had severely impacted its people and economy over the years.
“Over 90,000 Pakistanis have lost their lives, and the nation has endured staggering economic losses exceeding 150 billion dollars in this struggle.
“These events have had far-reaching humanitarian, economic, and social impacts. Pakistan reiterates its call for the urgent start of the UNHCR’s Climate Resilience Fund and other financing mechanisms to support countries most affected by climate change.”
He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to partnering with the international community to find durable solutions to humanitarian situations.
The minister cited three imperatives: first, urgent investment in the countries of refugee origin for stability and reintegration; second, timely and predictable international support to offset the burdens on host communities; and third, fast-track resettlement in third countries.
The minister also said that displacement continues to be a serious global challenge. He said that more than 132m people worldwide were forcibly displaced, including due to conflicts, persecution, violence and climate-induced disasters.
“Clearly, most of these humanitarian crises are man-made. On the other hand, resources needed to respond to the growing needs of forcibly displaced worldwide are shrinking rapidly.”</p><small>2025-10-06 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0616552368b5137.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947004/zardari-calls-naqvi-to-karachi-as-sindh-punjab-row-heats-up-ppp-stages-walkout-from-na-senate' target='_blank'><strong>Zardari calls Naqvi to Karachi as Sindh-Punjab row heats up; PPP stages walkout from NA, Senate</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Monday called Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Karachi for an urgent meeting as tensions continued to rise between the Sindh and Punjab governments, with the PPP staging a walkout from the National Assembly and Senate.
The PPP and PML-N are coalition partners in the Centre.
A post on X from the presidency said today that Zardari and Naqvi held a telephonic conversation related to the ongoing row between the Sindh and Punjab governments.
“President Asif Ali Zardari spoke to Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi over the phone to discuss the recent tensions between the Sindh and Punjab governments. The president has called the interior minister to Karachi for an urgent meeting in this regard,” the post said.
 






The PPP and the PML-N’s Punjab leadership have been engaged in a war of words for the past many days over issues ranging from flood compensation to water rights in the context of the Cholistan canals project. The PPP, which is in power in Sindh, has been particularly incensed by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s remarks, whose party is also leading the federal government.
The war of words between the two sides initially kicked off over flood compensation but expanded to water rights on the Indus River as CM Maryam told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
In response, the PPP lawmakers decided to stay away from parliamentary proceedings last week to protest the diatribe. PPP and PML-N bigwigs subsequently met in Islamabad to find a way out of the row, with the former asking CM Maryam to “rethink her tone” while speaking about water rights of the provinces.
However, she declared on Friday that she would never apologise to the PPP over her outburst, while the latter said she did not represent the people of Punjab as her government was a byproduct of Form 47.
The now-shelved six-canal project had turned out to be a cause of contention between Punjab and Sindh. Approval for the project was denied at the CCI after protests following the initiative’s launch by CM Maryam and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met his elder brother and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif on Saturday and discussed with him the ‘growing tensions’ between the PPP and PML-N, requ­esting him to play his part in cooling off the tempers.
Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon alleged a day ago that the Punjab government was taking his party’s cover to “target” the federal government.
Partners continue to trade barbs as PPP stages walkout from Senate, NA
The coalition partners continued to trade barbs today as Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari vented that the province had always played the role of a “big brother” during any natural calamity.
She said the Punjab cabinet expressed regret that when the province passed through the challenges of the recent floods, the moment was seized and used for the sake of politics and interests.
“The chief minister said she was saddened and, in her own words: ‘It is difficult for me to forget this. I didn’t expect that Punjab would be treated this way.’”
Bokhari also assailed Memon for his remarks and said a “planted campaign” was being run against CM Maryam.
“Ask all these people doing press conferences what they have done for flood affectees,” she said, also taking a dig at Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab.
The Punjab minister further said that she accepted Memon’s challenge to have a debate.
 


Responding to her, PPP Senator Quratulain Marri said Bokhari had a “phobia” of Sindh.
“PML-N’s declaration of war against Sindh is a dangerous precedent, the consequences of which will not be good for the country,” she said.
Marri also reiterated Memon’s allegation that the Punjab government was actually targeting the PPP to weaken the Centre and PM Shehbaz.
 






In a video message, PPP Senator and Senior Vice President Sherry Rehman said the party had said nothing to suggest that it was manipulating the issue of floods and aid for politics.
“If we are demanding relief for the people of Punjab and someone feels bad about it, that’s strange; Punjab is not anyone’s personal estate.”
 






Speaking in the Senate later, she said the PPP had great concerns and the federation was in “sheer need” of stability amid the devastation wrought by the floods.
She said it was “clear” that the “war of words” between Punjab and Sindh was affecting the federal coalition, saying that the PPP strove to maintain unity during tough times but when “lines were crossed”, the “Punjab card” was used and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s run as foreign minister was criticised, then such statements and remarks crossed the bounds of criticism and decency.
Rehman added that the PPP had never managed a coalition before in such a manner and said that apologising did not lead to a decline in self-respect and stature but only increased them.
“If our leadership is not apologised to, then the PPP is the biggest party in the Senate, count the numbers, we are by far the biggest party in this House and don’t take our support for granted in the coalition benches. We don’t want to break anything, but don’t take our support for granted. That is very clear,” she announced before leading a walkout of PPP senators from the proceedings.
 


Responding to her, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said everyone had a right to protest under a democratic system, but ebbs and peaks were also a part of it.
Tarar said he tried his best in the National Assembly that the recent statements from both sides did not affect parliamentary functioning. He highlighted that PML-N Senator and PM aide Rana Sanaullah had assured the PPP in the Senate that water distribution from the Indus River would only be carried out under the Irsa pact.
The law minister also appreciated that Rehman voiced her party’s grievances in a “very sophisticated” manner, adding that President Zardari and Nawaz were both leaders favouring “reconciliation”.
Addressing the opposition, the law minister stressed that the ongoing tensions were an “ordinary change in temperatures”.
At this point, Senate Deputy Chairman Syedaal Khan, who hails from the PML-N, called on his party’s Anusha Rehman and Khalil Tahir Sandhu, as well as on Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Amir Waliuddin Chishti to go and convince the PPP lawmakers to return to the Upper House.
 


Meanwhile, PTI Senator Ali Zafar quipped that they were witnessing a “historic contest” between the coalition allies.
“The contest is very interesting. It is about who served [the people] better during the floods.”
The PTI senator said that “surely the PPP prepared and may have prevented Sindh from being flooded, but only in books, not in reality”.
Noting the Punjab government’s assertions of providing ample rescue and relief services, Zafar claimed, “Surely they must have given the aid, but this is strange and perplexing aid because it did not reach the flood victims, but perhaps went into their pockets.”
The PTI senator assailed both government parties for contesting over “who held more press conferences rather than who built more houses”.
Meanwhile, in the National Assembly, PTI MNA Asad Qaiser welcomed the PPP’s “friendly fire” amid applause from the opposition. “I feel that if they are serious, they should come and present a vote of no confidence, we will side with them.”
His suggestion came after PPP MNA Raja Pervaiz Ashraf said that it was hard for his party to continue to participate in proceedings until it was given assurances by Punjab or any other authority.
Ashraf subsequently led a walkout of PPP lawmakers from the Lower House.
 


PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro addressed Qaiser’s suggestion in an interview on DawnNewsTV show ‘Doosra Rukh’ and said a mere sentence could not do anything and “reliablility” needed to be considered.
“I don’t know how reliable the PTI are, has he talked to his party founder?” he said.</p><small>2025-10-06 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06213522e301c38.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947036/militant-linked-violence-in-pakistan-soars-in-third-quarter-report' target='_blank'><strong>Militant-linked violence in Pakistan soars in third quarter: report</strong></a><br><p>Violence has surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) said on Monday.
In a quarterly report, CRSS reported a 46 per cent rise in fatalities, including civilians, security personnel and terrorists, compared to the previous quarter. The thick tank recorded 901 fatalities and 599 injuries resulting from 329 incidents of violence, including terrorist attacks and counter-terrorism operations.
The report noted that this year is on track to be deadlier than 2024 — already the most violent year in a decade.
The surge reflects an “intensification of militant violence and the expanded scale of counter-terrorism operations”, CRSS said.
“With an entire quarter still remaining, … 2025 is on course to surpass last year’s toll,” the report read.
“If the current trend continues, 2025 could mark one of the deadliest years in a decade.”
There were 2,414 deaths in the first three quarters of 2025, nearing the 2,546 fatalities reported in 2024, according to the think tank. The report added that when comparing casualty numbers from January to September 2024 (1,527 fatalities) to this year, 2,414 fatalities were recorded within the same period — an increase of 58pc.
“However, the source of fatalities has shifted; in 2024, security operations caused 505 deaths (33pc of the total), while terror attacks claimed 1,022. In 2025, security operations accounted for 1,265 deaths — over half of the total fatalities. This shift underscores how the state’s response has intensified, with security forces inflicting heavier losses on militants,” the report read.
Attacks have increased since the withdrawal of US-led troops from neighbouring Afghanistan in 2021, with the federal government accusing the Taliban authorities of sheltering terrorists — a charge they deny. However, the United Nations has warned of a “permissive environment” for militant groups in Afghanistan.
Government officials told AFP in September on condition of anonymity that the presence of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — designated Fitna al Khawarij by the authorities — had increased in recent months.
That same month, opposition lawmakers accused the military of carrying out an air raid on militant hideouts that killed children.
Local village councils have repeatedly warned that sweeping counter-terrorism operations would risk harming civilians.</p><small>2025-10-06 16:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06210107879ac8e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947032/nationwide-anti-polio-drive-to-vaccinate-45m-children-from-oct-13' target='_blank'><strong>Nationwide anti-polio drive to vaccinate 45m children from Oct 13</strong></a><br><p>The National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC) on Monday announced the launch of a nationwide anti-polio campaign from October 13 to 19, aiming to immunise 45 million children under the age of five against the crippling disease.
On September 29, two new poliovirus cases were confirmed in Sindh’s Badin and Thatta districts, taking the nationwide tally to 29 for this year and the total number of cases in the province to nine, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
“During the week-long campaign, more than 45 million children under the age of five will be administered oral polio vaccine (OPV) to protect them from the crippling disease,” the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported, citing the NEOC.
It said an additional dose of Vitamin A will also be given to children during the campaign to help strengthen their immune systems.
“More than 400,000 trained polio workers will take part in the campaign across the country to ensure every eligible child receives the vaccine,” it added.
As per provincial data shared by the NEOC, in Punjab, over 23m children under five will be vaccinated, while in Sindh, more than 10.6m children will be targeted.
In Balochistan, over 2.6m children will receive the drops, while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, around 7.2m children will be covered.
The NEOC said that in Islamabad, over 460,000 children will be vaccinated, while in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, more than 760,000 children will be administered the vaccine. In Gilgit-Baltistan, over 280,000 children will be reached during the drive.
“The NEOC has appealed to all parents and caregivers to ensure that every child under five years of age receives the polio drops during the nationwide campaign from October 13 to 19,” the report added.
It also urged parents to complete the full course of routine immunisation for their children to protect them from polio and other preventable diseases.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.
Sindh mulls blocking SIMs, CNICs, passports of parents refusing polio vaccination
Last week, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said the provincial government was likely to take “stern action” against the parents who refuse polio vaccination for their children.
The punitive measures include blocking of cell phone subscriber identification modules (SIMs) and suspending national identity cards and passports to restrict access to communication and travel facilities.
He also added that elected representatives, deputy commissioners, and senior superintendents of police (SSPs) would visit such households to administer polio drops to children “forcibly”.</p><small>2025-10-06 16:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061948496b5a6f8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947017/pakistan-forms-18-member-committee-for-economic-engagements-negotiations-with-saudi-arabia' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan forms 18-member committee for economic engagements, negotiations with Saudi Arabia</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has constituted an 18-member committee to carry out bilateral economic engagements and negotiations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), a notification issued on Sunday by the Prime Minister’s Office said.
According to the notification, made available to Dawn.com today, the committee will be co-chaired by Climate Change Minister Musadik Malik and the national coordinator for Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), Lieutenant General Sarfraz Ahmad.
The notification, dated October 5, said that the co-chairs “shall constitute core/negotiation teams for negotiations with the Saudi counterparts”.
These teams, per the notification, shall be responsible for implementing and executing the assigned tasks on a fast-track basis.
“The prime minister has directed that the SIFC shall submit proposals for the travel of members of the committee from Pakistan to KSA and back, and the PMO will ensure that these are processed/approved within one hour of the same working day,” the notification further said.
Per the notification, Economic Affairs Division Minister Ahad Khan Cheema, Special Assistant to Prime Minister (Minister of State) for Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan, Power Minister Awais Ahmed Leghari, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, Communication Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, and Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja will also be part of the committee, among other members.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in mutual economic interests, strategic military cooperation, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with the kingdom being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
In February, Riyadh signed a $1.2 billion deferred oil facility, releasing $100m monthly until February 2026. Islamabad is also seeking a rollover of $5bn Saudi loans — $2bn maturing in December 2025 and $3bn in June 2026 — at a concessional four per cent interest rate.
Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Riyadh was “central to Pakistan’s economy” as he met Saudi Crown Prince Moha­m­med Bin Salman on the sidelines of the Future Investment Initiative (FII) in Riyadh.
Saudi delegation due in Pakistan this week
According to a Reuters report, a Saudi business delegation is due in Pakistan this week to kick off what Islamabad hopes is a programme of investment, though major investments may be dependent on reforms, officials and experts said.
The development follows a mutual defence agreement that the two countries signed last month, pledging a joint response to aggression.
Pakistani sources anticipate initial investment plans of about $1bn, possibly through the creation of a new fund, as a path to a deeper economic relationship mirroring military ties, the report said.
Less clear is what Pakistan gets out of it, though analysts widely expect a financial payoff. The Saudi businessmen will be led by Prince Mansour bin Mohammad al-Saud, former governor of Hafar Al-Batin Province. The delegation is modest in ambition, with a much bigger Saudi interest sought by Pakistan in the months ahead.
Pakistan’s commerce ministry and the Saudi government media office did not respond to requests for comment. Prince Mansour could not be reached for comment.
The sectors that the Saudi businessmen will focus on are technology, sports equipment, and food and agriculture, according to a source involved in the process. They are expected to meet PM Shehbaz.
The Pakistani government is seeking large investments in state-owned enterprises and the development of a petrochemicals plant, according to officials.
Saudi Arabia has also shown interest in mining in the past, including in buying part of the Pakistani government stake in the multibillion-dollar Reko Diq copper mine being developed in western Pakistan.</p><small>2025-10-06 15:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061640017ba854b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947001/nobel-medicine-prize-goes-to-researchers-studying-immune-system-precision' target='_blank'><strong>Nobel medicine prize goes to researchers studying immune system precision</strong></a><br><p>American scientists Mary Brunkow and Fred Ramsdell, and Shimon Sakaguchi from Japan won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine on Monday for work shedding light on how the immune system spares healthy cells, creating openings for possible new autoimmune disease and cancer treatments.
This year’s prize relates to peripheral immune tolerance, or “how we keep our immune system under control so we can fight all imaginable microbes and still avoid autoimmune disease”, said Marie Wahren-Herlenius, a rheumatology professor at the Karolinska Institute.
Sakaguchi told reporters outside his university laboratory that “I feel it is a tremendous honour”, Kyodo news agency reported.
Regulatory T cells: the immune system’s ‘security guards’
The winners for medicine are selected by the Nobel Assembly of Sweden’s Karolinska Institute medical university and receive a prize sum of 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.2m), as well as a gold medal presented by Sweden’s king.
Brunkow is senior programme manager at the Institute for Systems Biology in Seattle, while Ramsdell is scientific adviser at Sonoma Biotherapeutics in San Francisco. Sakaguchi is a professor at Osaka University in Japan.
“Their discoveries have laid the foundation for a new field of research and spurred the development of new treatments, for example, for cancer and autoimmune diseases,” the prize-awarding body said in a statement.
The laureates identified so-called regulatory T cells, which act as the immune system’s security guards that keep immune cells from attacking our own body, it added.
After announcing the winners, the institute’s Thomas Perlmann said specific therapies had yet to win market clearance, but more than 200 trials on humans involving regulatory T cells were ongoing.
Among companies in the early race, Sonoma Biotherapeutics, which Ramsdell co-founded, is partly funded and supported by US drugmaker Regeneron to work on therapies against diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease.
Also targeting that condition, Quell Therapeutics has partnered with AstraZeneca.  Other biotech firms exploring the approach include Bayer’s BlueRock.
Medicine the first prize of Nobel season
The Nobel Prizes were established through the will of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite and a wealthy businessman. They have been awarded since 1901 for outstanding contributions in science, literature, and peace, with interruptions mainly during the World Wars.
The economics prize was added later and is funded by Sweden’s central bank, the Riksbank.
Winners are selected by expert committees from various institutions. All prizes are awarded in Stockholm, except for the Peace Prize, which is presented in Oslo — a possible legacy of the political union between Sweden and Norway during Nobel’s lifetime.
Past recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine include renowned scientists such as Alexander Fleming, who shared the 1945 award for discovering penicillin. In recent years, the prize has recognised major breakthroughs, including those that enabled the development of Covid-19 vaccines.
 
 

Last year’s medicine prize was awarded to US scientists Victor Ambros and Gary Ruvkun for their discovery of microRNA and its key role in how multicellular organisms grow and live, helping explain how cells specialise into different types.
Medicine, in accordance with tradition, kicks off the annual Nobels, arguably the most prestigious prizes in science, literature, peace and economics, with the remainder set to be announced over the coming days.
More than a century after their inception, the Nobel Prizes remain steeped in tradition. The awards culminate in ceremonies attended by the royal families of Sweden and Norway, followed by lavish banquets held on December 10 — the anniversary of Alfred Nobel’s death.</p><small>2025-10-06 14:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06175709c14f630.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947012/ihc-disposes-of-contempt-case-against-former-gb-chief-judge-rana-shamim' target='_blank'><strong>IHC disposes of contempt case against former GB chief judge Rana Shamim</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday disposed of the contempt case against former Gilgit-Baltistan chief judge Rana Shamim.
The case pertained to an alleged affidavit by Shamim, which stated that he witnessed former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Saqib Nisar relaying instructions to a high court judge not to release PML-N President Nawaz Sharif and his daughter, Maryam Nawaz, in the corruption references against them.
IHC Chief Justice Sardar Sarfaraz Dogar heard the contempt case against Shamim and others. Lawyer Aamir Abdullah stated that the former GB judge had submitted an apology letter, after which the case was not scheduled.
Speaking in court, the deputy attorney general said that the case had been fixed after a long time and only Shamim was indicted.
During the last hearing in 2022, the GB judge disowned his controversial affidavit.
In 2021, Shamim partially backtracked from the contents of his affidavit, stating that not a single sitting judge of the IHC was involved in the controversy and submitted an unconditional apology to the high court. He had, however, stood by his allegations against former CJP Nisar.
When Shamim’s affidavit was published in the newspaper, former IHC chief justice Athar Minallah took notice of the matter and initiated contempt of court proceedings.</p><small>2025-10-06 14:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06095850a272dba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946958/welcome-step-pm-hails-malaysian-announcement-of-import-of-halal-meat-worth-200m-from-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Welcome step’: PM hails Malaysian announcement of import of Halal meat worth $200m from Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday termed his Malaysian counterpart’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”, which he said would further augment engagement in this sector between the countries.
The PM’s remarks came in a post on X after he addressed a joint press conference alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya following bilateral talks between the two leaders. PM Shehbaz had also mentioned during the press conference that the Malaysian premier had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan.
 






PM Shehbaz, who reached Malaysia yesterday on a state visit, further shared in his post that he had a “most productive exchange of views with my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya today”.
“We held wide-ranging discussions on ways to further strengthen our historic partnership — focusing on trade and investment, climate, defence, education, and tourism.”
The prime minister added that the two leaders also had an in-depth discussion on regional and global developments, including the situation in the Middle East and South Asia. Both prime ministers “reaffirmed our shared resolve to continue working together for the peace, progress, and prosperity of our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said.
Mentioning a “gracious and impressive welcome ceremony at Perdana Putra”, he thanked the Malaysian PM for the “warm and generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation”.
Moreover, he said: “We also reflected on Allama Iqbal’s philosophy that the strength of a nation and the destiny of its people lie in the awakening of the self. It is through faith, effort, and perseverance that people shape their destiny.
“Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and I shared our deep admiration for Allama Iqbal, whose message of faith and self-renewal continues to inspire generations across the Muslim world.”
PM Shehbaz concluded his post saying that he was “looking forward to continued Pakistan–Malaysia collaboration across all areas of mutual interest”.
Pakistan presents ‘immense’ business opportunities: PM
Separately, after addressing the Malaysia Business Forum alongside his Malaysian counterpart, PM Shehbaz said he “invited Malaysian companies to seize the immense opportunities Pakistan offers”.
In a post on X, the prime minister termed Pakistan as a “nation with a skilled and youthful workforce, a rapidly expanding market, and an investor-friendly business environment”.
“With our economic trajectory on the rise and reforms unlocking new sectors, Pakistan offers a highly promising investment destination in the region,” the premier asserted.
 






Addressing the Pakistan–Malaysia Business and Investment Conference alongside his Malaysian counterpart, the premier said he had a very “constructive and productive” meeting earlier in the day with PM Ibrahim, “who is very keen” that bilateral business relations between the two countries should improve further.
“This seminar is a testimony of our joint desire that this is an area where we must cooperate with each other.”
“We have a youth bulge, which is a challenge and also a great opportunity, and both Malaysia and Pakistan wish to use this asset,” said the prime minister. He added that the youth can be provided training in information technology, artificial intelligence, vocational training and modern skills to transform the challenge into a “great opportunity”.
Referring to the tourism potential of Pakistan, PM Shehbaz said this is another area in which both Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur can cooperate. He suggested that companies from both countries can hold discussions to promote tourism and this initiative has the potential to be a “game changer”.
‘Pakistan wants to join hands for mutually beneficial projects’
Earlier, PM Shehbaz said during the press conference with Ibrahim alongside him that Pakistan wanted to “join hands” with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects which allowed for expertise from the two countries to come together.
The prime minister began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation, and called Malaysia a “second home”.
“This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said.
“The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said.
 






PM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser.
“I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations.
“Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas.
“Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said.
 






The premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said.
He noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism.
“It will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come, it will increase and have a quantum jump,” he said.
The premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script, which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development.
“These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said.
 






He further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”.
“When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said.
Talking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said.
He concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering.
Later, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia.
 






PM Ibrahim ‘extremely appreciative’ of Pakistan’s stance on Palestine
In his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities.
He said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million.
Ibrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”.
“So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said.
Calling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
“Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said.
Regarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism.
He also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue.
 
 

“We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave.
“Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said.
PM given guard of honour
After the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.”
“He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said.
“The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said.
 






PM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office.
 






According to Radio Pakistan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier.
Prior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement.
“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.
Important global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.
 






‘Visit reflects enduring partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia’
The Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.
“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.
It added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”
Pakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.</p><small>2025-10-06 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/06192458f5ce325.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1947020/sidra-amin-reprimanded-for-code-of-conduct-breach-during-india-clash' target='_blank'><strong>Sidra Amin reprimanded for code of conduct breach during India clash</strong></a><br><p>Top batter Sidra Amin was reprimanded for breaching Level 1 of the ICC Code of Conduct during their ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 match against India in Colombo.
India won Sunday’s match against Pakistan by 88 runs, with Sidra Amin scoring 81 runs during the encounter. She also become the first Pakistani batter to hit a six against India in a women’s ODI match.
The right-handed batter was found guilty of breaching Article 2.2 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Players and Player Support Personnel, which relates to “abuse of cricket equipment or clothing, ground equipment or fixtures and fittings during an international match.”
 






The incident occurred during the 40th over of Pakistan’s chase, when Sidra forcefully hit her bat onto the pitch after being dismissed.
In addition to the reprimand, one demerit point has been added to Sidra’s disciplinary record. This is her first offence in a 24-month period, ICC reports.
“Level 1 breaches carry a minimum penalty of an official reprimand, a maximum penalty of 50 per cent of a player’s match fee, and one or two demerit points,” ICC reported.
On-field umpires Lauren Agenbag and Nimali Perera, third umpire Kerrin Klaaste and fourth umpire Kim Cotton had levelled the charges.
Sidra admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Shandré Fritz of the Emirates ICC International Panel of Match Referees, negating the need for a formal hearing.

UK police would be given greater powers to restrict protests as Mahmood said repeated large-scale pro-Palestinian demonstrations had caused “considerable fear” for the Jewish community. The government initiative follows last week’s deadly knife and car-ramming attack on a synagogue in the northwestern city of Manchester.
“The strengthening of the legislation that I am going to bring about is based on the ability of the police to place conditions and restrictions on protests,” she said in a video posted on her X account.
“What I will be making explicit is that cumulative disruption … the frequency of particular protests in particular places is in and of itself a reason for police to restrict or place conditions.”
 






In an interview with the BBC, she further maintained that the move was not about a ban but about “restrictions and conditions”, such as relocating a demonstration and changing the time of protests.
“What I will make clear in the law is [that] cumulative disruption is in and of itself a reason to place restrictions,” Mahmood said. “There would be protests related to the conflict in the Middle East that would now come into the purview of these changes, as well as other protests.”
When asked about the “dark step” of restricting the fundamental right to protest, the home secretary said, “I don’t think it’s offensive to ask people to show a little humanity towards a community that has suffered such a terrible tragedy … I think just because you have a freedom, it doesn’t mean you have to use it at every moment of every day.”

This move garnered significant backlash from political figures, human rights groups, and other public figures across Britain.
Lawmaker Zarah Sultana wrote in a post on X that the home secretary aimed to ban pro-Palestinian protests, adding that Mahmood was “not content with locking up pensioners and priests for opposing the ban on Palestine Action”.
“She’s (Mahmood) violating our civil liberties and the right to protest — all while supporting the flow of arms to the apartheid genocidal state of Israel,” Sultana wrote. “I hope the ministerial car was worth throwing Palestinians under the bus.”
 






In an interview with Sky News, UK Green Party leader Zach Polanski called Mahmood “deeply irresponsible” to conflate protests against the Gaza crisis and “weaponising” against the Manchester synagogue attack.
“Democratic nonviolent protest is a cornerstone of our democracy, and I think it’s worrying when governments are increasingly trying to crush down dissent and using what is a brutal attack … to point at a protest and say people don’t have a right to speak out about a genocide,” Polanski said.
British actor and comedian Tez Ilyas posted a photo of Mahmood from 2014, showing her at a protest with a pro-Palestinian picket sign.
“Shabana Mahmood, before she was given access to the corridors of power,” he wrote in the caption.

His swift resignation was unexpected and unprecedented, and marked another major deepening of France’s political crisis.
The far-right National Rally immediately urged President Emmanuel Macron to call a snap parliamentary election.
After weeks of consultations with political parties across the board, Lecornu, a close ally of Macron, had appointed his ministers on Sunday and they had been set to hold their first meeting on Monday afternoon.
 


But the new cabinet line-up had angered opponents and allies alike, who either found it too right-wing or not sufficiently so, raising questions on how long it could last, at a time when France is already mired deep in political crisis, with no group holding a majority in a fragmented parliament.
Lecornu handed his resignation to Macron on Monday morning.
“Mr Sebastien Lecornu has submitted the resignation of his Government to the President of the Republic, who has accepted it,” the Elysee’s press office said.
 
 

French politics has become increasingly unstable since Macron’s re-election in 2022 for want of any party or grouping holding a parliamentary majority.
The French president’s decision to call a snap parliamentary election last year deepened the crisis by producing an even more fragmented parliament. Macron named Lecornu, a former defence minister, to the post last month and was his fifth prime minister in two years.
“There can be no return to stability without a return to the polls and the dissolution of the National Assembly,” National Rally leader Jordan Bardella said after Lecornu resigned.
 






Daunting task of finding approval for austerity budget
Lecornu had faced the daunting task of finding approval in a deeply divided parliament for an austerity budget for next year.
His two immediate predecessors, Francois Bayrou and Michel Barnier, were ousted by the legislative chamber in a standoff over the spending plan. France’s public debt has reached a record high, official data showed last week.
Paris’s benchmark CAC 40 index dropped 1.5 per cent as Lecornu resigned, making it the worst-performing index in Europe, as banking shares came under heavy fire, leaving BNP Paribas, Societe Generale and Credit Agricole down 4pc to 5pc.
The euro slid 0.7pc on the day to $1.1665.
 
 

France’s debt-to-GDP ratio is now the European Union’s third-highest after Greece and Italy, and is close to twice the 60pc permitted under EU rules.
Previous governments had rammed the last three annual budgets through parliament without a vote, a method allowed by the constitution but deeply criticised by the opposition.
But Lecornu promised last week to ensure lawmakers were able to vote on the bill.
France has been mired in deadlock since Macron gambled on snap parliamentary elections in June last year in the hopes of bolstering his authority. The move backfired, leaving the Macron-friendly bloc in the assembly in a minority.</p><small>2025-10-06 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/061602172663e48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1946991/govt-should-take-parliament-into-confidence-on-new-us-policy-raza-rabbani' target='_blank'><strong>Govt should take parliament into confidence on ‘new US policy’: Raza Rabbani</strong></a><br><p>Former Senate chairperson Raza Rabbani emphasised on Monday that the federal government should “immediately” take parliament into confidence on its “new US policy”, particularly mentioning media reports about the sale of rare minerals and the supposed plan to offer Pasni port to Washington.
“The federal government has not taken the people or parliament into confidence on the dynamics of the new relationship with the United States,” Rabbani stated in a press release. He added, “It is the right of the people to know the details and the direction of the foreign policy. In history, the US has never been a reliable friend to depend upon.”
On the sale of precious and rare minerals to American metals company US Strategic Metals (USSM), he said it was “unfortunate” that information about the deal had come through the media.
He stressed that “real stakeholders” in this matter were the provinces, which should have been taken into confidence through the Council of Common Interests.
“The federal government fails to realise that Article 172 [of the 1973] Constitution […] is in operation, [and] the provinces are 50 per cent owners of the mineral resources,” Rabbani pointed out.
According to Article 172: “Any property which has no rightful owner shall, if located in a province, vest in the government of that province, and in every other case, in the federal government […]  Subject to the existing commitments and obligations, mineral oil and natural gas within the province or the territorial water adjacent thereto shall vest jointly and equally in that province and the federal government.”
In this connection, he also recalled that the provinces had “rejected the federal government-sponsored minerals law”.
The legislation has particularly faced opposition in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and even ignited debate on resource control.
 
 

Rabbani further stated that it was “alarming” to learn from the international media that Pasni port may be offered to Washington. “This will have very serious repercussions on the other regional relationships,” he said.
He asserted that the federal government should “immediately take parliament into confidence on the various aspects of its new US policy”.
The former Senate chairperson’s assertion comes against the backdrop of
Pakistan is entering a new phase in its economic and strategic partnership with the US, as the two allies move closer to implementing a deal for the export of rare earth minerals.
USSM, which signed a memorandum of understanding with Pakistan in September to invest rou­ghly $500 million to establish mineral processing and development facilities in the country, rece­ntly dispatched its first consignment of mineral samples to the US to advance the deal.
The sample shipment, prepared locally in collaboration with the Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), includes antimony, copper concentrate, and rare earth elements such as neodymium and praseodymium.
But the opposition party, the PTI, has raised concerns over these “secret deals” with the US, and called on the government to disclose the details of these agreements.
In a statement, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram referred to the USSM shipment, as well as claims published by the Financial Times regarding a supposed plan to offer the Pasni Port to Washington. He warned that such “reckless, lopsided, and secretive agreements would further inflame the already volatile situation in the country”.
He demanded that parliament and the nation be taken on board and that “full details of all such deals be made public.” Akram stressed that PTI “would never accept agreements struck at the expense of the people and the state’s interests“.
Military sources have already disputed the claims made in the Financial Times report, calling the proposal “a commercial idea” rather than “official policy”.</p><small>2025-10-06 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/627218-fo-hopeful-of-ex-senator-mushtaq-ahmeds-evacuation-in-next-couple-of-days' target='_blank'><strong>FO hopeful of ex-senator Mushtaq Ahmad's evacuation in 'next couple of days'</strong></a><br><p>
