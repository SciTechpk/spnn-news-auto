• Income tax rate of first slab reduced to 2.5pc, not 1pc as initially printed in Finance Bill

• Aurangzeb defends steep pay hikes for lawmakers, ministers

ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Wednesday repeatedly warned that the government would be compelled to impose a further Rs400 to 500 billion in taxes if parliamentarians failed to approve the sweeping enforcement measures proposed in the 2025-26 budget — as they were already cleared by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
“I now request my colleagues in both houses of parliament to get the enabling clauses for enforcement measures passed, otherwise we would have to take Rs400-500bn additional tax measures,” the usually soft-spoken minister said at his post-budget press conference, hinting at potential resistance within the ruling party, coalition partners and other pressure groups.
While Mr Aurangzeb did not name specific provisions, he was apparently referring to expanded enforcement powers for the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). These include the authority to block high-value financial transactions by non-filers — such as vehicle and property purchases, investment in securities and mutual funds, and opening certain prestigious bank accounts — along with powers to seal unregistered business premises, confiscate goods and recover taxes from firms, including those in the public sector.
At a recent special meeting, the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue raised objections to some of those measures introduced through the Tax Laws (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 last month and hinted at tight scrutiny in due course. “Legal backing will be critical to institutionalise compliance and sustaining revenue growth,” the finance minister asserted.
Mr Aurangzeb explained that of the Rs700bn additional revenues envisaged for the next fiscal year — on top of an estimated 12 per cent organic growth in taxes driven by inflation and economic activity — about Rs389bn is tied to enforcement measures, while Rs312bn stems from additional tax measures.
“These numbers are locked with the IMF,” Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said, adding that the federal cabinet’s decision to increase government workers’ salaries by 10pc — up from the originally proposed 6pc — will have an additional fiscal impact of roughly Rs28bn.
He was responding to a question abo­ut whether talks with the Fund were com­plete or changes would ensue bet­ween the budget presented before and to be subsequently passed by parliament.
Both the finance minister and the finance secretary indicated that this additional fiscal impact was filled with a change in income tax rates for the salaried class. The first income tax slab — people earning between Rs600,000 and Rs1.2 million per year — was reduced from 5pc to 2.5pc, as announced by the finance minister in his budget speech, instead of the 1pc earlier envisaged (and printed in the Finance Bill).
Responding to a question, Mr Auran­gzeb said that, given Pakistan’s history, int­ernational stakeholders had also dou­bted the country’s ability to enforce tax laws effectively and insisted on results.
During the current year, “we have demonstrated practically that we can deliver”, with Rs400bn recoveries through enforcement. “We now have the trust and credibility,” the minister said, reiterating the need for legal provisions to continue enforc­e­ment or risk Rs400bn of more taxes.
Journalist walkout
The presser was marred by a walkout from journalists over the cancellation of a traditional technical briefing on the Finance Bill.

The protest turned into a full-blown boycott following a decision by officials to continue the live event in the presence of their own people alone. Information Minister Atta­u­llah Tarar, who was not in attendance, had to rush to the scene to acknowledge journalists’ grievances and convince them to return to the presser.
Mr Aurangzeb also defended sharp increases, some of them as large as 550pc, in the salaries of the speaker, deputy speaker, members of parliament and ministers.
He insisted the hikes sh­­ould be seen in the context that the salaries of the mi­­nisters had last been adju­s­ted in 2016, compared to annual increases in the wa­­­ges of employees in pu­­blic and private sectors in line with inflation and other factors. “Had these been adjusted on an an­­n­ual basis, there would have been no sudden jump.”
At the same time, the finance secretary indicated delays in the implementation of a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel with effect from July 1, 2025, as announced by the finance minister last year.
Mr Bosal said the contributory scheme for military employees was not an easy job and consultations had been taking place with the Ministry of Defence.
Both the minister and the secretary parried questions about the size of salary increases and special allowance for armed forces personnel annou­nced in the budget speech.
They also did not respond to repeated questions regarding the justification and increase in allocation of funds for parliamentarians’ schemes to Rs70bn, instead of the Rs50bn approved by the Annual Plan Coordination Committee.
 
 

The minister conceded the relief in tax rates for the salaried class, corporates and other sectors was minor but insisted it should be seen in the “direction of travel” that the government would keep on following as more fiscal space became available.
He insisted that the government showed acknowledgement that certain sections of society are overburdened. “This is a signal from the government to start moving in the right direction,” he said.
Responding to a question, Mr Aurangzeb said the federal government had called provincial nominations for the new National Finance Comm­ission, as the prime minister had already announced to call its meeting in August. He rejected the impression that the Centre could unilaterally delink population from resource distribution.
When questioned about the proposed debt servicing surcharge (DSS) on electricity, the finance minister did not recall he had announced any such thing in his budget speech.
However, in his budget speech, he had said the DSS would be used not only for servicing interest but also for repaying principal debt. He also proposed amendments to the Nepra Act to allow the federal government to raise the DSS beyond the current 10pc ceiling on a case-by-case basis.
Minimum wage
Asked why the government did not announce a minimum wage, the minister said the industry, in particular, and the private sector, in general, were not willing to pay even the previous minimum wage announced by the government.
He said Pakistan’s two international bonds are due for repayment in September and in April 2026, and the government was in a good position for their repayment.
Additionally, he ann­oun­ced plans to issue Panda bonds later this year to access China’s capital markets for diversification. The government also hopes to return to the US and European markets in 2026, contingent on improved credit ratings.
The minister stated that the government had eliminated additional customs duties on 4,000 tariff lines out of a total of 7,000 and reduced duties on an additional 2,700 lines as part of structural reforms aim­ed at aligning Pakis­tan’s trade and industrial policy with global standards.
These steps are part of a phased reform plan to simplify Pakistan’s tariff reg­i­me, aiming for an average rate of just over 4pc.
“Of these, around 2,000 tariff lines are directly linked to raw materials and intermediary goods used by the exporters,” he said. “This is the structural reform not taken in the past 30 years. This is a huge step, and we are committed to taking it forward gradually.”
Breathe Pakistan
The finance minister also expressed his gratitude to DawnMedia for its climate change initiative, Breathe Pakistan.
“I am very thankful to Dawn Group for the initiative it has taken on climate cha­n­­ge,” he said. “I have repeatedly said this (climate cha­nge) is an existential threat to Pakistan. Through Breathe Paki­st­an, you have taken it forward, and I commend you, your institution and your sponsors for highlighting this issue and its importance.”
He added, “It’s no longer just about the floods of 2022 — those of us living in Islamabad now experience windstorms and hailstorm every week. This never happened before. We are living climate change day in and day out. I want to sincerely thank your institution for leading the charge under Breathe Pakistan.”

Published in Dawn, June 12th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-12 04:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/684a42a64debb.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916673/thrashing-around' target='_blank'><strong>Thrashing around</strong></a><br><p>WE are now in the advanced stages of a fiscal malfunction that is causing the state in Pakistan to sink deeper into financial and economic non-viability. There is no point sugar-coating this harsh reality.
For too many years now, we have been repeating what is now a familiar ritual, where the budget is announced accompanied with pious-sounding intentions, well-meaning rhetoric, and pointed reminders about the state’s constraints. And yet the only thing that changes is the increase in the burden on those who are registered, compliant taxpayers.
The budget announced on Tuesday follows this well-trodden path. This was the year to make something big happen. Rarely have conditions been more favourable for a government to undertake far-reaching change.
 
 

The powerful establishment stands behind them. There is no opposition worth the name in parliament. The economy has stabilised. The raging inferno of inflation has been doused. The runaway fiscal and external sector deficits have been either converted into surpluses or at least brought within manageable bounds. There is political and economic stability in the country. Never mind for now the blood, sweat and tears through which this brief moment of respite has been procured.
The question to ask is what are they doing with this hard-earned moment of opportunity?
We now have our answer. There is not a single reform measure in this budget. No strategic change of direction is indicated anywhere. They claim to be trying to boost exports through wide-ranging reduction in custom duties across thousands of tariff lines but one is hard-pressed to find an exporter who is keen on this proposal. The most significant area one looks for in a budget are measures designed to broaden the base of taxation. And all we find is steps designed to bring online marketplaces, incomes and transactions of the digital economy into the net and ramp up the powers of tax commissioners to penalise those refusing compliance.
There are revenue measures to make you cry. Last year, they taxed stationery and children’s school supplies. This year they have dropped a bombshell of a tax on teachers by abruptly withdrawing a tax rebate that they had only a few days ago committed they would keep. And then they sat in their ritual ‘post-budget press conference’ and told us how much they value the work of educated Pakistani youth, who have brought $400 million into the country as freelancers, adding that they would like to see these same code writers make $90 to $100 per hour or something like that in the years to come.

There is not a single reform measure in this budget. No strategic change of direction is indicated anywhere.

This is vintage budget theatre. Put the tax burden on teachers and professors, tax students’ school supplies, then sing paeans to the productive energies of the youth. Wag a finger at those who pay no taxes in this country. And with the other hand pick the pockets of those who do. Salaried individuals got relief sufficient maybe to pay for a pizza delivery per month.
 
 

The finance minister justified this by saying the “direction of travel” is correct, even if the distance covered is not satisfactory, adding that things that go up rarely ever come down where taxes are concerned. This is a polite way of saying ‘count your blessings, others would have given you even less than what I did’.
But let’s talk about the “direction of travel” for a moment. The last major tax reform that was attempted in Pakistan was the so-called Reformed General Sales Tax, or RGST, bill back in 2009. It died a loud and messy death in parliament as even the government’s coalition partners at the time refused to vote for it. Since then, we have been reduced to clever little gimmicks to squeeze more and more revenue out of those foolish enough to be registered and complying with the tax laws of the country.
Along the way, we have invented whole new categories of taxpayers, and whole new income streams. Somewhere around the middle of the 2010s we had a new category of taxpayer called ‘non-filer of tax returns’. In 2022, the government invented the category of ‘deemed income’. Along the way, we had amnesty schemes, incentives and penalties to try and get recalcitrant non-filers to register, and pay their taxes.
It began in 2014 with an amnesty scheme and a withholding tax on bank transactions of non-filers. It continued through 2019 when the FBR was prodded into serving tens of thousands of notices to non-filers in the services sector. It continued in 2021 when we were supposed to collect tens of billions of rupees from ‘point of sale machines’ that were going to be mainstreamed across the retail sector.
 
 

It raced passed 2022 when incomes were deemed to have come from otherwise dormant assets on the wealth statements of the rich, and taxes were to be collected from shopkeepers based on power consumed and the square footage of their outlets. In 2024 we had the ‘Tajir Dost scheme’, announced by the same finance minister who gave us the latest budget.
And what do we have to show for this decade-long effort? Vast databases of non-compliant individuals and businesses?
All these schemes and gimmicks show us a state thrashing around within the shrinking confines of its resource envelope. Meanwhile, every year the same ritual plays out. A new scheme is announced, and the burden on those who pay is increased further, while we are all reminded that times are hard and the fiscal space is limited. This stasis, this inability to drive any change, is taking the state deeper and deeper into non-viability as it is forced to squeeze more from less and borrow the remainder. This was the year when that could have changed.
Instead, we got this elephantine mediocrity they’re calling a budget. Another year of treading water. Another year of limping from one IMF review to the next, with no end in sight.

Published in Dawn, June 12th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-12 04:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/684a42fcebaaf.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916674/state-of-the-economy' target='_blank'><strong>State of the economy</strong></a><br><p>SINCE 1988, Pakistan has been in 14 IMF programmes.
On each occasion, without fail, the economy has achieved stabilisation similar to what it is experiencing currently. Each time, the government of the day has launched into a song and dance to celebrate an invariably short-lived achievement. More importantly, one that has come at great human cost.
This time is different, however. Not because the incumbent government has embarked on a path of serious reform that will break the country free from its continual dependence on the IMF.
But because the current IMF programme is the harshest in Pakistan’s history, demanding a level of fiscal austerity that has exacted an un­­precedented toll of economic devastation, misery and impoverishment. Ordinary Pakista­nis have paid a very heavy price for the stabilisation the government is celebrating. And there is no place for their suffering in the official narrative.
 
 

A deadly combination of declining real incomes with rising unemployment and poverty, has meant that ordinary Pakistanis are in economic distress as never before. According to the government’s own statistics, from the recently published 7th Population and Housing Census-2023, over 18 million Pakistanis are now officially unemployed, with the jobless rate at an unheard of 22 per cent. Youth unemployment has hit an all-time high of 29pc.
Though not strictly comparable, the corresponding figure from the Labour Force Survey 2020-21, was 6.3pc — or 4.5m unemployed Pakistanis recorded two years prior to the digital census. This points to a steep increase in unemployment in a short span of time.

Beyond the official hype, the economic reality of ordinary Pakistanis is dire.

Not surprisingly, given the widespread joblessness, the latest poverty statistics are equally alarming. According to the World Bank, nearly 45pc of the population is now below the economic waterline, of $4.2/day. Using a lower international poverty line (of $3.65/day based on 2017 PPP), an additional 12.8m Pakistanis have been pushed into poverty since 2022, for a total of over 107m citizens. As in the case of unemployment, this is very likely the sharpest increa­­se over a two-year period in Pakistan’s history.
Placed in the context of faltering economic growth and an unprecedented loss in purchasing power for the average Pakistani since 2022, the foregoing statistics, however shocking on their own, are likely understating the true scale of economic misery being experienced by the masses.
Real GDP growth has averaged only 1.7pc since 2022-23, the lowest three-year average growth ever recorded since 1952 — and well below the population growth rate. All the main growth engines of prosperity in the economy have sputtered since 2023. Agriculture has performed poorly, with major crops posting one of the largest declines ever recorded. The Manufacturing sector has contracted over 10pc cumulatively since 2022-23. The Services sector has grown at two-thirds its long-run average rate of growth.
 
 

No economic sector or population segment has been spared. Farm incomes have collapsed, leading to a poverty rate of 50pc in rural areas, according to the World Bank. Countless factory workers are now jobless, while middle class households across Pakistan struggle to make ends meet. Since March 2022, the purchasing power of an average Pakistani has declined by 58pc. This means anyone earning Rs50,000 per month in March 2022, now has a purchasing power of just Rs20,833.
None of this should be surprising given the nature of the IMF programme. Widespread factory closures and industrial job losses, devastation of the farm sector, and the decimation of the middle class are the hallmarks of the Fund’s anti-growth and anti-people austerity policies. The social devastation visited upon Greece since 2010 is a glaring example. As I have previously written, despite the emphasis on social safety nets, the IMF gets the burden of adjustment of its programmes so tragically wrong.
How then can one explain the wide disconnect between the harsh daily struggles of ordinary Pakistanis set against official celebration of macroeconomic stabilisation? And the supportive, and sometimes embarrassingly gushing, endorsement from the IFIs?
It is useful to remember that Pakistan has received similar endorsements from the IMF and World Bank, the sovereign credit rating agencies and the likes of Barron’s, multiple times in the past. In each case, there is a combination of a particular set of incentives or a narrow point of view at work.
 
 

In the case of the IMF especially, there are professional as well as institutional incentives at work that can lead to over-hyping results of a programme, or condoning lapses. IMF mission chiefs and their management have every incentive to avoid a failed programme as it can be career-limiting. To do so, they can indulge in playing up programme successes, or pursue performative reforms to notch marginal wins to amplify the ‘success-factor’ of the programme under their watch.
The institutional incentive for the IMF is to portray, as quickly as possible, both to the financial markets as well as to bilateral donors, that a programme country under its watch is now eligible for a resumption of capital flows. This also plays out via the fairly charitable and ‘behind the curve’ debt sustainability assessments the Fund produces.
To left-leaning critics of the Bretton Woods Institutions, there is a hidden, more sinister dynamic at play. Support from the West in terms of access to funding from the IFIs, and the subsequent endorsements from the BWIs, are part of a system-legitimising re-stratification effort to consolidate the hold of Western-aligned ruling elites on power.
In Pakistan’s case, this plays out as timely and generous financial assistance, spinning a helpful narrative, facilitating political largesse and profligate spending in the budget for the past over two years while imposing austerity policies on ordinary Pakistanis. The IMF has much to answer for.
With one in two Pakistanis now below the poverty line, and nearly one in four unemployed, the state of Pakistan’s economy has never been as dismal and worrisome as over the past three years. This is the human cost of the stabilisation the government and the IMF are celebrating — and sadly, glossing over.

Published in Dawn, June 12th, 2025</p><small>2025-06-12 04:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/12083005f8bedd7.jpg?r=083618' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916667/lack-of-direction' target='_blank'><strong>Lack of direction</strong></a><br><p>FINANCE Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb’s call to fellow parliamentarians, seeking support for new legislation that would give sweeping punitive powers to the FBR for tax enforcement and tax-related litigation, underlines the resistance he fears from his own party and coalition partners as well as the opposition.
His concerns are not unfounded. Speaking at the post-budget press conference yesterday, he recounted how he was stopped at the last minute from announcing a proposal to withdraw sales tax exemptions for the steel and edible oil industry in ex-Fata/Pata in the budget for the outgoing fiscal year. The proposal has now been included in the next year’s budget.
 
 

He twice told lawmakers that they have the option of either passing the legislation and empowering the tax machinery to recover Rs389bn through enforcement measures, or to prepare for additional taxation to achieve the budgeted target.
Even if his plan goes according to script, the overall FBR target of Rs14.1tr, up by nearly 19pc from this year’s collection of Rs11.9tr, appears too ambitious due to overly optimistic GDP growth expectations, moderate inflation targets, and the absence of steps to effectively tax the undertaxed and untaxed segments. Some analysts resultantly expect the tax target to be revised downward in the coming months.
And it is not just the tax target: the government’s growth projection also faces the risk of downward revision. Islamabad says it plans to pursue an admittedly moderate growth rate of 4.2pc without breaching the IMF’s red lines or putting pressure on the precarious external sector. It appears to be betting on the rejuvenation of the real estate sector through the announced tax relief and expectations of a continued upward trend in remittances.
But this will prove to be a challenge, considering the fact that the new budget focuses on meeting the stabilisation goals of the IMF loan; public development spending continues to shrink as the government curtails expenditures to contain the large budget deficit; and big industry and major crops are contracting.
 
 

In short, few believe that a government desperate to grow the economy can actually pull it off, as the dynamism required is not visible. This is underlined by the downward revision of the IMF’s growth projection for FY26 from the previous 4pc to 3.6pc a few months earlier. At the presser, the minister dubbed his second budget an “East Asian moment” for Pakistan.
However, a budget devoid of bold reforms and a strategic direction, thanks to the ruling PML-N’s political concerns, can hardly be described in such terms. Even if we, for a moment, accept that the budget will meet its growth goals, it will remain unsustainable without a structural shift in the economy.

In a petition, it instead requested retention of approximately Rs800 million in its accounts on the same pattern as the regulator had allowed fuel cost savings worth Rs15.2 billion in past claims. KE reported that its fuel cost came out to be Rs4.69 per unit lower than it had charged consumers in April, resulting in a fiscal impact of Rs7.2bn.
KE submitted that pursuant to the determination of the generation tariff for its power plants for the period post-June 2023, it had submitted the required partial load, open cycle and degradation curves along with startup cost for approval and an amount of Rs16bn for the period July 2023 to April 2025 was accordingly pending for adjustment.
Additionally, the heat rate adjustments for its two plants at Korangi and Port Qasim, for the previous multi-year tariff amounting to Rs600m and Rs200m, were also pending.

Regulator fixes public hearing on 19th to decide retention plea

Out of this, the regulator has already set aside Rs15.2bn in KE’s fuel cost decisions for November 2024 to March 2025. KE has requested the regulator “to also consider aforementioned adjustment of accumulated actualisation of fuel cost so that the recovery can be made from the negative fuel cost variation of March 2025 and April 2025 to ensure consumers are not burdened at a later stage”.
 
 

Nepra has scheduled June 19 for the public hearing to examine whether the requested FCA was justified and KE followed the merit order when despatching to its power plants, as well as when purchasing power from external sources, including the cheaper national grid.
While Nepra has already settled through its five monthly determinations by allowing Rs15.2bn out of Rs16bn, just to complete the formality, it has also raised the question of the KE’s request for adjustment of accumulated actualisation of fuel cost on account of partial load, open cycle and degradation curves along with startup cost from July 2023 to April 2025, from the negative fuel cost variation was justified.
The FCA is reviewed monthly, in accordance with the tariff regime applicable nationwide.

• US president warns protests at army parade will be met with force
LOS ANGELES: Protests against Donald Trump’s harsh immigration policies spread on Wednesday across the United States despite a military-backed crackdown in Los Angeles and a threat by the Republican president to use “heavy force.”
In Los Angeles, where the unrest began last Friday, the downtown area was calm but tense after an overnight curfew saw police make 25 arrests.
Heavily armed officers patrolled near government buildings, and storekeepers boarded up windows to protect against vandalism.
US Marines — ordered by Trump to deploy in addition to more than 4,000 National Guard soldiers — were expected to make their first appearance on the streets on Wednesday.
“US military troops deployed to Los Angeles are allowed to temporarily detain individuals until law enforcement agents arrive to arrest them,” a senior US military official said.  The mostly peaceful protests ignited over a sudden escalation in efforts to apprehend migrants who were in the country illegally.
 
 

Pockets of violence — including the burning of self-driving taxis and hurling stones at police — triggered a massive response from authorities using tear gas and other non-lethal weapons.
Trump won the election last year partly on promises to combat what he claims is an “invasion” by undocumented migrants.
He is now seizing the opportunity to make political capital, ordering the California National Guard to deploy despite Governor Gavin Newsom’s objections, the first time a US president has taken such action in decades.
Trump then tested the constitutional limits of his power even further by ordering about 700 Marines — a force designed primarily for combat in foreign wars — to the scene.
“If our troops didn’t go into Los Angeles, it would be burning to the ground right now,” Trump insisted on social media Wednesday.
But in a televised address late on Tuesday, Newsom said “democracy is under assault right before our eyes.” “California may be first, but it clearly won’t end here,” the Democrat said.
Trump has expressed support for a call by one of his top officials to arrest Newsom, who is seen as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2028, when Trump will be required by the constitution to step down.
 
 

Despite Trump’s threats to deploy the National Guard to other Democratic-run states over the objections of governors, protesters appear undeterred.
Thousands marched in New York and Chicago late on Tuesday.
Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he was deploying the state’s National Guard to counter a protest announced for San Antonio on Wednesday.
Demonstrations were also planned on Wednesday in New York, Seattle and Las Vegas ahead of what organisers say will be a nationwide “No Kings” movement on Saturday, when Trump will attend a highly unusual military parade in the US capital.
In a speech at an army base on Tuesday, Trump warned that any protests during the Washington parade would face “very heavy force.”
The parade, featuring warplanes and tanks, has been organised to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the founding of the US Army but also happens to be the day of Trump’s 79th birthday.

• Hospitals across Punjab receive scores of heatstroke patients
• Authorities ask people to remain indoors, stay hydrated
• Met Office expects hot spell to continue for 48-72 hours
LAHORE: Amid no let-up in extreme heat that has engulfed Pakistan since last week, almost all cities in Punjab reported temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius, with Bhakkar and Sindh’s Jacobabad topping the charts with 49°C.
The intense weather is expected to continue today as well, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department. “Mainly hot and dry weather is expected in most parts of the country, while very hot in plain areas,” it said in a statement posted on its website.
“However, dust-raising/gusty winds are likely in plain areas during the afternoon. Partly cloudy weather with isolated rain-wind/thunderstorm is likely in upper Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Potohar region, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan during the evening/night,” it added.
The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) reported extreme conditions across Punjab, including Sargodha City at 47.8°C, Gujranwala and Hafizabad at 47.5°C, and Lahore at 46.2°C. Only the hill station of Murree offered some respite with a relatively cooler temperature of 32°C.
Like Punjab, the rest of the country sizzled as well, bringing life to a standstill. In Sindh, Jacobabad reported 49 and Mohenjo-Daro simmered at 48°C. Larkana and Sukkur recorded 47°C. Karachi experienced sweltering 40°C with 70% humidity, making conditions unbearable for citizens in the port city.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) plains, including Peshawar and Dera Ismail Khan, baked at 45-46°C. The northern mountainous areas remained relatively cooler, however. Balochistan’s Sibi and Turbat reported 47°C, while Quetta witnessed a comparatively mild temperature of 38°C.
Across Punjab, people avoided stepping outside to hide from the sun while markets and streets wore a deserted look during the afternoon. The relentless heat left streets deserted during the afternoon, with vendors and labourers struggling to cope. “The heat is unbearable. Even standing in the shade feels like being in an oven,” said Muhammad Asif, a rickshaw driver in Lahore.
Due to extreme heat, hospitals in Punjab received scores of heatstroke cases, which were treated by the authorities that had set up dedicated counters in the state-run hospitals. Most cases were reported particularly among labourers, the elderly and children. To add to the misery were the intermittent power outages in various cities, leaving many without fans or air-conditioning.
In light of the heatwave, the National Disaster Management Authority alerted all provincial departments to remain vigilant as the heatwave persists.
In response to the crisis, the Punjab government issued directives to mitigate the situation.
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabil Javed ordered all commissioners and deputy commissioners to remain on high alert. He said the authorities were providing cool drinking water at public spaces, transport hubs, and markets, and hospitals had set up heatstroke emergency counters, and medical supplies were stocked to treat heat-related illnesses.
He said that the water supply in Cholistan was being closely monitored to prevent shortages.
The authorities issued health advisories urging citizens to stay hydrated, avoid unnecessary outdoor activities between 11am-4pm and watch for heatstroke symptoms.
Residents were encouraged to wear light-coloured, loose cotton clothing and stay hydrated. Special attention was called for children, the elderly, and sick individuals who are at highest risk, with authorities recommending they remain in cool environments.
People were advised to avoid strenuous work or exercise in direct sunlight and to call PDMA’s emergency helpline 1129 in case of experiencing heatstroke symptoms.
The Met department predicts no immediate relief, with the heatwave expected to continue for the next 48-72 hours.
“This is a life-threatening situation,” warned PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia, stressing that vulnerable groups must be protected at all costs.

The case was dropped from the cause list after Justice Mohammad Asif, a member of Islamabad High Court division bench, headed by acting Chief  Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar, proceeded on leave.
Senior PTI leaders, including party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Leader of the Opposition in the Natio­nal Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, and Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan, arrived at the IHC and met officials in the chief justice’s secretariat to press for rescheduling the hearing.
After a two-and-a-half-hour wait, the court fixed June 26 as the new date for hearing the pleas, seeking suspension of sentence.
Security at the IHC was visibly heightened, with additional personnel dep­lo­yed and barbed wires ins­t­alled around entrances amid PTI leaders’ presence and media activity.
Speaking to the media outside the court, the party chairman expressed disappointment over the delay but remained optimistic about Mr Khan’s early release.
“The judge was on leave, so the case could not be heard today. But the day is not far when the PTI founder would walk free,” he said.
He criticised the backlog of cases, stating that proceedings of cases such as the present one should be concluded within a month.
He also voiced concern over the deteriorating state of justice, pointing out that the country now ranks 129th in the Rule of Law Index, down from 97th in 1996.

• France-based charity accuses Tel Aviv of deadly strike on its office building
CAIRO: Israeli gunfire and airstrikes killed at least 60 Palestinians in Gaza on Wednesday, most of them near an aid site operated by the US- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation in the centre of the enclave, local health officials said.
Medical officials at Shifa and Al-Quds hospitals said at least 25 people were killed and dozens wounded as they approached a food distribution centre near the former Jewish settlement of Netzarim before dawn.
Israel’s military said its forces fired warning shots overnight towards a group of suspects as they posed a threat to troops in the area of the Netzarim Corridor.
“This is despite warnings that the area is an active combat zone. The IDF is aware of reports regarding individuals injured; the details are under review,” it said.
Later on Wednesday, health officials at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip said at least 14 people had been killed by Israeli gunfire as they approached another GHF site in Rafah.
The foundation said it was unaware of Wednesday’s incidents but added that it was working closely with Israeli authorities to ensure safe passage routes are maintained, and that it was essential for Palestinians to closely follow instructions.
“Ultimately, the solution is more aid, which will create more certainty and less urgency among the population,” it said by email in response to Reuters questions.
“There is not yet enough food to feed everyone in need in Gaza. Our current focus is to feed as many people as is safely possible within the constraints of a highly volatile environment.” In a statement, GHF said it distributed 2.5 million meals on Wednesday, the largest single-day delivery since it began operations, bringing to more than 16 million the number of meals provided since its operations started in late May.
Gaza’s health ministry says that since then, 163 Palestinians had been killed and over 1,000 wounded trying to obtain the food boxes.
The United Nations has condemned the killings and has refused to supply aid via the foundation, which uses private contractors with Israeli military backup in what they say is a breach of humanitarian standards.

Elsewhere in Gaza on Wednesday, its health ministry said at least 11 other people were killed by separate Israeli gunfire and strikes across the coastal enclave.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday there had been “significant progress” in efforts to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza, but that it was “too soon” to raise hopes that a deal would be reached.
Two Hamas sources told Reuters that they did not know about any breakthrough in negotiations.
Violation of international law
Medical charity Medecins du Monde on Wednesday accused Israel of violating international law with drone strikes on a building housing one of its offices in war-torn Gaza that killed eight people, none of them staff.
The France-based aid group said in a statement the attack on Tuesday “constitutes a serious violation of international humanitarian law, which protects both civilian populations and humanitarian organisations operating in conflict zones”.
The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“Yesterday morning, at around 11am local time, a building in Deir el-Balah housing a Medecins du Monde office was attacked by drones,” the aid group said.
Its staff had not been present as they had been off as part of the Eid al-Adha holiday, it added.
“At least eight people were killed in the bombardment. All were on the last floor of the building,” it said, without providing more details on those killed.
“Medecins du Monde had informed the Israeli military of the presence of its office, which had officially been declared ‘deconflicted’, or shielded from Israeli military attacks under humanitarian coordination agreements,” it said.

• Banks, couriers to deduct withholding tax under new plan
• Fine for failing to submit withholding tax statements raised by 10 times
• Govt to take over property valuation powers from FBR
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has proposed sweeping reforms to tighten tax compliance, including significantly higher penalties for non-compliance and stronger enforcement measures to target under-taxed and digitally active sectors.
The changes, proposed in the Finance Bill 2025, aim to deter non-compliance, discourage cash-based transactions and enh­ance documentation of the economy. Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said enforcement was the only viable option to boost revenue collection, rather than relying on new taxes.
 
 

One of the key amendments is a tenfold increase in the penalty for failure to submit withholding tax statements — from Rs5,000 to Rs50,000. Authorities believe this will compel withholding agents to comply with deadlines and file statements within the due date.
A substantial penalty has been proposed for online marketplaces that allow unregistered, non-resident vendors engaged in e-commerce to sell digitally ord­ered goods without proper registration under the Sales Tax Act and the Income Tax Ordinance.
 
 

Under the proposed framework, the first violation would incur a fine of Rs500,000, with subsequent defaults carrying a penalty of Rs1 million. These fines would apply to both online platforms and courier services facilitating such transactions.
According to the Finance Bill, if a banking company, payment gateway or courier service provider fails to deduct tax when making payments to sellers or neglects to remit the deducted tax, the government proposes strict penalties.
In cases involving digitally ordered goods or the provision of digitally delivered services via e-commerce platforms, the government proposed a penalty equal to 100 per cent of the tax amount for violations.
The government has made banks and courier services withholding agents for deducting withholding tax and sales tax from buyers of online goods and services. The collected tax will be submitted to the FBR, while the remaining amount will be transferred to the seller.
The Finance Bill 2025 introduces several revisions across various sections, tightening restrictions on economic transactions by certain individuals. These limitations were initially outlined in the Tax Laws Amendment Bill 2024.
Under the proposed amendments, the federal government — rather than the FBR — will be responsible for notifying the value of immovable property. Until this valuation is officially declared, restrictions on registering, recording or attesting property transfers will not take effect, and no individual will be deemed ineligible for such transactions.
The Finance Bill 2025 also expands exemptions to restrictions on bank account operations. Pensioner accounts, along with previously exempted Aasan accounts, are now explicitly excluded from limitations on opening or maintaining current or savings accounts.
The bill seeks to broaden the definition of an “eligible person” by including individuals who have submitted a statement of investment sources and expenditures, demonstrating sufficient resources and providing an explanation for a specific purchase or investment transaction.
The bill removes “special child” from the definition of immediate family members and eliminates the age limit of 25 years for a child’s classification as an immediate family member. As a result, individuals aged 26 or older who remain financially dependent on their parents will now qualify under this definition.
The definition of “sufficient resources” has also been broadened to encompass cash in local or foreign currency, the fair market value of gold, and the net realisable value of stocks, bonds, receivables or other prescribed cash-equivalent assets.
Individuals may declare these assets in their sources of investment and expenditure statements or their wealth statements filed for the latest tax year.
For companies and associations of persons (AOPs), sufficient resources include cash and equivalent assets reported in financial statements accompanying the income tax return for the latest tax year.
The Finance Bill proposes a proviso in the definition of sufficient resources, specifying that when an asset is acquired through the exchange of capital assets already declared in a wealth statement, financial statement or sources of investment and expenditure statement, the disposed capital assets shall be considered part of cash-equivalent assets, up to the value stated in the agreement.

Dr Mahrang Baloch, a leader of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC), is held at the Hudda District Prison, Quetta, pursuant to a March 22 detention order by the deputy commissioner under the Mainte­nance of Public Order.
 
 

Moved through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi, the appeal pleaded that Mah­rang Baloch had challen­ged her detention before the BHC, but the high court rejected her plea.
Now the appeal before the apex court contended that the high court order was contrary to the Cons­titution, law and facts.
The federal governm­ent through interior ministry, home and tribal aff­airs department of Baloch­istan, prosecutor general, inspector general of police, Federal Investiga­tion Agency director general, Quetta deputy commissioner and the state have been named as res­pon­dents in the petition.
The petition alleged that her repeated unlawful det­e­n­tion and labelling her as a sympathiser of militants was a planned effort by the respondents to stop her from raising voice for missing persons. It apprised the court that her father and brother too were subjected to enforced disappearance in 2011 and 2017.
Along with the main appeal, a separate application was also filed before the Supreme Court, seeking suspension of the BHC order during the pendency of the present case.
Another petition challenging the extension of detention order is also expected to be filed before the SC in a day or two.
The main appeal pleaded that in December 2023, the “Baloch Long March”, organised and led by the detenue and other members of the BYC, was allegedly met with excessive and unlawful force.
The petition alleged that following a militant attack on a passenger train on March 11, there was a marked escalation in retaliatory measures by the state. On March 20, Bebarg Zehri, a BYC central committee member and his brother were abducted from their residence, the petition alleged, adding on March 19, their relative Saeeda Baloch was arrested and unlawfully detained for two days without any formal charge.
The appeal contended that the BHC erred by not ensuring the production of all the relevant material before it on which Balochistan MPO was passed so that the high court could have satisfied itself regarding reasonableness, arbitrariness and legality of the MPO.
It reminded that the SC held in 2003 that it was incumbent upon the detaining authority to place entire material before court on which basis the detention order was passed, regardless of any claim of privilege related to any document, as the high court was competent to decide the same and satisfy itself regarding the existence of the requisite condition of MPO of the detaining authority.
The court was apprised that the balance of convenience was in favour of the petitioner and irreparable loss would be caused to the petitioner unless the operation of the high court order was not suspended during the pendency of the present case.
The petitioner asserted that the deputy commissioner by issuing MPO order acted in clear excess of his statutory mandate, since it was issued unilaterally by him without securing the requisite approval from the chief minister.

The visit reflects the deep-rooted fraternal ties between Pakistan and the UAE, which are marked by mutual trust, shared values, and close cooperation across multiple sectors, said an official press rel­ease issued here on Wednesday.
The prime minister will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Deputy Prime Min­ister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar, federal ministers, and other senior officers.
PM Shehbaz will hold high-level meetings with the UAE leadership, including a bilateral meeting with the President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.
A wide range of bilateral, regional, and global issues of mutual interest and concern will be discussed during the high-level interactions.
The PM’s visit will serve to further stre­n­g­then the longstanding bro­­therly rel­a­tions between Pakistan and the UAE, deepen economic ties, and foster multifaceted collaboration.
Record remittances
Earlier, PM Shehbaz expressed satisfaction over increase in remittances during May 2025 which was 13.7 per cent more than the previous fiscal year.
In a statement, the prime minister said the country had received some $34.9 billion in remittances during the current fiscal year, which was 28.8pc higher than the outgoing financial year.
“$3.7 billion was received in re­­mittances during May 2025, which is 13.7 per cent more than May last year. The increase in remittances is evidence of the growing confidence of overseas Pakistanis in the economic policies of the government,” the prime minister said.
PML-Q delegation meets PM
Meanwhile, a delegation of the PML-Q on Wednesday called on PM Shehbaz and expressed full support for all the initiatives taken by him for the country’s economic development and public welfare.
The delegation, led by Minister for Overseas Pakistanis Chaudhry Salik Hussain, comprised MNAs Chaudhry Hussain Elahi, Mu­­h­a­mmad Ilyas Chaudhry and Farukh Khan, the PM Office Media Wing said in a press release.
The MNAs praised the prime minister and his team for presenting the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026 in the National Assembly.
The delegation said that both the military and political leadership were working tirelessly for the national development and the welfare of the people.
They also lauded the prime mi­­nister’s exemplary leadership during the recent tensions with India and his efforts to elevate the country’s prestige at the global stage.

Weinstein, once one of the most powerful figures in Hollywood, is facing a retrial after a state appeals court last year overturned his 2020 conviction. He was accused by prosecutors in the case of raping an aspiring actress and assaulting two other women.
Weinstein, 73, pleaded not guilty and has denied assaulting anyone or having non-consensual sex.
The jury found Weinstein guilty on one of the three counts he faced, which stemmed from his alleged assault of former production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006.
The jury found Weinstein not guilty of a charge stemming from his alleged assault of Kaja Sokola in 2002 when she was a 16-year-old aspiring actress.
The jury has not yet reached a verdict on a third count, which charges him with raping aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013. They will resume deliberations on that count on Thursday.
Regardless of their eventual verdict on the rape charge, Weinstein faces up to 25 years in prison when he is sentenced. He has separately been sentenced to 16 years in prison following a rape conviction in California.
 
 

Jurors in the New York case reached their partial verdict on the fifth day of sometimes fractious deliberations.
Before the jury announced their verdict on Wednesday, Justice Curtis Farber met privately with one person on the 12-member jury referred to as Juror One. The judge then stated in open court that there had been “fighting” in the jury room.
“Juror One has made it very clear that he is not going to change his position,” Farber said, adding that Juror One did not tell him what his position was. “He indicated that at least one other juror made comments to the juror that I’ll meet you outside one day, and theres yelling and screaming.”
Weinstein’s lawyer Arthur Aidala asked for a mistrial. As Farber was preparing to dismiss jurors for the day to give them a chance to “cool off”, the jury sent a note indicating it had reached a verdict on some counts.
The retrial began on April 23. Weinstein has had a litany of health problems and attended the retrial in a wheelchair.
In closing arguments on June 3, the prosecution told the 12 jurors that the evidence showed how Weinstein used his power and influence to trap and abuse women.
The defence countered that the accusers lied on the witness stand out of spite after their consensual sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer failed to result in Hollywood stardom.
MeToo milestone
A jury had in February 2020 found Weinstein guilty of raping Mann and sexually assaulting Haley. Sokola’s allegation was not part of that case.
The conviction was a milestone for the MeToo movement, which encouraged women to come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct by powerful men.
But the New York Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court, threw out that conviction in April 2024. It said the trial judge erred by letting women testify that Weinstein had assaulted them, though their accusations were not the basis of the criminal charges.
Though the conviction was thrown out, Weinstein has remained behind bars because of his California conviction. He is appealing that verdict. More than 100 women, including famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of misconduct.
The retrial was handled by prosecutors with the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg. They portrayed Weinstein as a serial predator who promised career advancement in Hollywood to women, only to then coax them into private settings where he attacked them.
The defence rejected that characterisation, saying Weinstein engaged in “mutually beneficial” relationships with his accusers, who ended up with auditions and other show business opportunities.
Weinstein co-founded the Miramax studio, whose hit movies included “Shakespeare in Love” and “Pulp Fiction”. His own eponymous film studio filed for bankruptcy in March 2018, five months after sexual misconduct accusations against him became widely publicised.
Weinstein has experienced several health episodes while being held at New York City’s Rikers Island jail, and in September was rushed to a hospital for emergency heart surgery.</p><small>2025-06-11 19:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11234907c929808.jpg?r=234958' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916546/punjab-govt-accords-high-priority-to-hafizabad-gang-rape-case' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt accords high priority to Hafizabad gang-rape case</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Prosecutor General Syed Farhad Ali Shah on Wednesday took notice of the Hafizabad gang-rape incident and declared it a “high-profile” case for the police to pursue.
Last week, Hafizabad police launched raids to arrest eight suspects who allegedly abducted a couple in Hafizabad and subjected them to physical and sexual assault.
 
 

A first information report (FIR) filed by the husband at the Kasoki Police Station said that the incident occurred on April 25 when the complainant and his wife were on a motorcycle and they stopped for a bit. As the wife got off the motorcycle, a man came towards them who verbally abused and hit her, it stated.
A group of armed men later arrived and took the couple to a secluded place near a graveyard, the FIR said, detailing how the couple were subjected to physical violence, sexual assault, and robbery.
According to a press release issued by the prosecutor general’s office today, the prosecutor general declared the case as “high-profile”,  summoning the investigating officer (IO) along with the record under Section (3)10C of the Punjab Criminal Prosecution Service Act, 2006.
The IO appeared with the record and briefed the Punjab government official regarding the investigation, it said.
“The prosecutor general of Punjab issued a line of inquiry and instructed the IO to complete the investigation on merit,” the press release added.
Shah was quoted as saying that, according to the vision of Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, it was the responsibility of the state to protect the honour and dignity of women.
“The state will use all its resources to bring the culprits to justice,” he added.
On June 5, one of the four suspects involved in the incident was allegedly killed in the firing by his own accomplices during an “encounter” with a Crime Control Department (CCD) team near Jorian bridge in Kassoki police precincts, Hafizabad district.
Sources in the CCD said the police had been informed about the presence of the suspects, upon which a team conducted a raid on a premises near Jorrian bridge along an open drain. On seeing the police party, the armed men had opened fire, which was returned by the policemen.
The sources had said that when the firing stopped, the police had found a body which was identified as that of one of the four gang-rape suspects. The sources claimed the suspect was killed in his accomplices’ firing.
They said that the remaining suspects had managed to flee the scene.
 
 

Investigation into the incident had taken a new turn a day later when two policemen were arrested for freeing an alleged rapist after taking bribe a few days after the April 25 incident.
Meanwhile, the Federal Investigation Agency had placed the names of two of the four alleged rapists on the Provisional National Identification List following reports that they were trying to escape abroad.
The list is maintained by the agency to prevent the travel or escape of individuals involved in “heinous crimes”.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
In March, Punjab police arrested three suspects for allegedly gang-raping a woman in Lahore.</p><small>2025-06-11 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11215807e7500f1.jpg?r=220100' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916542/detained-madleen-activists-advocating-for-free-palestine-honoured-in-karachi-protest' target='_blank'><strong>Detained Madleen activists advocating for free Palestine honoured in Karachi protest</strong></a><br><p>Civil society members gathered at Karachi’s Teen Talwar monument on Wednesday to protest the detention of activists on board the Gaza-bound aid ship Madleen and Israel’s ongoing offensive in Gaza, urging people “not to rest until the entire world stands in support of Palestine.”
Earlier this week, Israeli forces detained the members of the aid ship, operating under the Freedom Flotilla Foundation, going to Gaza to break Israel’s siege. The activists, including Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, were carrying baby powder and aid for the besieged enclave. Israel has ramped up its offensive in Gaza, after it ended a ceasefire in March. So far, 55,014 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli airstrikes.
Chanting “Free Palestine” echoing through the city’s intersection, civil society members gathered to decry the Palestinian suffering in the face of Israeli occupation. The crowd sang, rejecting Israel’s actions: “Aisay dastoor ko mai nahi maanta” (I do not accept this system).
Speaking to Dawn.com, activist Sheema Kirmani called out the “hypocrisy shown by the Muslim world around the Palestinian cause.”
“The young activists aboard the Madleen went all the way to deliver aid, and yet our leaders, with all their resources, have no interest in doing the same,” Kirmani said.
Lauding their strength, she hoped that someday, people from Pakistan could also go on such missions.
 
 

On Tuesday, Israel said it deported Thunberg and three others after seizing the Madleen, according to Al-Jazeera.
“Every day, we are full of sadness and anger at what Israel is doing in Gaza,” she lamented, adding that there was “very little we can do except raise our voice, get together and protest.”
“The conflict is not of religion but of land, and of power”, Kirmani added.

Environmentalist and activist Zulfiqar Bhutto Jr, while addressing the crowd, said, “The Palestinian issue is not just for Muslims but for everyone.
“If we call them (Palestinians) our brothers, then why is Pakistan not doing anything for them?”
He added: “Greta and the activists were forced to do this because no country, including ours, was doing anything for Gaza.
A representative from the Women Democratic Front noted: “The West has plenty to say about the perils of Afghan women, but they stay silent at the plight of women in Gaza.”
Also, echoing through the crowd were songs hopeful for a free Palestine, “Woh subha kab ayegi”, people sang, calling for an end to the atrocities by Israel in the conclave.
As Israel ramps up its siege on Gaza, the world has repeatedly called for an end to the offensive.
Another participant, reading out the names and the countries of the activists aboard the Madleen, questioned, “Why is there no one from the Muslim world on the list?”
Drawing parallels with the struggle of Sindhis against “state actors”, Sindh United Party’s Jagdish Ahuja said, “We, too, have been deprived of our land and that is why we have always felt the pain of Palestinians.”
Noting the role of women in the conflict, he said until the “women of Palestine rise [and] the women of Sindh rise, there can be no freedom from oppressive forces.”

The Pew Research Centre found that favorability of the US has dropped in 15 of the 24 countries surveyed.
Trump received his lowest marks in neighbouring Mexico, which he has long disparaged and pressed on migration, with 91 per cent of Mexicans saying they did not have confidence that Trump would do the right thing on world affairs.
Trump led to a downward shift in perceptions of the US as a whole.
In both Mexico and fellow neighbour Canada, which Trump has provocatively said should be the 51st US state, majorities now see the US unfavourably after seeing the country favourably last year when Joe Biden was president.
Views of the US also darkened in most of Europe, with an especially sharp drop in Poland, a frontline ally of Ukraine, as Trump reduces US support for Kyiv and seeks a negotiated solution with Russia.
Sweden, which entered Nato under Biden in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, gave the worst marks to the US among all publics surveyed, with 79pc having a negative opinion of the country.
The survey found that on average majorities from all countries surveyed disagreed with all of Trump’s key global policies including on Ukraine, Gaza, immigration and climate change.
Additionally, 80pc called Trump arrogant and only 28pc found him honest.
Not as bad as first term
Israel, which has enjoyed robust support from its ally in the Gaza conflict, had the most favourable opinion of the US at 83pc, a notch higher under Trump.
Views of the US remained positive in Nigeria and Kenya, which historically have given high marks to the US no matter who is president, and India saw little change, with more than half seeing the US favourably.
Since returning to office, Trump has pursued one of the most sweeping agendas of any US president, which has included eviscerating foreign aid and aggressively deporting migrants.
Nonetheless, the global perceptions of Trump, while negative, were not as bad as they were in 2017 when he first entered the White House. Trump in the first term succeeded Barack Obama, who remained wildly popular in most of the world.
This time, he followed Joe Biden, whose marks were similar to Trump’s globally on the issue of the economy, according to Janell Fetterolf, a senior researcher at the Pew Research Centre.
The past decade has also seen the growing normalisation of right-wing populists.
In Brazil, which Trump’s ideological ally Jair Bolsonaro led from 2019 through 2022, Trump has the confidence this year of 34pc of the public — low, but well above the 14pc he had when he started his first term.
Across the world, Trump consistently enjoyed more support from men than women and was seen more favourably by people on the right of the political spectrum.
But the study also showed the limits of his international appeal. In both Sweden and France, Trump failed to win the confidence of a majority of backers of far-right nationalist parties, although they were more supportive than the general public.
The annual survey contacted 28,333 adults across 24 countries between January and April.</p><small>2025-06-11 18:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11230201f7bf22e.png?r=231159' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916547/board-of-us-fulbright-programme-quits-citing-trump-interference' target='_blank'><strong>Board of US Fulbright programme quits, citing Trump interference</strong></a><br><p>The board overseeing the Fulbright programme, the prestigious exchanges between US and foreign scholars, quit on Wednesday, accusing President Donald Trump’s administration of political interference.
Members of the board, nominated by successive presidents, voiced alarm about “injecting politics and ideological mandates” into a long non-partisan programme.
“The current administration has usurped the authority of the board and denied Fulbright awards to a substantial number of individuals who were selected for the 2025-2026 academic year,” the board members said in a resignation statement posted online.
“The administration is also currently subjecting an additional 1,200 foreign Fulbright recipients to an unauthorised review process and could reject more,” it said.
“We believe these actions not only contradict the statute but are antithetical to the Fulbright mission and the values, including free speech and academic freedom, that Congress specified in the statute.”
The board members chose to resign rather than “endorse unprecedented actions that we believe are impermissible under the law, compromise US national interests and integrity, and undermine the mission and mandates Congress established for the Fulbright programme nearly 80 years ago,” they said.
The State Department didn’t immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
The New York Times reported the board had approved the applications of around 200 American professors and researchers who were set to work at universities and research institutions in other countries this summer, and the State Department was meant to send acceptance letters to the applicants in April.
Instead, board members learned the department’s Office of Public Diplomacy had begun sending rejection letters to the scholars based on the topics of their research.
“The bipartisan Fulbright Board was mandated by Congress to be a check on the executive and to ensure that students, researchers and educators are not subjected to the blatant political favoritism that this administration is known for,” Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement.
“While I understand and respect the bipartisan Fulbright Board for resigning en masse rather than grant credibility to a politicised process, I’m painfully aware that today’s move will change the quality of Fulbright programming and the independent research that has made our country a leader in so many fields,” she added.
The Fulbright programme, which was established in 1946, sends US graduate students, scholars, artists, teachers, and professionals abroad to study, conduct research or teach English in approximately 160 countries worldwide.
The program awards approximately 8,000 competitive, merit-based grants each year in most academic disciplines and fields of study, according to its website.
Named after late senator J. William Fulbright, the scholarship was seen as a major source of US soft power by bringing leading scholars to US universities and sending Americans overseas.
The Trump administration has waged war on US universities, which Vice President JD Vance described before taking office as “the enemy” due to their influence and the often left-leaning views in academia.
 .
Trump has cut off billions of dollars in federal research funds for leading universities, over their purported lacklustre response to anti-Semitism during protests against Israel’s devastating military offensive in Gaza.
The Trump administration has also aggressively revoked visas for students, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio using an obscure law that allows him to remove foreigners deemed to go against US foreign policy interests.
Rubio recently suspended processing of visas for foreign students, who are a major source of revenue for US universities, so the State Department can ramp up screening of applicants’ social media postings.</p><small>2025-06-11 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11225318f9f3a39.jpg?r=225344' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916545/punjab-police-arrest-suspect-for-allegedly-killing-wife-in-okara' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab police arrest suspect for allegedly killing wife in Okara</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab police on Wednesday said they arrested a suspect in Okara for the alleged murder of his wife last month.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Okara’s Renala Khurd Saddar Police Station at the complaint of the woman’s father under Section 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on May 19.
The FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawm.com, said the complainant came to know that his daughter was injured at her house, adding that he “found her murdered with her throat slit when he reached his son-in-law’s home with the latter lying unconscious on the ground in an injured state as well.”
The FIR said the police were subsequently called to the spot. It requested a case and action against the son-in-law, accusing him of the murder with a blade.
A statement from the Okara police spokesperson today said the suspect was arrested and the murder weapon recovered as well, adding that the husband had managed to injure himself as well. It called the murder the “result of a domestic dispute.”
It said legal proceedings had been initiated against the suspect.
“The culprit will be punished as per the law. Anyone who kills anyone unjustly does not deserve any concession,” the statement quoted District Police Officer Rashid Hidayat as saying.
Last Wednesday, a mother of a three-year-old child was allegedly killed by her husband over a family dispute in Dhoke Ghulam Ali, Rawat.

The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
Paposh Nagar Station House Officer (SHO) Shaukat Awan said that two boys were killed after a water tanker hit them near Abdullah College.
“The victims were riding a motorcycle and were on their way towards Banaras Chowk when the tanker descending from the North Nazimabad bridge hit them,” Awan said.
The accident resulted in the death of a 20-year-old and an 18-year-old, he said, adding that the bodies were taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.
He added that the incident enraged passersby, who caught the driver and beat him.
“They attempted to torch the heavy vehicle, but police prevented them,” he said, adding that the driver was arrested and the tanker had been impounded.
Separately, a man was killed and another person was injured when a bus hit them in the city’s Korangi area, according to Sharafi Goth SHO Raja Khalid.
“The victims were riding a motorcycle when a bus belonging to a private company ran them over, resulting in the instant death of one motorcyclist and injuries to the other.
Khalid said, “The driver has been arrested and the vehicle is impounded, while the dead body and the injured person have been moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.”
In another incident, Gadap City police SHO Sarfraz Jatoi said, “A young man was killed while his wife was injured in an accident on the Superhighway.
“The couple was travelling on a motorbike when an unknown vehicle hit them near Kathore. The injured couple was taken to a nearby private hospital, where the husband was pronounced dead.”
He added that the wife sustained minor injuries.
The relatives told the police that they did not want any legal proceedings, he added.
Meanwhile, a policeman was killed in a hit-and-run incident in Baldia, according to Saeedabad SHO Pervez Solangi.
“The policeman was on his way to work when an unknown vehicle hit him, killing him on the spot. The body was taken to the Civil Hospital,” SHO Solangi said.
Last month, the police said that a woman was killed and her husband injured when a water tanker hit their motorcycle and ran them over in Korangi, prompting an angry mob to set the water tanker on fire.
In April, an employee of the Pakistan Navy was killed while another was injured in Karachi’s Baldia after a 10-wheeler trailer hit them, police said.</p><small>2025-06-11 17:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11215202b092530.jpg?r=215938' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916543/us-secretary-of-state-rubio-seeking-sanctions-investigation-of-harvard-report' target='_blank'><strong>US Secretary of State Rubio seeking sanctions investigation of Harvard: report</strong></a><br><p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is pushing to investigate whether Harvard University violated federal sanctions, The New York Times reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by the newspaper.

He made the remarks during a post-budget press conference where he expanded upon the federal budget proposed yesterday for the upcoming FY25-26.
Maintaining an aggressive stance on fiscal consolidation, as required by the Int­ernational Monetary Fund (IMF), Aurangzeb yesterday still managed to offer some notional relief to the salaried class in the federal budget for FY2025-26, along with incentives for the real estate and construction sectors to revive the struggling industrial sector and stimulate economic growth.

Highlights:

Finance minister links no hike in minimum wage with slower inflation
Aurangzeb defends salary hike ‘after 9 years’ for NA speaker, Senate chairman
FBR chief notes levy on solar panels due to ‘disadvantaged’ local assemblers
FBR member explains rationale behind taxing high-value goods at different rates

Miftah Ismail lambastes lack of reforms, inadequate relief measures


Addressing a media briefing in Islamabad today, Aurangzeb acknowledged that past concerns about government expenditures not reducing were the “right pushback”.
However, in the outgoing fiscal year, the minister said the spending had gone up by “just 1.9pc”.
“We have reduced subsidies and debt-servicing costs, and increased some expenditures because this country needed those. But this is our response to those people who are paying taxes in this country that ‘why are you not bringing the government expenditures under control’,” Aurangzeb asserted.
He pointed out that whatever the government was giving was doing so “by taking loans as we start with a deficit”, adding that if the expenditures were not reduced, then the loans would keep surging.
 


At the outset of the press conference, the reporters voiced their concerns about not being given a technical briefing yesterday by the Federal Board of Revenue (FRB) on the Finance Bill 2025, which details the legislation for the proposed measures under the budget.
Subsequently, they walked out of the conference room in protest.
However, flanked by FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial and Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal, Aurangzeb soon continued with his press conference in the presence of some journalists.
Concluding his address, Aurangzeb acknowledged the “worry” caused to reporters and said he “regretted if there was anything of the sort”, referring to the journalists not being briefed.
However, the minister added, he and the FBR chairman “had been appearing before you in terms of having these types of discussions”. “We will continue to accelerate this,” he affirmed, hinting at a plan of engagements with journalists every four to six weeks.
Addressing journalist Mehtab Haider, who spearheaded the journalists’ concerns, Langrial acknowledged that there used to be a “technical briefing” but this time it was decided that Aurangzeb would hold an “essential briefing”.
“Its name is technical briefing but practically, the same questions are raised during it, […] which makes the ministerial press conference slightly less meaningful.
“But if you want, we would hold a separate technical session with you,” the FBR chairman told the journalists.

‘Salaries and pensions linked with slower inflation’
On salaries and pensions for federal employees, which have been raised by 10pc and 7pc, respectively, the finance czar stressed the need for a benchmark.
“If we are saying the inflation is declining, similarly, the salary or pension has to be benchmarked with inflation. This is not just the rule in Pakistan but across the world.”
The minister also pointed out the connection between pay and inflation when asked why the minimum wage of Rs37,000 was not to be increased in the upcoming year.
 
 

“Go to the industries and get their feedback on minimum wage. I think we are in a good place,” he asserted.
Echoing his remarks from yesterday, Aurangzeb stressed that the government tried to give relief “as much as possible” while considering the fiscal space. He also pointed out the 0.5pc reduction in super tax for the corporate sector.

‘Not taxing fertilisers, pesticides negotiated with IMF’
Detailing the measures proposed for property buyers and sellers, Aurangzeb said: “Selling side still gets capital gains but the buying side should get some relief.”
The minister also termed the mortgage financing “as important as the fiscal side of things and what we have to do on the taxation side”.
Speaking on the agricultural sector, Aurangzeb said an additional tax on fertilisers and pesticides was a “benchmark” but it was negotiated with the IMF on the directions of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as it was a “critical input into agriculture” and should not be imposed.
“Again, this is a step in the right direction”, the minister asserted.
The finance czar acknowledged that additional taxes and measures were also talked about last year. “We had to impose those as when we were speaking to international institutions, they were not agreeing with our stance that there can be enforcement in this country,” he said.
Responding to a query, Aurangzeb underscored the need to reduce the role of the middleman in the agricultural sector and increase the financing for small farmers. “It is very critical […] that we have a policy in the devolved subjects.”
He noted that the relevant measures were underway, hence the growth target was decided considering that.
 
 

Expressing the aim to reach a tax-to-GDP ratio of 10.9pc by the next year, the minister said additional taxes were around Rs312 million of the total 2.2 trillion target.
“We have two ways — either we ensure enforcement or we introduce additional measures of up to Rs400 billion to Rs500bn. This is why we will go to the parliament to help us out with the enabling amendments and legislation.”
The minister added: “We have laws, legislation and taxes but we were not able to enforce them, so in this fiscal year, we have worked on enforcement, which has exceeded Rs400bn.”
‘NA, Senate heads’ salaries hiked after 9 years’
Asked about a recent increase in the salaries of the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker, the minister claimed that the last time their salaries were “adjusted” was in 2016.
He emphasised that the hike was “all of a sudden” as it had not been done for the past nine years.
 
 

Responding to a question on how the federal government could delink the statistic of population from the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Aurangzeb asserted, “Everything will be done in consultation with provinces.”
He added, “Nothing will be done [without them], including the national fiscal pact which we signed with the provinces.”
The provinces are projected to receive a record Rs8.2tr from the federal divisible tax pool in the upcoming fiscal year.
The minister also acknowledged a lack of implementation in suggested measures: “Over the past 10 years, I’ve been looking at the state of economy, first in the private sector and now in this job. I have never seen anything going up go downwards.
“I could be wrong; maybe it might have happened in some year,” he added. “It starts with acknowledgement, the undue burden that we had, as the prime minister has said before as well,” Aurangzeb said.
“The things that had never been reversed before have now been put into reversal, but that’s not the eventual end state,” the finance czar highlighted.
He made it clear that the segments that have been under undue burden, “whether it’s the formal sector, the beneficiary sector, the salaried class”, the government should at least give a signal that it was “serious”. “This is just signalling in my perspective from the right direction,” the finance minister said.
Digital economy, energy and tariff reforms
FBR Inland Revenue member Dr Najeeb Ahmad took the floor to answer some questions on sales tax, specifically on cosmetic items, and the digital economy.
Noting that electrical goods were found to be the high-value retail items sold on e-commerce platforms, Dr Ahmad explained that the tax rate for items worth below Rs20,000 was kept at 0.25pc as per the industry input, as sellers with goods valued above Rs200,000 were already keeping a 1pc-1.5pc profit margin.
The FBR official added: “In boutiques where people buy high-value clothes ranging from Rs15,000 to Rs18,000, their profit margin in such cases usually is 10pc, 15pc or 20pc, but we have set the tax rate for that at 2pc.”
 
 

Najeeb noted that grocery items had lower profit margins but naturally were taxed at a higher rate than electrical goods. “We did not follow previous policies that everyone should suffer under the same category,” he emphasised.
Dr Ahmad highlighted that previously, sales tax was charged on delivery orders through online platforms in the form of cash payment but was not filed.
“Not only is our local economy transforming digitally but the global digital framework is also changing, in which Pakistan’s sales tax right is eroding,” he noted, explaining that vendors in other countries evaded taxes by categorising them as exports.
Aurangzeb noted that the government had taken two “very concrete measures” to bring the cash-based economy of Rs9.4tr or more towards documentation.
Asked what the youth was being offered under the proposed budget, the minister underscored the need for the government to provide an “enabling environment for the youth”.
Noting that freelancers earned $400m last year, he said it was important to provide them with education.
“The coders are now earning $8 to 10 per hour; we hope they reach $100 per hour rate,” he said, urging the private sector to lead that goal.
Answering a query on circular debt, FBR chairman Langrial highlighted the revisions last year for power firms’ contracts. He stated that the power sector wanted “major reforms toward cheap credit and an enabling environment”.

When asked about the rationale for applying an 18pc sales tax on imported solar panels, Langrial explained that they came in two forms: assembled and less assembled.
“The one which added value in Pakistan already had an 18pc tax rate. The assembled one from abroad did not, so the local assembly was at a disadvantage.
“We also closed the door for future local assembling, so this was not an option and we have to create a level playing field,” the FBR chairman said, asserting that incentives were unimportant now that the technology had become cheaper.
“The payback period was two years, so we are ending these anomalies.”
Aurangzeb also reiterated the significance of tariff reforms under the five-year National Tariff Policy, which was approved by the government last month.
“People ask us that the revenue will decline but if we have to take this country forward towards an export-led discussion […] I want to go into the details of the steps we have taken,” he said.
The minister noted that additional customs duties were removed in four “lines”, while they were reduced in 2,700 tariff lines, which were “directly linked with those raw materials on the basis of which exporters will benefit”.
He stressed these measures were just for the upcoming year and more will be taken gradually.
 
 

Expanding further on the topic while answering a query. Aurangzeb said: “This is an East Asia moment for Pakistan. Whatever was available in the fiscal space is the direction of travel. We have tried to reduce tariffs. This is not the eventual end state.”
Asked about local investment and lack of incentives, Aurangzeb highlighted the “need to end protectionism, increase productivity [and] reduce the price of raw materials so that not only textile but every industry exporting benefits”.
Responding to a question on bond repayments, the finance czar stated that the first instalment of Eurobonds worth $500m was due in September, while the next was due in March. “We are prepared and willing to pay.”
The minister reiterated his hopes of Pakistan launching yuan-denominated Panda bonds this year, adding that credit enhancement through the Asian Development Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank was in progress.
“As the international credit rating improves, we want to access the euro and US dollar market, which is expected in 2026, but certainly not this calendar year,” Aurangzeb said.
Miftah Ismail lambastes lack of reforms, inadequate relief measures
On the other hand, former finance minister Miftah Ismail lambasted the proposed budget for lack of reforms and inadequate relief measures despite having a “good space to do so”.
Speaking on Geo News today, Ismail said: “I don’t see anything on the budget through which you (government) will take the country towards growth. You could have brought reforms this time according to the country’s requirements; you had such good space to do so.”
He went on to list that international oil prices were low, the country’s current account was in control and had its IMF programme in place, and commodities across the globe were cheaper.
 


Ismail, who resigned as the finance minister in September 2022 and launched a new political party last year, referred to the 2.8pc growth rate in the outgoing year and claimed “anyone could bring such numbers if they have to bring it just on paper through wrong forecasting”.
On the relief measures for the salaried class, Ismail called it a “joke” with the people.
Using an example of a person with a monthly salary of Rs800,000, he said the person was previously liable to pay Rs218,750 in taxes and would now only save Rs7,000 per month — calculations verified by Dawn.com’s income tax calculator.
Ismail stated that the education crisis in Pakistan and the high unemployment rate were among the reasons the government should have given some relief to the people.
 






The finance expert also criticised the “meagre” reduction in the super tax for companies from 10pc to 9.5pc, explaining that they already pay 29pc corporate tax, 15pc dividend tax and 5pc workers’ welfare profit fund.
“You (the government) overspent last year as well,” Miftah said, noting that the civil administration expenditure was recorded at Rs971bn this year despite the government itself highlighting slower inflation.
“Neither you reduced expenditure in PSDP, nor in the current account, nor have you reduced subsidies for power and other sectors,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-11 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11211038ed7b14a.jpg?r=211429' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916540/us-begins-uneasy-fifa-world-cup-countdown-as-trump-moves-marines-to-los-angeles' target='_blank'><strong>US begins uneasy FIFA World Cup countdown as Trump moves Marines to Los Angeles</strong></a><br><p>US cities hosting next year’s FIFA World Cup faced questions on Wednesday about how to reassure international fans concerned by President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and travel ban as the year-to-go countdown began.
The United States, along with Canada and Mexico, is set to co-host the finals, which will feature 48 teams and a record 104 matches in a tournament that FIFA boss Gianni Infantino said would usher in a new generation of football fans.
Celebrities and football stars were due to walk the red carpet at the Fox Studio Lot in Los Angeles — one of the host cities — for the year-to-go event there, a day after President Trump deployed Marines and the National Guard to quell protests.
California Governor Gavin Newsom described the deployment as an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism”, while Trump officials defended it and branded the protests as lawless, blaming local and state Democrats for permitting upheaval.
Los Angeles is one of several host cities that will mark the year-to-go occasion, including New York-New Jersey, which will welcome fans at a waterside festival in Jersey City with the Statue of Liberty in view.
“If we look at [American] football as the US’s sport, soccer is the world’s sport and this is an opportunity for us to welcome people from all over the world,” Alex Lasry, the New York-New Jersey host Committee CEO, told Reuters.
Minky Worden, director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, said FIFA needed to work with the US government to ensure the rights of competitors, support staff, fans and media were protected regardless of their identities or views.
“FIFA should publicly acknowledge the threat US immigration and other anti-human rights policies pose to the tournament’s integrity … [and] should establish clear benchmarks and timelines for the US policy changes needed to ensure respect for immigrants’ rights during the 2026 World Cup and beyond,” she said.
US Democratic leaders raised concerns over a national crisis on Tuesday as Trump moved Marines into Los Angeles to tackle civilian protests over his immigration policies.
“There are certainly things that are happening at the national level, the international level, there are going to be geopolitical issues that we don’t even know right now that are going to affect the tournament,” Meg Kane, a host city executive for Philadelphia told reporters at a Paley Centre event on Monday. “So we recognise that we’re planning within uncertainty.”
FIFA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Infantino confident
FIFA President Infantino said last month after meeting Trump that he was confident the world would be welcomed in for the 2026 World Cup and this year’s Club World Cup, which runs from June 14 to July 13.
But the task of reassuring international fans was complicated by a travel ban that went into effect on Monday, cracking down on what Trump called “foreign terrorists”.
Of the 12 countries facing travel bans, Iran is the only one that has qualified for the 2026 tournament so far. Tehran said on Saturday that the ban showed “deep hostility” toward Iranians and Muslims.
European fans, supporter groups and former players contacted by Reuters said it was too early for anyone to be thinking about revising schedules or reevaluating plans for attending the World Cup.
Alina Hudak, the Miami host committee president and CEO, told Reuters she had been in touch with the local consular corps to address their concerns and to offer support.
“My responsibility is to make sure that we’re ready, that we’re safe, that we’re coordinating logistically with all of our law enforcement agencies, that we’ve done everything we can to ensure that our mass transit system is ready and can handle the volume,” said Hudak.
“And so for me, you know, what’s happening outside of that is something that we’re monitoring, but not something that, quite frankly, I have an impact [on].”</p><small>2025-06-11 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/11211100c66bbfe.png?r=211113' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916533/jaishankars-bellicose-punchlines-show-indias-sheer-frustration-after-failed-military-misadventure-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Jaishankar’s bellicose punchlines show India’s sheer frustration after failed military misadventure: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Wednesday slammed remarks by India’s Minister for External Affairs Subhramanyam Jaishankar regarding how India had the “right to strike Pakistan”, stating that New Delhi’s “bellicose punchlines” showed its “sheer frustration following an unsuccessful military adventure”.
The Indian minister’s comments come in the wake of a four-day military conflict between the nuclear powers last month.
Speaking in Brussels on Tuesday, Jaishankar said when India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi maintained that ‘Operation Sindoor’ was not over, it was a clear message that “we reserve the right to go after terrorists anytime, anywhere if they have done harm to us”.
According to the FO statement, Pakistan rejected Jaishankar’s comments, stating that top diplomats should aim to promote peace and harmony rather than producing “bellicose punchlines”. Criticising his conduct, the FO said the tone and tenor of a foreign minister “should be commensurate with his dignified status”.
 
 

The FO further said: “For the last several years, India has been engaged in a malicious campaign to mislead the international community through a fictitious narrative of victimhood.
“However, India’s continued anti-Pakistan diatribe cannot hide its sponsorship of terrorism beyond its borders, nor can it cover up the state-sanctioned oppression in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.”
It added that instead of pointing fingers at others, India should “introspect on its own involvement in terrorism, subversion and targeted assassinations.”
Reiterating that Pakistan believed in peaceful coexistence, the FO urged India to “stop concocting narratives” to justify its aggressive actions in the wake of the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir.
“The narrative emerging from India betrays sheer frustration, following an unsuccessful military adventure against Pakistan,” the FO said. “Indian leaders would be well-advised to improve the standard of their discourse and discard their obsession with Pakistan.”
The FO stated that while Pakistan pursued peace, it would defend its sovereignty against aggression such as that by India last month.
“History will judge not by who shouted the loudest, but by who acted the wisest,” the statement concluded.
 






A day prior, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman termed India a “belligerent power spinning out of control” in response to Jaishankar’s remarks.
“Pakistan cannot be responsible for every attack in India, which is home to a dozen insurgencies,” she said, adding that “no lessons seem to have been learnt from the encounter with Pakistan, and no evidence provided”.
Pakistan and India have been at odds since the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which saw the killing of 26 tourists. New Delhi, without any evidence, blamed Islamabad for the attack, while the latter strongly denied the claims and offered a neutral probe. The two nations then fought a four-day conflict before the US brokered a ceasefire on May 10.
Earlier this month, Pakis­tan launched a broad-based engagement campaign to present its perspective on the recent conflict with India to the world and counter New Delhi’s unproven allegations. As part of its global outreach, a delegation — including Rehman — has visited the United States, is currently in London and will also head to Brussels.</p><small>2025-06-11 16:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608690-fo-slams-indian-foreign-minister-for-irresponsible-remarks-in-brussels' target='_blank'><strong>FO slams Indian foreign minister for 'irresponsible remarks' in Brussels</strong></a><br><p>

The tourism ministry decision issued this week marks the first time the Damascus authorities have issued guidelines related to what women can wear since Bashar al-Assad was toppled in December.
During the Assad family’s iron-fisted rule of Syria, which was shaped by a secular Arab nationalist ideology, the state imposed no such restrictions, though people often dressed modestly at public beaches, reflecting conservative norms.
The new requirements were set out in a wider decree dated June 9, which included public safety guidelines for beaches and swimming pools ahead of the summer, such as not spending too long in the sun and avoiding jellyfish.
It said that beachgoers and visitors to public pools should wear “appropriate swimwear that respects public decency and the feelings of different segments of society”, requiring “more modest swimsuits” and specifying “the burkini or swimming clothes that cover the body more”.
Women should wear a cover or a loose robe over their swimwear when moving between the beach and other areas, it said.
Men should wear a shirt when not swimming, and are not allowed to appear bare-chested “in the public areas outside the swimming areas — hotel lobbies or … restaurants”, it said.
The decree added that “in public areas outside the beaches and swimming pools”, it was preferable to wear loose clothing that covers the shoulders and knees and to avoid transparent or very tight clothing.
It offered an exception for hotels classed as four stars or above, and for private beaches, pools and clubs, saying “normal Western swimwear” was generally permitted, “with adherence to public morals and within the limits of public taste”.
Since rebels overthrew Assad, fliers have appeared urging women to cover up, but the government has issued no directives ordering them to observe conservative dress codes.
A temporary constitution passed earlier this year strengthened the language on the role of Sharia in Syria.
Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who led an al Qaeda group before cutting ties with the jihadist network, has sidestepped interviewers’ questions on whether he thought Syria should apply Sharia, saying this was for experts to decide.</p><small>2025-06-11 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608689-pakistan-phenomenal-partner-in-counter-terrorism-says-us-centcom-chief' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan 'phenomenal partner' in counter-terrorism, says US Centcom chief</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the US reaffirmed the continuation of counter-terrorism cooperation during a dialogue in Washington on May 10. The dialogue underscored the cooperation between the two countries in addressing the most pressing challenges to regional and global security, including the threats posed by terrorist outfits such as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and IS-K.
The two nations are slated to have another counter-terrorism dialogue this month.
During a House Armed Services Committee hearing in Washington on Tuesday, the general was asked about the situation on the Afghan border with Pakistan, where he outlined that Pakistan has apprehended several “high-value” IS-K operatives.

Hailing a “phenomenal partnership” with Islamabad, Gen Kurilla highlighted that Pakistan has “gone after ISIS Khorasan (IS-K) killing dozens of them.”
“Through a relationship we have with them and providing intelligence, they have captured at least five ISIS Khorasan high-value individuals,” Kurilla said.
“They have extradited back Jaffar, who was one of the key individuals behind the Abbey Gate bombing,” he added, referring to IS-K operative Mohammad Sharifullah, an Afghan national who was arrested by Pakistan earlier this year.
Gen Kurilla added that he received a call from Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir after Sharifullah’s arrest, recounting, “He said ‘I’ve caught him, I’m willing to extradite him back to the United States, please tell the secretary of defence and the president’.
“We’re seeing Pakistan — with limited intelligence that we provided them — go after them using their means to do that and we’re seeing an effect on ISIS Khorasan,” he emphasised.
Gen Kurilla noted that there have been 1,000 terrorist attacks in “the western area” of Pakistan since the start of 2024, noting that they “are in an active counter-terrorism fight right now”.
“They have been a phenomenal partner in the counter-terrorism world,” the Centcom chief added.
Continuing his testimony, Gen Kurilla stated that the US needs to maintain ties with both Pakistan and India.
“We have to have a relationship with Pakistan and with India. I don’t believe it’s a binary switch that we can’t have one with Pakistan if we have one with India,” he argued. “We should look at the merits of the relationship for the positives that it has.”
In April, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in the pair’s first phone call, where America’s top diplomat expressed interest in deepening cooperation in a variety of sectors, including counter-terrorism.
“During the call, DPM (Deputy Prime Minister)/FM Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to strengthening its partnership with the United States,” the Foreign Office said in a statement.
“According to the statement, Dar highlighted Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts between 2013 and 2018, with Rubio appreciating Pakistan’s fight against terrorism and expressing the US’s “desire to further enhance counterterrorism cooperation”.
In an address to the US Congress in March, US President Donald Trump spoke about Sharifullah, praising Pakistan for the arrest.
“Tonight, I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible for that atrocity, and he is on his way here to face the swift sword of American justice,” the US president told Congress. “I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster.”</p><small>2025-06-11 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608679-imran-khan-unlikely-to-walk-free-in-near-future-says-aleema-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan unlikely to walk free in near future, says Aleema Khan</strong></a><br><p>

His statement came against the backdrop of Pakistan’s recent conflict with India triggered by a deadly April 22 attack on tourists in Occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. New Delhi, without evidence, accused Islamabad of backing the attackers — an allegation that led to a four-day military escalation between the two nuclear-armed countries before the United States brokered a ceasefire on May 10.
To present Pakistan’s stance on the escalation and dismiss Indian propaganda, the government constituted a high-level delegation, chaired by Bilawal, to visit major world powers. After holding meetings in the US, the delegation is now in the United Kingdom, after which it will head to the Belgian capital of Brussels to hold talks with the members of the European Commission.
Addressing a press conference at the Pakistan High Commission in London, Bilawal said, “India wants to sabotage President Trump’s peace efforts, but its efforts will be in vain. The US will, if required, drag India to the table as it in the global interest that India and Pakistan make peace for regional stability and move towards development.”
The PPP chairman added that the recent conflict with India had turned the Kashmir dispute into a global issue despite New Delhi’s attempts to call it an “internal matter.”
“During this war, there has been progress regarding Kashmir on the diplomatic front. In 2019, India thought it had turned Kashmir into an internal matter. When Trump said there should be mediation on Kashmir, the issue is now a global issue. India has been forced to accept that Kashmir is a bilateral issue.”
A day earlier, the US Department of State reiterated President Trump’s resolve to work on the Kashmir dispute, saying each step that he takes “is made to solve generational differences between countries”.
Responding to a question on the steps US plans to take in the wake of Trump’s offer, State Department’s spokesperson Tammy Bruce during a press briefing noted, “So, while I can’t speak to his plans, the world knows his nature, and I can’t speak to any details of what he might have in that regard.”
He said the delegation held a meeting with members of the All Parties Kashmir Conference at the British House of Commons, who accepted that the issue has been globalised and they can speak about it.
Other members of the delegation include — Hina Rabbani Khar, Khurram Dastgir, Sherry Rehman, Musadik Malik, Faisal Sabzwari, Bushra Anjum Butt and senior envoys Jalil Abbas Jilani and Teh­mina Janjua.
Bilawal reaffirmed that Pakistan desires peace but will defend itself from Indian aggression if attacked.
“Pakistan believes that through dialogue, all issues — whether Kashmir, water or terrorism — can be resolved.  War is not the solution,” he asserted, adding the message would be conveyed to the European Commission during the visit to Brussels as well.
“India’s narrative is based on lies. Its war and post-war narrative is also based on lies.  The people of India also want to live in peace.
“We have demonstrated that we can defeat India in conventional war as well as on the diplomatic front. We are talking about peace and India about war.”
Answering a question, Bilawal said India had no right to suspend or terminate the Indus Water Treaty — a deal between Pakistan and India that ensures fair distribution of the Indus River system’s waters. Following the Pehalgam attack, New Delhi held the treaty in abeyance.
“The treaty is still intact. India’s statement (on holding the treaty in abeyance) is a violation of the Indus Water Treaty. Even threating to suspend the treaty is a violation of the UN charter. If India suspends it, we have called it an act of war.”
The former minister said India would have to “take back the statement on holding the treaty in abeyance.”
“If we are to create an enabling environment for dialogue, it is necessary that treaties are upheld,” he said.
Bilawal also criticised the recent statement of Indian External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Pakistan, who said that when India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that “Operation Sindoor” was not over, it was a clear message that India “reserved the right to go after terrorists anytime, anywhere if they have done harm to us”.
“Jaishankar is a war monger, not a diplomat. If he thinks threatening nuclear war is diplomacy, then India’s problem isn’t Pakistan, it’s extremism within its own cabinet,” Bilawal said.
“Pakistan rejects these recycled allegations. It is ironic that a country with a sitting prime minister whose reputation speaks for itself… dares to lecture Pakistan, who is a victim of terrorism. Threatening missile strikes and boasting about escalation is not a display of strength, it’s a dangerous sign of regional instability.”
“The world should ask who is the aggressor. Pakistan responded with restraint, India continues to brag about war. Even India’s military has walked back its initial lies. Pakistan air force defended its air space.”
“If Jaishankar is so enamored by Google images, I suggest he Googles Abhinandan,” he quipped, referring to the Indian Air Force fighter pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured on 27 February, 2019, after his plane was shot down inside Pakistani territory.
Bilawal said India has been unable to provide even a shred of evidence on the baseless allegations in the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir in which 26 people lost their lives.
“Pakistan has asked for evidence. We have nothing to hide. If India has proof linking the April attacks to Pakistani soil, Pakistan group, then share with the international community.
“The truth is India knows Pakistan has nothing to do with the attacks. That is why India refused our prime minister’s call for an investigation. That is why to this day, they are hiding the truth from their citizens. This was an indigenous act of terrorism, an Indian intelligence failure, and the Indian government launched a war based on a lie,” he asserted.
The Bhutto scion said Pakistan will continue to peruse peace from “Kartarpur to the ceasefire”, while India continues to pursue “propaganda, polarisation, and war”.
“We want peace, stability and regional integration. All we see from New Delhi since election time is jingoism as a war policy,” he said.
In response to another question, Bilawal said India has targeted Sikh activists in Pakistan and countries around the world, and employing terrorism as a foreign policy that cannot be allowed for any civilised nation.
“I think India’s targeting campaign against Sikhs is a continuing factor why the world wasn’t with them when they raised allegations against Pakistan,” he said.
“The world knows India targeted Sikhs activists, killed them, or paid criminals gangs. India has targeted Sikhs in Pakistan also. Canada has said India paid criminal organisations to target Sikhs. There were also targeted in US and Australia.”</p><small>2025-06-11 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/1116531759f93ac.jpg?r=165321' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1916522/pm-shehbaz-set-to-embark-on-uae-visit-tomorrow-discuss-global-issues-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz set to embark on UAE visit tomorrow, discuss global issues: FO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will undertake an official visit to the United Arab Emirates tomorrow (Thursday) to discuss bilateral, regional and global issues of mutual interest during some high-level meetings.
Over the last few months, UAE expressed the country’s commitment to strengthening its long-standing partnership with Pakistan and announced a $2 billion debt rollover soon after. In April, the two nations signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen the bonds between the people of both nations.
A press release issued by the Foreign Office today said that the visit reflected the “deep-rooted fraternal ties” between Pakistan and the UAE, marked by mutual trust, shared values, and close cooperation across multiple sectors.
“The PM will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, federal ministers, and other senior officers,” the press release said.
“PM Shehbaz will hold high-level meetings with the UAE leadership, including a bilateral meeting with the President of the UAE and Ruler of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.”
“The visit will serve to further strengthen the longstanding brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE, deepen economic ties, and foster multifaceted collaboration,” the press release continued.
It said that the visit was a “manifestation of Pakistan’s and UAE’s shared commitment to bolstering the mutually beneficial strategic partnership, enhancing cooperation in existing areas of mutual interest, and exploring new avenues for further strengthening the bilateral cordial relations.”
In February, PM Shehbaz was invited by UAE leader to participate in the World Governments Summit (WGS) in Dubai, where he delivered a keynote address highlighting Pakistan’s vision for inclusive economic growth, digital transformation and governance reforms.

Iran and the United States have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 accord that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
Since returning to office in January, Trump has revived his “maximum pressure” campaign on Tehran, backing nuclear diplomacy but warning of military action if it fails.
“All its bases are within our reach, we have access to them, and without hesitation we will target all of them in the host countries,” Iran’s Defence Minister Aziz Nasirzadeh said in response to US threats of military action if the talks fail.
“God willing, things won’t reach that point, and the talks will succeed,” the minister said, adding that the US side “will suffer more losses” if it came to conflict.
The United States has multiple bases in the Middle East, with the largest located in Qatar.
Iran and the United States have recently been locked in a diplomatic standoff over Iran’s uranium enrichment, with Tehran defending it as a “non-negotiable” right and Washington calling it as a “red line”.
In an interview published on Wednesday, Trump said he was “less confident” the United States and Iran could reach a deal, in response to a question on whether he believed he could stop Tehran from enriching uranium.
‘A shame’
Iran currently enriches uranium to 60 percent, far above the 3.67-percent limit set in the 2015 deal and close though still short of the 90 percent needed for a nuclear warhead.
Western countries, including the United States and its ally Israel, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons, while Tehran insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes.
Last week, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said enrichment is “key” to Iran’s nuclear programme and that Washington “cannot have a say” on the issue.
During the interview with The New York Post’s podcast ‘Pod Force One’, which was recorded on Monday, Trump said he was losing hope a deal could be reached.
“I don’t know. I did think so, and I’m getting more and more — less confident about it. They seem to be delaying and I think that’s a shame. I am less confident now than I would have been a couple of months ago,” he said.
“Something happened to them but I am much less confident of a deal being made … May be they don’t wanna make a deal, what can I say? And may be they do. There is nothing final,” he added.
On May 31, after the fifth round of talks, Iran said it had received “elements” of a US proposal for a nuclear deal, with Araghchi later saying the text contained “ambiguities”.
 


Iran has said it will present a counter-proposal to the latest draft from Washington, which it had criticised for failing to offer relief from sanctions — a key demand for Tehran, which has been reeling under their weight for years.
On Monday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog began a Board of Governors meeting in Vienna that will last until Friday to discuss Iran’s atomic activities and other issues.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) meeting followed a report issued by it criticising “less than satisfactory” cooperation from Tehran, particularly in explaining past cases of nuclear material found at undeclared sites.
Iran has criticised the IAEA report as unbalanced, saying it relied on “forged documents” provided by its arch-foe Israel.</p><small>2025-06-11 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/608668-nuclear-war-a-reality-warns-bilawal-over-indias-water-threat' target='_blank'><strong>'Nuclear war a reality', warns Bilawal over India's water threat</strong></a><br><p>
