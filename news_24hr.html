The PCB had lodged a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against match referee Andy Pycroft over his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket“, with the board claiming that the referee had asked the Pakistan and India captains “not to shake hands at the time of the toss” for last Sunday’s match.
“Pakistan will not be holding their pre-match press conference today,” the Asian Cricket Council confirmed in a statement on Tuesday ahead of Pakistan’s match against the UAE tomorrow.
The PCB confirmed in a statement later in the day that the board had still not taken a final decision on continuing participation in the Asia Cup.
“The Pakistan Cricket Board has not yet taken any final decision regarding the Asia Cup, “PCB spokesperson Amir Mir said in a statement.
He added that consultations are underway in this regard, and a final decision will be taken by tomorrow (Wednesday).
“The decision will be taken keeping in mind the interests of Pakistan,” Mir said.
Officials of both the PCB and the UAE Cricket Board confirmed earlier to Dawn.com that the press conference had been cancelled.
Pakistan men’s team media manager Syed Naeem Ahmed had confirmed to Dawn.com separately that the team would still hold their practice session today.
 






Indian media outlets claimed earlier in the day, citing “unnamed sources”, that the ICC had dismissed the PCB’s complaint seeking the removal of match referee Pycroft from the ongoing Asia Cup over the official’s conduct violation in Pakistan’s match against India.
However, Indian cricket news outlet Cricbuzz reported, “When contacted, the PCB has denied receiving any communication from the ICC.”
The PCB is yet to issue an official statement on the alleged development.
Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema had flagged his concerns with the match referee and the tournament director Andy Russel about the Indian team’s behaviour, Pyroft’s own actions at the toss, and the umpires’ role in allowing the Indians to walk off the field without the handshake after the match.
A PCB source, requesting anonymity, told Dawn.com on Monday that Cheema had also approached tournament director Andy Russel with his concerns, upon which he was informed that the match referee had been acting at the behest of the BCCI.
 
 

This compelled the PCB to write to the ICC for the withdrawal of Pycroft from the match officials’ roster for the ongoing Asia Cup.
The PCB official had said that the board is contemplating the withdrawal of Pakistan teams from the Asia Cup if Pycroft continues to officiate the Asia Cup matches. And, the PCB seems prepared for the extreme measure, as Naqvi tweeted on Monday: “There is nothing more important to me than the honour and prestige of my country.”
Pycroft is one of the two match referees — the other being Richie Richardson — that the ICC has nominated for this tournament. He is slated to officiate Pakistan’s next game on Wednesday, against the UAE. Pyrcoft had also officiated Pakistan’s first game of the tournament against Oman.
Pakistan were expected to beat the home side in Dubai tomorrow, and they would have faced neighbours India again on Sunday in the Super 4 round of the Asia Cup.

The World Cup, to be hosted later this month under a hybrid model across India and Sri Lanka, will see all of Pakistan’s fixtures staged in Colombo, with political tensions ruling out travel between the two neighbours.
Earlier in the day, veteran batter Sidra Amin smashed a century as The Women in Green set the Proteas a target of 256 to win in the first ODI of the three-match series.
 






South Africa’s reply was led by batters Tazmin Brits and Marizanne Kapp after Sadia Iqbal struck early for the Green Shirts.
They remained unbeaten on 101 and 121 respectively as the Proteas chased down a decent total with 10 balls to spare.
Pakistan skipper Fatima Sana had won the toss and elected to bat first at the Gaddafi Stadium.
Sidra was ably supported by Muneeba Ali as the duo put Pakistan in a strong position to win the first encounter of the three-match series.
Opening batter Muneeba and Sidra anchored the innings with a commanding 147-run stand.
It was Pakistan’s highest second-wicket partnership and third-highest for any wicket in women’s ODIs. The duo brought up the team’s 100 in the 21st over and continued to build momentum, taking the total to 150 by the 31st over.
Muneeba, having reached her 5th half-century, was eventually dismissed for a well-crafted 76 off 94 balls, laced with 11 fours.
Aliya Riaz then joined Sidra at the crease and the pair added a valuable 68 runs off the next 71 deliveries. Aliya contributed a brisk 33 off 34 balls, striking five boundaries, before falling in the 43rd over.
Sidra brought up her 5th ODI century with a delicate dab down to long-on. She remained unbeaten on a superb 121, featuring 12 fours, as Pakistan posted 255-4 at the end of their 50 overs
 


For the Proteas, Ayabonga Khaka returned figures of 9-0-36-2 while Tumi Sekhukhune picked up one wicket for 37 runs in eight overs.
Pakistan had opened their immediate run-in with a three-match ODI series against South Africa in Lahore, following the conclusion of a training camp at the National Cricket Academy and the Gaddafi Stadium.
On Monday, speaking at the pre-match press conference in Lahore, Fatima had said: “The specific aim is to prepare for the World Cup and execute our plans in this series.”
“A series like this is very beneficial for the team ahead of the World Cup. It gives the players a good opportunity to put into practice all the preparation they have done in recent times,“ she was quoted as having said by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
She added that it is widely known that Pakistan rely on their bowling attack, so this time the Green Team’s focus will be on getting more support from the batting unit as well.
“We worked a lot on batting during the camp,” the Pakistani skipper said.
The ODIs will be staged at the Gaddafi Stadium on September 16, 19 and 22, with the first ball of all matches to be bowled at 3:30pm, according to the PCB.
Pakistan’s 15-member squad is captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt leads the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches.
The squad features one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August.
The series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka.
In head-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on September 14, 2023.</p><small>2025-09-16 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1617182920934a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942431/ihcs-justice-babar-sattar-orders-removal-of-pta-chairman-over-illegal-appointment-to-office' target='_blank'><strong>IHC’s Justice Babar Sattar orders removal of PTA chairman over ‘illegal’ appointment to office</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court on Tuesday ordered the removal of the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority Chairman retired Major General Hafeezur Rehman due to his “illegal” appointment to the position.
The decision came in a verdict by IHC’s Justice Babar Sattar in a case pertaining to the appointment of the PTA’s member (administration) filed by digital rights activist Usama Khilji in 2023.
Rehman later filed an urgent intra-court appeal against the verdict.
The order said the court had admitted the petition for hearing and directed the government not to proceed with the hiring, following which the government had filed an appeal for a stay of the court injunction, which was partially accepted, as the court had subsequently allowed the recruitment process to continue while warning that any appointment would be subject to the final determination in the case.
It added that the court was subsequently informed in later hearings that Hafeezur Rehman, a retired major general, was appointed as the member (administration) and then the PTA chairman.
 


In his verdict, Justice Sattar remarked: “The entire process of creation of the post of member (administration), prescription of qualifications and criteria for such post and the manner in which the recruitment process was carried out lacked integrity and suffered from mala fide in law. The recommendation by the selection committee of a panel of three individuals for the appointment to the post of nember (administration) was not in conformance with the requirements of Rule 4(4) of the PTA Appointment Rules, which required that only one candidate could be recommended.
“The decision of the federal government to pick the candidate listed at the bottom of panel recommended by the selection committee on the basis of merit was devoid of any reasoning or objective basis and fell afoul the obligation of the federal government under Section 24A of the General Clauses Act, 1897, to act in a just, fair and reasonable manner.”
The verdict further read: “Similarly, the appointment of respondent No.4 as chairman PTA, after being appointed as member (administration), without any objective or transparent process and without the federal government recording any reasons as to why he was so selected from amongst the members of PTA, was illegal, irrational and unsustainable in the eyes of law.”
He said the petition was allowed on the above grounds and remarked that the subsequent steps taken by the federal government in filling the post of member (administration) were not sustainable in the eyes of the law and were of no legal effect.
“The entire edifice of processes and decisions built on an illegal foundation must crumble upon such illegal foundation. As the impugned advertisement and the process of recruitment undertaken thereunder suffered from malice in law, all subsequent decisions in pursuit of such process, including the appointment of respondent No.4 as member (administration) and chairman PTA, are illegal, ultra vires the law and of no legal effect.”
Concluding his verdict, the judge said that since the entire process of Rehman’s appointment as the member (administration) and as the PTA chairman was found to “suffer from malice in law being the product of an unconstitutional and illegal recruitment process, he shall cease to hold such appointments and shall immediately relinquish charge for such offices”.
The judge ordered that the senior-most serving PTA member would temporarily assume the charge of the office of PTA chairman till the time that the federal government appointed a regular chairman.</p><small>2025-09-16 18:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/162206526f791b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942453/pakistan-warns-of-dangerous-escalation-as-unhrc-urges-accountability-for-israels-qatar-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan warns of ‘dangerous escalation’ as UNHRC urges accountability for Israel’s Qatar attack</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan warned of “dangerous escalation” as the United Nations and a long line of countries on Tuesday denounced Israel’s attack on Qatar last week, demanding “accountability”.
Israel’s strikes on the Qatari capital on September 9 targeted Hamas leaders gathered to discuss a new US ceasefire proposal for Gaza. Five Hamas members and a Qatari security officer were killed.
That strike “was a shocking breach of international law”, UN rights chief Volker Turk said during an urgent debate at the UN Human Rights Council about the strike.
Denouncing the attack as “an assault on regional peace and stability”, he urged “accountability for unlawful killings”.
His words were echoed by Qatar and dozens of country representatives who took the floor during the three-hour debate.
 






Qatari International Cooperation Minister Maryam bint Ali bin Nasser Al-Misnad slammed Israel’s “treacherous attack” and demanded that the international community “take practical steps to hold the aggressors accountable and prevent their impunity”.
“This attack was not an isolated incident, but rather was part of a broader campaign aimed at distorting Qatar’s role and obstructing its diplomatic efforts,” she said.
Pakistan’s ambassador Bilal Ahmad warned that “this unjustifiable and unprovoked attack constitutes a dangerous escalation”.
 






 
 

The council had announced on Monday that it would convene the 10th urgent debate since its creation in 2006, following two official requests from members of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Pakistan was among those that led the call for the urgent debate.
‘Shameful’
Neither Israel nor its main ally, the United States, which both disengaged from the council earlier this year, was present for the urgent debate.
But Israel’s ambassador in Geneva, Daniel Meron, lambasted the meeting from the sidelines.
“This marks yet another shameful chapter in the Human Rights Council’s ongoing abuse,” he told journalists.
He accused the council of “serving as a platform for anti-Israel propaganda, while ignoring the brutal realities on the ground and the atrocities committed by Hamas”.
There was little support for Israel’s position during the debate.
European Union ambassador Deike Potzel stressed the bloc’s “principled stance against terrorism in all its forms”, while underlining its “support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar” and calling “on Israel to respect international law”.
“We urge all parties to refrain from any actions that jeopardise mediation channels and regional stability,” she said.
China’s ambassador Chen Xu said his country “firmly rejects and categorically condemns” the September 9 attack, which he charged was “a deliberate attempt to derail the negotiation process”.
Some of the harshest criticism came from South Africa, which has brought a case against Israel before the International Court of Justice, accusing it of committing genocide in Gaza.
The attack “strikes against the very heart of mediation processes”, ambassador Mxolisi Nkosi told the council, adding that it “demonstrates that Israel does not want to end its genocidal war against the Palestinian people”.
“It is time for the international community to demonstrate through practical countermeasures that Israel does not enjoy some form of special immunity from accountability.“</p><small>2025-09-16 18:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624057-pakistan-joins-global-call-for-security-of-global-sumud-flotilla-following-attacks' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan joins global call for security of Global Sumud Flotilla following attacks</strong></a><br><p>

Bulcke will be succeeded by Vice Chairman Pablo Isla, effective October 1. Bulcke was earlier supposed to hand over the reins to Isla in April 2026.
According to media report, Nestle investors had since been pushing for Bulcke — a Belgian national who served as Nestle CEO for nearly a decade before becoming chairman in 2017, to step down.
The Financial Times reported that investors blamed him for a chaotic period at the company that culminated with Freixe’s ouster.
Bulcke, who has been scheduled to remain in his position until next April, said in Tuesday’s statement that he had “full trust in Nestle’s new leadership and firmly believe this great company is well positioned for the future”.
“This is the right moment for me to step aside and accelerate the planned transition, allowing Pablo and Philipp to advance Nestle’s strategy and guide the company with a fresh perspective,” he said.
Isla meanwhile hailed Bulcke “for his leadership and unwavering dedication to Nestle”.
“Paul’s wisdom and commitment have shaped the company and laid the groundwork for our next chapter,” he said, adding that Bulcke had been named Honorary Chairman of the company
The dismissal of Freixe follows an investigation into an undisclosed romantic relationship with a direct subordinate, which breached Nestle’s code of business conduct, Nestle had said.
Freixe, who spent 39 years with Nestle, will receive no exit package following his departure, the company told Reuters.</p><small>2025-09-16 17:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624034-ihc-bars-justice-jahangiri-from-judicial-work' target='_blank'><strong>IHC bars Justice Jahangiri from judicial work</strong></a><br><p>

Those targeted have helped coordinate funds transfers, including from the sale of Iranian oil, that benefit Iran’s military force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC)- Quds Force and its Ministry of Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL), the Treasury said.
“Iranian ‘shadow banking’ networks like these — run by trusted illicit financial facilitators — abuse the international financial system, and evade sanctions by laundering money through overseas front companies and cryptocurrency,” it said in a statement.
US sanctions generally prohibit American individuals and companies from engaging in any business transactions with those targeted.
The US had issued Iran-related sanctions in June this year as well, taking aim at the procurement of machinery for the country’s defense industry.
 
 

The US Treasury Department had said back then that it was targeting an individual and eight entities over their roles in the sourcing and transshipment of “sensitive machinery for Iran’s defense industry”.
Iran said earlier this month that the path to nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States is not closed but US demands for curbs on Iranian ballistic and hypersonic missiles are obstructing prospects for talks.
A sixth round of Iran-US talks was suspended after Israel and the US struck Iranian military and nuc­lear facilities and Iran ret­aliated with waves of ballistic and hypersonic missiles against Israel.</p><small>2025-09-16 15:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/624015-human-trafficking-fake-football-team-deported-from-japan-confirms-fia' target='_blank'><strong>‘Human trafficking': Fake football team deported from Japan, confirms FIA</strong></a><br><p>

While the total losses are yet to be calculated, it is critical to understand their economic repercussions and the urgent need to initiate damage limitation measures.
The 2022 floods, which affected only Sindh and Balochistan, had displaced 33 million people, submerged their homes, destroyed livestock and crops and damaged infrastructure including the irrigation network. That deluge killed over 1,100 people and caused economic losses to the tune of $30 billion, or 10 per cent of GDP. Clearly, global warming has taken firm root in the form of droughts, glacier melt, floods, torrential rains, heatwaves and rising sea levels. Our response capacity must match the challenge.
 
 

No other economic sector has such strong backward and forward linkages for national well-being as agriculture. The situation, therefore, requires a holistic rather than a narrow sectoral approach. In the immediate term, the IMF’s ongoing review warrants a revision of performance indicators and structural benchmarks in light of projected changes in the underlying variables. At least, seven important linkages can be identified.
GDP growth rate: Although agriculture’s direct contribution to GDP is only 23pc, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trade, transportation and storage and other ancillary services rely on its inputs such as raw material, processing, marketing, distribution of crops, livestock, dairy, fruit and vegetables, pulses, oil seeds, etc. A guesstimate of this indirect contribution would add another 25pc arising from these non-agricultural activities. Thus the rate of GDP growth rate is highly dependent not only on agricultural performance but also allied activities. Together, they account for 50pc of the economy.
Employment: The proportion of labour force employed directly on the farm is almost 37pc, including non-farm incomes. A rough guess is that about 60-70pc of total employment can be attributed to the rural economy. A significant drop in rural employment would result in a decline in purchasing power and the increased incidence of poverty.

What steps should be taken to minimise the impact of flood losses?

 
 

Inflation: Shortage of grains, vegetables, pulses, and disruption of the supply chain would push up the consumer price index causing inflationary pressures. Coming on top of rising wheat flour and sugar prices the likelihood of higher inflation in the months ahead cannot be ruled out.
The lowest income quintile spends about 40pc of their income on food. Floods would thus hurt the poor who cannot afford higher food prices.
Poverty and income distribution: Income poverty estimates show that rural poverty is 28pc compared to 11pc in the urban areas. Income distribution is also skewed in favour of the big landlords.
The recent agriculture census shows that the top 4pc of landholders own one-third of the total farm area while the bottom 80pc of farmers possessing less than five acres own another third, with the remaining one-third belonging to medium landholders. Negative changes in poverty headcount and income distribution are the result of flood losses.
Exports: Eighty per cent of Pakistan’s merchandise exports derive their raw material, such as ginned cotton, husked rice, leather and food products, from rural sources. Cotton and yarn are already being brought from abroad. This volume is likely to rise in the floods’ aftermath, affecting our current account balance.
 
 

Food security and nutrition: In Pakistan, 38m people face moderate to severe food insecurity (18pc of children are malnourished). These numbers must have risen after the floods.
Wheat is the main crop in Pakistan — thus, policies and incentives for sowing on a greater area during the coming Rabi season should be assured through a coordinated federal-provincial strategy.
Output of manufactured goods: The production of goods such as motorbikes, bicycles, fertilisers, pesticides, tractors and other farm equipment as well as light consumer items are dependent on the demand of rural household. The manufacturing sector is already under stress and a drop in demand is likely to result in decreased production, shedding labour and intensifying unemployment and poverty.
What steps should be taken to minimise the impact of flood losses in the short and medium term?

Provide farmers with less than five acres of land access to good quality certified seeds, fertiliser and pesticide at subsidised rates through Kissan Cards; 2) use the BISP database to identify affected households for additional cash transfers; 3) accelerate agriculture credit disbursement and reschedule payments of old, outstanding loans for small farmers; 4) set up mobile veterinary services in areas where livestock has suffered most; 5) conduct an audit of national waterways to clear riverbeds and pathways of encroachments, and develop shelters on elevated land for residents of low-lying areas; 6) prepare projects for strengthening embankments and flood protection works, desilting channels, and managing afforestation and soil conservation; 7) encourage contract farming between the processors, extractors and buyers of commodities and the producers to ensure stable and predictable prices; 8) minimise conveyance losses by lining water courses and promoting drip and sprinkler, instead of flood, irrigation. Pres­e­n­tly, only 41MAF out of 145 MAF of water from the Indus irrigation system reaches the crops; 9) rehabilitate, restore and expand wetlands, develop small dams and reservoirs to store rainwater, recharge groundwater storage in farms, and promote the use of solarised tube wells; 10) allocate funds for R&D institutions to develop seeds resistant to heat, drought and cold temperatures, which can withstand pest and disease caused by climate change; 11) incentivise the private sector to invest in warehousing, storage and cold chain facilities and refrigerated vans; 12) while wheat trade should be deregulated, the provinces should hold strategic reserves for release in lean months when prices rise. Inter-district movement and fixed flour and end-product prices should be discouraged. Allowing imports and exports should depend on the situation.

 
 

As the National Water Policy 2018 recommends, an integrated water resource management system that takes into account surface water conveyance, groundwater recharge and usage, drainage, flood protection works, barrages, drinking water, industrial water needs and water conservation should be established.
As I’ve pointed out previously: ‘the changing weather patterns will significantly affect temporal distribution and availability of water in the coming decades and accelerated melting of glaciers and overloading of rivers will affect food, water and energy security, posing a grave threat to living standards’.

A complaint pertaining to Justice Jahangiri’s allegedly fake degree was submitted to the SJC last year in July while a petition challenging his appointment was filed in the IHC earlier this year.
The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
During the hearing today, apart from barring Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work, the bench also appointed lawyers Barrister Zafarullah Khan and Ashtar Ausaf as amici curiae.
Moreover, the bench also sought the attorney general’s assistance over the matter of the maintainability of the plea.
It ruled that the case would remain under adjournment until the SJC’s decision on the matter.
“The court has to consider an important question, that if a matter is under adjournment in the Supreme Judicial Council, can the high court be approached on it,” the bench observed.
At one point in the hearing, Raja Aleem Abbasi, who was representing the Islamabad Bar Association, remarked, “We believe in the rule of law.” He added that bar associations were also stakeholders in the matter.
CJ Dogar observed during the hearing that anyone had the right to hearing and the court had to consider the objections on the petition by the registrar’s office.
For his part, counsel Abbasi pleaded that if the practice of filing such cases turned into trend, it could be “dangerous”. He argued that objections on the petition should be upheld.
The court concluded the hearing after ruling that Justice Jahangiri should be barred from judicial work until the SJC’s decision.
Following that, the IHC also issued a revised duty roster for the judges, which is seen by Dawn.com and does not show Justice Jahangiri being a part of any bench.
The petition
The petition against Justice Jahangiri, filed under Article 199 of the Constitution, seeks a writ of quo warranto (by what authority) against him, arguing that his foundational qualification for judicial office — an LLB degree from the University of Karachi — is “invalid”, thereby rendering his entire legal career and subsequent appointment illegitimate.
 


The petitioner has bas­ed his case on official correspondence from the Uni­versity of Karachi, which is attached as evidence with the plea.
The key allegations in the petition include the use of dual enrollment numbers, as the record shows two different enrollment numbers for Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I and Part-II examinations. The University of Karachi has previously stated that it is “impossible to allot two enrollment numbers to a student for one programme”.
The enrollment number AIL-5968/87, which appears on Justice Jahangiri’s LLB Part-I mark sheet, was officially allocated by the university to another individual, Imtiaz Ahmad, son of Muhammad Ellahi, according to the petition.
Furthermore, the principal of Government Islamia Law College, Karachi, stated in a letter that a student named “Tariq Mehmood s/o Qazi Muhammad Akram”, under enrollment number AIL-7124/87, was never admitted to the college for the LLB programme during the relevant period, the petition read.
It further stated that the controller of examinations at KU concluded in an official letter that the degree and mark sheets in question were “invalid”.
The petition argued that the appointment of a judge without the requisite legal qualification is not just an administrative error, but a violation of the fundamental rights of all citizens.
The petitioner has contended that the presence of a judge with an allegedly invalid degree “shakes public confidence” and “tarnishes the image of the judiciary as a neutral arbiter”.
It may be recalled that Justice Jahangiri is one of the five judges who challenged the transfer of Justice Dogar, along with two other judges —Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif — to the IHC.
He was also among the cohort that, last year, wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council, alleging interference by intelligence agencies in the judicial matters.
Days before the controversy over his degree initially surfaced, Justice Jahangiri was expeditiously hearing election petitions against alleged rigging in all three constituencies of Islamabad.</p><small>2025-09-16 14:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/161656247e6977c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942187/the-words-of-the-chief-justice' target='_blank'><strong>The words of the Chief Justice</strong></a><br><p>In 1817, Chief Justice John Marshall, one of America’s founding fathers, delivered what is often called the shortest judgment in judicial history: “The United States never pays costs.” This was the entirety of a unanimous majority decision in the Supreme Court case of United States v. Barker. Six words settled a complex question of law that had gone unanswered for twenty years, and solidified jurisprudence on sovereign immunity with clarity and precision.
Exactly 208 years later, the unthinkable happened. In a judgment authored by Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) ruled on the case of a journalist restricted from leaving the country with the following: “Office objection is sustained”. Move over Justice Marshall, that looks like four words and a newly broken world record to me.
Pakistan: 1, USA: 0.
A stunning upset like this must be exactly the kind of judicial achievement the framers of the 26th Amendment dreamed of. So where are the balloons, the mass media coverage, the celebrations on the streets? Why is it only this writer who’s publicly noticed an achievement so grand?
Well, it might have something to do with the difference between these two judgments. Brevity is the soul of wit, and that Shakespearean adage applies to both. But while the former sought to push the limits of how much you could accomplish with how few words, the latter took a different approach, by not seeking to accomplish anything at all.
When courts shield power, not people
For context, the journalist, Asad Ali Toor, had approached the court after he was stopped at an airport and prevented from leaving the country to attend a training program.  He had been placed on the “Provisional National Identification List”, which exists under a 2018 standing order for the purposes of preventing fugitives of ‘heinous crimes’, like rape, murder, or terrorism, from fleeing abroad.
The only ‘heinous’ crime Toor has ever been accused of is irritating some very powerful people. Regardless, his name was on the list; he was not told this fact until he was packed up and ready to board his flight, and someone in a very high office likely took great pleasure in the deliberate act of causing him pain.
Courts exist for the precise purpose of shielding regular citizens from thuggery like this. What happened to Toor was illegal in at least a dozen different ways: he was not even accused of anything that merited inclusion in the PNIL; no reasoning or show-cause notice was given; the Courts have consistently held that one must be informed when placed on such a list; an accused must be given the right to appeal; the Constitution guarantees freedom of movement; and the list goes on and on. Toor has a history of being targeted and punished for his journalism (even the people who sold him his parrots were not spared), and this cannot be ignored when judging his present mistreatment.
For a case like this to land before a judge is a ripe and easy opportunity to affirm that justice is not dead in this country — that some loose cog in our very large government machinery cannot arbitrarily decide that it does not like you, and therefore you must deal with a certain amount of misery as a prerequisite to your existence here. Confronted with a situation so transparently unjust, a judge has the chance to deliver a comprehensive verdict that strengthens individual liberties and at least attempts to ensure that no citizen of this country ever goes through such an indignity again.
Justice Babar Sattar of this same court did just that in his excellent judgment on illegal phone tapping. If the chief justice so desired, he could have affirmed and strengthened the constitutional right to free movement in a way that made Pakistan a better place, with a stronger rule of law, for all of us.
Instead, we got the world’s shortest judgment. Toor had been told by the registrar’s office that, before he comes to court, he must first go to the government department that is visibly intent on making his life miserable. The office objection was sustained. The training program went on without him. Now, it could happen to you, too. Whether you love him or hate him, agree with his opinions or not, or even know who he is, Toor has unravelled the extent of all our freedoms, and their lack thereof. For now, they’re worth a grand total of four words.
Later, though, we got more words from the chief justice.
Misogyny, misconduct and the language of the law
In another case about the freedom to leave the country, he castigated Imaan Mazari, the same lawyer who represented Toor, for critiquing his work. In open court, the chief justice reportedly threatened contempt proceedings, said “shut your mouth”, and then turned to another lawyer, who happened to be Mazari’s husband, to say “control her, one day if I catch her…”. There was no question that these remarks were sexist, threatening, and unacceptable. An apology was due.
Instead, the following day, according to journalists in the courtroom, the chief justice stated: “Imaan Mazari is like my daughter. Yesterday, as a chief justice and as an elder, I was explaining things to her. My remarks were taken out of context”. Specifically, he denied having said he was going to “catch her” and stated (in contradiction of multiple journalists’ reports) that he had, in fact, only asked her husband to catch her (as if that was any better).
There’s an old saying that goes, ‘when you’re in a hole, stop digging’. But the Chief Justice still wasn’t done. “If I initiate contempt proceedings, the girl’s career will be ruined. I explained to her like my children, but she wasn’t understanding”. A shockingly inappropriate word was used to refer to a professional and accomplished lawyer — “bachi”. In doubling down on a worldview that sees women as lesser beings, devoid of agency and subject to the restraint, control, and unsolicited advice of the men around them, the chief justice revealed much. But he was clear during his castigation that one should critique the decisions, and not the person, so that is all I’ll do.
The IHC chief justice’s decision to belittle a female advocate for daring to stand up to him has sparked criticism across the board. His decision to present a non-apology and further condescension disguised as benevolence only worsened his position. And his decision to still not provide an unconditional apology to all the women who appear in his court, despite multiple condemnations from bar associations and women’s groups, takes this matter to unacceptable levels of misconduct.
Apparently, there is a history to this behaviour. In an interview with Matiullah Jan, Mazari’s husband reported that Justice Dogar had been protested by the bar in Multan and ultimately transferred for referring to a lawyer as ‘ulloo ka patha’ in court. The Supreme Judicial Council is the sole body empowered to hold judges accountable for actions like this. At the very least, it should convene to take notice and release the minutes of the meeting to the public to let the country know that the entirety of its justice system does not condone misogyny.
How one clause changed it all
It cannot be ignored that everything you have read about here is a direct result of the 26th Amendment. That is what allowed this chief justice to be transferred from number 15 in seniority at the Lahore High Court (LHC) to number one in Islamabad, leapfrogging over some of our country’s most brilliant jurists. No reasoning was ever given to the public as to why Justice Dogar was deemed a better fit than those he superseded for the top job at the court of this nation’s capital.
Five sitting judges went on the record to argue (very convincingly) that this transfer was illegal and amounted to nothing more than an attack on the independence of the judiciary; going so far as to file a petition against the transfer appointments in the Supreme Court (SC). This challenge was heard by the constitutional bench, itself a creation of the 26th Amendment, and went exactly how you would expect it to.
With every passing day, the mess that this amendment created gets layers added to it, and the prospect of any meaningful pushback feels less and less likely. Robust challenges to its legality remain completely ignored by the SC. And almost a year into its enactment, while its impacts are immense and impossible to quantify, the result here is simple; the same IHC that once represented the very best of our judiciary — pushing back against power, delivering intelligent and progressive judgments, and standing up for the vulnerable — has been reduced to castigating activists and broadcasting misogyny.
This country deserves better. And if justice is to be seen to be done, we can’t have Justices seeing half the population as lesser than the other.</p><small>2025-09-16 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/161908197b7bd55.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942432/imaan-mazari-moves-sjc-against-ihc-cjs-shunting-of-female-judge-for-taking-up-harassment-complaint-against-him' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari moves SJC against IHC CJ’s shunting of female judge for taking up harassment complaint against him</strong></a><br><p>Advocate Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir approached the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) on Tuesday against Islamabad High Court Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar after the court administration stripped Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz of her powers to entertain harassment complaints when she took cognisance of a complaint against him.
Last week, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge. Mazari then filed a complaint a day ago against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
After Justice Imtiaz took cognisance of her complaint, the IHC administration de-notified her as the “competent au­­thority” and replaced her with Justice Ina­­am Ameen Minhas, stripping Justice Imtiaz of her powers to entertain harassment complaints.
In a post on X today, Mazai said she had filed an addendum to her initial complaint lodged with the SJC against Justice Dogar following yesterday’s “alarming development”. She said Justice Imtiaz was “arbitrarily and with mala fide” removed as the competent authority just a  few hours after she had lodged her complaint and a committee was constituted to inquire into the matter.
 






The additional complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said various IHC organs — registrar office, dispatch branch and member inspection team — had refused to forward her complaint to the competent authority.
“The complaint was then taken directly to the competent authority … Her court associate confirmed receipt of the complaint by providing a receiving on a copy of the complaint in writing in the courtroom. Yesterday’s events showed absolute lack of transparency in relation to the process for registration of complaints under the 2010 act. Furthermore, it highlighted a systematic response/culture of courts, overwhelmingly occupied by men, to not even entertain a complaint of harassment by a woman under the 2010, Act. Eventually, the only female judge (being the competent authority) had to directly entertain the complaint through her staff, after all relevant male officers of the IHC, refused to even receive my complaint.”
Reiterating yesterday’s development, she said Justice Imtiaz had subsequently formed a three-member inquiry team, following which, Justice Dogar “with clear mala fide and in direct conflict of interest” had removed Justice Imtiaz as the competent authority and replaced her with Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas.
“No reason whatsoever has been provided in the removal notification. Even if the chief justice (who is a respondent in the complaint) had any objection on the assumption of jurisdiction by the competent authority or the inquiry committee, he could have raised it as an objection in his response to the complaint. Instead, the chief justice opted to exercise his administrative powers as the chief justice to influence the composition and constitution of the inquiry committee and/or competent authority to remove the only female judge, who dared to receive my complaint. Such brazen misconduct within hours after I attempted to seek appropriate remedy and justice is alarming, and reflects the degree of abuse of power prevalent under the IHC chief justice,” the additional request reads.
Mazari also pointed out that cases of hers which were previously not fixed for hearing, were suddenly fixed before Justice Dogar after she filed her complaint. She added that when a proxy counsel appeared on her behalf and requested a case transfer on the grounds of the  pending workplace harassment complaint, “not only was this request not entertained but the IHC chief justice repeatedly tried to drag the proxy counsel into discussion on the incident of harassment. The chief justice, while refusing the transfer request, simply on the basis that the principal counsel (the undersigned) had not appeared before him, then adjourned the matter.”
The lawyer also pointed out that she had additional documentation “reflecting the apparent degree of influence and abuse of authority by the IHC chief justice”, saying that soon after last week’s incident, a case was lodged against her in the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA).
She said on Friday last week, a notification was issued by the Ministry of Interior nominating a special prosecution team in her case. Furthermore, she said a challan was submitted against her in a trial court yesterday and she came to know by media reports and then by a voice note sent by an NCCIA officer that she was summoned in the matter on Wednesday.
“At the time of filing this, I have yet to receive a summons/notice through formal court process. It appears to be more than a mere coincident that soon after the harassment incident and the filing of complaint, a challan in a case that involves incidents pertaining to past four years (i.e. 2021-2025) has hastily been filed in trial court and the trial court (working as subordinate judiciary under the IHC chief justice) has immediately fixed it for hearing.”
Mazari urged the SJC to read the additional complaint and documentation as part of her previous complaint against Justice Dogar. “I request the members of the SJC to take up my complaint and initiate proceedings against Mr Dogar at the earliest as such brazen misconduct and unchecked exercise of coercive power affects my legal practice and the clients I represent on a daily basis,” she concluded.
She made the following request to the SJC secretary: “Due to the dire nature of this complaint and the ensuing consequences, I urge you to convey the contents of this complaint to the honourable members of the SJC urgently upon receipt of this post.”
Reference seeking cancellation of Mazari’s licence filed in Islamabad Bar Council
Separately, a lawyer filed a reference before the Islamabad Bar Council (IBC) seeking the cancellation of Mazari’s practising licence for her alleged involvement in “anti-state activities” and a “smear campaign against state functionaries”.
The reference, filed by Advocate Adnan Iqbal and a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stated: “The complainant has received some information from credible sources that Mst. Imaan Zainab Mazari Hazir has been involved on a number of occasions in anti-state activities like hate speeches against the state institutions and the honourable heads of government departments, negative and smear campaign against state functionaries and law enforcement agencies, and instigating hatred and rebellion against vital institutions of the state.”
 
 

It requested the IBC chairman and its disciplinary committee to initiate an inquiry against Mazari and “permanently cancel her licence to practice as an advocate”. “During the inquiry, her licence may kindly be suspended till final verdict of the worthy disciplinary committee,” it added.
The reference was filed under Section 41 of the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act 1973 (punishment of advocates for misconduct), read with Chapter X (disciplinary proceedings) of its 1976 rules and the Islamabad Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Rules 2017.
The reference alleged there was “strong persuasive evidence” against Mazari for her “close connections with anti-state organisations”, such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement leader Manzoor Pashteen.
“She has been supporting the cause of every movement which has the agenda of rebellion against the state and its vital institutions. She could be seen delivering speeches, chanting fiery slogans against the state and its institutions on every such stage adorned for launching anti-state campaign,” it further claimed.</p><small>2025-09-16 14:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/16164226eb86a9a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942425/pia-swings-to-profit-in-first-half-of-this-year-as-privatisation-push-gathers-pace' target='_blank'><strong>PIA swings to profit in first half of this year as privatisation push gathers pace</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) posted a pre-tax profit in the first half of 2025, which a company source said is its first such for the period in about two decades, ahead of a planned sale of the national carrier later this year.
The PIA, part of the PIA Holding Company, recorded a pre-tax profit of Rs11.5 billion ($40.64 million) in the six months to June, compared with the same period in 2024 when it remained in a loss before taxes and only managed a rare annual profit through deferred tax adjustments. Net profit for the current half year stood at Rs6.8bn.
The disclosure comes as Islamabad presses ahead with a fresh attempt to privatise the airline, a key condition under Pakistan’s $7bn IMF bailout.
 
 

A company source said it was the state-run airline’s first such profit since 2004. Financial records before 2014 are no longer publicly available on the airline’s and the stock exchange’s websites.
The planned sale of the PIA would mark the country’s first major privatisation in about two decades, with divestment of loss-making state firms a central plank of last year’s bailout.
Lucrative UK routes
High fuel and service costs continue to weigh, but a steep drop in finance costs after Islamabad assumed about 80 per cent of the PIA’s legacy debt last year was a decisive factor in its return to profit. Despite the gain, the PIA’s equity remains negative, underscoring the fragility of its turnaround.
A previous privatisation attempt collapsed last year after a single lowball offer was received, but the government has since drawn interest from five domestic business groups, including Airblue, Lucky Cement, investment firm Arif Habib and Fauji Fertiliser. Final bids are expected later this year.
Britain lifted in July a five-year ban on Pakistani airlines imposed after a fatal 2020 crash and a pilot licensing scandal, allowing the PIA to reapply for lucrative UK routes. The move follows similar steps by the European Union late last year.
The PIA had previously estimated an annual revenue loss of around Rs40bn from the British ban, with London, Manchester and Birmingham among its most profitable routes.</p><small>2025-09-16 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/16153407e4b397e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942416/debt-trajectory-more-sustainable-than-headline-figures-finance-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Debt trajectory ‘more sustainable than headline figures’: finance ministry</strong></a><br><p>The country’s debt trajectory “is more sustainable today than suggested by headline rupee figures”, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday, citing its continued focus on debt-to-GDP reduction, early repayments, lower interest costs and a stronger external account.
It asserted that it continued to centre its debt management strategy on aligning public debt-to-GDP ratio to the Debt Limitation Act, which provides for the reduction of federal fiscal deficit and debt-to-GDP ratio to a prudent level by effective public debt management. Moreover, the strategy considered “minimising refinancing and rollover risks while generating interest savings to support sustainable public finances”, the ministry said.
According to latest data from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the country’s total government debt has increased by Rs9 trillion in just one year up to June 2025, with domestic debt representing the ma­­jority of this increase.
As per SBP, the total government debt in­­creased from Rs68.91 trillion in June 2024 to Rs77.89tr by June 2025, marking a rise of Rs8.97tr. This figure exceeds the debt servicing allocation for the federal budget for fiscal year 2026 (FY26), which stands at Rs8.207tr.
Citing these figures, concerns have been raised regarding the country’s capacity to manage revenue and expenditures effectively.
A Dawn editorial yesterday said Pakistan’s “debt dynamics continue to paint a difficult fiscal picture”.
“For the government, the options are bleak: diverting scarce domestic resources — which would require the IMF’s consent — or borrowing more to add to an already high debt mountain,” it added.
However, the finance ministry, “while noting recent commentary about public debt levels”, maintained in its statement that “absolute numbers, which will naturally rise with inflation, are not meaningful indicators of sustainability in isolation. The appropriate measure of sustainability is looking at debt relative to the size of the economy i.e Debt-to-GDP — not absolute rupee amounts”.
“By this yardstick, which is followed globally, Pakistan’s position has actually improved over the last few years, with debt-to-GDP ratio declining from 74 per cent in FY22 to 70pc in FY25. At the same time, the government has reduced rollover and refinancing risks and saved taxpayers substantial interest costs,” the ministry said.
Detailing its approach towards debt management, the statement outlined debt-to-GDP reduction, early repayments, lower interest costs, and a stronger external account as its main focus.
The ministry said this approach underscored its “commitment to macroeconomic stability, reduced risk, and responsible fiscal management”.
The ministry highlighted that the government, “for the first time in Pakistan’s debt history”, prepaid around Rs2600 billion owed to commercial and central banks before maturity. In doing so, it said, the government reduced the risks of reducing rollover and refinancing, which ultimately led to taxpayers saving “hundreds of billions of rupees in interest savings.”
“Similarly, on the fiscal side, the federal fiscal deficit stood at Rs 7.1tr in FY25, lower than Rs 7.7tr in FY24,” the ministry said, highlighting that Pakistan posted a “historic primary surplus of 2.4pc of GDP, or Rs 2.7tr, for the second consecutive year”.
Consequently, the country’s “total debt stock rose 13pc year-on-year, below the 17pc average growth of the past five years”, it said.
The ministry attributed the record current account surplus of $2bn in FY25 to its “prudent fiscal management.”
“To lower [the] interest burden, prudent liability management along with reduction in interest rate in FY25 delivered over Rs 850bn in interest expense savings compared to the budgeted amount,” the statement said, noting that “in the current fiscal year’s budget, interest allocation is Rs 8.2tr, down from Rs 9.8tr in FY25,” it added.
The ministry further said that the “public-debt average time to maturity has improved to about 4.5 years in FY25 compared to about 4.0 years last year; within this, domestic debt average time to maturity has also risen to over 3.8 years from about 2.7 years.”
Moreover, it said that “part of the increase in external debt reflects balance of payments support, e.g., IMF Extended Fund Facility inflows and non-cash commodity facilities such as the Saudi Oil Fund, that do not require rupee financing.”
“Approximately, Rs 800 billion of the external debt increase is a valuation effect from exchange-rate movements, not new net borrowing,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-09-16 11:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/16163811698699a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942409/fact-check-andy-pycrofts-x-account-bashing-pakistani-cricketers-is-fake' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Andy Pycroft’s X account bashing Pakistani cricketers is fake</strong></a><br><p>Posts from multiple Indian users on social media platform X on Monday were sharing the post of an account allegedly belonging to Zimbabwean cricket referee and former player Andy Pycroft, saying he stood by his decision that raised controversy in the Asia Cup 2025 match between India and Pakistan and criticised the latter’s players. However, the account is fake.
 
 

Pakistan lodged a complaint a day ago with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pycroft’s conduct during the Asia Cup clash with India, as political tensions between the neighbours spilt onto the field. India beat Pakistan by seven wickets in Dubai on Sunday in the first meeting between the two sides since a four-day military conflict in May. The match, overseen by Pycroft, passed without incident but ended without the customary handshakes, intensifying the rancour between the two camps.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) alleged that Pycroft told captain Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav before the toss. No handshakes followed the game either, with Indian players heading straight into their dressing room. As a protest, Pakistan did not send their captain for post-match duties.
A day ago, an X account with the name of Pycroft reshared a post that said: “Big decision by PCB. PCB has warned ICC that Pakistan will not play in the Asia Cup if the match referee is not removed. (Geo News)”
The caption of the post said: “I stand by every decision that I took yesterday. Pakistan players have had a history of bringing disrepute to the game of cricket be it Hafeez and Ajmal in past (reported for chucking by me) or the current bunch of players like Faheem and Abrar. So I had to take precautions.”
The post gained 1.8 million views, 2,600 reshares and 23,000 reactions.
The same post was also quoted by Indian news outlet Odisha Bytes in an article dated Sept 15, 2025, with the following title: “Pakistani cricketers brought disrepute to game: Andy Pycroft”.
The post was also shared by multiple Indian users.
A fact check was initiated to determine the veracity of the account due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter.
Accessing the post at 10:27am on Tuesday showed that the account’s username was written as “90_gangadhar”. Clicking on the account to go to the main profile displayed an error with X saying: “This account doesn’t exist.”
 


Refreshing the account a number of times eventually opened the profile, showing it was renamed to “90_andypycroft”.
Reviewing the profile revealed numerous older posts written in Hindi or about local Indian politics or the India-Pakistan rivalry, as can be seen here, here and here. The topics or language used are hardly those to be expected from a former Zimbabwean cricketer.
Conducting an advanced search on X for posts from “90_andypycrof” only showed posts from the past 13 hours, with no earlier activity traceable, whereas the account bio showed that it joined in February 2021.
 


In contrast, an advanced search for posts from “90_gangadhar” did display a longer posting history with multiple posts — all now displaying the name of “Andy Pycroft” and the username “90_andypycrof”.
 


This clearly showed that the account was renamed after the Zimbabwean cricket referee and was not his actual account.
Some users also pointed this out in the comments of some posts, saying the account had changed its username from “90_gangadhar”.
Lastly, the viral post claimed that Pycroft had reported both Ajmal and Hafeez for suspect bowling actions. However, a keyword search yielded a January 19, 2005, news report from ESPNcricinfo with the following title: “Mohammad Hafeez reported for suspect bowling action”.
As per the report, Hafeez was called for chucking during the VB Series match between Pakistan and West Indies in Brisbane on January 19, 2005, when on-field umpires Rudi Koertzen and Peter Parker, third umpire Simon Taufel, and match referee Chris Broad lodged the report.
There was no mention of Pycroft in the story, and neither did a keyword search yield any information on him ever reporting Hafeez for such an action.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a post on the X account of Zimbabwean cricket referee Andy Pycroft bashes Pakistani players is false. The account is a fake and was recently renamed after the former cricketer.

The PCB had yesterday lodged a complaint with the ICC against Pycroft over his alleged violations of rules pertaining to the “Spirit of Cricket“, with the board claiming that the referee had asked the Pakistan and India captains “not to shake hands at the time of the toss” for Sunday’s match.
“Late last night, ICC had sent a reply to PCB stating that Pycroft won’t be removed and their plea has been rejected,” an unnamed ICC source told the Press Trust of India.
However, Cricbuzz reported, “When contacted, the PCB has denied receiving any communication from the ICC.”
The PCB has yet to issue an official statement on the development.
 
 

The Times of India (TOI) reported it was “actually the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) officials on the ground who informed Pycroft about the no-handshake policy at the toss”. It is unclear if any such official policy had been set for the match.
Another TOI report quoted an unnamed PCB source as saying, “It is very unlikely that the PCB will pull out from the Asia Cup.”
At the centre of the complaint is the Indian team’s refusal to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts at the toss and the match’s end, as is customary. PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi yesterday claimed, without naming, that Pycroft had violated the “ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket”.
According to an earlier press release by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Pycroft is scheduled to be the match referee for the Pakistan-UAE match tomorrow.
‘Politicised’ victory
The Asia Cup match between India and Pakistan took place on Sunday in Dubai, where spinners led by Kuldeep Yadav helped the Men in Blue beat the Green Shirts by seven wickets as the neighbours met on the cricket pitch for the first time since their military conflict in May.
After hitting the winning shot, skipper Suryakumar Yadav and his teammates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts.
The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government” and the team wanted to give the Green Shirts a “proper reply”.
 
 

Suryakumar also seemingly “politicised” the victory by bringing up the April terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam — over which Delhi and Islamabad fought the four-day conflict in May — at his post-match presentation and said the victory was “a perfect gift” for his country.
He also dedicated the win to the Indian armed forces, with Pakistani cricketers and various analysts criticising his comments.
In response, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony and coach Mike Hesson termed the Indian team’s conduct “disappointing”.</p><small>2025-09-16 10:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623953-sikh-pilgrims-barred-from-travelling-to-pakistan-sparks-strong-reaction' target='_blank'><strong>Sikh pilgrims barred from travelling to Pakistan sparks strong reaction</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting was held on the sidelines of the emergency Arab-Islamic Summit in Doha, where leaders from the Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) yesterday called for a review of ties with Israel following its deadly strike on Hamas members in the Qatari capital as they discussed a Gaza ceasefire proposal.
“While reaffirming Pakistan’s all-out support and solidarity with Qatar at this critical time, the prime minister termed Israel’s attack of September 9, a flagrant violation of Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as a serious breach of international law,” read a press release issued today by the government-run Press Information Department (PID).
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir were also present in the “warm and cordial” meeting, the PID statement said.
 
 

“The prime minister stressed that Israel’s aggression in the Middle East must be stopped immediately, and unity within the ummah was vitally important, in the face of repeated Israeli provocations,” the press release said.
PM Shehbaz “deeply appreciated” Qatar’s decision to convene the emergency Arab-Islamic summit, which the Foreign Office said was co-sponsored by Pakistan.
The premier further recalled that at Qatar’s request, Pakistan had sought an emergency session of the United Nations Security Council to discuss the “deteriorating situation in the Middle East”. Pakistan took centre stage at that summit as its envoy and Israeli ambassador traded barbs while major powers censured Tel Aviv over its attack on Doha.
 
 

The Qatari emir, as per the PID, expressed appreciation for PM Shehbaz’s participation in the Arab-Islamic summit as well as for his one-day visit to Doha last week to “express solidarity with Qatar at this difficult time”.
“Both leaders agreed to remain in close contact in view of the unfolding situation in the region,” the press release added.
PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s “strongest condemnation of the Israeli strike on a residential area in Doha on September 9, that led to the loss of precious lives and injured several others”. Hamas said that five of its members were killed in the attack, including the son of Hamas’s exiled Gaza chief Khalil al-Hayya. A Qatari security official was also killed in the strike.
Recalling his last week’s meeting with the Qatari emir — which took place two days after the attack — the premier “emphasised, once again, that Pakistan and Qatar’s fraternal ties were historic, longstanding and abiding and they would grow stronger in the coming days”.
Meetings with other Mideast key players
Yesterday, on the sidelines of the Arab-Islamic summit, PM Shehbaz held a bilateral meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, during which Dar and COAS Munir were also present.
The prime minister also met Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El Sisi and appreciated the latter’s “proactive diplomacy at this difficult juncture”, the government said on X.
Both leaders termed the violation of Qatar’s “sovereignty and territorial integrity by Israel as reckless and a blatant violation of international law”.
 






In his meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II bin Al Hussein, PM Shehbaz “lauded King Abdullah II’s steadfast leadership on the Palestinian cause”, the government’s official X account said.
“The two leaders underscored the urgency of Muslim unity in confronting Israel’s belligerent actions and agreed to continue close consultations to mobilise international support for peace and stability in the region,” it added.
 






Addressing the summit, PM Shehbaz had suggested the formation of a task force to counter Israeli aggression and expansionism, while terming its attack on Qatar a “hegemonic ambition on part of Israel to control the whole region”.</p><small>2025-09-16 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/16115614e92c5c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942382/we-have-effective-armed-forces-dar-on-pakistans-possible-position-if-united-body-is-formed-against-israel-in-me' target='_blank'><strong>We have ‘effective’ armed forces: Dar on Pakistan’s possible position if united body is formed against Israel in ME</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has “very large” and “effective” armed forces that have proven their capabilities in conventional warfare, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said during an interview to Al Jazeera when asked about the possible position Islamabad would take in case a united body in the Middle East was formed to stop Israeli aggression.
The interview, recorded ahead of an Arab-Islamic summit on Israel’s recent strikes in Qatar and published late on Monday night, saw Dar in conversation with Al Jazeera’s Osama Bin Javed. who asked the foreign minister if the formation of a united body in the Middle East, away from the United Nations structure, to intervene in Gaza was an option on the table.
To that, Dar began his response by mentioning that “vis a vis UN Security Council, a mechanism could be chalked out”.
“For example, they have [imposed] very serious sanctions on countries that don’t listen to them. And that is a very severe economic dent or pain they can cause to any country.”
 


He then went on to say that there had been talk along the lines of “some sort of combined security force” during recent interactions among Arab nations and the Arab League.
Dar added, “Why not? What’s wrong with that? They should [have a combined force]. And according to their own capacity, own strength, they should create some mechanism. Not for aggression purpose [sic], but for peaceful purpose[s], for stopping the aggressor, for stopping the occupier, for stopping someone who just doesn’t listen.”
Where would a “nuclear-powered Pakistan” stand with that, asked Javed.
“Nuclear-powered Pakistan, obviously, as a member of the ummah, would discharge its duty,” replied Dar.
Javed then asked him to further elaborate in his answer.
In his response, Dar clarified that Pakistan saw nuclear weapons only for deterrence and didn’t intend to use them. “We have no intention of using it; it is only a deterrence.”
He continued: “But Pakistan has a very large, known, very effective army, very effective air force, very effective navy … We have proved that we can beat [our opponent] even conventionally, if challenged.”
The interviewer then brought up a recent debate at the UN Security Council where Israel had invoked a 2011 attack within Pakistan to kill Osama Bin Laden in a bid to justify its attacks in Gaza.
“So if now Pakistan comes under attack, from a country like the United States, for instance, would Pakistan act differently [than it did in 2011]?” he asked.
“We would not allow the breach of our territorial integrity, no matter by whom, be it the smallest or the largest country. We would respond. But I don’t see any reason why the US or any other country would do it. India did it. You saw what happened to them,” replied Dar.
Javed then pointed to the lack of action by the US in stopping Israel from attacking Qatar and asked Dar whether Pakistan still saw America as a “trustworthy” security partner.
In his response, Dar highlighted the “positive” role the US had played in brokering a ceasefire between India and Pakistan following a recent escalation between the two countries in May.
Earlier in the interview, recent strikes by Israel in Qatar that targeted Hamas leaders in Doha also came up.
Sharing his views on the subject, Dar said Israel’s reasons to attack a sovereign country were “totally baseless”. He pointed out that Qatar was mediating talks, along with the US and Egypt, for peace in Gaza when that attack happened, terming Israel’s actions “rogue”.
Dar highlighted that Israel had attacked multiple countries in the Middle East and said that international laws, international humanitarian rules and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and UN Security Council resolutions seemed to have “no effect on one country, which is repeatedly doing what it feels like”.
“That means [the] multilateral system needs very serious reforms right now … This is the need of the hour. I think the UN Security Council, as well as the UN system itself needs very serious reforms.
“The UN Security Council is meant to maintain peace in the world. And if its resolutions are just put in the bin, as it is happening since so many years — [by] Israel in Gaza and Palestine and by India in Kashmir — what do we expect from the multilateral system?”
Asked whether all Muslim countries in the world were carrying equal weight and “doing the jobs they should be doing”, Dar said Pakistan believed that no matter how big or small a state was, their “dignity and respect should be equal”.
In this connection, he also gave the example of India, mentioning that “some country had claimed to have hegemony, to be the net security provider, to be the captain of the entire region”.
But “you saw what happened between May 7 and 10. It’s all settled. The hegemony is buried,” he added, referring to a four-day armed escalation between India and Pakistan. Dar further said that military action by Pakistan at the time was in self-defence.
Answering a follow-up question, he said he believed with regard to Gaza, diplomacy and dialogue were the best options. “It takes time, but you can reach a solution when you sit at the table. But if you are not willing to sit [at] the table, if you are not sincere and have negative and evil designs of expansionism […] then you will never be sincere about the dialogue. So, sincerity in dialogue is also required.”
To a question about whether Israel could attack Pakistan next after Qatar, Dar reminded that India had tried that and Israel “gave it full support according to our information” and the “world saw that the claim is exposed”.
“We are ready. Again, I repeat, we want peace. The nuclear-armed state does not want any destabilisation in the region because that will have consequences beyond [the region],” he added, stressing the need for collective efforts for reforms in UN Security Council resolutions.
Saying that Israel and India were the only countries that did not abide by UN Security Council resolutions, he emphasised evolving a mechanism in the council for taking practical measures to “control the situation” if its resolutions were not acted upon and implemented.
“And that might require physical actions, physical interventions.”</p><small>2025-09-16 08:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/161305580c5a03c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942399/afghan-man-handed-life-sentence-in-germany-after-fatal-stabbing-at-anti-islam-rally' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan man handed life sentence in Germany after fatal stabbing at anti-Islam rally</strong></a><br><p>An Afghan man was sentenced to life in prison by a German court on Tuesday for a knife attack that killed a police officer and injured five others at an anti-Islam rally last year.
The verdict comes at a time of heated debate about immigration and security in Germany, and a strong surge in support for the country’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
The defendant, named only as Sulaiman A to protect his privacy, was found guilty of using a large hunting knife to attack people during a demonstration in the western city of Mannheim that was organised by the anti-Islam group Pax Europa in late May 2024.
 
 

Sulaiman A attacked a speaker and several demonstrators at the event before stabbing a police officer who rushed in to help. The officer later succumbed to his injuries.
The attacker was taken into pre-trial custody in June 2024 after leaving intensive care for injuries he sustained during his arrest.
Though prosecutors say he sympathised with the Islamic State group, he was not tried as a terrorist. He faced one count of murder and five counts of attempted murder.</p><small>2025-09-16 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623942-pakistan-calls-for-unity-among-muslims-reaffirms-support-for-qatar-in-aftermath-of-israeli-attack' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with Emir Sheikh Tamim, PM Shehbaz reaffirms support for Qatar</strong></a><br><p>

In an appearance on Fox News’ “Fox & Friends,” Patel said investigators believe Tyler Robinson also wrote a physical note saying he had the “opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk” and would do so. The note was destroyed, Patel said, but investigators have collected forensic evidence that it had existed and confirmed its contents through interviews.
Patel did not say who had received the text message or whether anyone had seen the written note before the attack.
Investigators have not publicly identified a motive. Law enforcement authorities have said they believe Robinson acted alone when he shot Kirk, but are investigating whether anyone else had a role in plotting the killing.
Separately, the Washington Post reported on Monday that Robinson had sent a message via the online platform Discord to friends, apparently confessing to the crime on Thursday night, shortly before he was arrested.
“It was me at UVU yesterday. im sorry for all of this,” read a message from the account belonging to Robinson, the newspaper reported, citing two people familiar with the chat as well as screenshots it had obtained.
Kirk, an influential ally of US President Donald Trump who co-founded the leading conservative student group Turning Point USA, was killed by a single rifle shot last Wednesday during an event at Utah Valley University in Orem, about 40 miles south (65 km) of Salt Lake City.
Court hearing by video
Robinson, 22, is expected to be formally charged on Tuesday, around the same time that he makes an initial court appearance by video from his jail cell.
Patel told Fox News that DNA matching the suspect’s was found on a towel that was wrapped around the rifle believed to be the murder weapon and on a screwdriver found on the rooftop that served as the shooter’s sniper perch.
Robinson has not cooperated with authorities, Utah Governor Spencer Cox said on Sunday, but investigators have been interviewing his friends and family in an effort to determine the motive for the shooting.
The killing has shaken a country already gripped by a spike in political violence, fueled by deepening polarisation between the right and the left.
Both sides have universally condemned Kirk’s slaying as an indefensible act of political violence, though partisan differences have emerged over the framing of that message.
Some Republicans, including Trump, have blamed liberal groups for Kirk’s murder despite a lack of evidence, while Democrats have noted that left-wing figures have also been the targets of political violence in recent years.
The left and right also disagree over Kirk’s legacy and how he should be remembered.
Legacy divided
Kirk’s supporters cast him as an influential and charismatic figure who galvanised support for Trump among younger voters in 2024, and the Republican president has honoured Kirk by ordering flags flown at half-staff on public buildings.
Civil rights advocates and liberals have criticised Kirk as a divisive figure who embraced Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of a stolen election in 2020 and has marginalised Blacks, women, the LGBT community, Muslims and immigrants with derogatory rhetoric.
In an appearance on Kirk’s eponymous podcast on Monday, Vice President JD Vance said the “incredibly destructive movement of left-wing extremism” had helped lead to Kirk’s killing.
While Robinson was raised in a Mormon household by religious parents in a deeply conservative region of the state, “his ideology was very different than his family,” Cox said on Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program, without going into specifics.
State records show Robinson had registered to vote without choosing a party affiliation and did not vote in the 2024 presidential election. But a relative told police that Robinson had grown more political and had expressed dislike for Kirk in a recent conversation.
House Speaker Mike Johnson and three other top members of the House Republican leadership held a brief vigil on Monday for Kirk, attended by dozens of lawmakers, friends and supporters in Statuary Hall of the US Capitol.
Back in Utah, at the scene of Kirk’s assassination, scores of mourners have flocked to makeshift memorials in recent days to leave flowers and handwritten notes, and to inscribe messages in chalk on campus sidewalks, many of them Bible verses.
Dally Bronson, 22, a sheriff’s dispatcher from neighbouring Wasatch County who was on duty at the time Kirk was shot, said that as a devout Christian, she felt torn about what justice should look like.
Describing herself as an admirer of Kirk, Bronson said she had been praying for both him and his accused killer.
“By all accounts (Robinson) was a good kid until recently, when something went terribly wrong,” she said, speaking through tears. Kirk’s “killing isn’t about one political side or the other - it’s about good and evil. The shooter encountered a darkness online; he went into some black hole on the internet, and it’s something people our age fall into.”</p><small>2025-09-16 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623949-world-must-act-to-stop-israel-pakistan-calls-for-action-against-escalating-aggression' target='_blank'><strong>'World must act to stop Israel': Pakistan calls for action against escalating aggression</strong></a><br><p>

The statement comes after Trump threatened last week to sue The New York Times for its reporting related to a sexually suggestive note and drawing given to Epstein.
“Today, I have the great honour of bringing a $15 billion dollar defamation and libel lawsuit against The New York Times,” Trump said in a post on his social media platform, Truth Social.
The New York Times did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.
Trump accused the paper of lying about him, his family and businesses, as well as Republican-led movements and ideologies such as the America First Movement, and Make America Great Again, or MAGA.

Industry leaders argue the legislation was drafted without consulting stakeholders and hands sweeping powers to bureaucratic bodies, particularly the Engineering Development Board (EDB). They warn that vague and punitive provisions could discourage investors at a time when the government is seeking stability and foreign capital.
One of the most contentious elements is the classification of routine matters — including recalls and warranty disputes — as cognisable offences enforceable by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA). Automakers say this equates manufacturers with criminals and will undermine confidence.
Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) Director-General Abdul Waheed Khan, in a letter to the Ministry of Industries on Sept 8, said the draft “criminalises manufacturing and trading activities without clear justification,” adding that FIA involvement is deeply troubling.

Industry rejects excessive FIA role, unchecked powers for EDB

He noted the law does little to strengthen consumer protection beyond the existing Auto Policy 2021–26 and instead threatens to push documented businesses into difficulties while leaving the unorganised sector unchecked.
 
 

The industry further pointed out that Pakistan already has multiple regulatory frameworks covering safety, quality and consumer rights — including the Auto Policy 2021–26, SRO 656, competition law, consumer protection laws, and the Import and Export Control Act. Local assemblers also comply with 17 international United Nations Economic Commission for Europe safety standards and are working to adopt more. Warranties, after-sales service and recalls are already standard practice, they stressed.
Particular unease surrounds the discretionary authority granted to the EDB. Unlike statutory regulators such as the SECP or CCP, the EDB lacks legislative backing, accountability and technical capacity. Yet under the draft, it is tasked with overseeing recalls, type approvals, repairs, and even surveillance powers to enter premises without warrants.
Mr Khan argued that the EDB does not have the facilities to issue type approvals or monitor thousands of workshops nationwide. Such provisions, he said, are “impractical at best and open to misuse at worst.”
For consumers, the law could also backfire. Automakers warn that additional compliance costs and red tape will drive up vehicle prices, while vague language such as “significant risk” or “unfair contract terms” leaves room for arbitrary enforcement.
The industry emphasises it is not opposing regulation but is calling for targeted guidelines and stricter enforcement of existing laws. Stakeholders argue genuine consultation with manufacturers, provincial governments and consumer groups is necessary to close regulatory gaps without stifling growth.
 
 

Citing Section 5, Mr Khan noted manufacturers cannot be held responsible for accidents caused by reckless or untrained drivers who ignore basic precautions such as wearing seat belts. “This section must be rephrased in consultation with the industry,” he urged.
Similarly, Section 9 — which requires a conformity certificate — duplicates existing practice since assemblers already issue COCs. Any post-purchase modifications, such as tyre changes or body alterations, should absolve assemblers of liability, he added.
PAMA also rejected provisions placing repair services under EDB oversight, saying the board lacks the capacity to regulate thousands of workshops. The roles of EDB staff under Section 15, which allow undefined employees to exercise powers of the Act, were also termed legally questionable.Mr Khan urged the government to hold back the draft for “appropriate scrutiny of its administrative aspects,” and to remove provisions that criminalise industry operations.

Ms Mazari earlier approached the IHC’s anti-harassment committee, and also sent a reference against CJ Dogar to Supreme Judicial Council.
In response to her complaint, Justice Imtiaz, being the ‘competent authority’, not only entertained the complaint but also formed an inquiry committee in consultation with her fellow judges.
A circular from her office said that, being the competent authority under the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010, the inquiry committee comprising Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Justice Imtiaz has been formed to conduct an inquiry into the complaints of harassment against the IHC judges.

Imaan Mazari-Hazir also moves plaint before SJC

However, the court administration sw­iftly de-notified her as the competent au­­thority and replaced her with Justice Ina­­am Ameen Minhas.
 
 

As per the court record, a similar committee was already constituted in 2019, comprising the member inspection team (MIT), deputy and assistant registrars under the said act, in order to probe the allegations of harassment. A senior official of the IHC, however, claimed that the act was not applicable to judges as they could only be charged under Article 209 of the Constitution.
Another reason for de-notifying Justice Imtiaz was that being the competent authority, she could not be part of the inquiry committee. Subsection 4 of section 4 of the Act says, “The Inquiry Committee shall submit its findings and recommendations to the Competent Authority within thirty days of the initiation of inquiry.”
Last week, Ms Mazari and CJ Dogar had a heated exchange during the hearing of case. At the time, Justice Dogar had warned Ms Mazari of contempt and was reported to have passed warning remarks along the lines of “getting hold of her”. Ms Mazari said she was only fulfilling her professional duty and was ready to face contempt proceedings.
 
 

Separately, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) submitted a challan in the controversial tweet case against Ms Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, in the court of Senior Civil Judge Abbas Shah.
The court has also issued notices to the accused and directed that copies of the challan be provided to them at the next hearing, scheduled for Sept 17.
The NCCIA had registered a case against them over alleged controversial tweets under cybercrime laws. Both accused are facing charges of violating online content regulations, which authorities argue could incite unrest.

The Toshakhana record, made public by the cabinet division for the period between January and June 2025, lists high-value items such as watches, luxury vehicles, carpets, handicrafts, and traditional artefacts presented to top state functionaries, including the president, prime minister, ministers, and senior officials during foreign visits and local engagements.
The data, comprising 137 entries, records gifts received from heads of state, royal families, diplomats, and business delegations. However, the value of these gifts is still being assessed by the cabinet division.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received a total of 61 gifts, mostly decorative and traditional items. These included several high-end wristwatches. Notably, on the first day of 2025, he was presented with two luxury wristwatches — an IWC Schaffhausen and a Panerai, both with warranty cards — by Sheikh Abdul Hadi Mana Al-Hajri of Qatar.

Record shows PM received 61 out of total 137 gifts presented to state officials

The Shah of the State of Selangor, Malaysia, gifted PM Shehbaz a ‘Golden Kris’ — a traditional Malaysian dagger. Additionally, the president of Turkiye presented him with an electric car.
 
 

During his visit to Azerbaijan, the prime minister received a handmade silk carpet and other items. The President of Tajikistan gifted him a box containing a golden teacup with a spoon.
While in Saudi Arabia, PM Shehbaz received a model of Mimbar-e-Rasool from Prince Mansour Bin Muhammad Bin Saad bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, and a wooden box containing two documents — the Charter of Makkah in English and Arabic — from Dr Mohammad Abdulkareem Al-Issa, Secretary General of the Muslim World League.
From Iran, the PM was presented with a wall hanging and a shield by the Chief of General Staff. Other gifts included handmade carpets, onyx decorations, paintings, tea sets, books, and shields.
Interestingly, while the Saudi hosts did not overwhelm the prime minister with lavish gifts, several Pakistani officials visiting the Kingdom — led by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — received high-end wristwatches.
On Jan 28, Interior Minister of Saudi Arabia gifted six Rolex watches, five Tudor watches, three Black Armin watches, and nine Frank Rosha watches to Pakistani officials, primarily government officers.
 
 

The record shows that President Asif Ali Zardari received 11 gifts, including a ladies’ suit and a bedsheet from the High Commissioner of Bangladesh. The most valuable among his gifts was an electric vehicle from the president of Turkiye. He also received a carpet from the Iranian foreign minister, as well as vases, candle stands, shields, a coffee set, and onyx items.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar received several Afghan carpets and traditional bowls, while Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was presented with prayer mats and Turkish handicrafts.
Other ministers, advisers, and security officials were gifted watches, rugs, wall hangings, and porcelain items.

Maqbool Ahmed Gondal was sworn in as the country’s 22nd AGP on Monday, at a ceremony held in the Supreme Court.
Appointed for a fixed tenure of four years, Mr Gondal will immediately have to deal with the fallout from the AGP office’s U-turn its ‘Consolidated Audit Report of Federal Government for the Audit Year 2024-25’.
The original report, released in August this year, contained the illogical figure of irregularities worth Rs376 trillion, which is 3.5 times more than the country’s total gross domestic product (GDP).

After repeatedly defending its controversial audit report, containing astronomical figure of ‘irregularities’, auditor general’s office finally blames ‘typos’ for the discrepancy

It had alleged procurement-related irregularities of Rs284tr, defective civil works worth Rs85.6tr, receivables of Rs2.5tr, and unresolved circular debt of Rs1.2tr.
The figures implied financial anomalies far beyond the size of Pakistan’s kitty, sparking disbelief even within government circles.
Although the outgoing auditor general, Muhammad Ajmal Gondal, had repeatedly defended the contents of the report, after sustained criticism and media scrutiny, the department conceded its error.
A note appended to the introduction of the fresh report says: “The executive summary of the original version of the Consolidated Audit Report uploaded on the [AGP’s website] had a few typos. At two places, the word ‘trillion’ had been used instead of ‘billion’. The actual amount after rectification is Rs.9.769 trillion.”
The revised amount of Rs9.769tr, still a staggering sum, constitutes nearly two-thirds of the federal budget for FY2023-24.
The revised report explains that the irregularities span multiple years and include out-of-budget items such as circular debt, land disputes, and corporate accounts.
This new version was uploaded to the AGP office’s official website last week.
When asked why the AGP office chose to initially defend the report which contained the incorrect figures, an official privy to the matter claimed that this seemed to have become “a matter of credibility as well as ego of the department”.
Expert opinion
Experts Dawn spoke to about the discrepancy offered their own opinions on how such a massive error could have gone undetected.
The Rs376tr figure appears to be an inflated aggregation of audit observations, not actual verified financial losses, and must be contextualised. The AGP only audited 1,362 formations with Rs24.2tr expenditure and Rs20.6tr receipts, so the Rs376tr irregularities claim exceeds the real audit scope,” argues Dr Vaqar Ahmad, an economist with audit expertise.
“The mismatch arises because AGP often records ‘procedural or regulatory deviations’ as irregularities, multiplying values far beyond actual spending,” says Mr Ahmad, who works with the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).
According to him, the Rs5.58tr reported as recovered is deposited with the national exchequer, while the remaining ‘irregularities’ are mostly audit objections unlikely to be fully realised recoveries.
A former provincial auditor general was at pains to clarify that these figures constituted irregularities, not corruption.
“There are over 30 criterions these spending are judged against. One project could fall under over a dozen conditions — like Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA), Finance Divisions Rules, the particular contract conditions, rules of the contracting bodies (Wapda, Pepco etc.) and so on. If a contract is judged on ten different criteria — its different steps falling under different legal provisions, the irregularities are bound to multiply,” he said.
According to a senior official in the Punjab government, audits in Pakistan are conducted under the obsolete and typical ‘desi’ mindset of just creating more and more audit paras having no solid evidence of corruption. Such audits are usually not specific to irregularities as per the actual budget expenditures, thus revealing exaggerated figures to put pressure on the departments.
“If the auditor doesn’t find receipt of any expense during the audit, he considers it misappropriation of funds even though the department-under audit, proves making such expense through other solid evidences. In certain cases, the auditor even declares the whole procurement process suspicious, multiplying it several times with the actual expenses.
“In my whole service, I have never seen any auditor specific to auditing the actual budget expenditures. Certain portions of the revenue targets, which are not achieved, are also considered as irregularities,” he says.
Housing and Works Division Secretary Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh, who has also served as federal finance as well as federal planning secretary, says the audit has two functions — to oversee whether the expenditures have been made correctly and in line with the rules and regulations; and to point out procedural lapses if irregularities are being committed time and again.
Believing that there is no shortage of expertise at the AGP office, Mr Sheikh stresses it needs to shift from mere auditing transactions to assessing “value for money” as is the case in the developed world.

The bill was announced by Bill Huizenga, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on South and Central Asia and Republican Party lawmaker from Michigan, and co-led by Democrat leader from California Sydney Kamlager-Dove, along with representatives John Moolenaar (Republican), Julie Johnson (Democrat), and Jefferson Shreve (Republican). Additional cosponsors include Rich McCormick (Republican), Jack Bergman (Republican), Joaquin Castro (Democrat), and Mike Lawler (Republican).
The freedom and accountability bill authorizes the US President to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which allows Washington to target individuals responsible for severe human rights violations or corruption. In this case, it would apply to current or former senior officials of Pakistan’s government, military, or security forces.
The legislation also reaffirms US support for free and fair elections in Pakistan and emphasises the importance of upholding democratic institutions and human rights.

Bill referred to Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees for review

It builds on House Resolution 901 (H.Res. 901), passed in June 2024 with overwhelming bipartisan support.
That resolution expressed strong backing for democracy in Pakistan, called for protection of free and fair elections, and urged the US administration to engage with the Pakistani government to uphold human rights, rule of law, and freedom of speech.
Speaking on the new legislation, Congressman Huizenga said, “The United States will not sit idly by, as individuals who currently serve or have previously served in Pakistan’s government, military, or security forces commit or downplay blatant human rights abuses.
The Pakistan Freedom and Accountability Act is a bipartisan measure designed to protect the people of Pakistan by holding bad actors accountable and ensuring that neither the democratic process nor free speech is drowned out in Pakistan.”
 
 

Ranking Member Kamlager-Dove emphasised, “Promoting democracy and protecting human rights are core tenets of US foreign policy and must remain central to the administration’s engagement in Pakistan.
“At a time of democratic backsliding and global unrest, the US must defend these values at home and abroad—and hold those who undermine them accountable. I’m proud to join Chair Huizenga in introducing legislation to sanction those who threaten democracy, human rights, and rule of law in Pakistan.”
Democrat leader from Texas Julie Johnson added, “By holding officials accountable when they undermine free and fair elections or commit gross human rights abuses, we send a strong message: those who attack democracy will face consequences, and they will not find impunity on the global stage.”
Diaspora’s efforts
Pakistani-American advocacy groups have played a central role in promoting the freedom and accountability bill and supporting the H.Res. 901.
Ex-president of Pakistan-American Public Affairs Committee Asad Malik said, “This legislation empowers the people of Pakistan and ensures that human rights, free speech, and democracy violators will be accountable and face appropriate consequences.”
Dr Malik Usman of First Pakistan Global highlighted the broader impact of the diaspora’s efforts, saying, “This is a testament to the Pakistani diaspora’s relentless advocacy in Congress and grassroots mobilisation in our communities. This landmark bill is a major step toward Haqeeqi Azadi — standing shoulder-to-shoulder with 250 million Pakistanis for democracy, human rights, and the release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan.”
 
 

The bill has been referred to both the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees for review. Observers note that its bipartisan backing and alignment with H.Res. 901 increase the likelihood of progress through Congress.
Mr Malik added, “This is not just a bill. It affirms that the US Congress is listening, and that Pakistani-Americans will not stop fighting until democracy and human rights are restored in Pakistan, including freedom for Prime Minister Imran Khan and all political prisoners.”
With the accountability bill, the US reasserts its longstanding position of supporting democracy, human rights, and rule of law in Pakistan while holding accountable those who threaten these values.
