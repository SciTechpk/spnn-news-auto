<div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/012310214efea4d.jpg?r=231639' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914783/us-china-trade-row-could-ease-after-trump-xi-talks-treasury-chief' target='_blank'><strong>US-China trade row could ease after Trump-Xi talks: Treasury chief</strong></a><br><p>United States Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday that President Donald Trump could speak with China’s Xi Jinping “very soon” and that such a call could help break the logjam in the trade talks between the world’s two biggest economies.
Trump on Friday accused Beijing of violating a deal reached last month in Geneva — negotiated by Bessent — to temporarily lower staggeringly high tariffs they had imposed on each other, in a pause to last 90 days.
China’s slow-walking on export license approvals for rare earths and other elements needed to make cars and chips have fueled US frustration, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday — a concern since confirmed by US officials.
But Bessent seemed to take the pressure down a notch, telling CBS’s ‘Face the Nation’ that the gaps could be bridged.
“I’m confident that when President Trump and Party Chairman Xi have a call that this will be ironed out,” Bessent said, noting that China was “withholding some of the products that they agreed to release during our agreement.”
When asked if rare earths were one of those products, Bessent said, “Yes.”
“Maybe it’s a glitch in the Chinese system. Maybe it’s intentional. We’ll see after the president speaks with” Xi, he said.
On when a Trump-Xi call could take place, Bessent said: “I believe we will see something very soon.”
Since Trump returned to the presidency, he has slapped sweeping tariffs on most US trading partners, with especially high rates on Chinese imports.
 


New tit-for-tat levies on both sides reached three digits before the de-escalation this month, where Washington agreed to temporarily reduce additional tariffs on Chinese imports from 145 per cent to 30pc. China, meanwhile, lowered its added duties from 125pc to 10pc.
In an interview with ABC’s ‘This Week’, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said China was “slow-rolling the deal,” adding: “We are taking certain actions to show them what it feels like on the other side of that equation.
“Our president understands what to do. He’s going to go work it out,” Lutnick said.</p><small>2025-06-01 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607261-pakistani-american-tycoon-confirms-he-met-imran-khan-several-times-in-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani-American tycoon confirms he met Imran Khan several times in Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>

His comments came during a grand jirga in Quetta on Saturday, organised to interact with tribal leadership and discuss the evolving security situation in Balochistan, with particular focus on terrorists receiving support from India. The COAS and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif delivered speeches and interacted with tribal elders.
In April, at least six people, including three students, lost their lives and over 40 others — mostly students — sustained injuries after a bomb targeted a school bus in Balochistan’s Khuzdar. Following the attack, the military accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
Reaffirming that the enemy’s “nefarious designs will fail”, the field marshal said: “It is an open malicious act of terrorism waged on our people, our progress, and our peace. Pakistan has concrete evidence of India’s involvement with terrorist networks in Balochistan.
“The Pakistan Army, with the unwavering support of the nation and the brave Baloch people, will confront and crush every enemy, foreign or domestic, that dares to challenge our sovereignty.”
Stating that Pakistan was ready to respond to any act of aggression, the field marshal said, “Peace in Balochistan is non-negotiable and that the future of Pakistan is directly linked to a stable, prosperous Balochistan.”
Earlier during the event, PM Shehbaz underscored that terrorist groups under the umbrella of Fitna Al Hindustan sought the support of locals, which must be denied to them.
“Indian-sponsored proxies operating in Balochistan have intensified their efforts to undermine peace, destabilise the province, and disrupt development initiatives led by the Government of Pakistan and the Armed Forces,” PM Shehbaz emphasised.
The prime minister reiterated the need for engagement at the grassroots level and ensuring that terrorists find no social space.
The tribal elders agreed to stand “shoulder-to-shoulder” with the government and the armed forces, reaffirming their commitment to the security, stability, and development of the province.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
In March, the Jaffar Express train was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.</p><small>2025-06-01 17:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01221106f361b0c.jpg?r=222620' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914773/delegation-presenting-pakistans-stance-on-escalation-with-india-to-land-in-new-york-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Delegation presenting Pakistan’s stance on escalation with India to land in New York tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, along with a nine-member high-level parliamentary delegation, will visit New York tomorrow on a two-day visit to present Pakistan’s perspective on the recent military clash with India and counter New Delhi’s disinformation campaign on the conflict.
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a diplomatic delegation to important world capitals in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with the neighbouring country. He entrusted PPP Chairman Bilawal to lead the delegation.
The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
According to Associated Press of Pakistan (APP), the delegation members would conduct several meetings, including with the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang, and the ambassadors of permanent and non-permanent members of the UN Security Council.
Besides these meetings, the delegation will also brief the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) members at the UN, the report said.
Bilawal, along with other members of the delegation, would interact with media representatives after the visit.
The visit follows a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
As New Delhi launched air strikes in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan downed five Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
In a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p><small>2025-06-01 17:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/012213279f00211.jpg?r=221518' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914772/motor-racing-piastri-wins-in-spain-angry-verstappen-demoted' target='_blank'><strong>Motor racing-Piastri wins in Spain, angry Verstappen demoted</strong></a><br><p>Formula One leader Oscar Piastri won the Spanish Grand Prix from pole position in a McLaren one-two with Lando Norris on Sunday while Max Verstappen was demoted from fifth to 10th for a late collision with George Russell’s Mercedes.
Piastri beat teammate and title rival Norris by 2.471 seconds for his fifth win in nine races this season, and McLaren’s seventh, to stretch his championship lead to 10 points.
Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc completed the podium after passing Verstappen’s Red Bull six laps from the end of a race that saved the drama to the end.
“It’s a nice way to bounce back from Monaco. A superb weekend,” said Piastri, who finished third last weekend in a race won from pole by Norris.
Verstappen, who made four stops in total and ended up fighting on the slower hard tyres against rivals with softs, collided with Leclerc and then twice with Russell after a safety car restart with six laps to go.
“I’ve seen those sort of manoeuvres before on simulator games and go-karting but never in F1,” said Russell, who has had clashes before with four times world champion Verstappen.
“I don’t really know what was going through his mind.”
Penalty points
Nico Rosberg, Mercedes 2016 world champion and now a pundit for Sky Sports television, said Verstappen should have been black-flagged for what looked to him like intentional retaliation for the earlier contact.
The 10-second penalty was added to Verstappen’s time post-race, with the driver also given three penalty points to take his total tally to 11 for the 12 month period - one step from a one-race ban.
Verstappen and Leclerc also faced a post-race investigation for their clash.
“I tried to push him to the left, there was a bit of contact but fortunately no consequences,” said Leclerc.
Verstappen claimed the Monegasque had rammed into him and should have given back the place.
Russell finished fourth after eventually being let through by Verstappen, who was incensed to be told to do so but reluctantly obeyed.
Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg finished a surprising and morale-boosting fifth for the future Audi team after passing Ferrari’s seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton on the penultimate lap.
Hamilton was a disappointing sixth, Isack Hadjar seventh for Racing Bulls and Pierre Gasly eighth for Renault-owned Alpine.
Ferrari moved up to second from fourth in the constructors’ standings, now 197 points behind McLaren.
Verstappen remained third in the drivers’ championship but now 49 points behind Piastri in what is becoming a McLaren battle.
First points
Home hero Fernando Alonso scored his first points of the season with Aston Martin, who had only one car on the grid due to Lance Stroll’s withdrawal through injury after Saturday’s qualifying.
Piastri led away at the start with Verstappen seizing second from Norris while Hamilton and Leclerc moved up to fourth and fifth as Russell lost out.
Hamilton let Leclerc through on lap 10 of 66 after the two Ferraris had run nose to tail.
Norris took back second place from Verstappen on lap 13, the Dutch driver making no attempt to defend against the quicker McLaren and pitting in the next lap for fresh tyres.
Verstappen took the lead again on lap 23 after Piastri pitted, with Norris making his first stop on lap 21 and coming out behind the Red Bull, but that lasted only until Verstappen pitted for a second time on lap 30.
He came in for a third stop on lap 47 but Norris pitted the lap after to defend second place.
A safety car deployment on lap 55, after Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli beached his Mercedes in the gravel, bunched up the field and triggered a rash of stops.
The McLarens came in together for fresh tyres, double-stacking, and resumed ahead of Verstappen who questioned the switch to a set of hards but was told that was the only option available.
“That safety car just came at the wrong time,” he said. “On the straight, I got driven into already and then into Turn One as well. Then they told me to give the position back.”</p><small>2025-06-01 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01175409c1f884a.jpg?r=175621' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914758/jui-fs-fazl-assails-child-marriage-law-announces-protest-rallies-across-country' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F’s Fazl assails child marriage law, announces protest rallies across country</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Sunday rejected the recently enacted Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act 2025, announcing nationwide protest rallies aimed at “creating awareness” among the public.
The bill, which sought to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18 in Islamabad, was signed into law by the president on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.
However, the move attracted strong opposition from religious segments of society, with the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) — a constitutional body responsible for giving legal advice on Islamic issues to the government and the Parliament — ruling that “classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.”
 
 

Addressing a press conference in Peshawar today, the JUI-F chief rejected the law, alleging that it “made fornication easier while making legitimate marriages difficult”.
“Pakistan is a strange country — during the time of General Musharraf, a constitutional amendment was passed in the name of women’s rights that decriminalised fornication,” Fazl said. “It took it out of the realm of sin.
“Now, they are trying to ban the marriage of people under 18. The CII has already rejected this and all ulemas and their parties have agreed that it contradicts the Quran and sunnah,” he added, lamenting that despite constitutional guarantees, the Constitution was “being trampled”.
Announcing that the JUI-F would “take steps” to protest the legislation, Fazl announced a series of rallies and a large conference in Hazara Division in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on June 29.
“We will stage rallies, but they won’t focus on one subject, like Al-Aqsa Mosque,” the party chief explained. “Now, we will host rallies to create awareness about national sovereignty and Islamic governance.”
He added, “God willing, we will present our stance to the world freely. Islam is a faith that moves with the world and can be beneficial.”
Underage marriages are practised in some parts of the country, most commonly in rural areas, driven largely by poverty and limited access to education. According to a 2019 World Health Organisation report, about 21 per cent of girls in Pakistan were married before 18.
The same year, the Senate passed the Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Bill, 2018 — a private member bill presented by PPP  Senator Sherry Rehman, proposing that the legal minimum age of marriage in the country be set at 18.
At that time, JUI-F had opposed the bill as well, calling it “contradictory to Islamic principles,” and suggesting that the bill should be sent to the CII before being discussed in the Senate. It was, however, not passed by the National Assembly.
Similarly, in 2021, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2021 presented by PPP MPA Nighat Orakzai — aimed at banning marriages of people under the age of 18 — could not become law.
In 2014, the Sindh government had promulgated the Sindh Child Marriage Restraint Act 2013.</p><small>2025-06-01 16:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01204044f4de566.png?r=210926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914767/may-sees-modest-rise-in-attacks-but-militants-fail-to-escalate-amid-regional-crisis-report' target='_blank'><strong>May sees modest rise in attacks, but militants fail to escalate amid regional crisis: report</strong></a><br><p>Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India in May, militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in Pakistan, according to data released by the Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) on Sunday.
The PICSS monthly security assessment recorded 85 militant attacks in May —up slightly from 81 in April — resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.
A total of 182 people were injured, comprising 130 civilians, 47 security personnel, four militants, and one peace committee member.
This marks a five per cent increase in militant attacks compared to April. Notably, there was a 73pc rise in security personnel deaths, and a dramatic 145pc increase in civilian injuries (from 53 in April to 130 in May).
However, injuries among security personnel decreased by 20pc, falling from 59 to 47.
In operations initiated by security forces during the month, at least 59 militants were killed, while five security personnel lost their lives. Additionally, seven security personnel and five militants sustained injuries. Security forces also arrested 52 suspected militants during various intelligence-based operations.
Combining militant attacks and security operations, the overall casualty toll for May stood at 172 deaths — including 57 security personnel, 65 militants, 46 civilians, and four peace committee members.
A total of 194 people were injured, comprising 130 civilians, 54 security personnel, nine militants, and one peace committee member. Militants also abducted at least 19 individuals during the month.
A striking aspect of the May security landscape was a 78pc rise in the deaths of security personnel, contrasted with a 68pc decline in militant deaths compared to April.
Notably, May was the first month since October 2024 in which militant fatalities were recorded in double digits (65), a sharp drop from 203 in April.
Provincial overview
Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa remained the most affected provinces, accounting for 82 of the 85 attacks nationwide.
Balochistan experienced the highest level of violence, with 35 militant attacks that left 51 people dead — including 30 civilians, 18 security personnel, and three militants — and 100 injured (94 civilians, five security personnel, one militant). Militants also abducted nine individuals in the province.
A particularly tragic incident occurred in Khuzdar, where a blast targeted an Army Public School bus, killing eight children (mostly girls) and two staff members, and injuring 35 others.
In the merged tribal districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 22 militant attacks led to 45 deaths, including 23 security personnel, 12 civilians, six militants, and four peace committee members.
Additionally, 58 people were injured, comprising 30 security personnel, 27 civilians, and one peace committee member.
In mainland KP, excluding the tribal districts, 25 militant attacks resulted in 14 deaths, including 10 security personnel and two each from civilians and militants. Additionally, 24 people were injured, including 12 security personnel, nine civilians, and three militants.
Sindh witnessed three militant attacks, resulting in the deaths of two civilians and one security personnel.
No militant attacks were reported from Punjab, Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK), or Gilgit-Baltistan.
However, Punjab recorded the highest number of militant arrests, with 39 suspects detained in intelligence-based operations. In Azad Kashmir, security forces conducted a raid in Rawalakot, killing four militants reportedly affiliated with Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-01 16:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01184719ee34af2.jpg?r=202253' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914761/navy-conducts-comprehensive-exercise-to-counter-sub-conventional-asymmetric-threats-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Navy conducts comprehensive exercise to counter sub-conventional, asymmetric threats to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Navy on Sunday conducted a comprehensive two-day exercise “focusing on countering sub-conventional and asymmetric threats across all major ports and harbours of Pakistan,” a statement said on Sunday.
The naval exercise took place amid heightened tensions with India, following four days of clashes involving fighter jets, missiles, drones, and artillery, before a ceasefire was declared.
On Friday, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said his country would use the “firepower of their navy in response to any future aggression by Pakistan.”  In response, a spokesperson for Pak­is­tan’s military referred Reuters to a May 12 statement, which said there would be a “comprehensive and decisive” res­ponse whenever Pakis­tan’s sovereignty was “threatened and territorial integrity violated”.
According to a press release issued today by the Pakistan Navy’s Director General Public Relations Commodore Ahmed Hussain, the naval fleet conducted a comprehensive two-day exercise focusing on countering sub-conventional and asymmetric threats across all major ports and harbours.
“The exercises were aimed at validating and refining tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) to ensure robust defence of critical maritime infrastructure against evolving asymmetric threats,” the statement said.
“The exercise involved coordinated operations by PN (Pakistan Navy) Fleet units, Pak Marines, SSG (Navy) and Naval Aviation assets,” it added.
 
 

The statement said that the exercise scenarios were “designed to simulate a range of sub-conventional threats” including sabotage, infiltration and unconventional attacks, enabling participating units to enhance inter-agency coordination, situational awareness and rapid response capabilities.
Commander Coast (Comcoast) Rear Admiral Faisal Amin also visited various operational setups at ports and harbours during the course of the exercise, witnessing live-action simulations carried out by participating units, the statement added.
Comcoast Amin appreciated the high level of preparedness and professional conduct demonstrated during the exercises.
He emphasised the importance of maritime installations, adding that the secure functioning of ports and harbours was directly linked to national economic stability and growth.
 






“Pakistan Navy remains committed to maintaining a high state of readiness to respond to all forms of threats and continues to strengthen its capacity to defend the maritime frontiers against emerging challenges,” the statement said.
The latest fighting between Islamabad and New Delhi had erupted after 26 people, mostly tourists, were killed in an April 22 attack in India-held Kashmir’s Pahalgam area.
India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.
A ceasefire took effect on May 10 and a top Pakistani military official told Reuters on Friday that both countries were close to reducing their troop build-up along their border to pre-conflict levels.</p><small>2025-06-01 15:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011434545ca1cc0.jpg?r=194952' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914749/two-bridges-in-russia-collapse-in-blasts-7-dead' target='_blank'><strong>Two bridges in Russia collapse in ‘blasts’, 7 dead</strong></a><br><p>The overnight collapse of two bridges in Russian regions bordering Ukraine that killed seven people were caused by explosions, Russian officials said on Sunday, treating them as “acts of terrorism”.
In Russia’s Bryansk region, an explosion caused a road bridge to collapse onto a railway line late Saturday, derailing a passenger train heading to Moscow and killing seven people, authorities said.
A separate rail bridge in the neighbouring Kursk region was blown up hours later in the early hours of Sunday, derailing a freight train and injuring the driver.
Authorities did not say who was behind the explosions, but investigators said a criminal inquiry was underway.
Russian President Vladimir Putin was briefed on the incidents throughout the night, the Kremlin said.
Videos posted on social media from the Bryansk region showed rescuers clambering over the mangled chassis of a train belonging to national operator
Russian Railways, while screams could be heard in another video.
“There are seven dead as a result of the collapse of a bridge onto railway tracks,” Alexander Bogomaz, the Bryansk region’s governor, wrote on Telegram. At least 71 people were injured, 44 of whom were in hospital, he told reporters.
“Last night… in the Zheleznogorsk district, a bridge collapsed while a freight locomotive was passing. Part of the train fell onto the road below the bridge,” Kursk region governor Alexander Khinshtein said on Telegram.
“One of the locomotive drivers suffered leg injuries, and the entire crew was taken to hospital,” he said.
‘Illegal interference’
There was no immediate comment from Russian investigators as to who was behind the blasts.
A spokeswoman for Russia’s Investigative Committee said the incidents had been “classified as acts of terrorism”, without elaborating.
But senior ruling party lawmaker Andrey Klishas blamed Ukraine, describing it as a “terrorist enclave”.
Russia has been hit by dozens of sabotage attacks since Moscow launched its full-scale military assault on its neighbour in 2022, many targeting its vast railroad network.
Kyiv says Russia uses railroads to transport troops and weaponry to its forces fighting in Ukraine.
An AFP reporter saw relatives waiting for loved ones to arrive from the Bryansk region at a station in central Moscow.
“Russian Railways said that those who had survived would be coming here,” said 30-year-old entrepreneur Sergey Trinkinets. “My dad finally got in touch. He said he had some bruises and wasn’t feeling very well, so I came to meet him.”
In one video posted on social media, purportedly taken at the scene of the incident in the Bryansk region, someone could be heard screaming as eyewitnesses rushed to find help.
“How did the bridge collapse? There are children there!” a woman can be heard shouting in the video.
Russia’s emergency ministry said a team was on site in the Bryansk region, while Russian Railways said it had dispatched repair trains to the scene.
The incidents came on the eve of a possible meeting between Russian and Ukrainian officials in Istanbul, amid a US-led diplomatic push to end the three-year-long conflict.
Moscow’s three-year assault on Ukraine has resulted in tens of thousands of deaths. Russia currently occupies around a fifth of its neighbour.</p><small>2025-06-01 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607240-daesh-operative-arrested-in-pakistan-turkiye-joint-intelligence-operation-report' target='_blank'><strong>Daesh operative arrested in Pakistan-Turkiye joint intelligence operation: report</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this week, both nations agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging envoys — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.
Pakistan on Friday announced its elevation of diplomatic representation in Afghanistan from Charge d’Affaires to Ambassador level, as bilateral ties “move on a positive trajectory.”
According to the statement, Muttaqi spoke to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar over the phone and discussed upgrading diplomatic relations.
“Muttaqi called it a positive step and expressed hope that the remaining stages would be completed soon,” the statement said. “Both sides expressed that upgrading the level of diplomatic relations would pave the way for expanding cooperation in many areas.”
Meanwhile, the Foreign Office (FO) said that Muttaqi welcomed Pakistan’s decision to upgrade its diplomatic relations to the Ambassador level and informed that Afghanistan has decided to follow suit.
“Both leaders also reviewed the implementation of decisions taken during DPM/FM’s visit to Kabul on 19 April 2025 and vowed to continue working together to establish mutual trust between the two brotherly nations,” the FO said in a statement.
It added that both nations agreed to “work closely” to swiftly finalise a framework agreement for the Uzbekistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan (UAP) Railway Line Project for regional connectivity.
Experts believe that the conversation between Dar and Muttaqi indicates that the two sides remain focused on increasing convergence and cooperation in their bilateral interactions.
“After a period of unprecedented friction in the relations for the past three years, the actions by both sides to upgrade diplomatic representation, releasing held goods of Afghan companies at Pakistani ports, addressing impediments in trade and transit and extension of CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) to Afghanistan are positive and forward-looking measures,” Pakistan’s former ambassador to Afghanistan, Mansoor Ahmad Khan, told Dawn.com.
He added that these decisions should be implemented to “strengthen bilateral relations and make progress for achieving regional connectivity with Central Asia and beyond”.
China has played a key role in the normalisation of relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. Both nations made the announcements days after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated in a statement “to strengthen exchanges and diplomatic contacts late last month.
“Afghanistan and Pakistan expressed a clear willingness to elevate diplomatic relations and agreed in principle to exchange ambassadors as soon as possible,” he said after he hosted Dar and Muttaqi at an informal trilateral meeting in Beijing.
Pakistan-Afghanistan ties have been marred by deep mistrust, cross-border attacks, and sharp disagreements over the presence of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants operating from Afghan territory.
Islamabad has long accused Kabul of harbouring TTP fighters, who were blamed for a 70 per cent increase in attacks inside Pakistan in 2024.
Russia accepts Afghan-nominated ambassador to Moscow
Separately, Russia officially accepted Afghanistan’s nomination of an ambassador to Moscow, the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement on Sunday, as economic and political ties grow between the two sanction-hit nations.
Russia in April suspended its ban on the Taliban, which it had designated for more than two decades as a terrorist organisation, in a move that paved the way for Moscow to normalise ties with the leadership of Afghanistan.
“We hope this new phase will allow both countries to expand cooperation in various fields,” said Muttaqi in a statement.

The arrests took place in the northeastern state of Assam, where Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said, “81 anti-nationals are now behind bars for sympathising with Pak”.
Sarma, from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist ruling party, said in a statement, “Our systems are constantly tracking anti-national posts on social media and taking actions”.
One of the persons was arrested after he posted a Pakistani flag on his Instagram, Assam police told AFP. No further details about other arrests were given.
There has been a wider clampdown on social media since an April 22 attack on tourists in Indian-occupied Kashmir, the deadliest on civilians in the disputed territory in decades.
New Delhi blamed Islamabad for backing the terrorists it said carried out the attack, charges that Pakistan denied. India and Pakistan then fought a four-day conflict, their worst standoff since 1999, before a US-brokered ceasefire was agreed on May 10.
India’s counter-terrorism agency last month arrested a paramilitary police officer for allegedly spying for Pakistan, while authorities have arrested at least 10 other people on espionage charges in May, according to local media.
A week prior to arresting the police official, Indian police arrested 10 people in Haryana, Punjab and Delhi — including a travel vlogger and a university professor — over their alleged connections to Pakistan or comments related to the recent escalation.
Sarma is also pushing efforts to stem the contentious issue of illegal immigration.
Assam shares a long and porous border with neighbouring Muslim-majority Bangladesh. Indian media reported that Assam’s government has allegedly rounded up dozens of alleged Bangladeshis in the past month and taken them to the frontier to cross.
The Times of India newspaper on Saturday reported that Assam was “dumping them in no-man’s land”, suggesting that at least 49 had been pushed back between May 27-29 alone.
The Assam government has not commented on the reports.
Bangladesh, largely encircled by land by India, has seen relations with New Delhi turn icy, after the Dhaka government was toppled in an uprising last year.
Bangladesh has also moved closer to China, as well as to Pakistan.</p><small>2025-06-01 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607241-earthquake-of-36-magnitude-jolts-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Earthquake of 3.6 magnitude jolts parts of Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

Both Rafal Trzaskowski of ruling centrists Civic Coalition (KO) and his rival Karol Nawrocki, backed by nationalists Law and Justice (PiS), are hoping to mobilise their supporters and clinch the race.
Trzaskowski had a narrow lead in pre-election opinion polls, but the difference was within the margin of error. Voting was due to end at 9 pm (1900 GMT), with exit polls published soon afterwards. The electoral commission says it hopes final results will be announced on Monday morning or early afternoon.
Parliament holds most power in Poland, but the president can veto legislation, so the vote is being watched closely in neighbouring Ukraine, as well as in Russia, the US and across the EU.
Both candidates agree on the need to spend heavily on defence, as US President Trump is demanding from Europe, and to continue supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s three-year-old invasion.
But while Trzaskowski sees Ukraine’s future membership of NATO as essential for Poland’s security, Nawrocki has recently said he would not ratify it as president as this could draw the alliance into a war with Russia.
Trzaskowski says strong relations with both Brussels and Washington are essential for Poland’s security, but Nawrocki, who met Trump in the White House in May, prioritises relations with the United States.
Turnout stood at 24.8 per cent at noon, the head of the electoral commission, Sylwester Marciniak, told reporters on Sunday. That compared with 24.7pc at the same stage of voting in the second round of the presidential election in 2020, when the final turnout was at 68pc.
“The most important thing is foreign policy,” said IT specialist Robert Kepczynski, 53, who was voting in Warsaw. “We can’t look both ways, to the US and the EU, and looking only to the US for help is short-sighted.”
Economist Maria Luczynska, 73, said that going to vote made her emotional. “(The election) is important because this is how we decide our future. What country my daughter, my grandchildren will live in.”
If Nawrocki wins, he is likely to follow a similar path to outgoing President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally who has used his veto power to block the government’s efforts to undo the previous PiS administration’s judicial reforms, which the EU says undermined the independence of the courts.
Coming around a year and a half since Prime Minister Donald Tusk took office, the vote provides the toughest test yet of support for his broad coalition government, with Nawrocki presenting the ballot as a referendum on its actions.
In 2023, huge queues outside polling stations in large cities forced some to stay open later than planned. Analysts said that high participation by younger, liberal, urban Poles was crucial in securing a majority for Tusk.
Trzaskowski is hoping that such scenes will be repeated on Sunday. “Encourage everyone, so that as many Poles as possible vote in the presidential election,” he told a rally in Wloclawek, central Poland, on Friday.
Nawrocki, who draws inspiration from Trump and his Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement, told supporters in Biala Podlaska in the country’s east that “these elections could be decided by single votes”.
Social issues
The two candidates also differ on social issues, with Trzaskowski favouring the liberalisation of abortion laws and introduction of civil partnerships for LGBT couples, while Nawrocki says predominantly Catholic Poland should reject such moves.
The first round of the election on May 18 saw a surge in support for the anti-establishment far-right, suggesting that the KO-PiS duopoly that has dominated Polish politics for a generation may be starting to fracture.
Nevertheless, after a tumultuous campaign in which Nawrocki in particular faced a slew of negative media reports about his alleged past conduct, once again candidates representing the two main parties are facing off in the second round.
PiS has traditionally enjoyed high support in small towns and rural areas, especially in the south and east. These areas are typically more socially conservative than larger cities and poorer, creating a sense of exclusion that PiS has tapped into.
“They want to build a Poland for the elites,” Nawrocki told voters in Biala Podlaska, referring to his opponents from KO.
KO, meanwhile, campaigns on a pro-European centrist agenda that appeals to more liberal-minded Poles who mainly live in cities or bigger towns.
Trzaskowski took heart from the turnout at a rally in Ciechanow, central Poland. “Looking at this mobilisation, I see how much hope you have - hope in a future in which Poland plays a leading role in the European Union,” he said.</p><small>2025-06-01 13:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0114173052d59c4.jpg?r=141737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914744/punjab-govt-bans-temporary-mechanical-rides-on-eve-of-eidul-azha' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab govt bans temporary mechanical rides on eve of Eidul Azha</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab home department has banned the operation of temporary mechanical rides installed during Eidul Azha holidays, fairs, festivals and other seasonal events for a short period of time at any location of the province, according to a notification issued on Sunday.
In the past, several accidents have been reported due to malfunctioning and falling mechanical rides, resulting in the loss of lives, including children, and injuries to several other riders. Such incidents were reported at amusement and water parks in different cities, including Lahore and Multan, in the province.
Mechanical ride accidents are generally reported during Eid holidays or Christmas holidays, as more families visit amusement parks with their children to enjoy the rides.
A notification issued today by the Punjab home department said that temporary mechanical rides typically setup or installed during Eidul Azha holidays, fairs, festivals, and other seasonal events for a short period of time “shall not to be allowed to operate at any location of Punjab on the eve of Eidul Azha 2025.”
However, mechanical rides installed on a permanent basis at different amusement parks, theme parks and play areas “will be allowed to operate, subject to the provision of a fitness certificate by the owners/operators of mechanical rides”.
The operators must verify to their respective deputy commissioners “that each ride has undergone the necessary safety inspections and meets all regulatory standards for the safety/ protection of public”.
A similar ban was imposed during Eidul Fitr holidays earlier this year.
Eidul Azha will be observed on Saturday, June 7. The announcement was made by Maulana Syed Abdul Khabir Azad, chairman of the committee, following a meeting held in Islamabad to assess moon-sighting reports.</p><small>2025-06-01 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011650376448339.jpg?r=165048' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914753/aurangzeb-hails-ipsos-consumer-confidence-survey-results-reiterates-positive-economic-direction' target='_blank'><strong>Aurangzeb hails Ipsos consumer confidence survey results, reiterates positive economic direction</strong></a><br><p>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Sunday hailed the results of the Ipsos Consumer Confidence Survey for the second quarter of 2025, saying the findings reflected the government’s successful microeconomic strategy over the last 14 months.
The survey was conducted by Ipsos, a global market research firm that gathers insights on consumer behaviour, public opinion, and market trends. The firm uses methods like online polls, interviews, and focus groups across 89 countries.
A press release by the Ministry of Finance said today that Aurangzeb welcomed the survey findings, calling them a strong affirmation of the improving economic outlook and public sentiment across Pakistan.
“The survey reveals a significant surge in consumer confidence, with 42 per cent of Pakistanis now believing the country is heading in the right direction — the highest level recorded in six years,” the release said.
Perceptions of the economy being strong also reached their most favourable levels since August 2019. Notably, optimism had overtaken pessimism for the first time since consumer confidence tracking began, marking a key psychological shift among the population.
Aurangzeb noted that this data reflected the success of the government’s disciplined and targeted macroeconomic strategy implemented over the last 14 months.
“The stabilisation of key economic indicators — including the containment of inflation, strengthening of the exchange rate, rebuilding of foreign exchange reserves, and improved fiscal discipline — has created a foundation for renewed public trust and economic recovery,” the press release said.
He highlighted that consumer confidence in making major purchases and investments had doubled compared to the same period last year, indicating that households are beginning to feel more secure in their financial prospects.
Similarly, confidence in job security was now at its highest since 2019, a sign that labour market conditions were gradually stabilising in response to pro-growth policies and reforms.
Aurangzeb further pointed out that this upswing in confidence spanned across urban and rural areas, and was particularly evident among youth and women — demonstrating the broad-based nature of the economic turnaround.
He linked this optimism to sustained government efforts to create an enabling environment for private sector growth, boost exports, enhance social protection, and encourage financial inclusion.
The finance minister reaffirmed that the government remained committed to maintaining macroeconomic stability, accelerating structural reforms, and ensuring that economic growth translates into real and inclusive progress for all citizens, per the release.
“The findings of the Ipsos survey are a timely validation of Pakistan’s economic direction and a clear signal that the country is on a steady path toward recovery and resilience,” the press release quoted him as saying.
In April, Aurangzeb said Pakistan had reached a crucial juncture in its economic recovery and transformation.
While speaking at a conference, he highlighted key achievements, including a historic reduction in inflation to 0.7pc, the lowest in 60 years; foreign exchange reserves doubled; a 3pc currency appreciation; and a current account surplus exceeding $1bn in March.
Pakistan also witnessed a 44pc increase in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), a 24pc rise in IT exports, and record-high remittances projected at $38bn. Pakistan achieved a fiscal surplus for the first time in 24 years, with the highest primary surplus in two decades.</p><small>2025-06-01 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011707433e63967.png?r=181127' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914759/is-operative-captured-at-pak-afghan-border-in-joint-pak-turkiye-intelligence-operation' target='_blank'><strong>IS operative captured at Pak-Afghan border in joint Pak-Turkiye intelligence operation</strong></a><br><p>An operative of the militant Islamic State group (IS) was captured at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in a joint intelligence operation conducted by Pakistan and Türkiye, the latter’s security sources said on Sunday.
Paki­stan and Turkiye, which share strong bilateral relations, reaffirmed their commitment to enha­ncing defe­nce and security cooperation during Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s recent visit to Istanbul.
Ozgur Altun, also known by the codename “Abu Yasir Al Turki”, was arrested in a precision operation jointly conducted by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)  and Türkiye’s National Intelligence Organisation (MİT).
Following intelligence sharing, the ISI had been briefed on Altun’s presence in Afghanistan and his intent to cross into Pakistan. After his arrest, he was deported to Türkiye for further investigation.
Altun was identified as the highest-ranking Turkish member of IS and played a key role in the group’s media and logistics networks.
Türkiye’s MİT had tracked Altun’s activities and found that he was allegedly coordinating the movement of IS fighters from Europe and Central Asia to the Pakistan-Afghanistan region.
He was also accused of directing plots targeting concert venues and other civilian sites in Türkiye and across Europe.
The development follows a similar arrest made in March when an operative of the IS-Khorasan was detained by Pakistani authorities and brought to the United States, with President Donald Trump hailing Islamabad’s help.
Mohammad Sharifullah, a “top-tier operational commander”, was responsible for killing 13 US service members in 2021 suicide bombing outside Kabul airport during the chaotic US military withdrawal from Afghanistan.
 
 

Though largely crushed by a US-led coalition several years ago, the IS has managed some major attacks while seeking to rebuild.
They include an assault on a Russian concert hall in March 2024, which killed at least 143 people, and in August that year, authorities said a 19-year-old Austrian suspected of masterminding a planned attack on a Taylor Swift concert in Vienna had vowed allegiance to the IS.
It also claimed responsibility for two explosions in the Iranian city of Kerman in January 2024 that killed nearly 100 people, and an assault by suicide attackers on a mosque in Oman in July that year, which left at least six dead.</p><small>2025-06-01 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01131518dd06f1f.png?r=152636' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914735/congress-says-modi-govt-misled-nation-on-aerial-combat-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Congress says Modi govt ‘misled’ nation on aerial combat with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>India’s Congress party President Mallikarjun Kharge has said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government had “misled the nation”, amid a furore about the now-acknowledged aircraft losses to Pakistan during the recent conflict.
The remarks come a day after India’s top general confirmed that his country’s fighter jets were downed by Pakistan but did not specify a number. That admission followed a statement by Subrahmanyam Swamy, a member of Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) but a staunch critic of the Indian premier, that Pakistan had downed five Indian planes.
“The Modi govt has misled the nation. The fog of war is now clearing,” Kharge wrote in a post on X.
 






He said that in the wake of the remarks made by India’s Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan in Singapore during an interview, there were some very important questions which needed to be asked.
“These can only be asked if a Special Session of the Parliament is immediately convened,” he said.
“The Congress party demands a comprehensive review of defence preparedness by an independent expert committee, on the lines of the Kargil review committee,” he added.
Congress leader and Telangana Minister Uttam Reddy separately demanded transparency from the Indian government to reveal the extent of losses, Deccan Herald reported.
“The fact that the fighter aircraft were downed is something that the government needs to stop denying. The CDS himself mentioned that. “Earlier Air Marshal Bharti had mentioned it indirectly in his briefing along with the DGMO,” Reddy, himself a former air force pilot, was quoted as having said.
Indian fighter jets were shot down by the Pakistan Air Force on the night of May 6-7 in response to the Indian Air Force’s late-night missile strikes at six Pakistani sites, including Subhan Mosque in Bahawalpur’s Ahmedpur East, Bilal Mosque in Muzaffarabad, Abbas Mosque in Kotli, Umalkura Mosque in Muridke, the village of Kotki Lohara in Sialkot district, and Shakargarh.
Pakistan took down six Indian jets, including three advanced French Rafale planes. According to a Dawn.com report, the recent clash between India and Pakistan marks a significant development in the regional air power constellation. Three Rafales, one Su-30MKI, one Mirage 2000 and one MiG-29 were downed within a 40-minute span. Not one Pakistani jet crossed the border or engaged in close combat.
After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases on the night of May 9-10, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
The US-brokered ceasefire had brought a halt to a week of record escalation between Pakistan and India as the latter took a series of unprovoked military actions despite Islamabad’s call for a neutral probe into India’s allegations over the Pahalgam attack.
BJP lawmaker criticises Indian Air Force
BJP legislator Ranbir Pathania questioned the role of Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel at the Udhampur base in Indian-occupied Kashmir during Operation Sindoor, allegedly used derogatory words against them, Indian outlet The Telegraph reported.
The BJP defended the legislator, saying his statement has been twisted, while Congress has asked the party to apologise. Pathania also issued a video statement, denying the use of foul language against the force.
In a video uploaded by Congress, Pathania appears to be ridiculing the IAF at Udhampur for its performance during Operation Sindoor. “Everybody knows what happened at the air force station, it was their incompetence; they were sleeping. What is our fault? We have held them in very high esteem,” a man purportedly Pathania can be heard saying.
The BJP leader denied abusing soldiers, saying he is proud of the army and his video had been edited. However, he defended his stand against the IAF’s land acquisition in the area.
The Congress said the statement was shameful and reprehensible, saying it was “an insult to our army and our brave soldiers.”
It added, “The BJP should apologise to the entire country and the army on this matter and should dismiss Ranbir Pathania from his post. If the BJP does not take any action against its MLA, then it will be considered as the thinking and statement of Narendra Modi and the BJP.”
Pathania on Wednesday joined a protest in a village in Udhampur, where he accused the IAF and the local administration of violating the legal rights of landowners by taking over their land without paying any compensation. He said notices had been issued to locals asking them to vacate the land.</p><small>2025-06-01 12:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0116203362367e7.jpg?r=163349' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914752/pakistan-signs-charter-as-global-water-organisation-launches-operations-to-address-challenges' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan signs charter as Global Water Organisation launches operations to address challenges</strong></a><br><p>The Global Water Organisation (GWO) has officially launched its operations from its headquarters in Riyadh, with founding member states, including Pakistan, signing its charter.
The newly established organisation — formed under the leadership of Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman and the patronage of the Saudi environment minister — aims to enhance international collaboration to address the growing pressures on global water systems. Aside from Pakistan, the founding countries of the GWO include Kuwait, Qatar, Spain, Greece, Senegal and Mauritania.
According to a statement from the Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) on Sunday, the launching event “marked a major milestone in fostering international collaboration to address global water challenges.”
Federal Minister for Water Resources, Mian Muhammad Mueen Wattoo, represented Pakistan at the invitation of Saudi Arabia’s Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture, Abdul Rahman Bin Abdul Mohsen Al-Fadley, to share the country’s perspective.
“Pakistan along with other founding members signed the GWO charter, formally committing to the organisation’s shared vision of strengthening international cooperation on water scarcity, sustainable resource management, and climate resilience, particularly in arid and water-stressed regions,” the statement said.
Pakistan also offered to establish a GWO sub-office in Pakistan, the statement added.
In December 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the leadership and initiative of the crown prince to establish the GWO.
“We are proud to join this initiative, as one of its founding members and look forward to providing, all possible support, in achieving its important goals,” he had said while addressing the One Water Summit on the Margins of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Riyadh.
According to the Saudi Press Agency, the founding nations of the GWO concluded their inaugural meeting in Riyadh on May 28 by signing the organisation’s founding charter, “cementing a shared vision for achieving global water resource sustainability and addressing escalating challenges facing this vital sector.”
The charter signatories seek to address growing challenges facing the water sector by promoting social, economic, health, and environmental development to ensure equitable access to water and sanitation for all and achieve sustainable management.
The GWO represents a pivotal step in addressing one of humanity’s most pressing challenges, as water scarcity affects billions worldwide and climate change intensifies pressure on global water resources, it said.
The charter signatories emphasised the importance of achieving the organisation’s objectives, which represent a new milestone for international cooperation in water management. The participants underscored the significance of this groundbreaking initiative in fostering collaborative solutions to water-related challenges.
The founding nations stressed the importance of adopting a unified strategic vision and mission focused on water resource sustainability and promoting global progress toward practical solutions for water-related environmental and climate challenges.
The agreement establishes enhanced cooperation and coordination among member states to protect water resources in terms of both quantity and quality, ensuring continued water supplies for future generations.
The organisation called for strengthening partnerships with non-member countries, United Nations organisations, international financial institutions, and all relevant stakeholders to support the organization’s objectives.
The members emphasised establishing best practices and international standards in water management while enhancing knowledge and methodological exchange between countries. The meeting highlighted the importance of research, encouraging innovation and development in sustainable technologies, and providing joint mechanisms and programmes.</p><small>2025-06-01 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0112344497f0198.jpg?r=142246' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914742/escalation-can-outpace-diplomacy-with-no-crisis-management-in-place-warns-pakistans-top-general' target='_blank'><strong>Escalation can outpace diplomacy with no crisis management in place, warns Pakistan’s top general</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s top military man General Sahir Shamshad Mirza has stressed the need to move towards conflict resolution instead of management, warning that its absence could result in a destructive escalation.
The remarks follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. As New Delhi launched air strikes in early May, killing civilians, Pakistan downed five Indian jets in retaliation. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Gen Mirza, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, made the remarks at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue 2025 organised by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Singapore on Saturday evening.
During a panel discussion, titled “Regional Crisis-Management Mechanisms”, Gen Mirza said: “It has become imperative to move beyond conflict management towards conflict resolution. This will ensure sustainable peace and an assured crisis management.”
He then stressed that an “early resolution of Kashmir [dispute] in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and as per the aspirations of the people is essential” for an enduring peace in South Asia.
The CJCSC cautioned: “Given the Indian policies and polities’ extremist mindset, the absence of a crisis management mechanism may not give enough time to the global powers to intervene and affect cessation of hostilities. They will be probably too late to avoid damage and destruction.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

During his address, Gen Mirza also highlighted the Kashmir dispute and the recent military clash between Pakistan and India.
“When there is no crisis, Kashmir is never discussed, and as we always say that it is the Kashmir dispute resolution in line with the aspirations of the people of Kashmir and in line with the UNSC resolutions that will address many issues.
“The core that resides between Pakistan and India is Kashmir,” the CJCSC pointed out.
He added that unless countries did not “enter conflict resolution” — which he said could initially be through conflict management and then lead to resolution — issues would “always erupt”.
Other speakers on the panel included Canada’s Deputy Minister of National Defence Stefanie Beck and Fiji’s army chief Major Gen Jone Logavatu Kalouniwai. India’s Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan also addressed a separate discussion on defence innovation yesterday.
 
 

In an apparent reference to the Kashmir dispute, the CJCSC also noted: “Crisis prevention is better than crisis fighting. Suppressed disputes, whether territorial or ideological, cannot be indefinitely managed.”
Gen Mirza said the recent Pak-India escalation had underscored “how regional crisis management frameworks remain hostage to countries’ belligerence”, noting that the only line of contact between the two countries was the director general military operations (DGMO) hotline.
The top general further said that following the military conflict, the “threshold of an escalatory war has come dangerously low, implying greater risk on both sides, not just in the disputed territory but all of India and all of Pakistan”.
“Emboldening of India as a net security provider by the West and its ambition to become a regional hegemon is disincentivising it to engage in conflict management options,” CJCSC Mirza asserted.
He went on to state that Pakistan desired a “peaceful coexistence with India based on mutual respect, sovereign equality and most importantly, dignity and honour”.
“We seek a principal order, an order anchored in sovereign equality and restraint. In this, crisis management is not merely a set of tools but a strategic ethic,” he added.
The CJCSC stressed the need for Asia-Pacific and South Asia regions to re-energise and strengthen existing bilateral, regional and multilateral frameworks instead of chalking out new mechanisms. “States need to communicate more and more often and more effectively.”
‘Conventional warfare threshold now dangerously lower’
During the IISS session, Gen Mirza also asserted that following the Pakistan-India military clash, the threshold of strategic stability had been lowered to “dangerous levels”.
He stated, “The threshold of what we say conventional warfare has significantly degraded.”
Gen Mirza pointed out that the 1965 and 1971 wars with India were “always confined to the disputed territory”. “[However,] this time, it has transcended that and come to the international border.”
The CJCSC highlighted: “Instead of targeting the borders first, which used to be the conventional domain or erstwhile domain, the cities have been targeted and the borders have relatively remained, if not silent, comfortable.”
 
 

He noted that strategic stability hinged on conflict resolution, adding: “The lowering of this threshold to the dangerous levels, if next time such a conflict occurs and the cities are targeted first, […] there could be a chance — I’m not trying to create an alarm but I’m speaking based on logic — there could be a possibility that before the international community intervenes because of the restricted or constricted times window, the damage and destruction may have already taken place.”
On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi had launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in at least 40 civilians losing their lives with 121 others injured.
The military has confirmed that 13 security personnel, including members of the Pakistan Army and the Pakistan Air Force, were martyred while over 75 were injured during the confrontation with India.
Gen Mirza noted that by those attacks, India had “crossed the threshold of disputed territory into the international border”.
He recalled that India’s strikes on Pakistan “disturbed the deterrence stability”, which had to be restored while remaining within the conventional domain. However, he added, strategic stability was still disturbed.
Highlighting the absence of a crisis management mechanism, “jingoistic” role of Indian media and its leadership’s mindset, he said, “Had there been no third party mediation, it would have gone to the next levels.”
The top general mentioned the United States, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the “interlocutors”.
 


‘Asia-Pacific direly needs organic security architecture’
Speaking on crisis management in Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza termed it the “geopolitical cockpit of the 21st century”. “Its trajectories will shape the security architecture not only for this region but for the world.”
Offering eight observations, he stated that the crisis management debate in the Asia-Pacific must also focus on South Asia, adding that structures holding the modern state system were losing vitality.
He also called for institutionalised protocols, inclusion of key stakeholders and peaceful dispute resolution; highlighted the importance of communication; and stressed that emerging technologies compress the decision space.
“Misconception, narrative warfare and information distortion are the oxygen for escalation. We must disarm not only militarily but rhetorically,” Gen Mirza observed. “Power and interests, not morality or principles, now reign supreme.”
On the challenges faced by the Asia-Pacific, CJCSC Mirza made four observations, one being: “Asia-Pacific today appears to be descending into an extended era of great power contestation and strategic uncertainties.”
 
 

He further pointed out that the Asia-Pacific direly needed an “institutional security architecture organic to the region itself”, which was missing as it had “largely been guided by extra-regional powers”.
On South Asia, the CJCSC remarked: “A looming threat of a global scale resides.
“South Asian strategic outlook is shaped by competing interests of the global power play, complicated Iran-West relations, perpetual instability in Afghanistan, India-Pakistan-China equation and the unresolved Kashmir dispute that remains at the core of India-Pakistan dyad, leading to regional instability in the geostrategic realm.”</p><small>2025-06-01 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01114637098f9df.jpg?r=114733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914721/bangladesh-top-court-restores-jamaat-i-islami' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh top court restores Jamaat-i-Islami</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh on Sunday restored the registration of the Jamaat-i-Islami party, allowing it to take part in elections, more than a decade after it was removed under the now-overthrown government.
The country’s supreme court overturned a cancellation of Jamaat-i-Islami’s registration, allowing it to be formally listed as a political party with the election commission.
“The election commission is directed to deal with the registration of that party in accordance with law,” commission lawyer Towhidul Islam told AFP.
Jamaat-i-Islami party lawyer, Shishir Monir, said the supreme court’s decision would allow a “democratic, inclusive and multi-party system” in the Muslim-majority country of 170 million people.
“We hope that Bangladeshis, regardless of their ethnicity or religious identity, will vote for Jamaat, and that the parliament will be vibrant with constructive debates,” Monir told journalists.
After Sheikh Hasina was ousted as prime minister in August, the party appealed for a review of the 2013 high court order banning it.
Sunday’s decision comes after Bangladesh’s top court on May 27 overturned a conviction against a key leader of Jamaat-i-Islami, A.T.M. Azharul Islam.
He had been sentenced to death in 2014 for rape, murder and genocide during Bangladesh’s 1971 war with Pakistan.
Jamaat-i-Islami supported Islamabad during the war, a role that still sparks anger among many Bangladeshis today.
They were rivals of Hasina’s father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman of the Awami League, who would become Bangladesh’s founding figure.
Hasina banned Jamaat-i-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders.
In May, Bangladesh’s interim government banned the Awami League, pending the outcome of a trial over its crackdown on mass protests that prompted her ouster last year.
Bangladesh to open trial of fugitive ex-PM
Meanwhile, Bangladesh will open Hasina’s trial on Sunday on charges of crimes against humanity related to the killings of protesters by police, prosecutors said.
ICT chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said on May 12 that Hasina faces at least five charges, including “abetment, incitement, complicity, facilitation, conspiracy and failure to prevent mass murder during the July uprising”.
“The prosecution team … is set to submit charges against former prime minister Sheikh Hasina,” said Gazi MH Tamim, one of the prosecutors.
The hearing is expected to be broadcast live on state-owned Bangladesh Television.</p><small>2025-06-01 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/011515539f45911.jpg?r=152335' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914751/indias-monsoon-rains-kill-at-least-30-in-northeast-parts-of-country' target='_blank'><strong>India’s monsoon rains kill at least 30 in northeast parts of country</strong></a><br><p>Flash floods and landslides after torrential monsoon rain over the last two days killed at least 30 people in India’s northeast, officials said on Sunday.
State disaster management officials said eight people died in Assam, and nine in Arunachal Pradesh, many of them in landslides as earth loosened by the water slumped into the valley below.
Another five people died in a landslide in the neighbouring state of Mizoram, state authorities said.
The officials said that six people lost their lives in Meghalaya, while at least two others were killed in the states of Nagaland and Tripura.
A red alert warning was issued for several districts in the region after the non-stop downpour over the last three days.
Rivers swollen by the lashing rain — including the mighty Brahmaputra, which rises in the Himalayas and flows through India’s northeast towards its delta in Bangladesh — broke their banks across the region.
The Indian army said that it had saved hundreds “in a massive rescue operation” across Manipur state.
“People have been shifted to safer places,” the army said on Saturday. “Food, water and essential medicines were provided.”
Conrad K Sangma, the chief minister of Meghalaya state, has ordered officials to remain on high alert “especially in landslide-prone and low-lying areas”, according to a statement.
Scores of people die each year during the rainy season due to flash floods and landslides across India.
India’s annual monsoon season from June to September offers respite from the intense summer heat and is crucial for replenishing water supplies, but also brings widespread death and destruction.
South Asia is getting hotter and in recent years has seen shifting weather patterns, but scientists are unclear on how exactly a warming planet is affecting monsoons.
Last month, India’s financial capital Mumbai was swamped by monsoon rain that began two weeks earlier than usual, the earliest for nearly a quarter of a century, according to weather forecasters.</p><small>2025-06-01 10:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607204-pakistan-afghanistan-to-finalise-uap-railway-project-framework-agreement' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan to finalise UAP railway project framework agreement</strong></a><br><p>

As per the French interior ministry, a woman riding a scooter died after she was hit by a car in the southwest of Paris, while a 17-year-old in the southwestern town of Dax was stabbed to death during the celebrations. In total, 559 people were arrested, including 491 in Paris.
The majority of fans celebrated peacefully, but Paris police said scuffles broke out near the city’s Champs-Élysées avenue and PSG’s Parc des Princes stadium, where 48,000 had watched the 5-0 win against Inter Milan in Munich on big screens.
Most of the people detained were suspected of possessing fireworks and causing disorder, Paris police said.
AFP journalists saw police use a water cannon to stop a crowd reaching the Arc de Triomphe.
“Troublemakers on the Champs-Élysées were looking to create incidents and repeatedly came into contact with police by throwing large fireworks and other objects,” police said in a statement.
In a video posted by a user on X, police can be seen dispersing the fans.
 






Videos circulating on social media, posted by a French press agency CLPRESS, show burning vehicles as the celebrations turned into riots.
 






 






Outside Paris, police said a car careered into fans celebrating PSG’s win in Grenoble in southeastern France, leaving four people injured, two of them seriously.
All of those hurt were from the same family, police said.
The driver handed himself in to the police and was placed under arrest.
A source close to the investigation said it was believed the driver had not acted intentionally.
In Paris, most fans showed their joy by singing and dancing in the streets, with cars sounding their horns, after their team won the biggest prize in European club football for the first time in their history.
 






One 20-year-old PSG supporter, Clement, said: “It’s so good and so deserved! We have a song that talks about our struggles and it hasn’t always been easy.
“But we got our faith back this year with a team without stars. They’re 11 guys who play for each other.”
French President Emmanuel Macron’s office said he would host the victorious players on Sunday to congratulate them.
In a separate message on X, Macron hailed a “day of glory for PSG”.
“Bravo, we are all proud,” he wrote. “Paris is the capital of Europe tonight.”
Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo hailed it as a “historic” win.
The PSG team will hold a victory parade on the Champs-Élysées today, when tens of thousands of supporters are expected to gather to get a glimpse of their returning heroes.

PSG’s young team achieved what the likes of Lionel Messi, Neymar and Kylian Mbappe could not do in their colours as they became only the second French side to win the trophy after Olympique de Marseille in 1993.
“Making history was a goal from the start of last season,” the club’s manager, Luis Enrique, said.
“I really felt a connection with the players and the fans, a very strong connection that we saw throughout the season. We were able to handle the tension and excitement in the best possible way.”
Luis Enrique, visibly emotional after the final whistle and wearing a T-shirt with a tribute to his daughter Xana who died in 2019, has turned PSG from a side of superstars into a group of humble players finally playing as a team.</p><small>2025-06-01 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/01144724b4cf08e.jpg?r=144946' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914747/arshad-nadeem-thanks-nation-for-javelin-victory-ahead-of-arrival-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Arshad Nadeem thanks nation for javelin victory ahead of arrival in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>Less than 24 hours after striking gold in the javelin final at the Asian Athletics Championship, javelin phenom Arshad Nadeem on Sunday thanked the nation for its support and prayers, dedicating the win to Pakistan.
Yesterday, Arshad returned to international competition and won a gold medal with a throw of 86.40 metres in the men’s javelin final in Gumi, South Korea. India’s Sachin Yadav took silver with an 85.16m and Japan’s Yuta Sakiyama took home bronze with an 83.75m throw. Both athletes threw a personal best.
In a post on Instagram today, Nadeem said: “It is because of all your prayers that Allah made me successful in the finals, and gave respect to Pakistan, when I won gold at the Asian Athletics Championship.

“This is a result of your prayers, and the hard work of me and my coach, Salman Iqbal Butt,” he said in a short video message as he adorned a green and white Pakistan jersey.
He noted that he would be arriving at Lahore International Airport at 10:20pm tonight.
“It gives me great happiness that this was my first competition since the Paris Olympics, and Allah delivered victory to Pakistan,” the 28-year-old said.
Nadeem, who holds the Olympic record after throwing a monstrous 92.97m at Paris 2024, narrowly missed breaking the championship record of 86.72m.
The triumph also marks the first time Pakistan has won gold at the Asian Athletics Championship in 50 years.
Nadeem will soon be going to England to prepare for September’s World Athletics Championships, the only major tournament where he has yet to win gold.</p><small>2025-06-01 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/010832539509139.png?r=083308' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914634/indias-top-general-admits-losses-in-conflict-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>India’s top general admits losses in conflict with Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>• Chauhan curious why their jets were downed
• Claims conflict never came close to a nuclear war
• Says ‘channels of communication’ with Islamabad were open
• BJP leader says PAF shot down five Indian aircraft
NEW DELHI: A day after a BJP politician and staunch critic of Prime Minister Nare­ndra Modi, Subrahmanyam Swamy, claimed Pakistan had downed five Indian planes in the recent military escalation, India’s top military general admitted losses.
In an interview with Bloomberg on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue on Saturday, Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan admitted losses but dismissed Pakistan’s claims that it shot down six Indian jets, including four Rafales, as “absolutely incorrect”.
 






“What is important is that, not the jet being down, but why they were being down… Why they were down, what mistakes were made — that are important. Numbers are not important,” he said.
In a separate interview to Reuters, Gen Chauhan said the losses India suffered were in the initial stages, on May 7, when it launched Operation Sindoor.
“What I can say is that on May 7, in the initial stages, there were losses… What was important is why these losses occur and what we will do after that,” he said.
 
 

However, the chief of defence staff said the armed forces were quick to analyse the “tactical mistakes”, remedy them, and again target Pakistan on May 8 and May 10.
“The good part is that we are able to understand the tactical mistake which we made, remedy it, rectify it, and then implement it again after two days and flew all our jets again, targeting at long range,” India Today quoted Gen Chauhan as saying.
It may be recalled that Pakistan military says India did not fly its fighter jets again in the conflict after suffering losses on May 7.
Earlier on Friday, former law minister Swamy became the most candid Indian to admit that Pakistan Air Force had shot down five Indian planes, including French-made Rafales. Speaking in an online interview, Dr Swamy blamed the French planes as being responsible for the losses, implying that the deal the prime minister had made for them was to blame. The interview came as Mr Modi went about holding mammoth meetings in Gujarat and other states claiming victory and threatening more dire conflict with Pakistan.
Gen Chauhan’s remarks were the most direct by the army so far on losses suffered during the hostilities, which came as India attacked nine alleged terror camps deep inside Pakistan. It was in response to the horrific Pahalgam attack, which left at least 25 tourists dead.
As Pakistan retaliated by launching a wave of drone attacks targeting Indian military facilities and border towns, the armed forces struck 11 vital airbases with long-range BrahMos missiles, India Today reported.
Previously, the armed for­ces had deflected questions abo­ut Indian jets being shot down by Pakistan. Addressing a press conference, Air Mar­shal A.K. Bharti, Director Gen­e­ral of Air Operations, said “losses are a part of any combat scenario”. However, he said all Indian pilots “were back”.
“We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is, have we achieved our objective? Answer is a thumping yes. At this time, I would not like to comment on that (loss of jets) as we are still in combat and give advantage to adversary. All our pilots are back home,” he claimed.
The chief of defence staff also claimed that the conflict never came close to a nuclear war, while underscoring that “channels of communication” with Pakistan were always open to control the situation.
This flies in the face of US President Donald Trump’s repeated assertion that he avoided a potential nuclear disaster by mediating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, the news report said.
“I personally feel that there is a lot of space between conduct of conventional operations and the nuclear threshold,” Gen Chauhan told Bloomberg.
During the hostilities, Indian missiles and jets were able to bypass Chinese-supplied air defence systems to target Pakistani military sites, the report said.

Rescue 1122 spokesperson Jawad Afridi said the blast took place at a tube well near a house in Akhorwal village. Two people died on the spot in the explosion.
Rescue medical and disaster teams reached the scene after receiving information about the incident. The house was completely destroyed in the explosion, the rescue official said.
In another incident, an under-construction building was heavily damaged when an improvised explosive device (IED), reportedly planted by unidentified terrorists, exploded in Bannu district.
Muhammad Usama, spokesperson for Rescue 1122, Bannu told Dawn.com that the explosion occurred around at 1am today when unidentified attackers reportedly detonated an IED that severely damaged the building.
He said the targeted structure, located in the Kaki tehsil of Bannu district, belonged to the Rescue 1122 emergency services. However, no casualties were reported.
Khanzala Quraishi, spokesperson for the Bannu region police, confirmed the incident and said that a police team responded promptly and launched an investigation.
He said the perpetrators fled the scene after detonating the explosion. However, he said a search operation is underway to apprehend the culprits.
This marks the second blast on a Rescue 1122 building in recent times.

A police constable, Maqbool Sheikh, died and his colleagues, Iqbal Baloch and Safeer Ahmed Kehar, suffered gunshot wounds in the attack that took place within the jurisdiction of Tando Masti police station in Khairpur district.
Police officials said the judge, Samkan Ahmed Mughal, and his security squad came under fire from the armed dacoits but the judge remained unharmed in the attack. The judge was on his way to Larkana last night after attending an event at the Sindh High Court’s Sukkur bench, they said.
They said that the armed highwaymen were standing by the road within the limits of Tando Masti police station when they signaled the judge’s convoy to stop.
In reply to media persons’ questions if it was a targeted attack on the judge and linked to some cases he was hearing or if it was only an act of highway robbery, the officials said they had just started investigation into the incident and it was premature to say whether it was pre-planned attack or merely a random act of highway robbery.
They said that police teams had cordoned off all routes leading into riverine area from where the criminals came out to commit the crime on the highway.
Martyred cop’s funeral held in Larkana
The funeral for the martyr Maqbool Ahmed Sheikh was held with full police honours at the Police Headquarters in Larkana, according to a press release issued by Sukkur DIG’s office.
It said the martyr had sacrificed his life fighting valiantly against dacoits. The funeral prayer was attended by the martyr’s family and a large number of police officers, Rangers personnel, the judge, DIGs of Sukkur and Larkana, commissioner and deputy commissioner of Larkana, SSPs and officials of other law enforcement agencies, leaders of various schools of thought, civil society members and general public.
It said that the Sukkur DIG and other officers laid wreaths on the martyr’s coffin.
The DIG said in his message that no stone would be left unturned in the treatment of the injured police officials. All officers and personnel of Sindh Police stood like a solid wall for the restoration of law and order, he said.
“We are proud of our martyrs, our spirits are high, and we will not shy away from any sacrifice for the establishment of peace. Insha Allah, the gang of dacoits who martyred our official will be found and eliminated soon,” he said.
People react angrily to attack
People of Khairpur district complained to journalists that the district had been left at the mercy of dacoits and outlaws who came out of the riverine areas and committed crimes at their whim and disappeared with utmost ease while police acted as silent spectators.
They said that due to constant political interference in the district police, no honest SSP was allowed to work and restore peace in the area.
They recalled that former SSP, Dr Samiullah Soomro, had cracked down on dacoits and criminals and forced them to flee the district, but he was soon transferred as he was deemed disobedient by some political figures.
As a result, Khairpur district had once again fallen into the hands of criminals, they lamented and demanded that SSP Dr Samiullah or an honest officer like him be posted in the crime-infested district to restore peace on the roads.

The New York Times reported on Friday that the billionaire adviser to United States President Donald Trump used so much ketamine, a powerful anaesthetic, that he developed bladder problems.
The newspaper said the world’s richest person also took ecstasy and mushrooms and travelled with a pill box last year, adding that it was not known whether Musk also took drugs while heading the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) after Trump took power in January.
In a post on Saturday on X, Musk said: “To be clear, I am NOT taking drugs! The New York Times was lying their ass off.”
He added: “I tried ‘prescription’ ketamine a few years ago and said so on X, so this not even news. It helps for getting out of dark mental holes, but haven’t taken it since then.”
 






Musk first dodged a question about his drug use at a bizarre farewell appearance on Friday with Trump in the Oval Office in which the Tesla and SpaceX boss sported a noticeable black eye as he formally ended his role as Trump’s main cost-cutter at DOGE, which fired tens of thousands of civil servants.

News of the injury drew substantial attention as it came right after the Times report on his alleged drug use.
The daily recalled erratic behaviour such as Musk giving an enthusiastic Nazi-style salute in January of this year at a rally celebrating Trump’s inauguration.
Musk said he got the injury while horsing around with his young son, named X, when he told the child to hit him in the face.

“And he did. Turns out even a five-year-old punching you in the face actually is…” he added, before tailing off.
Later on Friday, when a reporter asked Trump if he was aware of Musk’s “regular drug use”, Trump responded: “I wasn’t.”
“I think Elon is a fantastic guy,” he added.
Musk has previously admitted to taking ketamine, saying he was prescribed it to treat a “negative frame of mind” and suggesting his use of drugs benefited his work.</p><small>2025-06-01 06:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607168-pakistan-sounds-alarm-over-rising-asia-pacific-conflict-risks-amid-india-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan sounds alarm over rising Asia-Pacific conflict risks amid India tensions</strong></a><br><p>

The decision was taken at the third meeting of the Counter-Terr­orism Committee and Har­den the State Commi­ttee held here under the chairmanship of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday.
The government had already announced it would deport thousands of Afghan refugees awaiting resettlement in the West if the prospective host countries didn’t relocate them by April 30. Tens of thousands of Afghans came to Pakistan fearing retribution after the Taliban returned to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, following the withdrawal of US-led forces.
 
 

An official told Dawn that so far 1.023 million Afghans had been repatriated. He said 135,865 had been repatriated in April and another 65,057 in May. On May 30 alone, 1,483 individuals had been repatriated.

Naqvi asks all institutions to coordinate for implementation of one-document regime

Speaking on the occasion, the interior minister said the federal and provincial agencies must coordinate their efforts to eli­m­inate the illegal spectrum undermining nat­io­nal security, emph­asising that all institutions must work together to fully implement the “one-document regime”.
He said that Nadra would provide live data verification facilities at exit points.
Referring to the beggar mafia, Mr Naqvi said they must be dealt with strictly as they were tarnishing the country’s image. He highlighted the need to declare begging a non-bailable offence.
As a nationwide crackdown on power theft continues, the meeting was informed by a representative of the power division that Rs142 billion was recovered with the cooperation of the interior ministry and provincial governments. The minister said every possible support was being provided to the Ministry of Energy and provincial governments to prevent electricity theft.
The meeting also reviewed progress on anti-encroachment operations.
Regarding maintenance of law and order, the meeting was briefed that more than 250 intelligence-based operations were being conducted on a daily basis.
It also reviewed progress on the establishment of the Pakistan Port Authority, ‘Gwadar Safe City Project’, besides the construction of a protection wall was also discussed.
Digital transformation

Academic activities at government schools across Gilgit-Baltistan have been suspended since last week, as thousands of teachers announced that they would call off their protest only when their single-point demand was fulfilled.
For the past five days, teachers have organised demonstrations and rallies outside the education department offices in Hunza, Nagar, Astore, Skardu, Diamer, Ghanche, Shigar, Kharmang and Ghizer. On Friday, the protesting teachers from these districts marched towards Gilgit and joined the protest sit-in outside the Gilgit-Baltistan Directorate of Education in Gilgit, the regional headquarters, where the minister’s office is situated.
Despite harsh weather conditions on Saturday, a number of male and female government teachers continued their protest sit-in outside the GB Directorate of Education on the call of the Teachers’ Coordination Committee.

Verification of teachers’ academic, professional credentials ordered

The organisers said government teachers had been demanding promotions for many years. Teachers with a Bachelor of Education should be promoted to Grade 16, while those with a Certificate in Teaching should be promoted to Grade 14, they explained, but nearly 7,000 teachers despite the required qualification were ignored when the education department promoted only 300 in a “discriminatory” way.
 
 

According to them, the GB Supreme Appellate Court had directed the government to grant teachers their legitimate pay scales. Also, the chief court ordered the implementation of the appellate court’s order for qualified teachers to be given their due service scales. However, the protesters said, the GB government was reluctant to implement the court order, depriving teachers of their rights.
They said many teachers despite having qualifications for promotion had been serving in same grades for more than a decade. They demanded that all CT and BEd qualified teachers be promoted to their relevant grades immediately. They said that teacher representatives had held meetings with government officials and education department heads, but the issue was ignored.
GB officials said the education department had moved an appeal before the GB Supreme Appellate Court against the decision related to teachers’ promotion. After a court ruling on the appeal, the GB government would decide the matter accordingly.
Verification of credentials
At the same time, the GB government started a large-scale verification of academic and professional credentials of teaching staff working under the school education department.
According to an official notification issued by the school education department issued on May 30, the department has directed the director general of education to carry out “a comprehensive verification exercise of all teachers working under the school education department, across all districts of Gilgit-Baltistan”.
However, the protesting teachers termed it another ploy to delay the due promotions and announced that their protest would continue till the implementation of court order.

• Additional DC laid to rest in Kachhi
QUETTA: A Levies official was martyred in a shooting in Dera Bugti and a Levies police station was set on fire in Mastung district, while a roadside blast on the outskirts of Quetta left two siblings dead and nine others wounded on Saturday, officials said.
The gun and bomb attacks were carried out on the day when the additional deputy commissioner of Surab district, who had embraced martyrdom in an attack on Friday, was laid to rest with full state honour in Kachhi district.
According to Levies sources, the official, identified as Rehan, was on his way home when some armed men opened fire on him in the Sui Tehsil Bazaar area of Dera Bugti.
The body was shifted to a nearby hospital for medico-legal formalities before being handed over to the family.
A search operation was launc­hed to track down the assailants.
No one claimed responsibility for the shooting. The motive for the shooting remains unclear. Levies authorities later registered a case.
In the late evening, armed militants attacked a Levies police station in Wali Khan area of Mastung. “Armed militants set fire to the building of Levies thana. The building was badly damaged and record burnt,” a senior official said.
No casualty was reported in the attack.
The official said the armed men also attempted to surround the area but failed when security forces reached there and launched an operation forcing the militants to flee.
Earlier, on the outskirts of Quetta, a roadside bomb blast claimed the lives of two brothers and left nine others wounded, officials said.
They said an improvised explosive device (IED) planted at the roadside in the Nawan Killi area was detonated when a car was passing through the area. The blast left two sons of a tribal elder, Sardar Abdullah Kakar, dead.
Soon after the explosion, heavy contingent of police and Frontier Corps rushed to the site and shifted the bodies and injured to Civil Hospital Quetta.
“We have received two bodies and nine injured, who were hit by splinters after the IED blast,” Dr Wasim Baig, the spokesman for the Civil Hospital told Dawn.
He said that the deceased were identified as Abdul Salam and his brother, Abdul Nafay.
While three of the nine injured remained unidentified till the filing of this report, the six others were identified as Janan, Saifur Rehman, Samiullah, Zabihullah, Muhammad Asif, Naseebullah and Jameel Ahmed.
The bodies were handed over to the families after necessary legal procedures, authorities confirmed to Dawn.  Police termed the blast a targeted killing.
No  group claimed responsibility for the attack  with security agencies continuiing their investigations.
Funeral
Meanwhile, the additional deputy commissioner, Hidayatullah Buledi, who was martyred in an attack at his residence, was laid to rest in his native town of Bhag in the Kachhi district on Saturday.
His body was flown to the area by a helicopter.
People from all walks of life gathered to pay their final respects.
The funeral was attended by Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Zahid Saleem, Naseerabad Commissioner Moeenur Rehman Khan, Kalat Commissioner Shahzeb Kakar, Kachhi Deputy Commissioner Jehanzeb Baloch, Surab Deputy Commissioner Habib Nasir, senior officers of the divisional and district administration, Frontier Corps officials, tribal elders, political figures and locals.
After the funeral, a smartly turned-out contingent of Levies and police presented a salute to the fallen officer. His coffin, draped in the national flag, was laid to rest with full state honour.
Former chief minister of Balochistan Nawab Sanaullah Zehri while condemning the attack said, “Those who storm homes in the presence of women and children and commit such brutal acts have no right to call themselves Baloch.”
He described the assassination as a cowardly and shameful act, stating that action against culprits was inevitable.
A day ago, a large group of militants cordoned off police and Levies stations in Surab and set fire  to multiple government offices and looted a local bank.
The militants also tried to storm the deputy commissioner’s office but were repulsed by secuirty forces.
The banned Balochistan Liberation Army claimed responsibility for the attack.

The first edition of Breathe Pakistan sparked national dialogue and global collaboration around vital climate challenges — from climate justice and finance to renewable energy transitions, disaster risk reduction, and inclusive public-private partnerships.
It emphasised the crucial roles of accountability, media engagement, and the empowerment of women and smallholder farmers in building climate resilience, according to a press release.
 
 

Pakistan remains increasingly vulnerable to the devastating effects of climate change, facing record-breaking heatwaves, destructive hail and windstorms, water scarcity, and extreme weather events that threaten lives, infrastructure, and livelihoods.
As climate challenges intensify, DawnMedia continues to bring this critical issue to the forefront through the following ways.
Raising awareness: Increasing awareness around critical issues such as water scarcity, air pollution, and deforestation to mobilise public action to combat climate change.
Impactful journalism: Leveraging multimedia platforms through in-depth articles, documentaries, podcasts, and TV/radio explainers to keep climate discourse at the forefront.
Engaging children: Involving children in the climate conversation through interactive activities and storytelling on tree plantation, recycling, and water conservation to cultivate lifelong environmental stewardship.
Strategic collaborations: Building and strengthening partnerships with the public and private sectors, as well as government institutions, to sustain momentum and drive meaningful change for a sustainable Pakistan.
“The fight against climate change must continue,” says a DawnMedia spokesperson. “Through awareness, education, and collaboration, we can forge a sustainable future.”
The Breathe Pakistan 2026 conference will further amplify these efforts, convening global and local leaders to accelerate actionable solutions.
