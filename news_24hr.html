Relations between Pakistan and India have plummeted to their lowest level in years following the April 22 attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 men, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks on civilians in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
 




Says India has not provided evidence for “baseless allegations” against Pakistan
Says India has been found operating a terror network inside Pakistan targeting not only military but also innocent civilians
Says forensic analysis of retrieved materials shows “irrefutable evidence” of Indian terrorism


Following the incident, New Delhi, without providing any evidence, implied Pakistan backed the attackers — an allegation that Islamabad has strongly denied. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
Lt Gen Chaudhry said that seven days had passed since the Pahalgam incident but, so far, India had not provided a “shred of evidence” for its “baseless allegations” against Pakistan.
“We will present to you how India has been found to operate a terror network inside Pakistan in which explosives, IEDs (improvised explosive devices) and other materials are being provided to terrorists to target not only military but also innocent civilians,” he said.

The army’s spokesperson said the evidence he was presenting was just “one small part” of India’s “state-sponsored terrorism”.
“Four days ago, on April 25, an Indian-trained and sponsored terrorist, who was a Pakistani citizen, was arrested near the Jhelum bus stand from whom one IED, two mobile phones, and Rs70,000 were recovered,” he said, adding that further investigation yielded an Indian-origin drone from his house along with Rs1 million in cash.
The DG ISPR said that a forensic analysis of the retrieved materials showed “irrefutable” evidence that could be examined by any credible independent agency.
“The handler was a junior commissioned officer (JCO) of the Indian army, Subedar Sukvinder,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said. “The Indian officer had sent an IED and instructed the terrorist to collect it from a point.
“The evidence I’m putting forth before you [shows] how India is carrying out terrorism in Pakistan [through] serving officers and JCOs of the Indian army.”
He said further forensic analysis showed the involvement of four Indian army officials in the situation: Major Sandeep Verma alias Sameer, the main handler and a commanding officer of the Indian army in occupied Kashmir; Subedar Sukvinder alias Sikander; Havildar Amit alias Adil Aman: and another Indian soldier.
He said that Major Sandeep had hired terrorist Abdul Majeed and aired an alleged audio exchange between the two discussing the mode of payment.
“Just see, just hear what is being said by an Indian serving major. He is saying that ‘we conduct terrorism from Balochistan to Lahore’; He is telling the details of entry and how terror financing is carried out,” Chaudhry added.
The DG ISPR said the audio clip was “what you call irrefutable evidence of state-sponsored terrorism” collected from just one terrorist cell that the military was putting forth in today’s press conference.
Chaudhry said the Indian-trained terrorist had carried out four acts of militancy through IED attacks and that the IEDs were transported through drones.
He added that it was not the Indian intelligence agency RAW but the Indian army that was doing such activities of state-sponsored terrorism.
“The terrorist’s fourth attack took place after the Pahalgam incident,” he said, adding that a location near Nadala was shared with Majeed to retrieve the IED on April 22 and carry out the attack the next day at a populated bus stand.“
The DG ISPR said the terrorist was apprehended on April 25.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
This, he said, was manifested two nights back when security forces killed 54 terrorists attempting to infiltrate through the Pakistan-Afghanistan border in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district.
DG ISPR said the total number of terrorists killed was 71 so far after 17 more were taken out later.
Earlier today, the Pakistan Army shot down an Indian quadcopter drone near the Line of Control (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, state media reported. The development came as Indian and Pakistani soldiers reportedly traded fire along the Line of Control for a fifth straight night, after four years of relative calm.
Indian links in Jaffer Express attack
Earlier today, the Pakistan Mission to the United Nations said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffer Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release issued today.
The Jaffar Express train was hijacked on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages.
Security forces launched a two-day operation, concluding on March 12. DG Chaudhry had said that all 33 terrorists were neutralised, but no hostages were harmed in the final rescue phase.</p><small>2025-04-29 15:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29202350a4ffad2.jpg?r=202353' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907375/saudi-authority-dismisses-baseless-claims-that-pakistani-haj-pilgrims-payments-transferred-to-wrong-bank-account-report' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi authority dismisses ‘baseless’ claims that Pakistani Haj pilgrims’ payments transferred to wrong bank account: report</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Haj and Umrah has refuted claims that funds from thousands of Pakistani Haj pilgrims were mistakenly sent to the wrong bank account, emphasising that the Kingdom’s digital Haj platform maintains the “utmost levels of transparency,” Arab News Pakistan reported on Tuesday.
The clarification followed reports from [multiple] Pakistani media outlets last week, which claimed that over 67,000 Pakistani pilgrims might experience delays in their Haj travel due to millions of Saudi Riyals intended for their expenses being erroneously transferred to an incorrect bank account.
“Recent claims in some Pakistani media outlets about ‘Haj funds being sent to the wrong Saudi account’ are baseless and stem from a misunderstanding of the Haj account management system and the ministry’s official electronic Haj platform, which ensures the highest standards of transparency and accuracy,” Arab News Pakistan quoted an official of the Saudi Ministry of Haj and Umrah as saying.
According to the report, the official said that while Pakistan’s religious affairs ministry had finalised all contracts for its pilgrims without significant issues, several Pakistani private firms missed the deadline to secure their pilgrims’ contracts.
He told the outlet that this recurring issue from previous years has led to incomplete entry processes, preventing these pilgrims from participating in Haj in the Kingdom.
Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reprimanded officials from the religious affairs ministry for their alleged negligence that jeopardised the departure of 67,000 potential Pakistani pilgrims this year, assuring that he would take up the matter with the Saudi government to resolve the issue.
Local media had reported that private Haj operators failed to meet the Kingdom’s requirements, depriving the 67,000 intending pilgrims of performing Haj this year.
However, private Haj operators blamed the Saudi government for the delay, claiming they had sent the payments before the deadline, but the Saudi software system crashed.
The final date for issuing visas was April 18, as per the Saudi deadline, leaving the fate of the 67,000 pilgrims uncertain.
Meanwhile, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported that Pakistan’s Haj 2025 operations officially began on Tuesday morning, with the departure of the first Haj flight from Islamabad to Madinah.
“The inaugural flight, PK-713, took off at 5:21 AM, carrying 427 pilgrims who will perform the sacred journey in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” the report said.
In 2025, Pakistan’s Haj quota was set at 179,210, with half of the quota meant to be managed by private Haj operators. However, only 23,000 people were able to go under private operators.
Haj, one of the fundamental pillars of Islam, is performed each year by millions of Muslims worldwide. Pakistan receives one of the highest Haj quotas from Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-04-29 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2918030840d2df2.jpg?r=185433' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907369/pakistan-set-to-become-the-next-major-tech-destination-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan set to become the next major tech destination: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to becoming the next major tech destination in light of $700 million pledged in foreign investment in the IT sector at the Digital Foreign Direct Investment (DFDI) conference in Islamabad.
Delegates from around 45 countries arrived in Islamabad to participate in the DFDI conference,  the first-ever DFDI conference held in Pakistan.
Over 75 foreign investors and CEOs of more than 50 global companies attended the event. The digital sector has long been recognised as a key segment for foreign direct investment (FDI), yet Pakistan has struggled to attract substantial digital FDI.
Addressing the DFDI conference today, PM Shehbaz hailed investment in the IT sector, saying: “Pakistan is not waiting for the future but shaping it.”
He called on international stakeholders to continue supporting Pakistan as it was ready to lead the global digital economy.
The premier highlighted the government’s initiatives in the IT sector including the launch of federal and provincial IT parks, incubation centres, and a large-scale research and development (R&D) ecosystem.
 
 

He noted that Pakistan’s youth, aged between 15-30, constitute 60 per cent of the population, and announced that Huawei will train 200,000 boys and girls through a joint skill development programme in collaboration with the government.
“[The youth] are the architects of our digital future”, he said.
PM Shehbaz said that in March Pakistan received a record-breaking $4.1 billion in foreign remittances, signalling growing trust in the country’s digital potential.
“We’re not just building a digital economy — we’re creating a digital Pakistan. From transforming agriculture through AI to expanding exports with smart technology, this is the moment for global investors to join us,” the premier said.
He invited the world to invest, guide and grow with Pakistan.
“Together, we will make Pakistan a leading light in the digital era.”
Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja also spoke at the conference, highlighting Pakistan’s exponential growth in IT export.
“Pakistan’s youth — over 100 million strong — is our greatest digital asset. Under the prime minister’s direct supervision, we have trained over 300,000 young professionals in IT skills this year alone.”
She also spoke about Pakistan’s evolving regulatory landscape and called for the development of robust digital infrastructure.
CEO of Pakistan Software Export Board Abu Bakar announced that IT exports were set to exceed $4b this year, calling it a testament to public-private collaboration and national talent.
Secretary-General of the Digital Cooperation Organisation Deemah AlYahya, praised Pakistan’s ambition and innovation.
“This is a historic moment where ambition, innovation, and opportunity converge. Digital transformation is now a revolution, not a trend and with 142 million broadband subscribers, 65pc smartphone penetration, and IT exports poised to exceed $4b, the country is primed for digital acceleration.”</p><small>2025-04-29 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29181108edd9e8b.png?r=193221' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907370/security-forces-kill-3-terrorists-in-turbat-operation-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces kill 3 terrorists in Turbat operation: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Three terrorists were killed after security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the general area of Turbat town in Balochistan’s Kech district, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Tuesday.
According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the forces conducted an IBO,  effectively engaging with the terrorists’ location.
The statement said that “after an intense exchange of fire, three terrorists were successfully neutralised”.
It said that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists who were involved in multiple activities against the law enforcement agencies and the innocent civilians in the area.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to neutralise any other terrorists present in the area,” ISPR said, adding that the forces remain determined “to thwart attempts at sabotaging peace, stability and progress of Balochistan”.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Militant violence and security operations intensified in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-04-29 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29173812adbb6cb.jpg?r=173820' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907364/7-bullet-ridden-bodies-recovered-from-balochistans-ziarat-says-official' target='_blank'><strong>7 bullet-ridden bodies recovered from Balochistan’s Ziarat, says official</strong></a><br><p>Seven bullets-ridden bodies were found on Tuesday in Balochistan’s Ziarat district, officials said.
Ziarat Deputy Commissioner Ziarat Zakiullah told Dawn.com, “On Tuesday morning, the district administration received information about seven bodies being dumped at Gonja Tangi, ​​Ziarat, after which the assistant commissioner was sent to the scene along with ambulances.”
However, at Chautir, near the site of the incident, residents had blocked the highway in protest.
“They said that those who were killed neither belonged to Chautir or Ziarat, nor had they been seen in the area before, and that they were terrorists,” DC Zakiullah said.
The residents expressed their worry that based on this pretence, an operation would be launched in the area, DC Zakiullah said.
“After successful negotiations with residents of the area, the district administration took custody of the bodies, which were later handed over to the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ)  Ziarat,” the DC said.
He added that the counterterrorism department (CTD) and local police in Ziarat had been contacted as well.
“They said they were also unaware about the incident,” DC Zakiullah said.
 
 

He added that after being shifted to DHQ, the bodies could not be identified because all those killed appeared to be non-locals, who were shifted to Quetta for further necessary action.
In August last year, the bullet-riddled bodies of five people were found hanging from an electric pole in Dalbandin city, Balochistan.</p><small>2025-04-29 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602394-ispr-dg-addresses-presser-after-pahalgam-attack' target='_blank'><strong>DG ISPR presents 'irrefutable' evidence of Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

However, no such notification has been released by the PM Office and it is fake.
Relations between Pakistan and India have turned exceedingly sour since an attack took place in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in India-occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer, on April 22. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others. Following the attack, India, without providing evidence, implied that attackers had links to Pakistan, an allegation that Islamabad has vehemently refuted.
The incident led to a severe downgrading of ties between the two countries. Since then, the Indian mainstream and social media outlets have been spreading propaganda against Pakistan.
Following the same trend, an Indian X account on Monday (https://perma.cc/4UAD-6PVZ) shared a notification claiming that PM Shehbaz was hospitalised at Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Rawalpindi.
The post of the caption said: “Big, Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif hospitalised.”
The text of the alleged notification is reproduced below:
“Subject: Confidential — Hospitalisation of the honourable prime minister at CMH Rawalpindi.
It is hereby informed, in confidence, that the honourable prime minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was admitted to Combined Military Hospital (CMH), Rawalpindi on April 27, 2025, for medical evaluation and treatment related to a case of haemorrhoids.
The prime minister remains under the expert care of a specialised medical team at CMH. As of the latest update, his health condition is stable, and he is responding well to the prescribed course of treatment. The hospitalisation has been undertaken as a precautionary and standard medical measure advised by his attending physicians.
All concerned offices are advised to maintain strict confidentiality of this information. No disclosure to media or public forums is permitted unless officially authorised by the Prime Minister’s Office Media Wing or the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting.
This communication is issued with approval of the undersigned and is intended strictly for internal coordination among relevant departments.“
The document was signed off by Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Asad Rehman Gilani.
The post garnered more than 171,000 views.
The same claim was also shared by other Indian accounts, as can be seen here and here with over 764,000 and 74,000 views, respectively.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality, keen public interest in the events unfolding between India and Pakistan in the wake of the recent Pahalgam attack and the sensitivity of the matter as it directly involved the premier’s health.
The notification mentioned Asad Rehman Gilani as the principal secretary to the prime minister. However, a keyword search yielded a news report of Dawn dated March 18, 2025, which confirmed that Gilani had already been transferred from the position and that the post had since been abolished.
An official at the PMO also told Dawn correspondent Sanaullah Khan that the viral notification was a fake.
Additionally, no media reports were found indicating any recent health concerns or issues about PM Shehbaz or his hospitalisation.
On the contrary, PM Shehbaz was actively involved in official duties, including attending the Council of Common Interests meeting on April 28 — the same day the fake notification began circulating on social media.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim regarding a notification from the PMO about PM Shehbaz’s hospitalisation at CMH Rawalpindi is false. The viral notification is fake and the prime minister has been performing his duties as per normal.

This fact check was originally published by iVerify Pakistan — a project of CEJ-IBA and UNDP.</p><small>2025-04-29 13:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602396-at-least-three-terrorists-killed-in-turbat-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>At least three terrorists killed in Turbat IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

Relations between Pakistan and India have plummeted to their lowest level in years following an April 22 attack in the Indian-occupied Kashmir that killed 26 people, mostly tourists.  Following the incident, New Delhi, without providing any evidence, implied Pakistan backed the attackers — an allegation that Islamabad has strongly denied. The world has been urging the two nuclear-armed neighbours to “exercise restraint” amid rising tensions.
Speaking during a press conference, a video of which was shared on the X account of The Press Trust of India, the minister confirmed the incident, saying, “A mob lynching was reported, however, the identity of the victim could not be ascertained. He was rooting for Pakistan during a local cricket match while shouting ‘Pakistan Zindabad’,” he said.
The minister added that it was not yet known whether the victim was from Karnataka or came from elsewhere, adding that as soon as people in the crowd saw him rooting for Pakistan during the match, a few of them gathered and started assaulting him.
“He didn’t die on the spot, he died [later] because of the shock,” the interior minister said, adding that nearly 10 to 12 people had been arrested and further investigation was underway.
“We will definitely take this very seriously because such incidents should never occur anywhere.”
He said that if the victim had chanted pro-Pakistan slogans, people should have handed him over to the police rather than taking the law into their own hands.
Parameshwara called on the public to maintain peace and harmony in the state.
According to India Today, Mangaluru Police Commissioner Anupam Agarwal said that it was a “brutal and unprecedented attack”.
“We’ve never seen such a case in Mangaluru before. The injuries were extensive, and there was no timely medical aid. That led to his death,” the commissioner was quoted as saying by the news outlet.</p><small>2025-04-29 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2911483708b5d1b.jpg?r=123714' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907327/pakistan-tells-un-it-has-credible-evidence-of-regional-adversaries-sponsoring-jaffar-express-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan tells UN it has credible evidence of ‘regional adversaries’ sponsoring Jaffar Express attack</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Mission to the United Nations on Tuesday said the country had “credible evidence” proving that the Jaffer Express attack was “externally sponsored by its regional adversaries”, according to a press release.
The Jaffar Express train was hijacked on March 11 when Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages. Security forces launched a two-day operation, concluding on March 12. Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that all 33 terrorists were neutralised, but no hostages were harmed in the final rescue phase.
During the launch of the “Victims of Terrorism Association Network” by the UN Office of Counter-Terrorism at the UN headquarters in New York, Jawad Ajmal, a counsellor at the Pakistan Mission, expressed concern at the loss of tourist lives int he recent Pahalgam attack, and extended “heartfelt condolences to the near ones of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery.”
According to the press release, Ajmal said that Pakistan possessed “credible evidence establishing that the attack on the Jaffer Express passenger train — in which at least 30 innocent Pakistani nationals were killed and dozens taken hostage — was externally sponsored by its regional adversaries.”
He noted that Pakistan joined fellow UN Security Council members in condemning the attack.
The counsellor further said that Pakistan had been one of the worst victims of terrorism for over two decades. With the loss of more than 80,000 lives and thousands more injured, Pakistan remains inspired by the resilience and strength of its nation.
“We pay tribute to the families of the martyrs from our law enforcement agencies and armed forces, who have made countless sacrifices to defend our motherland,” he added.
“The international community had a responsibility to support survivors of brutal terrorist attacks and the families of victims whose lives were permanently altered by such tragedies.”
He underscored the need for collective action to prevent future attacks, calling for holding terrorists and their handlers accountable and adopting a “uniform, victim-centric approach”.
“If we are to chart a way forward for victims, we must look beyond narrow political interests and geopolitical agendas. We must examine why, despite global strategies, terrorism threats continue to proliferate and give rise to an ever-increasing number of victims,” he stated.
“Pakistan unequivocally condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, including right-wing extremism, Islamophobia, racially and ethnically motivated terrorism, and, above all, state-sponsored terrorism.”
Ajmal stressed that the world must address the root causes of terrorism and the conditions conducive to its spread. He also emphasised the importance of distinguishing terrorism from legitimate struggles for self-determination.
The counsellor highlighted the “need to address state-sponsored terrorism and underscored the necessity of reaching a consensual definition of terrorism that reflects emerging trends”.
“He added that challenges arising from the use of new tools — such as social media and the dark web — to deepen divisions and incite violence must also be combated,” the press release read.
He further called for efforts to counter disinformation campaigns designed to spread hate speech, xenophobia, and Islamophobia.
Ajmal also highlighted that the international community owes a moral and legal obligation to victims of terrorism to take effective, impartial steps to suppress terrorism wherever it exists and in whatever form.
“The more terrorism there is, the more victims there will be,” he noted.
Last month, the Foreign Office said that the perpetrators of the attack on the Jaffar Express remained in touch with their handlers in Afghanistan throughout the incident.
During the briefing, FO spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan was asked whether Pakistan had shifted its stance when it said that Afghanistan, and not India, was behind the terrorist attacks on Pakistan. He clarified that there was “no shift” in policy. “The facts have not changed. India is involved in sponsoring terrorism against Pakistan. What I was referring to was, in this particular incident, we have evidence of calls being traced to Afghanistan. This is what I said,” he said.
A day later, the DG ISPR called India the “main sponsor” of terrorism in Balochistan.
Lt Gen Chaudhry, who maintained that India was the main sponsor of terrorism in Balochistan, said the terrorists had used Afghan and foreign weapons in the recent incident and previous attacks. “We must understand that in this terrorist incident in Balochistan, and others before, the main sponsor is your eastern neighbour [India].”</p><small>2025-04-29 12:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29170420fd68807.jpg?r=170446' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907362/uk-to-stop-foreign-sex-offenders-receiving-refugee-protections' target='_blank'><strong>UK to stop foreign sex offenders receiving refugee protections</strong></a><br><p>Foreign nationals convicted of a sexual offence will be blocked from seeking refugee status in Britain as part of government efforts to tighten rules ahead of local elections and counter the charge from opponents that it cannot protect its borders.
Immigration has long been a major issue in Britain, with voters questioning why successive governments were unable to control arrivals, particularly those coming in small boats across the Channel.
 
 

Since being elected last July, Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government has sought to restrict access to the asylum system and speed up removal of those denied refugee status.
It is also reviewing how courts interpret a migrant’s right to a family life after the rule which guarantees it, Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, was used in multiple asylum appeals, with the details regularly reported by British newspapers.
“We are reviewing that because we do believe that the way in which it’s being interpreted in the courts is an issue,” interior minister Yvette Cooper told Sky News on Tuesday.
Britain has experienced record migration in recent years, with net arrivals hitting 728,000 for the year ending June 2024 — the vast majority coming via legal routes for jobs or as students.
So far this year more than 10,000 asylum seekers have also arrived in small boats in record time, up about 40 per cent compared with the same period last year.
The issue has been seized on by Nigel Farage’s populist Reform UK, and the new tightening of the rules was announced two days before local elections on Thursday, where Reform is expected to perform well.
AI for asylum caseworkers
The government’s Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, which is passing through parliament, will be amended to deny refugee status to any foreign national with a criminal conviction that qualifies them for the sex offenders’ register.
“Sex offenders who pose a risk to the community should not be allowed to benefit from refugee protections in the UK,” Cooper said in a statement late on Monday.
The government also said it would introduce new targets to speed up parts of the asylum decision-making system, and begin using AI to help caseworkers.
Britain had 90,686 asylum cases awaiting an initial decision at the end of 2024.
The government said in January that it had met its target to deliver the highest rate of removals since 2018, having removed 16,400 people.
Western countries, from France and Germany to the United States, have been grappling with a surge in the number of people fleeing war, persecution and poverty, with the global refugee population having tripled in the last decade.</p><small>2025-04-29 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29143712c561b29.jpg?r=143732' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907313/carneys-liberals-win-canada-election-defined-by-trump' target='_blank'><strong>Carney’s Liberals win Canada election defined by Trump</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Mark Carney won Canada’s election on Monday, local media projected, leading his Liberal Party to a new term in power after convincing voters his experience managing economic crises prepared him to confront United States President Donald Trump.
The public broadcaster CBC and other outlets projected the Liberals would form Canada’s next government, but it was not yet clear if they would hold a majority in parliament.
Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre fell short of becoming prime minister, but his party was on track to form a strong opposition in parliament
Trump’s trade war and threats to annex Canada — which he renewed in an election day social media post — outraged Canadians and made dealing with the US a top campaign issue.
 
 

Carney, who had never held elected office and only replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister last month, anchored his campaign on an anti-Trump message.
He previously served as central bank governor in both Britain and Canada and persuaded voters his global financial experience has prepared him to guide Canada through a trade war.
Carney, who also had a lucrative career as investment banker before joining Canada’s public service, promised to expand overseas trading relations to curb Canada’s reliance on the United States.
Carney’s descriptions of the Trump threat have been stark.
“Donald Trump wants to break us so America can own us,” he said during the campaign.
“They want our resources, they want our water, they want our land, they want our country. They can’t have it.”
When the CBC projection was announced, cheers of joy erupted at the Ottawa venue where Liberal supporters were watching the results.
“I’m happy in the sense that we’ve got somebody that can speak to Mr. Trump on his level,” said Dorothy Goubault, 72. “Mr. Trump is a business person. Mr. Carney is a business person, and I think they can both relate.”
Before Trudeau resigned, Trump had mocked him, calling the prime minister “governor” as he urged Canada to become the 51st US state.
Goubault said she expects that mockery to stop.
“It’s not the governor anymore, it’s the prime minister of Canada, and it’s not the 51st state anymore. It’s ‘We are Canada!’”
 


Liberal lawmaker and a member of Carney’s cabinet, Steven Guilbeault, tied the outcome to Trump.
“The numerous attacks by President Trump on the Canadian economy, but not just the economy, on our sovereignty and our very identity, I think have really mobilised Canadians, and I think they saw in Prime Minister Carney someone who has experience on the world stage,” he told the CBC.
Trudeau’s departure
The departure of former prime minister Justin Trudeau was also crucial to the Liberal win, which capped one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history.
On January 6, the day Trudeau announced he would resign, the Conservatives led the Liberals by more than 20 points in most polls, as voter anger over soaring coasts mounted after Trudeau’s decade in power.
But Carney replacing Trudeau, combined with nationwide unease about Trump, transformed the race.
Carney, 60, distanced himself from Trudeau throughout the campaign.
 
 

He said the former prime minister did not focus enough on growing Canada’s economy and scrapped a controversial Trudeau tax on carbon emissions that left many voters seething.
For Poilievre, a 45-year-old who has been in parliament for two decades, the outcome marks a stinging defeat.
He was criticised for the at-times muted anger he directed towards Trump, but said he wanted to keep the focus on domestic concerns that drove Trudeau’s unpopularity.
He tried to persuade voters that Carney would simply offer a continuation of the failed Liberal governance, an argument that fell short.
At the Conservative watch party in Ottawa, Jason Piche told AFP he was surprised by the result.
“I was hoping to have a big celebration tonight,” Piche said.
Nearly 29 million of Canada’s 41 million people were eligible to vote in the massive G7 country that spans six time zones. A record 7.3 million people cast advanced ballots.
Results were still pending on the shape of Canada’s 343 members of parliament, with 172 seats needed for a majority. The Liberals won a majority in 2015 but have governed with a minority since 2019.
World leaders react
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Canadian counterpart on his election victory.
“Pakistan and Canada enjoy warm and friendly relations, and we are proud of the vibrant Pakistani diaspora in Canada,” PM Shehbaz said in a post on X.
“I look forward to working together with Prime Minister Carney to further deepen our partnership and create greater opportunities for our nations.”
 






India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi also congratulated Carney on his election, suggesting hopes of a possible reset of fraught relations between New Delhi and Ottawa.
“I look forward to working with you to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people,” Modi said in a statement.
“India and Canada are bound by shared democratic values, a steadfast commitment to the rule of law, and vibrant people-to-people ties,” he added.
 






Ties between Canada and India were strained following accusations of New Delhi’s involvement in the assassination of a Canadian Sikh, claims India denied.
Meanwhile, China said it was open to improving ties with Canada.
“China is willing to develop China-Canada relations on the basis of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit,” foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.
Beijing on Tuesday stopped short of congratulating Carney, but said: “China’s position on China-Canada relations is consistent and clear.” Ties between Beijing and Ottawa have been tense in recent years.
The arrest of a senior Chinese telecom executive on a US warrant in Vancouver in December 2018 and Beijing’s retaliatory detention of two Canadians on espionage charges plunged relations into a deep freeze.
Ties were strained further over allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian elections in 2019 and 2021, charges Beijing has denied.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Carney on his election win, expressing hope the two countries would forge stronger ties under his premiership.
“We are sincerely grateful for Canada’s principled leadership in supporting Ukraine… We are confident that our partnership will only grow stronger in our shared pursuit of peace, justice, and security,” Zelensky said in a post on X.
 






France’s President Emmanuel Macron, congratulated Carney on his election win, saying he believed the Liberal Party leader embodied a “strong Canada”.
“You embody a strong Canada in the face of the great challenges of our time. France looks forward to further strengthening the friendship that binds our countries. Eager to work alongside you,” he said on X.
 






British leader Keir Starmer also congratulated Carney and said he looked forward to strengthening ties between the two countries.
“Congratulations to Mark Carney on your election victory. The UK and Canada are the closest of allies, partners and friends,” Starmer said in a statement.
“Our partnership is based on shared history and values, with a shared sovereign, and I look forward to strengthening our ties”.

However, the letters are fake.
An attack took place in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in India-occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer, on April 22. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others. It was the region’s deadliest attack on civilians since 2000. A hitherto unknown group, named by several Indian outlets as ‘The Resistance Front’, is said to have claimed responsibility for the attack.
India followed suit by announcing a series of actions against Pakistan. Responding in kind, Pakistan also announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines with immediate effect.
As diplomatic channels dry up and treaty frameworks teeter, analysts warn that relations between the nuclear-armed neighbours may be approaching a dangerous tipping point, with limited space remaining for de-escalation.
On Sunday, an Indian user shared a letter on X with the Pakistan Army’s emblem on the top left corner.
The caption of the post said: “Breaking news … Asim Munir sends his family over to Britain, along with families of other generals. Result mass resignations in Pakistani Army. Officers are petrified of facing the Indian Armed Forces.”
According to the details mentioned in the document, the alleged letter was sent to Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir at Rawalpindi’s General Headquarters from Corps Commander Peshawar (XI Corps), Lieutenant General Omer Ahmed Bokhari.
The letter starts with the subject, “Massive surge in resignations amid rising tensions with India.” The text of the alleged letter is reproduced below:
“I am writing to bring to your esteemed attention an alarming situation that has developed over the past 48 hours. Reports from various formations indicate a wave of resignations, the scale of which is unprecedented in recent history. This trend is creating significant concerns about the operational stability and morale of our troops.
Key Details as of April 26, 2025, 0800 hours:

XII Corps (Quetta):

Number of Resignations: 120 officers and 400 enlisted personnel
Impacted units: Infantry regiments deployed along the western borders.

Force Command Northern Areas (FCNA):

Number of Resignations: 80 officers and 300 enlisted personnel
Impacted units: Mountain battalions tasked with safeguarding critical sectors in the northern region.

I Corps (Mangla):

Number of Resignations: 50 officers and 500 enlisted personnel
Impacted units: Mechanised infantry and artillery regiments stationed at key forward positions.
Total Resignations: 250 officers and 1,200 enlisted personnel
Cited reasons:
The resigning personnel have predominantly cited family pressures, mental fatigue, and uncertainty about the strategic directives amidst escalating tensions with India.
This situation demands immediate intervention to mitigate its impact on our operational readiness and morale.
Your immediate guidance and intervention are crucial to address this critical issue and stabilise the ranks. I remain available to provide additional details or assistance as required.
Yours sincerely.“
The post gained over 962,000 views and was reshared 4,200 times.
A post by another Indian user sharing the same alleged letter gained 21,700 views and 4,200 shares and was shared by several other Indian X users with similar claims as can be seen here, here, here, here and here.
Separately, the executive editor for Indian-Telugu channel TV9 Network shared another document making a similar claim of mass resignations within the Pakistan Army.
The caption of the post said: “Huge. Mass resignations are being reported in Pakistan Army as morale is at its lowest under Asim Munir’s leadership.”
The text of the alleged letter is reproduced below:
“Subject: Reinforcing duty and discipline
To: All ranks, Pakistan Armed Forces
From: Major General Faisal Mehmood Malik, HI(M), DGISPR


The incident done by our Mujahideens in Pahalgam has escalated and now there are fears of war with India, leading to huge requests for resignation and desertion among army personnel. This disinformation aims to undermine our unity and Iman.


Directives:


-Uphold Your Oath: As Mujahideen of Pakistan, your commitment to defend the nation is sacred. Reject fear and stand firm.
-Maintain Morale: Our forces remain battle-ready, as demonstrated in Operation Swift Retort. Commanding Officers to conduct darbars to reinforce the high spirit.
-Discipline: Unauthorized resignation or desertion from service will face strict action under the Pakistan Army Act, 1952.

Call to Unity: You are the heirs of our Shuhada. Stand united under the crescent and star.

Pakistan Jinabad!“
The post received 1.2 million views and was shared 3,000 times.
A fact check was initiated to determine the veracity of the letters due to their virality and keen public interest in the events unfolding between India and Pakistan in the wake of the recent Pahalgam attack.
The first letter presents many formatting errors upon first glance, such as “commander”, “headquarters” and “peshawar” written in lower case at the top right-hand side, along with spelling eleven as “Xi” when it is spelt as “XI” when referring to the respective army corps.
There was also no date for the alleged letter.
Furthermore, it did not make sense for the commander of the Peshawar Corps to be discussing the details of other corps rather than his own, since they do not fall under his chain of command.
Sending an email to the provided address (o.bokhari@pakarmy.mil.pk) to verify it showed that the domain could not be found, showing that it was invalid.
 


Similarly, the contact number (+92-91-9200001) was also found to be “not listed” as per the operator when called.
According to several AI and ChatGPT detectors, such as Grammarly, QuillBot and ZeroGPT, the document’s text was found to be 66 per cent, 100pc and 71.3pc AI-generated, respectively.
 


A senior military official at the Peshawar Corps headquarters told Dawn correspondent Arif Hayat: “The resignation of army personnel is totally baseless. This is the fake news which is circulated by Indian social media accounts.”
As for the other letter, it presented glaring mistakes that showed it was a forged and fake document since the current director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations is Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry.
Furthermore, a keyword search yielded no record of a military official by the name of Major General Faisal Mehmood Malik.
Additionally, the common patriotic slogan of “Pakistan Zindabad” (long live Pakistan) was instead written as “Pakistan Jinabad”, which is Hindi.
Lastly, the signature at the letter’s end looked to be copied and pasted from somewhere hastily since its square border did not match the white background of the alleged document and it was partially cropped off as well, suggesting it was an edit.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that confidential internal correspondence and letters of the Pakistan Army raise alarms about rising resignations and low morale in the wake of the developing situation after the Pahalgam attack is false.
The two letters were confirmed to be fakes, as seen by the many errors and factual inconsistencies in them.

Shares of the Cleveland-based drugmaker rose 13 per cent in premarket trading.
The gene therapy, called Zevaskyn, is approved to treat adult and pediatric patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.
Patients with the disorder have extremely fragile skin, with blisters and tears forming large wounds all over the body that are difficult to heal and can remain open for years.
The disorder results from a defect in the COL7A1 gene, which prevents the production of a crucial type of collagen responsible for anchoring the upper and lower layers of the skin.
The current standard of care treatment is daily wound care and protective bandaging.
The treatment is expected to be available in the third quarter of 2025 at specific treatment sites, Abeona said.
Zevaskyn, chemically known as pz-cel, works by adding healthy COL7A1 genes to the patient’s skin cells and transplanting them back to the patient through a skin graft to heal the large and chronic wounds.
The FDA’s approval was based on data from early-to-mid-stage and late-stage studies, in which the therapy showed significant healing of wounds and pain reduction after treatment.
 
 

Current treatment options include Krystal Biotech’s Vyjuvek, approved in 2023, which is used to treat smaller-sized wounds. Last year, Vyjuvek brought in sales of $290.5 million.
Patients being able to use both Vyjuvek and pz-cel at the same time will help treat the disorder more effectively and “hopefully make this disease chronic but livable,” said Brett Kopelan, executive director at debra of America, a nonprofit patient support organisation.
Jefferies analyst Maury Raycroft estimates peak sales for the therapy, after royalty payments, to be at $427mn by 2034 and expects the treatment to be priced at $1.75mn per round of treatment.</p><small>2025-04-29 11:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/291548471c52f9d.jpg?r=154906' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907349/shares-at-psx-climb-800-points-after-imf-announcement' target='_blank'><strong>Shares at PSX climb 800 points after IMF announcement</strong></a><br><p>Bulls bounced back on the trading floor on Tuesday as shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange climbed more than 800 points after a day of volatility.
The benchmark KSE-100 index climbed 808.28 points, or 0.71 per cent, to stand at 114,872.18 from the previous close of 114,063.90.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, said, attributed the bull run to the announcement of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board meeting “to approve a tranche of $1.3 billion for Pakistan under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and a new 28-month arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility”.
Earlier, the IMF website confirmed that the Fund’s Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new $1.3bn arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme.
According to the IMF, this will be the first “review under the Extended Arrangement Under the Extended Fund Facility”, along with the request for an arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
Ashraf added that this “redirected attention from the border dispute with India to the country’s macroeconomic improvement efforts”.
Yesterday, after a positive start, the concerns about Pakistan’s economic outlook and rising tensions with India prompted equity investors to engage in panic selling towards the end of the session.
An analyst had said the share market fell across the board as investors weighed heightened geopolitical tensions, suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, and stalled bilateral trade by New Delhi.
Last week, the April 22 attack in Pahalgam saw 26 people, mostly tourists, killed in what is being described as the deadliest armed attack in the disputed Himalayan region since the year 2000.
Since the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.
Topline Securities Ltd observed that the PSX witnessed a classic tug-of-war between bulls and bears. The index opened positively, gaining momentum in the early hours to register an intraday gain of 1,189 points. However, the optimism proved short-lived, as intensified selling pressure later in the session caused the index to reverse sharply, touching an intraday loss of 1,601 points. The market eventually closed at 114,063.90 — down by 1,405.45 points or 1.22pc day-on-day.</p><small>2025-04-29 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/29155414fa41447.jpg?r=160027' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907354/restaurant-fire-in-northeast-china-kills-22' target='_blank'><strong>Restaurant fire in northeast China kills 22</strong></a><br><p>A restaurant fire in northeastern China killed 22 people and injured three on Tuesday, Beijing’s state media said, with footage posted online showing fierce flames engulfing the building.
The blaze erupted at 12:25pm (9:25am PKT) in a restaurant in a residential area of Liaoning Province’s Liaoyang City, state broadcaster CCTV said. “The incident has resulted in 22 deaths and three injuries,” it added.
President Xi Jinping said that the blaze had caused “significant casualties” and that the lessons from it were “profoundly serious”, CCTV said.
Xi called for “every effort to treat the injured, properly handle the aftermath for the deceased and provide support to their families, swiftly determine the cause of the fire, and pursue accountability in accordance with the law,” the report added.
Official news agency Xinhua did not identify the cause of the fire but said President Xi Jinping called it “a deeply sobering lesson”.
Footage shared online and verified by AFP showed the inferno engulfing the two-storey restaurant and smoke billowing skyward.
Other authenticated videos published on Douyin, China’s version of TikTok, showed paramedics wheeling one victim on a stretcher into an ambulance and several firefighters battling the flames with hoses.
Another video from the social media platform, shot from above the scene, showed more than a dozen fire engines parked outside the restaurant.
Hao Peng, secretary of Liaoning’s provincial ruling party committee, said 22 fire trucks and 85 firefighters were deployed to the scene. Hao said the on-site rescue work had been completed and people had been evacuated.
‘Very tragic’
One woman working at a nearby restaurant said she hadn’t been outside all day and only learnt of the incident when she read news articles about the fire.
“We weren’t aware of it and continued on normally,” she told AFP over the phone.
The woman, who did not want to be identified, said she had “no idea” what caused the fire but said she heard sirens and there were still police outside of her restaurant.
“It definitely was very tragic,” she added.
Deadly fires are relatively common in China due to lax building codes and an often slipshod approach to workplace safety.
 
 

The country has seen a spate of such deadly incidents in recent months. Earlier this month, 20 people died in a fire at a nursing home in northern China’s Hebei province.
And in January, a blaze at a vegetable market in Zhangjiakou city, northwest of Beijing, killed eight people and injured 15.
A month before that, nine people died in a fire at a construction site in eastern China’s Rongcheng city.

The explosion, heard dozens of kilometres away, hit a dock at the southern port of Shahid Rajaee on Saturday.
At least 70 people were killed and more than 1,000 others suffered injuries in the blast and ensuing the fire, which also caused extensive damage, state media reported.
Red Crescent official Mokhtar Salahshour told the channel late on Monday that the fire had been “contained” and a clean-up was underway.
State television aired live footage on Tuesday showing thick smoke rising from stacked containers.
Iran’s IRNA news agency quoted Hossein Zafari, spokesman for the country’s crisis management organisation, as saying the situation had improved significantly since Monday.
However, “the operation and complete extinguishing process may take around 15 to 20 days”, Zafari added.
Iran’s customs authority said port operations had returned to normal, according to the IRNA news agency.
The port of Shahid Rajaee lies near the major coastal city of Bandar Abbas on the Strait of Hormuz, a waterway through which one-fifth of global oil output passes.
Hormozgan provincial governor Mohammad Ashouri ruled out sabotage.
“The set of hypotheses and investigations carried out during the process indicated that the sabotage theory lacks basis or relevance,” he told state television late on Monday.
The port’s customs office said the blast may have started in a depot storing hazardous and chemical materials.
Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni said there were “shortcomings, including noncompliance with safety precautions and negligence”.
A committee assigned to investigate the blast cited similar factors as the likely cause.</p><small>2025-04-29 10:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/2913081207e6468.png?r=132113' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907326/pakistan-shoots-down-indian-quadcopter-violating-airspace-near-loc' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan shoots down Indian quadcopter violating airspace near LoC</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Army on Tuesday shot down an Indian quadcopter drone near the Line of Control (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), state media reported, as tensions between the two countries linger on in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The April 22 attack killed 26 men, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.
India, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.
“Pakistan has successfully shot down an Indian quadcopter along the Line of Control, thwarting a violation of its airspace,” state-run Radio Pakistan and PTV News reported, citing security sources.
 


Specifying the location, security sources said the “enemy attempted to conduct surveillance using a quadcopter” in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district in AJK.
“The Pakistan Army, through timely action, foiled this nefarious attempt by the enemy,” the report added.
The security sources termed the incident a “clear testimony to the vigilance, professional skill and defensive preparedness of the Pakistan Army”.
“The Pakistan Army is always ready to give an immediate and effective response to any aggression from the enemy,” the report read, adding that the entire nation stood “united with the armed forces to give a befitting response to the enemy on every front”.
The development comes as Indian and Pakistani soldiers reportedly traded fire along the LoC for a fifth straight night, after four years of relative calm.
The Indian army said its soldiers and Pakistani forces fired at each other overnight. There was no immediate confirmation from Pakistan.
India said that overnight from Monday to Tuesday, the gunfire took place in areas opposite the Kupwara and Baramulla districts in held Kashmir, as well as in the Akhnoor sector.
There were no reports of casualties.
In the latest of this heated debate, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif yesterday said Pakistan was ready for any incursion by India.
 
 

“We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So in that situation, some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken,” Asif told Reuters.
He said the military had briefed the government on the possibility of an Indian attack, but did not go into further details on his reasons for thinking an incursion was imminent.
In an interview with Samaa TV, Asif warned there was a “war looming on the horizon”, and later told Geo News that the “next two to three days were crucial”.
Calls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.
Pakistan preparing to challenge Indus Waters Treaty suspension: Aqeel Malik
Pakistan is preparing international legal action over India’s suspension of the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), Minister of State for Law and Justice Aqeel Malik told Reuters late on Monday.
Malik said Islamabad was working on plans for at least three different legal options, including raising the issue at the World Bank, the treaty’s facilitator.
It was also considering taking action at the Permanent Court of Arbitration or at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, where it could allege that India has violated the 1960 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, he said.
“Legal strategy consultations are almost complete,” Malik said, adding the decision on which cases to pursue would be made “soon” and would likely include pursuing more than one avenue.
India’s water resources officials did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request seeking comment.

Malik added that a fourth diplomatic option that Islamabad was considering was to raise the issue at the United Nations Security Council.
“All the options are on the table and we are pursuing all appropriate and competent forums to approach,” he said. “The treaty cannot be suspended unilaterally and cannot be held in abeyance, there is not [such a] provision within the treaty,” he asserted.
Since the Pahalgam attack, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.
India on April 23 unilaterally suspended the IWT — a water-sharing agreement that was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.
The next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights. The National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad also said “any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan […] will be considered as an act of war”.
The treaty is an agreement for the distribution and use of waters from the Indus River and its tributaries, which feed 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture and its hydropower.
 
 

Kushvinder Vohra, a recently retired head of India’s Central Water Commission, told Reuters: “There are very limited options [for Pakistan] … I can say that there are solid grounds for us to defend our action.”
Government officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately, because the treaty has allowed it to only build hydropower plants without significant storage or dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.
But things could start changing in a few months, and farmers, already hit by climate-change-related water shortages, have raised concerns.
Cyberattacks on ministries’ websites ‘foiled’
In a related development, Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja has said that cyberattack attempts on the websites of some ministries were foiled.
Responding to a query yesterday about cyberattacks from India, Khawaja said: “There were [cyberattacks] on some ministries, but we defended against them successfully. There was no huge issue.
“They were resolved timely,” she told reporters at her ministry’s office in Islamabad, clarifying there was no cyberattack on the IT ministry’s website.
 


Khawaja highlighted that the National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) and its provincial counterparts were functional.
The minister pointed out that Pakistan had been listed among the top countries in cybersecurity last year, recalling the Top Tier-1 ranking in the ITU-Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI-V5) 2024.
Speaking on the Pahalgam attack, she asserted Pakistan had always condemned terrorism and advocated peace.
“It is in no one’s interest that the situation escalates,” Khawaja said about the ongoing Pakistan-India friction.
Also yesterday, N-cert, which is responsible for the security of critical digital infrastructure, warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.
 
 

In an advisory, it noted there had been an “uptick in the circulation of videos, images, and commentary revealing troop movements, military deployments, and sensitive national security activities” on social media and public forums.
“ Such disclosures — whether inadvertent or intentional — may severely compromise national security, jeopardise operational effectiveness, and facilitate hostile actions by adversaries,“ N-cert said.
The advisory added that disseminating sensitive material may result in a security breach by disclosing the locations and movements of troops.
India shuts over half of tourist spots in held Kashmir in security review
More than half of the tourist destinations in India-occupied Kashmir (IoK) have been closed to the public from Tuesday, according to a government order reviewed by Reuters, in a bid to tighten security after last week’s attack on holiday-makers.

The assailants segregated men, asked their names and targeted Hindus before shooting them at close range in the Pahalgam area, killing 26 people, officials and survivors said.
The local government has decided to shut 48 of the 87 tourist destinations in IoK and enhanced security at the remaining ones, according to the government document.
No time period was given. Government officials did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
Nestled in the Himalayas with lofty peaks, picturesque valleys and grand Mughal-era gardens, the territory has been emerging as India’s tourism hotspot as violence there has waned in recent years.
But the Pahalgam attack has left panic-stricken tourists seeking an early exit at the start of the busy summer season.
UAE joins chorus favouring Pak-India dialogue
Meanwhile, the United Arab Emirates today joined other countries in stressing the importance of “promoting dialogue” to defuse tensions between arch-rivals India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
UAE Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in a phone call with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar, discussed the recent regional situation and matters of mutual concern, the Foreign Office (FO) said on X.
Dar apprised the UAE official of the decisions made by Pakistan’s National Security Committee last week in response to “India’s unfounded allegations, inflammatory rhetoric and unilateral actions”.

The UAE deputy PM “emphasised the importance of upholding regional stability, promoting dialogue, exercising restraint and peaceful resolution of disputes”, according to the FO.
“Reaffirming the strong fraternal ties between Pakistan and the UAE, both leaders committed to maintaining close coordination and consultations in light of [the] evolving regional situation.”
Both deputy premiers also expressed their countries’ resolve to “enhance bilateral cooperation and advance shared objectives of peace, stability, and sustainable development”, the FO stated.
Other friendly countries and global powers have also sought de-escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India — including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Turkiye, and Qatar.
 
 

Yesterday, China said it hoped the two sides would “exercise restraint, meet each other halfway, properly handle relevant differences through dialogue and consultation, and jointly maintain regional peace and stability”.
Turkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called for a swift de-escalation of the brewing crisis, Anadolu Agency reported on Monday.
“We want the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India to be de-escalated as soon as possible, before they evolve into a more serious situation,” Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting in Ankara.
“Türkiye emphasises at every opportunity that we do not want new conflicts in our region and beyond,” he stressed.
The United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint” so that issues can be “resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.
Iran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. US President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed tensions, saying the dispute will get “figured out, one way or another”.

The international lender also greenlit $78m in additional financing to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Rural Accessibility Project (KPRAP) along with $30m to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Integrated Tourism Development Project (Kite), enabling both projects to achieve their objectives in improving access to health and education services, markets and jobs in a way that strengthened resilience to natural disasters in the province.
“By rehabilitating critical rural road infrastructure and enhancing disaster preparedness, KPRAP and Kite projects are not only improving access to essential services like health and education, but also fostering climate, economic resilience and creating job opportunities for local communities,” WB Country Director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine said in a news release on Tuesday.
He said the $78m in additional financing for the KPRAP would focus on providing safe and climate resilient road infrastructure, by upgrading and rehabilitating rural roads, thereby improving access to services including schools, health facilities, and markets.
The project is also supporting safe and affordable transport to school for girls.
Overall, around 1.76m people are expected to benefit from the project, he added.
This additional financing underscores the World Bank’s commitment to support the country and its provinces’ development goals, said the task team leader for the project, Muhammad Bilal Paracha.
“The project is crucial for improving the lives of people in the province, particularly women and girls, by enhancing access to essential services and economic opportunities,” he said.
The $30m in additional financing for the Kite project would help improve the tourism sector by completing the rehabilitation of two roads that would help improve access to the province’s “pristine tourist spots in the vicinity”.
It would also support technical assistance and capacity building for the tourism industry and public sector stakeholders.
“The additional financing will support better destination management, heritage conservation, and the integration of digital platforms in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s tourism industry,” the press release read.
“The project will encourage responsible tourism in KP in collaboration with public and private sector stakeholders,” said task team leader for the project, Kiran Afzal.
Afzal added this was meant to improve roads and tourist facilities, and prove more opportunities for local communities to benefit from the growth of the tourism economy.
She highlighted, “The project will create jobs, train local people, and preserve the country’s rich cultural heritage.”</p><small>2025-04-29 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/291243574282882.jpg?r=131435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907331/ride-hailing-services-in-karachi-to-be-brought-under-one-system-sharjeel' target='_blank'><strong>Ride-hailing services in Karachi to be brought under one system: Sharjeel</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said on Tuesday that the provincial government was working to bring ride-hailing services in Karachi under one system, according to a press release issued by his spokesperson.
“We are working to bring the [online] taxi system in Karachi under one umbrella in an integrated and modern manner,” the statement quoted Memon as having said while chairing a meeting of the transport department.
Memon added that these services will be organised under one umbrella so that safe, standard and legal facilities can be provided to passengers.
The minister’s spokesperson Husain Mansoor, speaking to Dawn.com, said, “All online taxi services like Careem, Yango would be brought under one system.”
The statement added that Special Assistant to the Sindh Chief Minister on Investment and Public-Private Partnership Qasim Naveed Qamar, Transport Secretary Asad Zamin, and Sindh Mass Transit Authority Managing Director Kamal Dayo also attended the meeting.
The senior minister added that providing quality, safe and environment-friendly travel facilities to the citizens of Karachi is a top priority.
Memon also spoke about taking steps to introduce an electric vehicle (EV) taxi service in Karachi.
“The launch of an EV taxi service will not only improve the city’s taxi system but will also significantly reduce environmental pollution.”
The meeting also considered various models of providing EV taxi vehicles to the public on easy instalments, according to the press release.
Speaking about an earlier announcement by the Sindh government about providing pink scooters to women free of cost, Memon said that rapid progress was being made in this regard to provide women with ease of transport facilities.
“Double-decker buses for the transport sector [in Karachi] will arrive by June this year. A large batch of new buses is expected in late June or early July,” he added.
The senior minister added that in the budget for the upcoming financial year, efforts will be made to allocate maximum funds for the purchase of new buses for commuters.
Earlier in February, the Sindh cabinet had approved the procurement of 50 more electric buses for Karachi, including 15 double-deckers, and 1,000 pink electric motorcycles for women.</p><small>2025-04-29 08:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602329-heatwave-grips-sindh-rain-expected-in-early-may' target='_blank'><strong>Heatwave grips Sindh, rain expected in early May</strong></a><br><p>

Electricity had been restored to more than 90 per cent of mainland Spain early on Tuesday, the REE power operator said. Lights came on again in Madrid and in Portugal’s capital.
Barely a corner of the peninsula, which has a joint population of almost 60 million people, escaped the blackout. But no firm cause for the shutdown has yet emerged, though wild rumours spread on messaging networks about cyber attacks.
Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said the source of the outage was “probably in Spain”. Spain’s Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said “all the potential causes” were being analysed and warned the public “not to speculate” because of the risk of “misinformation”.
Sanchez said about 15,000 megawatts of electricity, more than half of the power being consumed at the time, “suddenly disappeared” in about five seconds.
He was unable to say when power would be completely restored in Spain and warned that some workers would have to stay home on Tuesday. Montenegro said Portugal’s power would be back “within hours”.
Power was restored overnight to around 6.2m households in Portugal out of 6.5m, according to the national electricity grid operator.
The outage rippled briefly into southwest France while Morocco saw disruption to some internet providers and airport check-in systems.
People were “stunned”, according to Carlos Candori, a 19-year-old construction worker who had to exit the paralysed Madrid metro system. “This has never happened in Spain”.
“There’s no (phone) coverage, I can’t call my family, my parents, nothing: I can’t even go to work,” he told AFP.
Cash queues
In Madrid and cities across Spain and Portugal, panicked customers rushed to withdraw cash from banks, and streets filled with crowds floundering for a phone signal. Long lines formed for taxis and buses.
With stop lights knocked out, police struggled to keep densely congested traffic moving and authorities urged motorists to stay home.
In Madrid alone 286 rescue operations were carried out to free people trapped in lifts, regional authorities said.
Trains were halted across the country and on Tuesday morning, three trains were still stranded in Spain with passengers onboard, according to Transport Minister Oscar Puente.
Several high-speed rail lines are expected to resume normal service, including between Madrid-Barcelona and Madrid-Valencia, but disruptions remain between Barcelona-Alicante and between Madrid-Galicia (northwest), Puente wrote on X.
Railway stations in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia, Seville and four other major cities were kept open all night so that stranded passengers could sleep there.
Spain’s nuclear power plants automatically went offline as a safety precaution, with diesel generators maintaining them in a “safe condition”, the Spanish Nuclear Safety Council said.
Serious disruption
Sanchez said the blackout, which hit just after midday, caused “serious disruption” for millions and “economic losses in businesses, in companies, in industries”.
The European Commission said it was in contact with Spain and Portugal over the crisis. European Council President Antonio Costa said on X: “There are no indications of any cyberattack”.
 






The huge power cut disrupted flights to and from Madrid, Barcelona and Lisbon, European air traffic organisation Eurocontrol said.
France affected
Transport chaos also gripped Spain’s second city, Barcelona, where locals and tourists alike flooded the streets in an attempt to find out what had happened.
Student Laia Montserrat left school when the lights went out.
“As the internet wasn’t coming back, they told us to go home… [but] there weren’t trains either,” she told AFP. “Now we don’t know what to do.”
The internet activity monitoring site Netblocks told AFP the blackout caused a “loss of much of the country’s digital infrastructure”. It said web connections plunged to just 17pc of normal usage.
Spain’s El Pais newspaper reported that hospitals used back-up generators to keep critical wards going, but some units were left without power.
Massive blackouts have affected other countries around the world in recent years.
Huge outages struck Tunisia in September 2023, Sri Lanka in August 2020, and Argentina and Uruguay in June 2019. In July 2012, India experienced a vast blackout.
In Europe, in November 2006, 10m people were left without power for an hour in France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy and Spain. That was caused by a failure in Germany’s grid.</p><small>2025-04-29 06:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/04/290931569ed1149.jpg?r=100527' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1907317/imf-board-to-meet-on-may-9-to-discuss-pakistans-programmes' target='_blank'><strong>IMF board to meet on May 9 to discuss Pakistan’s programmes</strong></a><br><p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Executive Board will meet on May 9 to discuss the country’s staff-level agreement for a new $1.3 billion arrangement under a climate resilience loan programme, along with the first review of Pakistan’s ongoing $7bn bailout programme, the global lender said.
According to the Fund’s website, this will be the first “review under the Extended Arrangement Under the Extended Fund Facility”, along with request for an arrangement under the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).
Previously, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb during his visit to Washington had said he also expected the IMF Executive Board to approve in early May.
Approval from the board would trigger the disbursement of a $1bn tranche under the programme, which Pakistan secured in 2024. The IMF programme has played a critical role in stabilising Pakistan’s fragile economy, providing much-needed external financing and boosting market confidence.
Pakis­tan and the IMF had reached a three-year, $7bn aid package deal in July 2024, with the new programme set to allow the country to “cement macroeconomic stability and create conditions for stronger, more inclusive and resilient growth”.
The ongoing 37-month EFF programme consists of six reviews over the life of the bailout, and the release of the next tranche of approximately $1bn will be contingent on the success of the performance review.
In March, Pakistan and the IMF had concluded the first biannual review of the $7bn loan programme on a positive note, without imposing additional revenue measures.
In an end-of-mission statement, mission chief Nathan Porter said: “Programme implementation has been strong, and the discussions have made considerable progress in several areas, including the planned fiscal consolidation to durably reduce public debt, maintenance of sufficiently tight monetary policy to maintain low inflation, acceleration of cost-reducing reforms to improve energy sector viability.”
A separate technical mission from the IMF also visited the country on Pakistan’s request for over $1bn in additional financing for climate resilience.</p><small>2025-04-29 06:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/602320-lawyers-end-sindh-sit-ins-after-cci-rejects-controversial-canals-project' target='_blank'><strong>Lawyers end Sindh sit-ins after CCI rejects controversial canals project</strong></a><br><p>

The clash left some protesters as well as the policemen injured.
The protesters, including the young doctors, had announced on Sunday to take out the rally under the banner of the Grand Health Alliance (GHA) and stage a sit-in outside the Chief Minister House.
The young doctors alleged that the police used force, tortured the protesters, including women, and arrested some of them. The police high-ups claimed that the protesters used syringes and knives they had brought from the hospitals, and injured some law enforcers. They said the employees were asked to avoid using the road leading to the high security zone, which led to the physical clash.

YDA stops entry of policemen to all public hospitals

The eyewitnesses said a part of The Mall from Charing Cross to the Alhamra Hall remained the battleground as both sides clashed, throwing the traffic out of gear even on the smaller adjoining arteries. The motorists and the traders faced a great deal of inconvenience in the day-long tense situation. However, a group of the charged protesters managed to reach the Club Chowk where they staged a sit in.
There were reports that the Young Doctors Association Punjab led the Monday’s rally and intensified agitation when the health department terminated and transferred many young medics for instigating the employees of the state-run hospitals for the strike in the outpatient departments (OPDs). YDA Punjab chairman Dr Salman Haseeb and president Dr Shoaib Niazi were also among them who faced terminations and transfers made by the health department.
Following Monday’s tense situation, the YDA Punjab banned the entry of the police personnel to all the government hospitals across the province. It also announced to postpone all kinds of surgeries of the patients and warned to go on strike in the indoor wards of the public hospitals of Punjab.
There were reports that the GHA postponed the agitation at the Club Chowk and reached back to the Charing Cross after Monday evening.
The YDA Punjab president has given a 48 hours deadline to the government to start negotiations with the employees protesting against outsourcing of the state-run hospitals. If the negotiations do not start, the employees would close down all the indoor wards of the public sector hospitals across the province.
Talking to the media persons late on Monday, Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique alleged that the employees of the government hospitals took the law into their hands, used knives and sharp surgical equipment to attack the police.
He said that the young doctors turned violent rather than being peaceful and used the women employees of the hospitals as shields to reach the high-security zone area, which was declared sensitive by the law enforcement agencies following the movement of the international cricketers playing the PSL in Lahore.
After the threats of the YDA, the health minister announced that the professors would run the OPDs from today (Tuesday) as the government would not tolerate interruption of healthcare services to the poor patients.

•  Irfan Siddiqui calls Pahalgam attack ‘false-flag operation’
• Senators warn New Delhi against changes to Indus treaty
ISLAMABAD: The main opposition, PTI, has demanded the release of its incarcerated leader Imran Khan so he can participate in national deliberations on escalating tensions with India in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.
The party also called for an immediate multi-party conference (MPC), with Mr Khan in attendance.
The demands were made in the  Senate on Monday, as lawmakers from both sides of the aisle slammed India for suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and fanning war hysteria following the April 22 attack.
Senator Ali Zafar, PTI’s parliamentary leader in the Senate, said political differences should be set aside for an issue of national importance.
He noted that a multi-party conference was the only “correct thing to do in the present circumstances”.
If Mr Khan is allowed to attend such a meeting, Mr Zafar said it would send a signal across the world that Pakistan is united and make the country’s case stronger.
He also criticised Indian PM Narendra Modi’s government and its “Nazi mentality” for fal­sely accusing Pakistan — which is itself a victim of terrorism.
“I want to tell the world that this is a blatant and baseless lie motivated by malice.”
He added New Delhi has a “habit of levelling such allegations” and also called the Indian government an “expert in carrying out false flag operations”.
PTI Senator Shibli Faraz said Mr Khan should be allowed to appear on TV to give a call to people for a public gathering at Minar-i-Pakistan and a march toward the Wagah border with India.
Mr Faraz, the opposition leader in Senate, expressed confidence that “over ten million people” will gather on Mr Khan’s call.
“Only a true representative of the people can give a strong message to India,” he said, warning the enemy “takes advantage of political instability”.
He demanded the release of all “political prisoners” and doing away with the practice of filing false cases against political opponents.
’False-flag operation ’
PML-N Senator Irfanul Haq Siddiqui said the Pahalgam incident was a “false flag operation carried out by the Indian authorities to defame Pakistan”.
 
 

He said India routinely accused Pakistan without any investigation or evidence. “India accused Pakistan within minutes of the Pahalgam incident, but the international community refused to accept their false narrative.”
Senator Siddiqui also raised critical questions about the security situation in India-held Kashmir.
He questioned how a major terrorist attack took place despite the “presence of army checkpoints at every corner and the deployment of one Indian soldier for every seven Kashmiris”.
Mr Siddiqui warned India against carrying out any attack in Pakistan, saying the people were “fully prepared and united to defend the motherland” despite internal political differences.
 


The PML-N senator also referred to growing internal dissent within India, noting that voices from within the country were now questioning PM Modi’s handling of the situation.
The BAP parliamentary leader in the Senate said the Pahalgam attack, which took place in an area with high military presence “clearly exposed that it was a false flag operation”.
He said India was involved in target killings in different countries and was responsible for various terrorist attacks inside Pakistan and there was “irrefutable evidence” of Indian funding to outlawed groups BLA and TTP.
Suspension of IWT
Talking about India’s move to suspend the IWT, Mr Siddiqui said New Delhi cannot unilaterally terminate the agreement.
“The Indus Waters Treaty involves the World Bank as an arbitrator along with several other international institutions. India cannot simply walk away from its obligations,” he stressed.
Senator Zafar of PTI also agreed with Mr Siddiqui saying that India has no right to unilaterally suspend, amend or cancel the treaty.
Mr Zafar, who is also a constitutional expert, said any such action by the Modi government will be “illegal and against the principles of international law”.
He said the announcement by India to suspend the treaty had no legal effect and Pakistan has rejected it.
Calling water a “basic human right”, he warned India that any disruption to the water flows of Pakistan would be “an act of war”.
“We will fight for each drop of water till the last drop of our blood.”
