The country was granted GSP+ status by the EU in 2014, resulting in a 108 per cent increase in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs. In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP+ status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan.

 

A seven-member EU delegation is currently visiting Karachi as part of the fifth Biennial Review of the GSP+ scheme. It is led by Sirgio Baliberia, adviser to the GSP+ Directorate in the Directorate General for Trade. The monitoring mission will scrutinise Pakistan’s record on 27 international conventions tied to the trade scheme. Maintaining GSP+ status is critical for Pakistan to keep export costs low.
A press release issued by the human rights ministry today said Human Rights and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar welcomed the delegation at its headquarters today.
“Pakistan reaffirmed its strong commitment to the GSP+ framework, emphasising that the Pakistan–EU partnership remains central to governance reforms, institutional strengthening, and sustainable development. As one of the largest beneficiaries of GSP+, Pakistan highlighted the programme’s role in advancing human-rights protections and aligning domestic legislation with international standards,” the press release said.
The delegation was briefed on “significant legislative and policy progress” since 2014, including strengthened protective mechanisms for women, children, labour, marginalised groups and people with disabilities.
The Pakistani side reaffirmed its commitment to uphold human rights despite “challenges posed by counter-terrorism and climate change” and institutional advancements were highlighted with the retention of the National Commission for Human Rights’ “A” status under the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions and the continued independent functioning of the National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC) and the National Commission on the Status of Women.
The delegation was also informed that implementation of the National Action Plans on Human Rights and Business and Human Rights was ongoing at the federal and provincial levels.
It was also briefed on key initiatives promoting gender equality, including the National Gender Policy Framework (2022), gender-responsive budgeting and provincial measures.
“Flagship programmes such as the Benazir Income Support Programme, benefiting over 9.1 million women and the Prime Minister’s Women Empowerment Package were highlighted as major drivers of women’s socio-economic inclusion.
“Progress on child rights was emphasised, including the establishment of NCRC, Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Agency and Child Protection Institutes, alongside recent child marriage restraint legislation. Efforts continue to address child labour, online exploitation and out-of-school children,” the press release said.
The Pakistani side further reaffirmed its commitment to freedom of expression and media safety, supported by the National Commission for Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals, and provided updates on sensitive human-rights measures, including reductions in capital offences, implementation of the Mercy Petition Policy, enforcement of the Torture and Custodial Death Act and an over 85 per cent resolution of cases by the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances.
Tarar also underlined the country’s “robust constitutional and legal safeguards”, noting Pakistan’s recent election to the UN Human Rights Council as a “testament to the international community’s confidence in its constructive role”.

 

The press release pointed out that the delegation highlighted “certain areas for further attention” regarding human rights in the country and key issues requiring government action, including the need for strengthened policies, legislation, and robust institutions to effectively fulfil Pakistan’s obligations under the 27 core United Nations conventions.
“The minister reassured the delegation that the government of Pakistan remains fully committed to these obligations and noted that progress achieved to date, ongoing challenges, and future plans would be shared in detail during the delegation’s ongoing visit.
“The minister welcomed the EU’s constructive suggestions on enhancing data integration, inter-provincial coordination, treaty reporting and implementation mechanisms. Pakistan has taken these points on board and is advancing progress through strengthened reporting, provincial engagement and robust monitoring,” it said.
The press release concluded by saying that the ministry officials also commended ongoing EU-Pakistan cooperation under the Huqooq-i-Pakistan Project and reaffirmed its commitment to sustaining GSP+ progress, advancing human rights and promoting an inclusive, rights-based, and sustainable future.
GSP+ status is a special incentive awarded to developing countries to “pursue sustainable development and good governance” in exchange for cutting import duties to zero on two-thirds of the tariff lines of its exports. Governments with this status need to implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labour rights, good governance and the environment.
Pakistan and the EU underlined the importance last week of further deepening trade and investment ties, including through the GSP+ scheme, as a driver for sustainable growth, export diversification, job creation and mutually beneficial economic opportunity.
Earlier that week, EU Ambassador to Pakistan Raimundas Karoblis had said the country needed to “do more” in terms of fulfilling its commitments under the GSP+ scheme ahead of a review.</p><small>2025-11-27 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271907070c8c5c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956540/cinemascope-predatory-behaviour' target='_blank'><strong>CINEMASCOPE : PREDATORY BEHAVIOUR</strong></a><br><p>With Predator: Badlands, director Dan Trachtenberg (of the brilliant 10 Cloverfield Lane) brings one of cinema’s most semi-appealing alien species closer to first-tier status — if not fully, then nearly.
But to make it to the big league, the aliens from the hardcore hunting species, the Yautja (that’s their name) needed a bigger brand and a little mythic scaffolding: the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, the malevolent backbone of the Aliens franchise.
For those to whom these names sound like gobbledygook, here’s the gist: since the first two Predator movies — the wildly popular 1987 original with Arnold Schwarzenegger and the less financially successful 1990 sequel with Danny Glover — the franchise has been in a persistent rut. Despite novel and comic publishers regularly putting Predators on shelves (the Yautja have fought Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, Wolverine and even crossed paths with Archie), the films were sporadic and uneven in terms of their storytelling and lore-making. Predators (2010), starring Adrien Brody, was a moderate success — it made three times its $40 million budget — and The Predator (2018, starring Olivia Munn) was less successful.
For a while, Predators leaned heavily on Aliens for support. The clash has long been a fan favourite, birthed in the comics, spawning two Alien vs Predator (AvP) films — both of which were atrocities, though they were financially successful to a degree. Yet they did little to boost the Yautja’s fortunes at 20th Century Fox.

Although Predator: Badlands is not built on an original premise, it is a superior, familiar story that works

That changed when Trachtenberg arrived with Prey (2022), a Hulu original set in 1719. He followed it with the animated anthology Predator: Killer of Killers (2025), again for Hulu, nudging the Yautja mythos credibility up a notch. Even so, the franchise still needed the Aliens heft.
This brings us to Badlands — a film that wholeheartedly extends itself into the Aliens lore (and not in the janky manner of the AvP movies). Rather than throw Xenomorphs yet again into the fray, Trachtenberg and screenwriter Patrick Aison (who also wrote Prey) bank on another nefarious creation of the Aliens stories: the androids called Synthetics.
Elle Fanning plays the synthetic Thia and her ‘sister’ Tessa. Tessa, pressured by the corporation, is cold and ‘robotic’, while Thia — bubbly and talkative — sits decapitated on a hill, surrounded by plants that fire paralysing darts into a world called Genna, a planet even Yautja fear because it teems with lethal wildlife.
From Genna, the Weyland-Yutani Corp wants Kalisk, the apex predator of this world, which cannot be killed because of its regenerative abilities; the Yautja — especially Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), the runt of the clan — crave it as a warrior’s trophy.

Dek’s father is a ruthless clan leader and though his mission begins as one of redemption and revenge, it gradually becomes one of friendship, with the Yautja strapping the half-decapitated torso of Thia on his back like a backpack (Vikram Baital and Demon Slayer much?) as he braves the treacherous terrain. The two also find a critter companion — named Bud — and become a small clan of sorts.
Badlands, though not built on an original premise, is a superior, familiar story that simply works. Trachtenberg is not a refined director, but his storytelling carries the film well enough through a first half that doesn’t always look visually believable (we finally see the fabled world Yautja Prime, but it lacks visual appeal). The second half is a notable improvement, as the story rumbles toward a feel-good climax.
Badlands leads directly into a sequel — one that brings in another character from Predator lore — and, with the way things have been handled, Trachtenberg and Aison’s sincere approach would be more than welcome.
Released by 20th Century Fox and HKC, Predator: Badlands is rated PG-13 and offers action-science-fiction adventure buffs plenty to appreciate

Former junior world champion Hamza defeated sixth seed David Bernet of Switzerland 3-1 in a 53-minute match to book his spot in Friday’s final.
Hamza, unseeded, took the first set 11-9 before the Swiss fought back 13-11 in the second set. A close third set saw Hamza come out on top 12-10 before dominating the fourth set 11-5.
In the other semi-final, holder Noor Zaman and Nasir Iqbal were battling it out in an all-Pakistan clash.
Second seed Noor won 11-4, 11-0 before Nasir retire hurt.
Noor will be looking to defend his title in Friday’s encounter against Hamza, with the former reaching his highest world ranking of 37 last month.

He made the remarks while addressing the business community in Manama. The premier had arrived in the country’s capital a day earlier and held delegation-level talks with Bahrain’s leadership at Al Qudaibiya Palace.
In his address, PM Shehbaz said that strategic cooperation had existed between the two countries for decades.
Addressing Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, he said: “Pakistan is ready to enhance economic cooperation with Bahrain in the fields of agriculture, information technology, artificial intelligence, financial technology and all other areas where our two countries can really work together, and create synergy through our efforts and our knowledge and our experience and our commitment to support each other.”
He said ties between Islamabad and Manama were based on cultural, religious, mutual respect and trust. These “are the pillars of our relations”, he added.
He termed his recent meetings with Bahrain’s leadership “extremely productive”.







“I am not a visitor here. I have come here to meet my family members, our Bahraini brothers and sisters,” he said.
“This is what our relationship is all about. Now we have to convert these wonderful relations into economic cooperation,” he added.
The premier highlighted that Pakistan possessed a “great youth bulge”.
“Sixty per cent of our population comprises young boys and girls within the [age] bracket of 15 to 30 years,” he said.
He added that the country was “committed” to converting this challenge into an opportunity by empowering the youth and training them in the fields of information technology and artificial intelligence, along with providing vocational and skills training.
“Together with our Bahraini brothers, entrepreneurs, we will create a great momentum in this field,” he said.
“I think this is the time to really catch up because time and tide wait for none,” PM Shehbaz stressed.
He also talked about the Pakistani community in Bahrain. The premier added that in every country he visited, he interacted with Pakistani communities and listened to the “stories of men and women whose love for Pakistan has never faded, even as they have dedicated their talent, loyalty and hard work to the progress of other nations and cultures”.
“The more I learn of these journeys, the more convinced I become that the Pakistani identity is not bound by geography. It is in the hearts of our people wherever they may be. Here in Bahrain, that spirit is visible beyond any ray of doubt,” he emphasised.
PM Shehbaz appreciated the Pakistanis living in Bahrain for their services to both countries.
“You are great ambassadors of Pakistan, and we are very proud of your contribution to Pakistan’s national economic development,” he said.
“Your hard-earned money, valuable remittances amounting to $484 million in the last financial year, is indeed highly appreciated.”







He also expressed gratitude to the Bahraini leadership for its love, affection, and support for the Pakistani diaspora.
PM Shehbaz added that Islamabad offered scale, talent, resources and a growing consumer market that was “strategically located, connecting to the wider region”.
“Combined with Bahrain’s financial expertise, business acumen and global outlook, the potential is huge and enormous,” he said, adding that Pakistan was undergoing a structural transformation, embodying economic reforms, digital modernisation and a decisive push for a private sector-led growth.
“We have cut red tape forever, strengthened our regulations and opened new sectors such as agri-business, information technology, minerals, energy and tourism for long-term partnership,” he highlighted. He added that Pakistan wanted to work with Bahrain and learn from its experience and expertise.
He further mentioned that the Gulf Cooperation Council Free Trade Agreement (GCC FTA) had been “nearly finalised and is expected to be signed soon”.







“This will enhance trade between Pakistan and the GCC countries, particularly with Bahrain,” he said. The premier ended his address by encouraging Bahraini investors interested in collaborating with Pakistan to “let this moment be your launching pad for a bold and meaningful collaboration”.
In a post on X, PM Shehbaz said engaging with Bahraini business leaders was a pleasure and said that there is significant potential in healthcare, energy, tourism and other high-growth sectors.
“Pakistan stands ready to facilitate Bahraini investment and deepen mutually beneficial collaboration,” the PM wrote.







Dar meets Bahrain’s finance minister, discusses economic cooperation
Earlier today, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who is accompanying the premier on his visit, met Bahrain’s Finance Minister Sheikh Salman bin Khalifa Al Khalifa.







In a press release, the Foreign Office said that the two ministers had a “fruitful discussion” that focused on enhancing cooperation in the finance sector.
“Bahrain has made significant progress in fintech and offered to share its expertise with the Pakistani banking sector,” the FO said.
It said that the two ministers discussed avenues of cooperation between the central banks of the two countries.
“The two sides further decided to establish teams of relevant officials to chalk out a roadmap for future collaboration in the fields of finance, banking, commerce and economy,” the FO added.</p><small>2025-11-27 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27131841b4cc8ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957695/death-toll-from-massive-hong-kong-blaze-rises-to-65-with-over-250-missing-police-blame-construction-firm' target='_blank'><strong>Death toll from massive Hong Kong blaze rises to 65, with over 250 missing; police blame construction firm</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from a massive blaze in a Hong Kong apartment complex rose to 65 on Thursday, with over 250 still missing, as police said the fire may have been caused by a “grossly negligent” construction firm using unsafe materials.
Almost a full day after the fire began, firefighters were struggling to reach residents potentially trapped on the upper floors of the Wang Fuk Court housing complex due to intense heat and thick smoke from the blaze that erupted on Wednesday afternoon.
Hong Kong’s government said the death toll from the fire had risen to 65.
The fire had “claimed 65 lives and injured 70 people” by 8pm local time (5pm PKT), a government spokesperson told AFP, citing fire service figures, adding that 10 firefighters had been injured since the blaze broke out yesterday.
The tightly packed complex in the northern Tai Po district has 2,000 apartments in eight blocks that are home to more than 4,600 people in a city struggling with chronic shortages of affordable housing.
“We bought [a place] in this building more than 20 years ago. All of our belongings were in this building, and now that it has all burned like this, what’s left?” asked a 51-year-old resident with the surname Wan.
“There’s nothing left. What are we supposed to do?”



A firefighter was among those killed, with dozens in hospital in critical condition, Hong Kong authorities said on Thursday afternoon. Around 279 people remain uncontactable.
Among the dead was a 37-year-old firefighter, who was found with burns on his face half an hour after losing contact with colleagues, according to the fire service director Andy Yeung.
Earlier in the day, a government spokesman told AFP that 56 people were being treated in hospital. Sixteen were in a critical condition, 24 in a serious condition and 16 were stable.
Eileen Chung, a Hong Kong police superintendent, said 900 residents were spread across eight shelters.
The fire was still burning in the afternoon, more than 24 hours after it started.
Sections of charred scaffolding fell from the burning blocks, and flames could be seen inside apartments, sometimes belching out through windows into the night sky, casting an eerie orange glow on surrounding buildings. An AFP reporter heard loud cracking sounds, possibly from the burning bamboo.

A 65-year-old resident surnamed Yuen said he had lived in the complex for more than four decades and that many of his neighbours were elderly and might not be mobile.
“The windows were closed because of the maintenance, [some people] didn’t know there was a fire and had to be told to evacuate via phone calls by neighbours,” Yuen told AFP. “I’m devastated.”
A woman surnamed Ng, 52, was distraught as she searched for her daughter outside a shelter. “She and her father are still not out yet. They didn’t have water to save our building,” she sobbed, carrying her daughter’s graduation photo.
Authorities said they had brought the blaze in four of seven blocks under control, with operations continuing in three. Bamboo scaffolding is a mainstay of traditional Chinese architecture but has been subject to a phase-out in Hong Kong since March for safety reasons.
Three arrested
Police officers searched the housing estate’s building maintenance company on Thursday morning, seizing documents that mention Wang Fuk Court, local media reported. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
“We have reason to believe that the company’s responsible parties were grossly negligent, which led to this accident and caused the fire to spread uncontrollably, resulting in major casualties,” said police superintendent Chung.
Three men from the construction company, two directors and one engineering consultant, had been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over the fire, she added.
Police said in addition to the buildings being covered with protective mesh sheets and plastic that may not meet fire standards, they discovered some windows on one unaffected building were sealed with a foam material, installed by a construction company carrying out year-long maintenance work.







Indonesia’s foreign ministry said on Thursday that two Indonesian migrant workers “in the domestic sector” died in the fire and two others were injured.
The death toll is now the highest in a Hong Kong fire since 1948, when 176 people were killed in a warehouse blaze. Hong Kong’s corruption body said it has launched an investigation into suspected corruption related to the renovation.
China’s Xi urges ‘all-out’ effort against fire
From the mainland, China’s President Xi Jinping urged an “all-out effort” to extinguish the fire and to minimise casualties and losses, China’s state broadcaster CCTV said.
Xi expressed condolences to the victims, including “the firefighter who died in the line of duty”, according to state media.







Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened at the tragic loss of lives and property.
“Our heartfelt condolences go out to President Xi Jinping and the Chinese nation, particularly the people of Hong Kong on this tragic incident,” he said.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved families, and we wish a speedy recovery to all those injured,” he said.
“Pakistan stands in solidarity with the people and government of China, especially the Hong Kong SAR (special administrative region), during this difficult time. May the affected families find strength and healing. Pakistan and China will always stand together,” he said.







Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also said he was deeply saddened to learn about the “devastating fire”.
“On behalf of the government and people of Pakistan, I extend our deepest condolences and profound sympathy to you, the Hong Kong special administrative region government, and especially to the families of the victims. Our thoughts are with those who have lost their loved ones, and we pray for the swift and complete recovery of the injured,” he said.







Searching for relatives
Harry Cheung, aged 66, who has lived at Block Two in one of the complexes for more than 40 years, said he heard a loud noise at about 2:45pm (11:45am PKT) and saw fire erupt in a nearby block.
“I immediately went back to pack up my things,” he said. “I don’t even know how I feel right now. I’m just thinking about where I’m going to sleep tonight.”

Another long-time resident, a woman surnamed Chu, said she still had not been able to contact her friends who live in the next block. After staying over at a friend’s place on Wednesday night, the 70-year-old came back to see her home still burning.
“We don’t know what to do,” she said.
An online app showed missing persons reports submitted through a linked Google document that detailed residents of individual towers and rooms.
It includes descriptions like “Mother-in-law in her 70s, missing”, or “one boy and one girl”, or “Rooftop: 33-year-old male.” One description simply says “27th floor, room 1: He is dead”.
Reuters could not independently verify the information on the app.
The fire has prompted comparisons to the Grenfell Tower inferno that killed 72 people in London in 2017. That fire was blamed on firms fitting the exterior with flammable cladding, as well as failings by the government and the construction industry.
“Our hearts go out to all those affected by the horrific fire in Hong Kong,” the Grenfell United survivors’ group said on social media. “To the families, friends and communities, we stand with you. You are not alone.”







A Tai Po resident surnamed So, 57, said the fire was “heartbreaking”.
“There’s nothing that can be done about the property. We can only hope that everyone, no matter old or young, can return safely,” So told AFP.
An apartment owner in his 40s who did not want to give his name told AFP that the government needed to help those made homeless by the blaze.
“The fire is not yet under control and I dare not leave, and I don’t know what I can do,” he said.
Residents were seen being evacuated via large coaches, with local media reporting that adjacent blocks were also being cleared. Sections of a nearby highway were also closed by the firefighting operation.
Hong Kong’s sky-high property prices have long been a trigger for social discontent in the city and the fire tragedy could further stoke resentment towards authorities ahead of a city-wide legislative election in early December.

Deadly fires were once a regular scourge in Hong Kong, especially in poorer neighbourhoods. However, safety measures have been ramped up in recent decades and such fires have become much less commonplace.
Wang Fuk Court is one of many high-rise housing complexes in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated areas in the world. Tai Po, located near the border with mainland China, is an established suburban district with some 300,000 residents.
Occupied since 1983, the complex is under the government’s subsidised home ownership scheme, according to property agency websites. According to online posts, it has been undergoing renovations for a year at a cost of HK$330 million ($42.43m), with each unit paying between HK$160,000 and HK$180,000.</p><small>2025-11-27 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635954-corruption-weak-institutions-pakistan-to-resolve-imf-identified-gaps-aurangzeb' target='_blank'><strong>'Corruption, weak institutions': Pakistan to resolve IMF-identified gaps: Aurangzeb</strong></a><br><p>

On Sunday, Singh said that “civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India”, and that “who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again”. His words were strongly rebuked by the Foreign Office as “dangerously revisionist remarks” that revealed an expansionist Hindutva mindset.
The Sindh Assembly unanimously passed a resolution today, stating that the House “unequivocally condemns the Defence Minister of India’s statement as delusional, inflammatory, and a deliberate distortion of history, made in violation of diplomatic norms and international law”.
The resolution, moved by Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla, said the assembly asserted “with absolute clarity that Sindh is, and will forever remain, an inseparable and integral part” of Pakistan, and rejected any narrative, however absurd, which suggested otherwise.







The lawmakers rejected “with full force all revisionist, expansionist, and politically motivated claims emanating from India that attempt to rewrite the history of Sindh, Pakistan, or the movement for independence”.
It further condemned the extremist policies of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government that “threaten regional peace, undermine civilisational heritage, weaponise water resources, and endanger the environmental security of millions”.
The resolution also called upon the government to “pursue decisive diplomatic, legal, and multilateral action to protect the Indus River, defend Pakistan’s rights under international treaties, and hold India accountable for violations of water, environmental, or humanitarian norms”.
New Delhi unilaterally held the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance in April this year based on unsubstantiated claims regarding the Pahalgam attack, which were strongly refuted by Islamabad. A Sydney-based think-tank warned last month that India could manipulate river flows in the near term, presenting an “acute” danger for Pakistan.

 

In its resolution, the House expressed “firm solidarity with all communities, within Pakistan and across India, who respect the sanctity of the Indus, reject extremism and revisionism, and uphold the principles of justice, coexistence, and peace”.
The resolution presented by Chawla noted that Sindh was an “ancient civilisation with its own enduring identity, culture, a political consciousness, rooted in history far older and deeper than any modern state”.
It highlighted that the “people of Sindh, asserting their right to autonomy and dignity, chose in 1936 to separate from the Bombay Presidency, long before the creation of Pakistan, thereby demonstrating a clear and unequivocal will for self-governance”.
“Sindh was the first province to adopt the historic resolution in favour of the creation of Pakistan, playing a decisive and irreplaceable role in the establishment of the nation envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,” it stated.

 

The House described statements made by senior members of the Modi government as not only “historically baseless but also reflect a reckless, provocative, and revisionist agenda aimed at distorting facts and destabilising the region”.
“The people of Sindh, the people of Pakistan, and all fair-minded citizens of India reject such destructive policies and recognise the Indus as a sacred, life-giving artery of our collective civilisation,” it added.
The resolution stated: “The Modi government has overseen the gravest aggression against the Indus River in recorded history — an act that constitutes a violation of international laws and a breach of the Indus Waters Treaty, and an assault on the very ecological civilisational foundations of South Asia.
“An attack on the Indus River is an attack on a shared civilisation and millions of livelihoods, and on the cultural and environmental heritage that binds the region together,” it added.
The National Assembly later passed a similar resolution by PPP MNA Asad Alam Niazi denouncing the remarks.
“These statements are historically incorrect, politically irresponsible and contrary to the recognised geopolitical realities of the Indo-Pak region. The House reaffirms that Sindh is an integral part of the sovereign State of Pakistan and urges all individuals and institutions to refrain from making misleading, biased and destabilising statements,” it reads.







CM Murad urges Centre to raise issue on int’l level
During the assembly session, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah delivered a strong speech, condemning Singh’s statements and demanding that the federal government raise the issue at the international level.
“We demand from the Centre through this resolution that the Government of Pakistan raise this matter before the world,” he said.
“The Government of Pakistan should send this resolution to the world and tell them that India wants to occupy the Sindh River,” the chief minister added.

 

Reaffirming the province’s loyalty, he declared: “Sindh is a part of Pakistan and will always remain so, and its boundaries can not be changed.”
CM Murad stressed that the international community must be informed of India’s aggressive actions and statements. Following his speech, the resolution against the Indian defence minister’s remarks was unanimously approved by the Sindh Assembly.
The chief minister labelled Singh as panicked. “He is suffering from a state of perplexity. India’s panic began after [a specified event].
“The Indian defence minister was born in Uttar Pradesh. He has never drunk the water of Sindhu (Indus), and that is why his mind is corrupted,” Murad quipped, accusing India of attempting to weaponise the river.







Emphasising the historical and cultural significance of Sindh, the chief minister said, “The impression given by the defence minister of India is deplorable.”
He highlighted Sindh’s ancient history, noting its existence even before the Common Era. “The resolution that was presented narrates the entire history,” he pointed out. “Multan and Makran were included in the ancient maps of Sindh,” he added.
CM Murad highlighted the contributions of Sindhi leaders to the nation’s founding. “The Muslim League Sindh Chapter presented the Pakistan Resolution,” he said, adding that Pakistan was formed “due to the sacrifices of our elders”.

Judge Afzal Majoka, who has been presiding over the case’s proceedings, too, was also seemingly unaware of the finalisation of the appointment of the new counsel when Advocate Taimur Janjua showed up in the Islamabad district and sessions court instead of Advocate Shakeel Jatt.
Advocate Jatt, who attended the case’s hearing as Imaan and Hadi’s court-appointed defence counsel for the first time on Tuesday, had previously refused to cross-examine the prosecution’s witnesses, saying that he could not “ask questions dictated” to him.
“I am in favour of a fair trial. I cannot ask questions that are dictated [to me]. My conscience does not allow this,” he had said. The counsel had alleged without sharing any specific details that he had “received 15 questions with the instructions that he should ask them during the cross-examination”.
Advocate Jatt had also sought more time from the court to prepare for the case, but Advocate Janjua showed up at the hearing today to represent Imaan and Hadi.
When he informed the court that he had been appointed as the couple’s counsel, Judge Majoka said the court had not yet received a notification in this regard.
A three-member prosecution team present at the hearing assured the court that the relevant notification would be submitted.
For her part, Mazari objected to the change, questioning who had made the new appointment and through what process. She also raised concerns over the “disappearance” of Advocate Jatt.
Mazari contended that she or Chattha had not expressed any lack of confidence in Advocate Jatt and requested the court to record their statements on the matter.
She further raised doubts over an application said to be submitted by Advocate Jatt for his removal as the duo’s lawyer. Moreover, she questioned why the court had not objected to the disclosures made by Advocate Jatt at the previous hearing.
After the court provided a copy of Advocate Jatt’s application to Chattha, the latter requested the judge to summon the lawyer. He also contended the defence had “not rejected” the counsel.
However, the prosecution objected to Chattha’s request, arguing that “while a sessions judge is the appropriate authority to summon a state-appointed counsel, the court hearing the case is not the relevant forum for such an action”.
The proceedings were suspended for a while after Mazari and Chattha requested for time to consult the newly appointed counsel. Judge Majoka accepted their request and granted them time until 1:30pm.
Earlier in the day, the court had suspended the proceedings twice, first until 10 am and later until 11 am, awaiting the appearance of the accused and a clarification about the appointment of a counsel for them.
An order from the office of the Islamabad west district and sessions judge regarding the appointment, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states: “Consequent upon the request made by Mr Muhammad Afzal Majoka, additional sessions judge Islamabad west, for the appointment of a defence counsel at state expenses, for Hadi Ali Chattha and Imaan Zainab Mazari accused […] Muhammad Taimoor Janjua is appointed as the defence counsel on state expenses.”
The proceedings were resumed after Mazari and Chattha held a meeting with Advocate Janjua. In a joint statement recorded before the court, the couple claimed that the new counsel was not following their instructions and that they did not trust him.
For his part, Advocate Janjua denied compelling them to follow any directions of his, saying that he only acted under the court’s instructions.
Chattha also filed an acquittal application during the hearing, urging the court to hear his arguments before calling the witnesses for cross-examination.
In his arguments, Chattha maintained that the first information report (FIR) registered in the case with the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) was based on a “flawed source report”.
He alleged that the FIR was based on a source report that did not comply with legal requirements, and that screenshots submitted by the prosecution as evidence were taken from different devices and then combined to form a single image.
No mobile device had been seized, and no verification was obtained from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, he argued.
Moreover, the FIR was registered 22 days after the date visible in the timestamps in the screenshots, he further alleged.
Chattha also read out complainant Shehroz Riaz’s statement in the court.
He contended that the entire case was based on “just two Twitter accounts and a single report”. The NCCIA’s procedure for the registration of the FIR was not followed, he claimed, urging the court to accept his acquittal application.
The case against Imaan and Chattha has been registered with the NCCIA on accusations of attempting to incite divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and of creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country in the case.
The two were indicted in the case on October 30, a day after the latter was arrested outside the courtroom over non-appearance. Mazari said that there was video evidence of his presence both “inside and outside the courtroom”.
Speaking to reporters after his release, Chattha had maintained that he had appeared in court five minutes ahead of time for the proceedings on October 29, but the judge had issued an arrest warrant “to his face”.
Before Tuesday’s hearing, Mazari had also alleged that the court had “forcibly appointed [a] state defence counsel” for her and Chattha.</p><small>2025-11-27 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27171216e5bce35.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957717/kp-cm-afridi-stages-sit-in-after-being-denied-meeting-with-imran-for-eighth-time' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi stages sit-in after being denied meeting with Imran for eighth time</strong></a><br><p>After being denied a meeting with PTI founder Imran Khan for the eighth time, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi staged a sit-in at Factory Naka, near Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail on Thursday.
CM Afridi was also denied a meeting with Imran at the jail last Friday. Speaking to reporters, he stated that it was unfortunate that, despite having orders from the Islamabad High Court (IHC), he was not permitted to meet the patron-in-chief of his party. He added that he wrote to the chief justice but received no response regarding the issue.
The CM and party supporters originally intended to march to the prison, where Imran is incarcerated, but were stopped by a heavy contingent of police personnel at Factory Naka.
The CM offered prayers at the sit-in, which were led by Punjab lawmaker Hafiz Farhat Abbas.
Speaking to reporters earlier today, Afridi said that police had stopped him this afternoon at Factory Naka, near the jail. This is the same area where the party staged a sit-in after being denied a meeting with Imran earlier this week.
“I told the police that I was stopped last time, and I am also being stopped this time,” CM Afridi said. “I told them, ‘If you stop me, then tell me why you are defying court orders in writing.’ They did not give me a reason.”

The KP CM added that the situation is “worsening” and questioned why the authorities are not complying with court orders.
“A province is being treated like a stepmother,” CM Afridi remarked. “If the representative of 25 million people is being treated like this, then it is not a good thing.
“Would you like it if it happened to someone else in another province tomorrow?”
The CM added that nobody was allowed to meet the PTI founder, be it his sisters, doctors, lawyers or party leadership.
“These people (authorities) need to decide who they are standing with. If they continue with this attitude, then we will take a final option,” he said, not elaborating on the “final option” itself.







PTI concerned about Imran’s health
The PTI expressed concern over Imran’s health while incarcerated, as he has been barred from seeing his family and lawyers for over three weeks.
Former PM’s aide Zulfi Bukhari said no one has seen Imran since November 4 and no reason has been given for denying meetings.
“His health is our concern. We are worried about his illegal isolation,” Bukhari told Reuters, demanding the government give Imran’s family immediate access to him.
A jail official told Reuters that the former premier was in good health and that he was not aware of any plans to move him to any other facility. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.</p><small>2025-11-27 13:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/27151134f553f20.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957710/50pc-of-afghans-travelling-abroad-used-pakistani-passports-senator' target='_blank'><strong>50pc of Afghans travelling abroad used Pakistani passports: senator</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Pakistan (JUI-P) Senator Attaul Haq on Thursday stated that Afghans with Pakistani passports travel abroad and if they engage in crime, it reflects badly on Islamabad.
Speaking during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, he said, “Fifty per cent of Afghans travel abroad using Pakistani passports. Whenever Afghans are caught by authorities abroad, they are carrying Pakistani passports.”
An official from the interior ministry acknowledged that this had occurred, but assured the committee that the practice had stopped.
“In the past, when people were deported from Saudi Arabia, it was found that deportees were Afghan citizens carrying Pakistani passports.”
Earlier today, the committee condemned Justice Ali Baqar Najafi’s remarks in the Noor Mukadam case that surfaced a day earlier, deeming them “ridiculous”.
Justice Najafi, who is now part of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), observed that the Noor Mukadam case was the direct result of a “vice” spreading in society known as “living relationship”. It appeared the judge was referring to a live-in relationship, where two unmarried individuals in a romantic relationship cohabitate.
In a meeting today, the committee questioned what “would happen to the conviction rate in cases against women, which is already shameful, if a judge himself has made such remarks.”
The committee summoned advocate generals, prosecutor generals, police officials and all relevant authorities due to the low conviction rate.
Conviction rate in cases of gender-based violence (GBV) is reportedly as low as 1.2 per cent due to weak prosecution and judicial delays.
Women’s rights advocates say there is also no centralised GBV database, hindering data analysis. Furthermore, due to resource constraints, shelters and crisis centres, GBV courts, police protection cells, and the like are underfunded.
Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at the Islamabad residence of Zahir Zakir Jaffer in July 2021. In May, a three-judge Supreme Court bench, led by Justice Hashim Kakar and including Justices Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Najafi, had upheld the death sentence awarded to Zahir, who was convicted by an Islamabad trial court in 2022.
Last month, the apex court had taken up Zakir’s review petition challenging the capital punishment awarded to him. During the hearing, Justice Najafi told senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the convict, that it would be more appropriate for him to start arguments after going through the additional note he had not yet issued at the time.
Later, Justice Najafi was sworn in as a judge of the FCC, established earlier this month after the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
In an additional note on the Noor murder case, which was uploaded on the SC website on Wednesday, Justice Najafi upheld the sentence handed to Zahir and observed that “the present case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know as ‘living relationship’ [sic]”.
He stressed that such relationships ignored “societal compulsions” and “defy not only the law of the land but also the personal law” under Sharia.
The judge’s observations, which surfaced just a day after the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, also triggered criticism from many on social media, including lawyers and journalists.

The ruling PML-N secured close to 64 per cent of the total votes polled in the by-elections for six National Assembly constituencies held on Sunday as it emerged victorious on all seats. Five constituencies were located in Punjab and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These seats, except for one, were vacated due to the disqualification of the opposition PTI MNAs.
The PML-N also won six out of seven Punjab Assembly seats in the province by securing 82.41pc of the polled votes. On the seventh seat, it had not fielded its candidate in PP-269, Muzaffargarh, against PPP nominee Alamdar Qureshi.
The ECP notified the following PML-N members as MNAs: Mahmood Qadir Khan for NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-II), Mohammad Nauman for NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), Muhammad Tufail for NA-143 (Sahiwal-III), Danyal Ahmad for NA-104 (Faisalabad-X) and Babar Nawaz for NA-18 (Haripur).
Excluding Nawaz, the four were later administered their oath by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq as the assembly’s 22nd session commenced.







Meanwhile, PPP’s Qureshi was notified for PP-269 (Muzaffargarh-II) and PML-N’s Sultan Ali Ranjha for PP-73 (Sargodha-III), Ali Haider Noor Khan Niazi for PP-87 (Mianwali-III), Azad Ali Tabassum for PP-98 (Faisalabad-I), Tahir Pervaiz for PP-115 (Faisalabad-XVIII), Ahmad Shehryar for PP-116 (Faisalabad-XIX) and Muhammad Hanif for PP-203 (Sahiwal-VI).
Meanwhile, for NA-96, ECP spokesperson Duriya Amir said: “Notification of the success of the successful candidate from NA-96 Faisalabad has been stopped. A code of conduct case is pending in the election commission against Talal Chaudhry and Bilal Chaudhry.”
The ECP had decided on Monday to withhold Bilal’s victory notification over the minister’s alleged violation of the code of conduct.
A four-member bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja took up the case for hearing. The state minister, who had been summoned, did not turn up. During the hearing, the bench observed that the state minister clearly violated the code of conduct.
It was emphasised that, as per the code, the minister was not authorised to participate in any election campaign and that strict action should be taken ag­­ainst him. The CEC rem­arked that Talal did not even bother to appear before the bench.
In response, the minister’s lawyer said that his client would appear before the commission. Later, the Election Commission exempted him from attendance for the first hearing. The CEC clarified that Bilal Chaudhry was not being disqualified; only the notification of his victory would be withheld. The hearing was adjourned till December 2.
By-poll performance
The PML-N had bagged 564,400 votes out of a total 883,108 or 63.91pc of the votes cast for the six National Assembly seats. In a surprising outcome, the PML-N also snatched from the PTI the NA-18 seat (Haripur, KP) against all expectations.
Political analysts had been hoping that at least this seat would be retained by the PTI because of certain factors, including the fact that KP is being ruled by the PTI, so there were minimal chances of rigging in the constituency.
“Now the PPP cannot blackmail the PML-N for the passage of the annual federal budget,” Dr Rashid Ahmad Khan, former head of Punjab University’s Political Science Department, had told Dawn, referring to the simple majority the PML-N would attain in the National Assembly after grabbing the six NA seats.
Discussing the factors about the defeat of the PTI in NA-18, he said the voters were alienated, believing that when their ballots were not “honoured” in the 2024 general elections, it would serve no purpose this time either. Also, it became clear that the PTI leadership without Imran Khan was unable to mobilise supporters, he added.
Endorsing his views, Pakistan Study Centre Director Dr Amjad Magsi had said that the PTI leadership was not clear-headed and failed to fully run the election campaign, while the lack of its traditional election symbol also played a role in the defeat. He said the turnout in the by-elections was low due to disappointment among the PTI supporters.</p><small>2025-11-27 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271538592f03306.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957713/uae-not-issuing-visas-to-pakistanis-interior-ministry-official-tells-senate-body' target='_blank'><strong>UAE not issuing visas to Pakistanis, interior ministry official tells Senate body</strong></a><br><p>Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry said on Thursday that the United Arab Emirates had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.
The secretary made this revelation during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, further stating that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” he warned.
The official said that currently, the UAE was only issuing visas to blue and diplomatic passport holders.
Separately, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who heads the Senate committee on human rights, also confirmed that the interior ministry official’s remarks to Dawn. She said the bar was attributed to concerns about people travelling to the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.
The committee was told that the UAE was not issuing visas to Pakistanis and that very few had been issued in the recent past “after much difficulty”, she said.
UAE envoy shares steps to facilitate visa processing
On the other hand, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M. Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi shared “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis” with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb today, the latter’s ministry said.
The reforms discussed during their meeting in Islamabad included online visa processing, e-visas without passport stamping, and faster system-to-system linkages, the finance ministry said on X.
Nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, the statement added, further outlining reforms shared by the envoy.







Ambassador Al Zaabi emphasised boosting bilateral cooperation in trade, investment and cultural ties, while “appreciating the longstanding contributions of Pakistanis working in the UAE”.
Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen the fraternal, strategic, and economic partnership between their countries, the statement said.
They also reviewed ongoing defence cooperation and agreed to continue working closely to unlock new opportunities in trade, investment, technology, people-to-people ties and other areas, it added.
Past UAE visa issues
Visa rejections were also faced by Pakistani citizens in early July, which prompted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to raise the issue with his UAE counterpart.
In a meeting on July 11, UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens as the Pakistani minister sought “relaxation in visa policies”.
In April, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa.

 

This came after the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, in January, was told that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”.
Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig had said the above, adding that the UAE government had reservations that Pakistanis on “visit visas, not work visas”, resort to begging in the country.
However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the Gulf country.</p><small>2025-11-27 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635924-cm-afridi-says-weighing-last-option-to-secure-meeting-with-imran' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi says weighing 'last option' to secure meeting with Imran</strong></a><br><p>

In many countries, the rule of law is becoming rule by law, with executive priorities dictating legislative action and overriding judicial checks on government regulation of the internet, enabling widespread abuses that impact freedom of expression, privacy, and due process, among other fundamental rights..
In particular, expanded government authority and the aggressive online surveillance it enables are being coded into laws and public policies, allowing governments to overreach the garb of legality and require compliance by domestic and foreign internet service providers (ISPs) — is typically tied to the State’s deployment of intrusive tech tools to monitor and access user communications and data, usually without public oversight.
Pakistan’s track record is no better; in fact, the country’s trajectory is a troubling example of this trend. From the deployment of a national “firewall” in recent years to the discovery of a “Lawful Intercept Management System”, user data and citizen privacy remain hostage to political ambitions and corporate collusion.



The upsurge in the use of these surveillance technologies has raised alarms about the erosion of privacy and the weakening of democratic norms. The Pegasus Project, for one, unveiled how governments — particularly authoritarian regimes — employ sophisticated spyware to infiltrate devices of journalists, activists, and political adversaries, extracting sensitive information without consent.
The Pegasus spyware can gather data, record video and audio, take screenshots and track location, all without the user’s knowledge. The infection occurs silently, without the target ever clicking on a link or answering a call. As of 2021, The Guardian reported that the technology had been sold to 40 governments around the world, ostensibly to combat terrorism and crime, though forensic analyses cast doubt on these justifications.
This was the same year the Pegasus Project revealed India as one of several countries utilising the spyware and released surveillance lists containing identities of prominent persons who were targeted. The data collected was not disaggregated, and individual searches were therefore not attributable to specific countries; nor could it be said with certainty whether any particular hack was successful.
Nevertheless, thousands of Indian citizens appeared on the surveillance list, including ministers, opposition leaders, journalists and activists. The surveillance list also included hundreds of Pakistani phone numbers, including one belonging to former prime minister Imran Khan.
Pakistan’s track record is no better. A 2013 report by Citizen Lab revealed the presence of command-and-control servers for FinFisher — a commercial network intrusion malware capable of intercepting communications, accessing private data, and recording audio and video from computers or mobile devices — in Pakistan. The server was employed on a network owned by the Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL), a now-privatised state-owned entity, with 62 per cent government shareholding.
Mass network surveillance has existed in Pakistan since at least 2005, with spying technologies obtained from both domestic and international companies, including Alcatel, Ericsson, SS8 and Utimaco, revealed a 2015 report by Privacy International.
It also documented Pakistan’s consistent cooperation with the US National Security Agency (NSA), exposing its participation in the NSA’s Fairview Program and SKYNET initiative. Pakistan has featured strongly in the NSA’s Fairview Program, which involves the mass surveillance of individuals within and outside the US, facilitated by a ‘highly collaborative’ partnership with AT&T, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the US.
The SKYNET programme, which algorithmises terrorist detection by harvesting cellular metadata from Pakistani telecom service providers, was used to identify thousands of alleged ‘extremists’ in Pakistan between 2004 and 2016, who were later killed through drone strikes.
In 2019, The Guardian reported that at least two dozen Pakistani government officials had been targeted using Israeli spyware, alongside lawyers, journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, and diplomats. The malware reportedly exploited a vulnerability in WhatsApp, allowing operators to access encrypted messages and other sensitive data on the targets’ devices.
While these attacks were not initially credited to Pakistani authorities, in 2023, Israeli newspaper Haaretz reported that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and various police units in Pakistan have been using the software since at least 2012. Local officials later confirmed that the spyware — a dated version of Israeli company Cellebrite’s Universal Forensics Extraction Device (UFED) — had been acquired indirectly, through foreign agents, despite the lack of diplomatic ties between the countries.
Around the same time, it was further revealed that Pakistan acquired the services of a controversial Canada-based company, Sandvine, through an $18.5 million contract, to help build a nationwide ‘web monitoring system’. This system would use Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to monitor communications, as well as measure and record traffic and call data, on behalf of the country’s national telecommunications regulator, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).
This was seemingly pursuant to the Monitoring and Reconciliation of Telephony Traffic Regulations, 2010, issued by the PTA, which alleged that it discontinued its use of DPI services in mid-2023.
In 2024, Pakistan tested a national internet ‘firewall’, using Chinese technology, which allowed the government to bolster its web monitoring capabilities and regulate the use of popular platforms by blocking specific features within an app or a website. It was deployed at the country’s main internet gateways, as well as the data centres of mobile service and major internet service providers, and triggered numerous complaints of poor internet connectivity.

 

The Lawful Intercept Management System (LIMS) is yet another surveillance mechanism employed by the Pakistani state, and can be used to retrieve the unencrypted data of any consumer, eavesdrop on their calls, and read text messages. The tool recently came to light, following a series of leaked audios which resulted in litigation before the Islamabad High Court, and revealed a growing trend of politicised intrusion that now threatens the independence and integrity of key institutions, including that of the judiciary.

In a turbulent political and legal climate such as that of Pakistan, the impact of leaked audios is immediate, driven by a widespread presumption of truth.

They possess the power to coerce, damage reputations, and shape public narratives well before the facts come to light. By the time clarity emerges, the damage is done — hardened public opinion, suffered reputations. The perpetrators, on the other hand, remain elusive, while societal pressure descends upon the latest target.
To highlight the far-reaching consequences of such breaches of privacy, we explored a selection of audio leaks that have surfaced since 2022, implicating an array of influentials, including politicians and judges. By examining the legal, social, and political fallout of these audio leaks, we seek to establish how this strategically disseminated information functions not only as a tool of public embarrassment but as a means to exert pressure, undermine credibility, and influence institutional conduct and decision-making.
It also outlines the glaring shortcomings in the domestic legal framework that enable such intrusions, offering no meaningful recourse, with an aim to highlight the evolving risks posed to democratic accountability and judicial independence in an age where state surveillance operates with little transparency and even less restraint.
While this article is rooted in the Pakistani experience, its relevance transcends national borders. The tactics, technologies, and political incentives behind the weaponisation of data are not unique to any one country — they reflect a global trend in which digital surveillance, audio manipulation, and leak-driven smear campaigns are increasingly deployed to shape public perception and suppress dissent.
As democratic institutions around the world grapple with declining public trust and as constitutional frameworks struggle to keep pace with technological advancement, the Pakistani example serves as a cautionary tale. It emphasises the urgent need for international scrutiny, effective legal safeguards, and civic vigilance to protect the integrity of judicial systems, political discourse, and the private lives of citizens before fundamental freedoms become (fundamentally) fiction.
Here, we focus on a set of audio leaks that resulted in litigation before the Islamabad High Court (IHC), in what is commonly known as the ‘Audio Leaks Case’. It was a case that laid bare the state’s ability to undertake mass surveillance of citizens through LIMS and brought to the fore flaws in the domestic legal framework that enable the misuse of such spying technologies.
The revelations made during the case have reinforced long-standing suspicions of institutional manipulation and state complicity, heightening concerns over the integrity and independence of Pakistan’s democratic institutions, including the judiciary. The potential impact of such reputational warfare, both on the individual and institutional level, is evident from the aftermath of the numerous audio leaks surfacing in recent years, involving judges, politicians, and private individuals — many of whom are either directly affiliated with the PTI or perceived to be aligned with Imran’s political camp.
Once installed, the LIMS enabled the interception of consumer data by allowing designated agencies to directly tap into the network of service providers — which is done with just a click of a button — by initiating a track and trace request using a unique SIM, IMEI or MSISDN number associated with the consumer’s device. The subsequent process was then entirely automatic, with the SMS, CDRs and metadata associated with the consumer being reported into a monitoring centre established at the surveillance centre.
Through another server, the entire content of the consumer’s communications routed through the telecommunications service provider (TSP) — including audio, video and search histories — would be transmitted to this monitoring centre, and stored. Any encrypted material, generated from applications such as WhatsApp, that formed part of the transmitted data would also be shared. And while the LIMS itself could not automatically decrypt such data, requests for decryption could be made to the company owning the relevant application.
Moreover, TSPs were required to ensure that up to 2pc of their entire consumer base could be surveilled through the LIMS. The TSPs reiterated that they had no way to monitor which consumers were being surveilled. The designated agencies could therefore access the LIMS, a mass surveillance system exposing the data of over four million citizens, without any supervision, oversight or control.
In its consequent order — issued on June 25, 2024 — the IHC noted how, throughout the proceedings, the federal government, its divisions, law enforcement agencies, and the intelligence agencies denied that any agency or entity had been authorised to undertake surveillance pursuant to the Pakistan Telecommunication (Re-organization) Act, 1996 (PTRA), Investigation for Fair Trial Act, 2013 (IFTA), and/or the Telegraph Act — the only laws providing for lawful interception — or that any rules had been made for this purpose.

 

The court found that this gave rise to one of two possibilities: either the state, through its investigative and intelligence agencies, never deemed it necessary to conduct surveillance for any legitimate state purpose and therefore did not do so; alternatively, that these agencies do, in fact, engage in surveillance, albeit unlawfully, without any legal authority or oversight.
It referenced numerous instances of audio leaks, beyond the subject audios, in the recent past, including the leaks referenced earlier in this article. From this, the IHC stated it could be logically deduced that there are surveillance mechanisms in place, and in use, enabling the recording of the highest executive, legislative and judicial officeholders of the country.
The court further observed that this was both “frightening and damning for a rule of law democracy functioning under the Constitution”, noting that Article 14 guarantees the right to privacy, whereas the right to life and liberty under Article 9 also includes the right of citizens to be left alone in their private spheres. The freedom of speech, guaranteed under Article 19, also includes the freedom to speak freely, without the state prying into the conversation.
However, these constitutional guarantees had been undermined through the mass surveillance of citizens in Pakistan without any constitutional or legal backing or judicial oversight. Justice Babar Sattar of the IHC — who heard the case among other judges — likened this to George Orwell’s book 1984, observing that the mass surveillance system seemed to be inspired by the dystopian novel.
While it appears that the federal government and its extensions, including the law enforcement and intelligence agencies, may have succeeded in evading accountability this time, it is nevertheless important to examine the rather suspect claims made in the process and chart a course that leads to true progress.
The positions taken by the Pakistani government are not without precedent; rather, they reflect a broader global pattern, transcending the issue of surveillance, wherein national security imperatives are invoked to deflect scrutiny with respect to the use of broad discretionary powers, often at the cost of constitutional freedoms. This moment, therefore, offers a critical opportunity for all democratic societies to reflect more seriously on the legal and institutional safeguards we must advocate for to ensure that such powers are not exercised in ways that violate fundamental freedoms.
In Pakistan’s case, the federal government contends that it lacks the technological capability to surveil citizens, or to identify those doing so, and has not authorised any agency or body for this purpose. The contention is, however, clearly contradicted by publicly available data, such as Privacy International’s comprehensive special report on security and surveillance in Pakistan, which reveals that the country not only possesses a wealth of surveillance technologies but has also actively facilitated local intelligence agencies and foreign states in surveilling its own citizens.
And while it is acknowledged that the mere existence of surveillance capability does not, on its own, prove culpability, it does raise urgent questions about oversight, access controls, and the potential for abuse, whether by rogue officials, ‘hostile agencies’, or state institutions themselves.
In any jurisdiction, the unchecked capacity to collect and retain personal data opens the door to misuse, even when deployed to meet admittedly legitimate objectives, such as national security or criminal justice. Following the issuance of the July 8 notification, wherein the government granted the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) broad-based powers of surveillance, thereby increasing the potential for abuse.
Consequently, the ISI is left to determine the boundaries of vague terms such as “national security” and the “apprehension” of an offence.
What emerges from the audio leaks case, hence, is not necessarily a conclusive finding of state complicity but, perhaps, a deeper institutional failure: either to prevent abuse of power, or to ensure that objectives of national security and criminal justice are met proportionately and made subject to democratic oversight and legal accountability.
We have seen that in the absence of such safeguards, breaches of digital privacy stand to inflict irreparable harm on the reputations, liberties, and safety of individuals, from ordinary citizens to politicians, often without the procedural protections of due process. These harms reverberate throughout the democratic system, deterring the freedom of expression, quelling dissent, and undermining the integrity of core institutions, including the judiciary.

A society stricken by the fear of such harm can never truly be free.

To facilitate meaningful progress, we must therefore move beyond critique and commit to concrete, actionable reforms. What follows is an attempt to do just that, by proposing targeted legislation and amendments to the existing legal framework designed to minimise the risk of misuse, manipulation, or even negligent oversight of surveillance powers.
In Pakistan, the unresolved discord between key statutes governing the interception of information, particularly the PTRA and the IFTA, heightens the risk of Pakistan’s surveillance framework being abused, leaving loopholes that can be exploited by those for whom the lack of data security represents an opportunity, rather than a liability.
During the audio leaks case, Justice Sattar had commented that any rules made to regulate the authorising and conducting of surveillance under Section 54 of the PTRA would necessarily have to comply with the IFTA; however, this does not settle the matter. There is, therefore, an urgent need for the legislature or the superior judiciary to resolve this issue, as presently, Section 54 of the PTRA provides a means to circumvent and render redundant the elaborate procedure and safeguards laid out under the IFTA.
Empowering the ISI to conduct surveillance, while bypassing the need for a judicial warrant under the IFTA, is clear evidence of this glaring flaw in Pakistan’s legal framework.
There is also a need to narrow the boundaries of what constitutes ‘lawful’ interception or surveillance. In Pakistan, the IFTA achieves this goal through the use of clear language and provisions to prevent and punish the misuse of surveillance frameworks. However, as previously mentioned, the beneficial effects of the IFTA are neutered by Section 54 of the PTRA, which employs far broader language, including vague references to ‘national security’, and does not contain any mechanism to punish such abuse.
It is this disharmony that enabled the federal government to issue the July 8 notification, following which no individual warrants will have to be sought, and the government may authorise surveillance at its discretion without being bound by the provisions of the IFTA. The ISI, in turn, will have unfettered access to Pakistan’s surveillance infrastructure, likely with little to no oversight.

 

With no safeguards to mitigate excesses, it is impossible to predict the extent of intrusive surveillance Pakistani citizens will be subjected to under the guise of ‘national security’. This controversy can only be resolved through the legislative process, or by the judiciary, which can exercise its powers of judicial review to harmonise the PTRA with the IFTA, or, alternatively, to invoke Article 8 of the Constitution and strike down the portions of the PTRA deemed inconsistent with fundamental rights.
But, beyond this, there remains a dire need to supplement the existing legislative framework with a comprehensive personal data law. This is particularly crucial, given there is currently no legal framework to regulate the interception, use, collection, storage and disclosure of personal data by the government, organisations and other individuals and entities in Pakistan.
While the Ministry of IT&T proposed a Personal Data Protection Bill for this purpose in 2023, the latter was subjected to great criticism for ambiguities, lending themselves to exploitation. Despite the barrage of audio leaks seen in 2023, this Bill has yet to be debated or passed into law.
There is therefore a critical need to design effective legal mechanisms to detect and punish the misuse of personal data, both by domestic and foreign entities. The framework in the European Union (EU) provides a useful model, incorporating both reactive and pre-emptive measures for data protection, while empowering individuals to monitor the collection of their data.
Lastly, it is essential to ensure that unlawfully obtained digital content is not admissible in judicial, disciplinary, or administrative proceedings, or allowed to influence such proceedings, whether directly or indirectly, especially where it infringes upon the fundamental right to privacy. Institutions cannot operate with integrity when their internal dynamics are susceptible to manipulation through illegitimate digital disclosures.
Moreover, using such material to punish or discipline individuals sets a dangerous precedent: one which legitimises unlawful surveillance and encourages its use. This practice must be unequivocally rejected, not only by those targeted but by society as a whole.
While Pakistan’s failure to confront the fallout of its recent digital scandals represents a missed opportunity for reform, on a global scale, its experience demonstrates the urgent need for comprehensive data protection laws that both prevent and punish invasions of privacy and are insulated from political interference.

In both fragile democracies and mature legal systems, unchecked surveillance and politicised data breaches threaten to compromise institutional independence and derail accountability mechanisms and fundamental freedoms, striking at the very foundations of justice.

Upholding the sanctity of privacy is therefore not merely a matter of personal liberties, but a collective imperative to preserve the integrity of democratic institutions and uphold the rule of law. As digital intrusions grow more sophisticated and pervasive, the task for the global community is clear: to build resilient legal frameworks capable of withstanding manipulation and protecting the democratic values they claim to uphold.
However, our success in this regard presupposes the existence of a rule of law regime, one where the various branches of the state remain confined to their spheres and abide by both the letter and the spirit of the law.
It also requires meaningful compliance by private organisations and entities which are bound by international principles and obligations to safeguard consumer data, such as under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR).
These international instruments now stand enshrined in principles laid out by the Global Network Initiative, which was launched in 2008 to protect and advance the freedom of expression and privacy rights, by setting global standards in the information and communication technologies (ICT) sector to regulate decision-making in the face of government restrictions and demands. The GNI comprises internet platforms, telecommunication operators, equipment vendors and other entities playing a key role across the ICT sector.
The role of private organisations and entities is thus of great importance, as a refusal to comply with illegal surveillance requests has the potential to do grave damage to the existing surveillance framework in Pakistan and in other jurisdictions.
Lastly, as individuals, what we can do is to fulfil a more fundamental duty: to reject vague denials, institutional silence, and the normalisation of unchecked surveillance, wherever we may be. We must demand that our governments uphold their constitutional commitments and international obligations with respect to the freedom of expression, and the rights to privacy and due process, regardless of our personal affiliations or political leanings.
Ultimately, we must recognise that when the rights of even one individual are compromised, the rights of all are endangered.



In the battle to protect privacy rights, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) companies operating in Pakistan often find themselves in a bind — caught between the demands of an authoritarian state and their duty to uphold human rights.
Since 2022, a political barrage has been rattling Pakistan with a series of high-profile audio leaks that surfaced online involving senior government officials and opposition leaders. The leaks, widely suspected to have originated from government intelligence agencies, exposed private conversations and sensitive political strategies between political figures. The fallout was immediate and severe; public trust in the government was further eroded, opposition parties denounced the surveillance as unconstitutional, and civil society groups raised concerns about the growing encroachment on privacy.
The scandal underscored a longstanding and deeply troubling reality in the country: the prevalent use of highly intrusive surveillance technologies with little to no accountability. This situation raises a critical question: what are the responsibilities of ICT companies operating in regimes like Pakistan, when confronted by potentially unlawful government demands to deploy highly intrusive surveillance technologies against the public and political figures?
As conduits for the transmission of data and telecommunications, ICT companies are often beset by governments’ demands to engage in surveillance. When such governments demand access to user data or pressure companies to otherwise invade the privacy of public and political figures, ICT companies face complex legal, ethical, and operational challenges.
The situation in Pakistan thus reflects a broader global issue: how should private companies balance their legal obligations to host governments with their responsibility to protect user data and personal privacy — an internationally recognised human right?

 

Here, we argue that ICT companies should adhere to international standards that recognise their responsibility to respect human rights, including privacy, as outlined in the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs) and by the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multi-stakeholder initiative that implements the UNGPs for the ICT sector.
The UNGPs, endorsed by the UN Human Rights Council in 2011, provide a global framework for businesses to prevent and address human rights impacts, emphasising accountability and due diligence. When operating in countries such as Pakistan, where digital rights are actively suppressed, this responsibility becomes even more urgent and morally significant.
ICT companies are not merely passive players; they are intermediaries with the capacity to shape the frontiers of digital rights and privacy protections.
Responsibility to respect human rights
This section examines the international legal normative framework governing the responsibility of ICT companies to respect human rights, with a particular focus on the right to privacy. The framework is primarily guided by the UNGPs and the GNI Principles — the latter commit ICT companies to uphold freedom of expression and privacy rights, while the former offer practical measures for conducting human rights due diligence and addressing government requests for data or censorship.

A. Under the UNGPs, ICT companies have a responsibility to respect the right to privacy as a human right.
1. ICT companies should enact policies to avoid infringing on the privacy rights of others, recognising that the right to privacy is an internationally recognised human right.

Under the UNGPs, ICT companies are called upon to respect the right to privacy as a fundamental human right. Principle 11 of the UNGPs states that companies should first adopt policies and practices to ensure they do not infringe on the privacy rights of others.
The right to privacy is an internationally recognised human right that companies should respect globally, regardless of state actions or national laws. They are expected to take proactive steps to prevent, mitigate, and remedy any harms to privacy rights, which includes enacting human rights policies and effectively implementing them in their business operations. Furthermore, companies should avoid undermining state human rights obligations or judicial integrity when addressing privacy concerns.
Similarly, under Principle 12 of the UNGPs, ICT companies are expected to respect the right to privacy as a recognised human right. Heightened attention should be given to individuals and groups most at risk of privacy violations in specific industries or contexts. Vulnerable groups, including journalists, women, religious minorities, and political opponents, warrant special attention.
These obligations, reinforced by GNI Principles, apply specifically to ICT companies that agree to adhere. According to the GNI Principles’ Preamble, ICT companies joining the initiative should respect and promote both freedom of expression and privacy rights as expressed therein. Companies under GNI are expected to support privacy rights through responsible business decisions, shared learning, and collaboration with other stakeholders.

 

While these companies are required to comply with local laws, they must also strive to uphold international human rights standards and minimise any adverse impacts arising from conflicting national legal frameworks. Although the GNI Principles apply only to member ICT companies, they provide expert normative guidance for the sector as a whole on how the UNGP should be applied.
GNI Principle 3 defines privacy as a fundamental human right that protects human dignity, security, and freedom of expression. All individuals have the right to legal protection against unlawful or arbitrary interference with their privacy. Accordingly, under the GNI Principles framework, ICT companies are responsible for safeguarding user privacy on a global scale, even when faced with intrusive government demands. Companies are expected to uphold international standards and resist pressures that conflict with these fundamental privacy protections.

2. ICT companies should conduct thorough due diligence and risk assessments to identify, prevent, mitigate, and address potential privacy rights violations arising from their business activities.

Under Principle 13 of the UNGP on Business and Human Rights, businesses must avoid causing or contributing to human rights harms and take action to address them when they occur. Even if a company is not directly responsible for a violation, it must still prevent or mitigate human rights harms linked to its operations, products, or services through business relationships.
The GNI Principles reinforce this obligation by requiring ICT companies to identify situations where privacy rights may be jeopardised or advanced and to integrate these findings into their decision-making processes. Section 3.4 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines specifically states that participating companies must assess the human rights risks associated with the collection, storage, and retention of personal information in the jurisdictions where they operate. This means companies need to evaluate how their data practices, including cross-border data transfers and government surveillance requests, could affect users’ privacy rights.
Principle 17 of the UNGPs further establishes that human rights due diligence should involve an ongoing process of assessing actual and potential privacy rights impacts, acting upon the findings, tracking responses, and communicating how these impacts are being addressed. Due diligence should not be a one-time exercise; it must adapt and conform to evolving risks over time and begin early in the development of new activities or business relationships, including mergers, acquisitions, and contractual agreements.
By implementing robust human rights policies and due diligence frameworks, ICT companies can ensure they meet international human rights standards while safeguarding user privacy.

3. ICT companies should be transparent about their human rights impacts, disclosing policies and practices related to government surveillance requests and user data protection.

ICT companies have a responsibility to be transparent about their human rights impacts, especially concerning government surveillance requests and user data protection practices. Under Principle 21 of the UNGPs, companies are expected to communicate externally about how they address human rights impacts, especially when affected stakeholders raise concerns.
For companies operating in high-risk contexts, this obligation extends to formally reporting on how they manage human rights risks and impacts.

Communication should be provided in a form and frequency that accurately reflects the company’s human rights impact and ensures accessibility for the intended audience.

The GNI Principles reinforce these transparency obligations by establishing a framework for governance, accountability, and transparency. According to GNI Principle 6, companies must operate under a collectively determined governance structure that clearly defines roles and responsibilities, ensuring that accountability is maintained.
Transparency should include public disclosure of human rights policies and practices as well as independent assessments of the company’s implementation efforts. By adopting transparent communication and governance structures, ICT companies can build trust with stakeholders and demonstrate their commitment to respecting privacy rights and broader human rights standards.

B. Obligations of ICT Companies in Responding to Arbitrary Surveillance Requests from Repressive Regimes

Further building on the framework established by the UNGPs as well as the GNI Principles and Implementing Guidelines, this section examines the obligations of ICT companies when responding to arbitrary surveillance requests from authoritarian regimes. It outlines key international standards that ICT companies should adhere to and the practical challenges they face when domestic laws conflict with global privacy norms. The suggested framework guides ICT companies with strategies to balance legal compliance, corporate responsibility, and human rights protection in authoritarian regimes.

1. ICT companies should encourage governments to establish legal regimes that comply with international standards on human rights, including privacy rights.

ICT companies have a broader responsibility to promote alignment between domestic regulations and international privacy standards. Section 3.1 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines advises companies to encourage governments to adopt specific, transparent, and consistent legal frameworks governing surveillance and privacy. Governments should be urged to harmonise their domestic regulations with international human rights standards, particularly those related to freedom of expression and the right to privacy.
To support this effort, companies should develop internal policies and procedures that guide how they anticipate, assess and respond to government demands for content restrictions or disclosure of personal information. Adopting a structured approach, companies can ensure that their own actions, as well as their responses to government demands, remain consistent with human rights obligations.
Encouraging governments to comply with international standards helps establish a more predictable and rights-respecting legal environment, even in politically restrictive jurisdictions.

2. ICT companies should require the government to follow established domestic legal processes that implement or reflect international human rights standards.

ICT companies should require governments to comply with domestic legal procedures when seeking to access user information or restrict communications. According to Section 3.2 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines, companies should ensure that any government demand for personal data, content removal, or communication restrictions follows established domestic legal processes.
The GNI Implementation Guidelines emphasise that companies should request clear written communications from the government explaining the legal basis for such demands. This ensures that the company’s response is based on a transparent and well-defined legal framework.
Moreover, Section 3.5 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines encourages companies to operate transparently when responding to government requests. Transparency includes informing users about government requests where legally possible and issuing public reports that summarise the nature and scope of such requests. This approach helps prevent governments from overstepping legal boundaries and ensures that companies uphold their commitment to protecting user privacy and freedom of expression.

3. ICT companies should challenge overbroad, arbitrary, or otherwise unlawful government restrictions.

When governments make surveillance requests that exceed legal limits, ICT companies are encouraged to push back. Section 3.3 of the GNI Implementation Guidelines urges companies to seek clarification or modification from authorised officials when surveillance requests appear overbroad or unlawful. If the government’s response remains unsatisfactory, companies should, for the purpose of seeking guidance and support, engage with relevant stakeholders, including government authorities, international human rights bodies, and non-governmental organisations.

 

In cases where the government’s actions would clearly violate domestic legal standards, companies are encouraged to challenge such measures through domestic courts. Such legal challenges not only protect the rights of individual users but also set important precedents that may influence future government conduct. Taking legal action demonstrates the company’s commitment to defending user rights and upholding global privacy norms even in difficult political environments.

4. ICT companies should move to uphold human rights and privacy when domestic laws and/or government conduct conflict with international standards.

ICT companies have a responsibility to uphold human rights and protect user privacy, even when domestic laws and/or government conduct conflict with internationally recognised standards. According to Principle 23(b) of the UNGPs, businesses must respect human rights regardless of the political or legal context in which they operate.

When domestic laws prevent full compliance with international human rights standards, companies should strive to honour these international standards and principles to the greatest extent possible and demonstrate their efforts to mitigate harm.

The GNI Principles reinforce the expectation that companies will protect user privacy. ICT companies will respect and work to protect the privacy rights of users when confronted with government demands, laws, or regulations that compromise privacy in a manner inconsistent with internationally recognised laws and standards. Companies should treat human rights risks as legal compliance issues and take steps to reduce potential harm.
ICT companies can take several steps to navigate these complex challenges. They can seek advice from internal cross-functional teams and external experts, including governments, civil society, national human rights institutions, and multi-stakeholder initiatives. Collaboration and consultation with stakeholders can help companies develop more effective strategies for responding to government demands while maintaining a strong commitment to human rights and privacy.
Moreover, ICT companies can challenge overbroad, arbitrary, or unlawful requests by demanding formal legal justifications and operating with transparency. They can report the nature and frequency of government requests for user data or surveillance, for example. Upholding these principles helps maintain user trust and ensures that ICT companies remain aligned with international human rights norms.



Picture this: the First Lady was on the phone discussing political party-related information. A number of political events cause friction and instability within the government. In the midst of this political turmoil, the First Lady’s phone conversations are strategically leaked to the press.
Sounds like the audio leaks case in Pakistan, specifically the audio recordings released of ex-prime minister Imran Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, and her private conversations. Surprise! It is actually a recent series of released audio recordings of Kim Keon Hee, the wife of former South Korean President Yoon Seok-yeol.
In February 2025, a phone conversation between Kim Keon Hee and a political broker was made public by a local weekly affairs magazine. Although the conversations occurred before President Yoon took office in May 2022, they were likely leaked in 2025 because of the pending impeachment trials of President Yoon.
First Lady Kim, speaking on behalf of the then President-Elect Yoon, and the political broker were allegedly discussing the ruling People Power Party’s candidate nomination process for the 2022 parliamentary by-elections. These recordings confirmed allegations against Kim and President Yoon that they were involved in illegal election meddling. Their release to the public further complicated the couple’s legal troubles, and since then, Korea’s highest court has affirmed the impeachment of President Yoon.
Similarly, in Pakistan, a number of private audio recordings of high-level political actors were recently made available online, a couple of which were the subject of litigation before the Supreme Court of Pakistan.
In April 2023, an audio recording of Mian Najamul Saqib, son of the former chief justice of Pakistan Saqib Nisar, was leaked; in November 2023, a recording of a conversation between Bushra Bibi, Imran, and her lawyer was released; and in November 2024, another of Bushra Bibi’s phone conversations discussing politics and strategies was made public.
These leaked conversations were scandalous because they touched on political and internal affairs. In particular, the recordings of Bibi’s conversations were all released within the period that Bibi and former Prime Minister Khan were fighting a legal battle against bribery allegations. The consequent audio leaks case, or ALC, as the joint litigation is known in Pakistan, is representative of the type of nefarious surveillance that has silenced political opponents, suppressed journalists from sharing information critical of the government, and put citizens in fear of repercussions from their online activities.

 

The joint case of Bushra Bibi and Mian Najamul Saqib has become the leading case symbolising the fight against state surveillance overreach in Pakistan, highlighting that no one is out of reach.
What can the parallel travails of former presidents and their spouses in Pakistan and South Korea tell us about government surveillance capabilities and the abuse of such power? The two countries have walked a similar path: starting from the end of military dictatorships, digital repressive policies of the government, the use of government surveillance of civilians to further the state’s interests, and now the public release of the private conversations of the wives of former heads of each state’s government.
Here, we will present a case study of state surveillance in South Korea and draw broad comparisons between that context and the Pakistani one, of which the ALC is emblematic. It will highlight the history of the South Korean government’s use of overly broad surveillance to set up a discussion of similar government surveillance practices in Pakistan.
The goal is to provide a foundation for readers to better understand the issue of state surveillance and draw insight into the readers’ own circumstances and needs. Specifically, the study of South Korea can help to illustrate where the ALC is headed within the Pakistani legal system, how it might be understood by Pakistani citizens, and how people can respond to a government that does not respect their privacy rights.
Global internet freedom has been declining as authoritarian governments continue in their efforts to repress the flow of news and information, centralise state control over internet infrastructure, and create barriers to cross-border transfers of user data.
Reflections on South Korean, Pakistani leaks
There are a number of parallels between Pakistan’s current surveillance practices and the history of state surveillance in South Korea. Notably, both countries face the recent issue of the public release of private conversations involving the wives of the former president or prime minister, as well as challenges to accountability for government malfeasance.
Some of the parallels between the obstacles faced in Pakistan and those described in the South Korean case study in this regard suggest significant insights that are explored below.
The scandal generated by the audio leaks case has highlighted several challenges that Pakistan must address to make similar progress in curbing the its abusive surveillance practices and policies, namely, (a) overly broad laws authorising or enabling virtually unlimited surveillance powers; (b) government agencies and other state actors exercising nearly unlimited surveillance powers with little to no effective oversight, judicial or otherwise; (b) the nonexistence of data protection laws; and (c) the susceptibility of ICT companies to surveillance and data requests by state actors.
Government agencies’ power of surveillance
Both South Korea and Pakistan have agencies with broad statutory authority to conduct intrusive surveillance. In March 2024, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), in response to the IHC’s inquiry into the role of the government in the ALC, asserted its national security authority to intercept calls by telecom operators.
This takes place through the PTA’s own licensing clauses, which permit the state to suspend or modify telecommunication systems and licenses over the preference of any licensee upon a broad declaration of emergency. Furthermore, the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) grants surveillance powers to agencies within Pakistan. There is no adequate oversight, and provisions grant powers to “law enforcement to seize digital devices and content.”
Similarly, 1980s legislation granted South Korea’s intelligence agencies broad authority to collect and compile information regarding public safety against communists and plots to overthrow the government. Despite transitioning to democratic rule, the Korean government has made no significant change to limit the scope of the power of surveillance permitted by this statute.
However, the South Korean judicial system no longer permits the broad scope of this legislation to allow intrusive surveillance of civilians. As seen above, South Korean officials who overreached in their surveillance of private citizens were subject to investigations and criminal convictions.
Legislation
Both countries have legislation granting the government expansive legal authority to surveil citizens.
The PTA draws its power to spy from the Pakistan Telecommunications (Reorganisation) Act (2010), the Investigation of Fair Trial Act (2016), and the Telecom Act (1996). In particular, Section 54 of the TRA grants the federal government power to intercept conversations or to trace those conversations through any telecommunication system.
The Investigation of Fair Trial Act then permits the interception of and direct access to all information upon the issuance of a warrant by a high court judge. There is also Peca, which “grants powers to law enforcement to seize digital devices and content.”
Peca — which penalises acts of cyberterrorism, hate speech, defamation, and the dissemination of false information — has been widely abused and lacks proper oversight. Such broad surveillance powers have resulted in allegations of intelligence agencies monitoring human rights defenders, journalists, politicians, and other dissidents or opponents of the current ruling political party.

 

With respect to the audio leaks case, while there is no identified source linked to Bushra Bibi and Saqib’s conversations, there is a widespread understanding that intelligence agencies had to have been involved. In court, government agencies have denied any liability by citing the aforementioned laws as the legal basis for collecting information from telecommunication companies.
Similarly, the Korean National Security Act (NSA) was passed in the mid-20th century to punish “those praising or sympathising with an anti-state group”. But the law has been most often used to imprison people who exercised their right to freedom of expression in the 20th Century.
Significantly, although other political and judicial limitations have evolved, the South Korean government has not reformed the statute to limit its broad scope; this, despite criticism from human rights organisations on how the law violates international human rights norms.
A key difference between the two case studies relates to data protection laws, emphasising their importance. While South Korea has enacted a robust data protection legal framework, in part to counteract widespread abuse of surveillance powers, Pakistan has no stand-alone data protection legislation. Despite some efforts to adopt such a law, there is currently no legislation in Pakistan that shields personal data from either private or government entities.
Role of government requests to private companies
Companies in both countries are susceptible to government requests for users’ private information. While it has not been ascertained yet as to how the audio leaks subject of the litigation occurred, the government’s position was that user devices could have been hacked or accessed by a third party, and that it was not the result of “lawful” interception.
The position taken by telecom operators in the case was that there are several laws and regulations that require the disclosure of user data, in particular their licenses issued by the PTA, due to which they are obligated to comply. Corporate telecom operators cited the same legal authorities as the PTA, specifically provisions that authorise government agencies to collect information from private companies, which is obligated through the PTA’s licensure requirement.
Similarly, South Korea permits government agencies to collect information from private companies through warrants and other legal government requests. Former President Park Geun-hye attempted to use this opportunity to monitor private messages sent through Kakao Talk — the main messaging app in Korea — to crack down on messages deemed as critical of her presidency.
As mentioned above, an ICT company’s susceptibility to the government’s request to pry into its users’ conversations led to the mass exodus of users, ultimately forcing the company to promise it would no longer respond to government requests for access to information. Most importantly, it was an encouraging example of a company willing to push back on government data requests and assume the possible legal consequences to retain its customers’ trust.
Lessons from South Korea
The foregoing makes clear a number of the similarities between the South Korean case study and the situation in Pakistan, as exemplified by the audio leaks case, in terms of government surveillance power and potential abuses of that power.
The key question thus remains: what are the differences between the two that might explain why government surveillance in South Korea has been scaled back, and is being held in check more effectively?
In short, the experience of South Korea highlights the importance of global and domestic media attention, widespread popular mobilisation, and the role of responsible ICT company conduct in combating state overreach, among others. When these factors converge, the case study suggests, abusive surveillance policies and practices can be reined in and wrongdoers held accountable, at least to some extent.
South Korea is an example of how factors like domestic and global media coverage, along with public mobilisation, can pressure governments to phase out abusive surveillance practices and even repeal repressive policies that violate constitutional and human rights.
The press and public backlash to the Chun government’s torture and killing of student activists Park Jong-chul in 1987; the negative coverage of government abuses in relation to South Korea hosting the 1988 Olympics; the scandals generated by the surveillance of political opponents during the administrations of Presidents Roh and Lee; and the huge outcry against President Park for spying on the families of the victims of the Sewol Ferry tragedy, as well as her political opponents, leading to her impeachment in 2016; these key moments in South Korea’s history all reflect the way in which democratic forces can positively influence public policies on state surveillance and respect for privacy rights.
In addition, even where government agencies have broad surveillance powers authorised by statute, these positive forces can motivate ICT companies to “do the right thing”, as Kakao Talk did in response to President Park’s unlawful surveillance of its messaging app and network.
Another key feature of the South Korean landscape that finds no direct corollary in Pakistan is the existence of a robust data protection legal framework that is strongly enforced; this acts to counterbalance at least some of the potential government overreach otherwise enabled by law. Indeed, ICT companies will be less susceptible to government surveillance and data requests when those powers are curbed by law in line with constitutional and human rights norms.
Such legal reform in turn can be enabled by international media and diplomatic pressure, which dovetail with domestic public backlash to positive change — a dynamic that altered the practice of state surveillance in South Korea.
It should be noted that surveillance by the South Korean authorities remains ongoing despite the positive evolution of public policies over the past several decades. Surveillance is still being used against citizens to silence political opponents and dissidents. However, the South Korean media and legal system continue to push back against the State’s overreach, fueled by the public’s decreased tolerance of abusive practices for the historical reason discussed.
And as technological advancements have made it faster and easier for South Korean citizens to access information, it has become harder for government officials to use surveillance powers against the interests of the people.

The development comes as Imran’s sisters have in recent weeks been repeatedly denied a meeting with him, leading them to question the whereabouts of the ex-prime minister and stage sit-ins outside the Adiala jail. Further, several social media accounts on X have shared unverified claims of his death, with Indian media also reporting on the alleged rumours about his health. The trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ was also trending on X on Thursday morning.
In a statement issued early on Thursday on X, the party said “rumours of a despicable nature” were being spread from “Afghan and Indian media, and foreign social media accounts” regarding Imran’s health.
The party demanded that the “current government and the interior ministry immediately and clearly dismiss and clarify the rumour and immediately arrange a meeting between Imran and his family”.
“A formal and transparent statement should be issued on behalf of the state regarding the health, security and current status of Imran,” the party demanded.







It further called on the state to investigate those responsible for spreading rumours of a “sensitive nature” and demanded that the “facts be presented before the nation”.
The party, in its statement, warned that “the nation will not tolerate any uncertainty regarding the status of its leader (Imran)”.
“The government is directly responsible for protecting Imran’s security, human rights and constitutional rights,” the party said. The PTI also vowed to take “every legal and political step to counter these rumours and bring the truth to light”.
Meanwhile, PTI leader Meher Bano Qureshi, who is also the daughter of former foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, said on X that rumours regarding Imran’s health were concerning.
“The government is responsible for Khan sahib’s safety and is duty-bound to issue a statement updating the nation. As far as putting an end to these rumours goes, the best, most credible way possible is to allow Khan sahib’s sisters, lawyers and party members to meet with him,” she said.







‘Afghan origin’ claim debunked
Separately, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MOIB) debunked “false claims by Afghan and Indian social media alleging that Imran had been killed in jail”.
“Anonymous Afghan accounts circulated an unverified rumour that Imran was killed in custody and his body moved. Indian outlets repeated the rumour using two old photos from 2013 and 2022 as ‘fresh evidence’,” the ministry’s official fact-checking cell said on X.
It added that “disinformation originated from two Afghan propaganda handles known for fabrications”.







“Their posts appeared only 46 minutes apart, a clear indication of a coordinated attempt rather than independent reporting. Both accounts falsely claimed a “Pakistani source” confirmed the death but provided no documentation, proof, or institutional verification,” it said.
The account clarified that the photos of Imran used by the accounts, and presented as “fresh evidence”, dated back to 2022 and 2013.
The fact-checking account said that the “first image used to support the rumour is actually from 2013, when Imran fell from a forklift stage during an election rally.”
“Afghan and Indian networks repurposed this 12-year-old image to imply a recent incident inside jail,” it added.
It detailed that “at 12:06pm PKT, Republic TV aired a false claim of ‘PTI supporters storming Adiala Jail”. It added that “within hours”, India’s Republic TV started running the rumour as well, followed by other indian outlets at 3pm — all of whom were “relying on the same two Afghan accounts”.
Tracing the origin of the second picture used by the Afghan-origin accounts, the fact-checking account clarified that the picture was from November 4, 2022, from an assassination attempt on Imran in Wazirabad.
“This photo predates Imran’s imprisonment and has zero connection to jail or custody,” it said.
Elaborating on the Indian media’s role in amplifying the rumour, the account said that “despite PTI representatives telling Indian channels that no such information existed, the rumour was aired repeatedly.”
“No journalist, official, hospital, or government agency confirmed any abnormal development,” it said.
Citing Republic TV as an example, the account said that indian channels continued to run the rumour as a “possible developing story” despite admitting that the rumour was of Afghan origin.
It added that the Indian media also misrepresented the “routine, court-ordered family visitation schedule as ‘suspicious.’
“In reality, jail meetings follow judicial guidelines, not intelligence or law enforcement discretion,” it said.
The account noted that the “timing, coordination, and rapid cross-border amplification suggest a deliberate attempt to create unrest within Pakistan.”
“The rumour was designed to provoke agitation, fuel anti-state narratives, and manufacture a false sense of instability,” it said.
‘Imran has TV, allowed use of exercise machine in jail’
Earlier on Wednesday, Defence Minister and PML-N leader Khawaja Asif had responded to a video on X in which Imran criticised ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif for demanding amenities while in jail.
“He (Imran) himself has a TV in his jail cell … and his food comes from outside,” he claimed.
“There are exercise machines available for him as well,” he added.







Asif, recalling his own time in prison, said, “We used to sleep on the cold floor and eat the food [prepared] at the jail.”
He continued: “It was the month of January, and we had only two blankets, and there was no hot water.”
On the other hand, Imran, he alleged, had “a double bed and velvet bedding”, claiming that the jail superintendent personally tended to him.
Asif called on the PTI founder to “listen to his own speech on the jail’s loudspeaker,” adding that “he (Imran) should fear God.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The party has previously also raised concerns over the health of Imran, who is 73-years-old.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2707371092c1a4d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957664/2-national-guard-soldiers-shot-near-white-house-trump-terms-incident-act-of-terror' target='_blank'><strong>2 National Guard soldiers shot near White House; Trump terms incident ‘act of terror’</strong></a><br><p>Two US National Guard soldiers were critically wounded on Wednesday after being shot in a brazen daytime attack a few blocks from the White House, with US President Donald Trump terming the incident an “act of terror”.
The incident, which left two Guard members critically wounded, was “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror,” Trump said.
“It was a crime against our entire nation.”
He confirmed that the man taken into custody after the daylight shooting two blocks from the White House was “a foreigner who entered our country from Afghanistan”.







The suspect had arrived in the United States in 2021 “on those infamous flights,” Trump said, referring to the evacuations of Afghans fleeing as the Taliban took over the country in the wake of the US retreat after 20 years of war.
“We must now reexamine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan” under former president Joe Biden, Trump said.
“We must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country if they can’t love our country, we don’t want them.”







The Department of Homeland Security identified the suspect as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national. According to CNN, the suspect applied for asylum in 2024, which was granted by the Trump administration in April 2025.
Separately, the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said it had stopped processing all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely.
“The protection and safety of our homeland and of the American people remains our singular focus and mission,” the US Citizenship and Immigration Services said in a post on X.







Reacting to the incident, former US president Barack Obama said “violence has no place in America”.
“Michelle and I are praying for the servicemembers shot in Washington, DC today, and send our love to their families as they enter this holiday season under the most tragic of circumstances,” he said.







‘Targeted shooting’
Trump was in Florida at the time of the attack, which prompted the White House to go into lockdown as law enforcement from multiple federal and city agencies swarmed the area.
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser called it “a targeted shooting” by a single assailant.
“That individual has been taken into custody,” she said.
The shooting occurred around 2:15 pm local time, when the two soldiers — a man and a woman — were conducting what authorities described as a “high-visibility patrol”.
According to DC Police Executive Assistant Chief Jeffrey Carroll, the attacker rounded a corner, raised a firearm, and “ambushed these members of the National Guard” without warning.
Both soldiers were struck multiple times and rushed to local trauma centers, where they remain in critical condition. The suspect was also injured during the encounter.
Carroll said investigators were still working to determine whose gunfire wounded him, but confirmed that there were no additional suspects and no ongoing threat.
Senior counterterrorism officials confirmed to ABC News that the FBI was examining the shooting as a possible act of international terrorism, and investigators were looking into whether the attack may have been inspired by a foreign militant group.
Authorities stressed, however, that no motive had been established.
Trump was the first to announce the incident publicly, writing on social media that “the animal that shot the two National Guardsmen” was also severely wounded and would “pay a very steep price”.
He praised the National Guard and federal law-enforcement agencies as “truly great people”.







Following the shooting, US Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth said the president directed him to deploy an additional 500 National Guard troops to Washington “immediately,” saying: “This happened just steps away from the White House. It will not stand.”
A brief security lockdown was also imposed at the White House as the situation unfolded, though Trump was not in the capital at the time.
“The president has been briefed,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.
Confusion briefly erupted when West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey issued — then retracted — a statement saying the two soldiers had died. His office later said the information was based on “early and conflicting reports”.
Unease within Muslim communities
A relative of Lakanwal’s told NBC News that the suspect had arrived in the US in September 2021, after serving for 10 years in the Afghan army alongside US Special Forces.
According to the relative, Lakanwal spent part of his military service stationed at a base in Kandahar. The relative who spoke to NBC News had also served with him, supporting US troops.
“We were the ones targeted by the Taliban in Afghanistan,” he said. “I cannot believe that he might have done this,” the relative added.
Lakanwal came to the US five months after Biden announced the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.
Originally from Khost province, Lakanwal had been living in Bellingham, Washington, with his wife and five children, the relative said.
The attack also triggered unease within Muslim communities.
“We hope this report is incorrect,” a Muslim political commentator, who declined to be named, told Dawn after initial reports about the nationality of the suspect.
“If it turns out to be true, it may trigger a strong backlash against Muslim communities across the United States.”
National Guard personnel from several Republican-led states, including West Virginia, have been deployed in Washington since August, when Trump expanded an earlier mission aimed at combating street crime and supporting immigration enforcement initiatives.
The soldiers shot on Wednesday were part of that deployment.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271414093f9cc49.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957708/bangladesh-ex-pm-sheikh-hasina-gets-21-years-in-jail-for-corruption' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh ex-PM Sheikh Hasina gets 21 years in jail for corruption</strong></a><br><p>A court in Bangladesh sentenced ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina on Thursday to 21 years in prison for corruption, a week after she was given the death penalty for crimes against humanity.
Hasina, 78, is currently residing in India and has defied court orders that she return to Bangladesh.
She was sentenced in absentia on November 17 to be hanged for crimes against humanity after ordering a deadly crackdown against a student-led uprising last year that eventually ousted her.

 

But three other cases had been brought against the ex-leader by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) over land grabs of lucrative plots in a suburb of the capital Dhaka.
Hasina received seven years’ imprisonment in each of the three cases, Dhaka Tribune reported. Several other accused were also handed varying prison terms, it added.
It is unclear if the sentences will run concurrently.
Hasina’s conduct “demonstrates a persistent corruption mindset rooted in entitlement, unchecked power, and a greedy eye for public property”, ruled judge Abdullah Al Mamun.
“Treating public land as a private asset, she directed her greedy eye toward state resources and manipulated official procedures to benefit herself and her close relatives.”

 

Hasina’s US-based son Sajeeb Wazed and daughter Saima Wazed, who has served as a top United Nations official, were sentenced to five years each.
Hasina fled Bangladesh by helicopter on August 5, 2024, after weeks of student-led protests against her autocratic rule.
Public prosecutor Khan Moinul Hasan said he would appeal the verdict in the corruption cases.
“We are not satisfied with the verdict, as we had sought maximum punishment,” he told AFP.
“We will consult our client, the Anti-Corruption Commission, and decide on the next course of action.”
The three cases involve a total of 47 accused, with 23 individuals named across them, according to Dhaka Tribune.
The first case listed 12 accused, including Hasina; the second listed 17, including Hasina and Sajeeb; and the third listed 18 convicts, including Hasina and her daughter Saima.
Bangladesh has been in political turmoil since the end of Hasina’s rule, and violence has marred campaigning for elections slated for February 2026.
The UN says up to 1,400 people were killed in crackdowns as Hasina tried to cling to power.

 

Hasina has called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”.
She is also being prosecuted in three other corruption cases, along with her sister Sheikh Rehana and her children, including British MP Tulip Siddiq.</p><small>2025-11-27 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635871-fia-clarifies-only-passengers-with-incomplete-documents-being-stopped' target='_blank'><strong>FIA clarifies only passengers with incomplete documents being stopped</strong></a><br><p>

Rare earth permanent magnets (REPMs), some of the strongest types of permanent magnets, made from alloys of rare earth elements, are used in many critical sectors, including electric vehicles, aerospace and renewable energy.
New Delhi currently meets its demand primarily through imports, with the government estimating that the country’s needs could double by 2030.
India’s cabinet approved on Tuesday a $815.3m scheme to promote the production of REPMs, which the government said will help secure the “supply chain for domestic industries”.
The plan involves offering sales-linked incentives and subsidies to help establish a manufacturing capacity of around 6,000 metric tons per year.
“This first-of-its-kind initiative aims to establish 6,000 MTPA (metric tons per annum) of integrated REPM manufacturing in India, thereby enhancing self-reliance and positioning India as a key player in the global REPM market,” the government said in a statement.
Local industry groups welcomed the move, with the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA) saying it will provide long-term resilience to the automotive supply chain.
It will encourage investments in advanced materials and give India a strong position in global value chains for EVs and clean energy, Vikrampati Singhania, ACMA president, said in a statement.
“This is a strategic and forward-looking intervention that addresses one of the most critical gaps in the EV and advanced mobility ecosystem,” he said.
While India sources rare earth magnets from multiple countries, China’s export curbs earlier this year raised alarm among some Indian firms.</p><small>2025-11-27 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635860-ecp-notifies-by-poll-winners-withholds-na-96-over-code-breach' target='_blank'><strong>ECP notifies by-poll winners, withholds NA-96 result over 'code breach'</strong></a><br><p>

Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”.
“All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”.
However, the FIA officer noted that a lot of people were those “who get deceived by various human smugglers in some way”.
Zia detailed that FIA immigration officials at airports check the travel documents of “all those people and profile them”, asserting that no one going abroad for a valid purpose was being stopped.
“All those who are denied from going abroad are refused due to them not having valid documents, or if they have permits or visas wherein the companies stated do not exist, and we have suspicions that human smugglers are trapping them and taking them abroad.’’



“We have seen cases where people get deceived by these human smugglers and change their routes mid-transit, or take an accomplice with them in the form of their mother or sister, through which they can exit here with the [safeguard] of an Umrah [visa],” Zia said.
He added there had been past cases where such people were deported from other countries, following which the FIA’s Anti-Human Trafficking Cell registers a case, conducts an inquiry and “such human traffickers are brought to a halt”.
He urged the public not to be fooled by migrant smugglers. The FIA officer said those networks were negatively portraying the matter to “create unrest” and secure financial gains for themselves.
He recalled the Mauritania and Greece boat capsize incidents, saying that innocent people were shown “dreams of Europe” and smuggled out of Pakistan via dunki (illegal land routes) or by transiting in other countries, only to be pressured into handing over exorbitant amounts of cash or even losing their lives.

 

“Not only does Pakistan’s name on an international level get maligned and the value of our green passport declines, but many countries have also created difficulties for us in obtaining visas,” the FIA Lahore director said.
Zia assured the public that immigration staff would facilitate all those who were travelling abroad for legitimate reasons with valid documents.
The FIA’s Facebook post said “such fabricated content aims to misguide the public and undermine institutional credibility”, and urged citizens to rely only on verified information from official FIA platforms.
Earlier this week, BBC Urdu reported that it spoke to some of the offloaded individuals, including a 25-year-old man from Hyderabad who had obtained a work visa for Saudi Arabia.
Another person, aged 35, who hailed from Punjab’s Sargodha, was stopped from travelling to Saudi Arabia from Karachi, and later also barred from travelling to Dubai from Lahore for work.
A resident of Punjab’s Jhang told BBC Urdu he was offloaded from Karachi as officials questioned why he was using that airport instead of the nearby one in Lahore, the reason for which he said was a cheaper ticket.
Earlier this week, it emerged that a number of genuine businessmen and tourists lodged a strong protest against the “harsh policy” to offload even those going for business trips or tourism.
Gujrat Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Ahmed Hassan Mattu told Dawn that he had received several complaints from members of the Gujrat chamber about being offloaded from Lahore, Sialkot and other airports despite having genuine travel documents and recommendation letters.
He said that the business fraternity had been very concerned over such a harsh policy of FIA Immigration as genuine businessmen should not be stopped or bothered at the airports.
When asked about the reasons of offloading, FIA Gujranwala Zone Director Muhammad Bin Ashraf told Dawn that there was no harsh policy or new directions issued in this regard of offloading passengers with fake documents or suspicious motives.</p><small>2025-11-27 07:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635864-sanaullah-hints-at-accountability-of-those-who-harmed-country-in-past' target='_blank'><strong>Rana Sanaullah hints at accountability of those who 'harmed country in past'</strong></a><br><p>

The statement, issued late last night, said terrorists carried out a “cowardly attack on the Qazi Talab checkpost in the dark of the night”.
Responding to the attack, Hangu District Police Officer (DPO) Khan Zeb Mohmand led the operation against the terrorists, the statement said.
It added that while the operation was underway, police personnel “surrounded the area and stood firm against the enemy like a wall of lead”.
“Eventually, police foiled the attack,” the statement added. However, three policemen, Head Constable Wahid Shah, Head Constable Hikmat Khan and Abdul Samad, were martyred during the operation.
The CTD statement detailed that “intense fighting” had continued between police and the terrorists for two hours, and there were reports of several deaths among the terrorists.
“The terrorists took advantage of the darkness of the night and the rocky mountainous terrain and fled, taking their dead and wounded with them. However, the body of an armed terrorist was recovered during the search and strike operation,” the statement said.
Condemnations pour in
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi strongly condemned the attack, a statement issued by his office said, adding that the provincial chief executive had also issued instructions to “immediately send additional personnel” to the site of the incident.
“Terrorists have no religion. Cowardly attacks cannot demoralise us,” the statement quoted Afridi as saying. He further said that the terrorists would be brought to justice and the sacrifices of the martyrs “will not go in vain”.
He sought an immediate report on the incident from the KP police inspector general and also called for the immediate provision of medical treatment to those injured in the attack, the CM Office’s statement said.
“The fight against terrorism will continue with an even stronger resolve,” the statement further quoted the CM as saying, adding that he also prayed for the martyred personnel and their families.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack and paid tribute to the martyred personnel.
A statement on the interior ministry’s X account said that Naqvi extended condolences to the bereaved families. “Sacrifice of the martyred personnel will not go in vain,” he was quoted as saying.
“These sacrifices are a testament to Pakistan’s unwavering resolve in the fight against terrorism,” Naqvi said, adding that KP police were on the front lines of this fight.







Pakistan has seen a rise in terrorist attacks in the recent past, particularly in KP and Balochistan, since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, the TPP had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last night’s attack comes roughly three weeks after an improvised explosive device struck a police convoy conducting search operations near a cemetery in the Doaba area of Hangu. Three police officers, including a station house officer, were injured in the November 2 attack.
In a similar incident on October 24, three cops, including a superintendent of police, were martyred when back-to-back blasts rocked Hangu. According to the police, the TTP was behind the blasts.</p><small>2025-11-27 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635848-justice-najafi-links-noor-mukadam-case-to-rising-live-in-relationships' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Najafi links Noor Mukadam case to 'rising live-in relationships'</strong></a><br><p>

The organisation also rejected concerns linking “these changes” with harmful algal blooms or eutrophication.
“We believe that the green discolouration of the ocean is caused by large, naturally occurring, non-toxic bloom of Noctiluca scintillans, a small, free-floating organism that may appear in red, orange, green, or even colourless forms.
“Along Pakistan’s coast, blooms are most often green or orange and can spread extensively depending on seasonal conditions. Although the organism itself is not green, the colour comes from its internal symbiont, Protoeuglena noctilucae, which enables it to photosynthesise and grow rapidly.
“Because Noctiluca is naturally bioluminescent, its presence creates the glittering glow reported at night,” it stated. Similar seasonal blooms had been documented across the coasts of Yemen, Oman, Iran, Pakistan and western India.

“After the peaceful protest outside the Islamabad High Court until 1pm, lawmakers will march on Adiala Jail [in Rawalpindi] along with Mr Imran’s sisters and sit outside the jail,” Mr Afridi told PTI workers during a ceremony held here to “pay tribute to the PTI workers martyred on Nov 26, 2024” in the provincial capital.
He requested PTI secretary general Salman Akram Raja to ensure the presence of all party members of the national and provincial assemblies and the Senate outside the high court on Tuesdays.
The chief minister also urged party workers to “ensure their elected representatives are present at the protest.”
“Wherever you [workers] are, make sure all your respective MNAs and MPAs are present at the peaceful protest. We’ll shame absent lawmakers afterward,” he said.
The chief minister said that those, who won elections in the name of the incarcerated prime minister Imran Khan to become parliamentarians, would protest to ensure justice is dispensed to the leader facing torture in the jail.
He said the party’s peaceful movement for the release of Mr Imran would continue and he himself would visit Adiala Jail on every Thursday until he met the detained leader.
Mr Afridi announced that a political gathering would be held in the provincial capital on December 7.
He said that Nov 26 was a painful day for PTI as its peaceful workers were fired at, martyred and wounded at D-Chowk in Islamabad.
The chief minister also complained that the police fired at and killed TLP workers in Punjab’s Muridke town.
“It’s a message for the entire country as powers-that-be want nobody to raise voice for rights. They do not want the supremacy of the Constitution, restoration of an independent judiciary and media,” he said.
Mr Afridi claimed that the PTI chief was illegally behind bars for over 850 days, just for the sake of the people’s rights.
He said that Mr Imran was waiting for people to do justice with him.
“The courts were paralysed through the 26th Constitutional Amendment and the rest was done in the 27th Constitutional Amendment. Now, the 28th Constitutional Amendment is in the works and it will be followed by the 29th Constitutional Amendment,” he said.
The chief minister said the PTI would continue the struggle for the release of its jailed activists and the people’s rights as allowed by the law and the Constitution. He said certain quarters wanted PTI to break the law for a crackdown, but that won’t happen.
Mr Afridi said that PTI protesters remained peaceful on May 9 and Nov 26 and would remain peaceful in the future as well but would never compromise on rights.
He said that party workers offered sacrifices, which wouldn’t go to waste.

Among other issues, MNA Anjum Aqeel Khan will draw the attention of the federal education minister to a matter of urgent public importance regarding insufficient transport facilities available to students in federal government colleges and schools in the capital, which is causing grave concern among the public.
In the Senate session, the food minister will move a bill to establish the National Agri-Trade and Food Safety Authority.
Through a calling-attention notice, Senator Jan Muhammad will draw the attention of the finance minister to the blocking of bank accounts of sitting and former parliamentarians (MNAs, senators and MPAs) by commercial banks on the directions of the State Bank of Pakistan and will seek an explanation of the policy or instructions under which this has been done.

“We have now completely restricted passenger vehicles, motorists and tourists from travelling to neighbouring GB for their safety,” Assistant Commissioner Balakot Hasrat Khan told reporters on Wednesday. He said the decision to impose a travel ban between KP and GB was taken in a meeting attended by the heads of all relevant departments.
The AC said that the Chilas (GB) district administration and police were in contact with Mansehra’s administration, and they too had imposed a ban on travel along Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad road. “
We have decided to allow tourists to travel only up to Battakundi and Saiful Muluk between 11am and 3pm, and only with chained tyres, as vehicles cannot move safely on icy roads before or after the four-hour period,” Mr Khan said.
He clarified that no restrictions had been placed on travel up to Naran until the next spell of snowfall. The official said most of the indigenous community settled in Barawai, Battakundi, and other areas beyond Naran had already migrated, while the remaining people were expected to leave within a week or after the second snowfall in Kaghan valley.
He stated that police posts in the upper reaches of the valley had also been closed for the winter. “We expect the Kaghan–Babusar Top section of the MNJ road to reopen in early May next year, and until then the valley will remain completely closed to movement,” he said.

During the hearing, Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra noted that despite multiple summons, Omar Ayub failed to appear before the court, prompting the judge to invoke proclamation proceedings.
The court also sought complete details of his movable and immovable properties and issued directions to block his passport and Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC).
The case concerns a PTI demonstration held last year, for which Mr Ayub and other senior party figures have been nominated under anti-terrorism charges.

Defence, prosecution clash after Aleema Khan briefly detained for attempting to leave courtroom

Earlier this year, prosecutors submitted a challan formally naming several top PTI leaders, accusing them of inciting violence and causing disruption during the protest.
The court adjourned further hearings while ordering officials to complete the requirements associated with the proclamation process.
Aleema briefly in custody
Separately in Rawalpindi, proceedings in a different protest-related case took an unexpected turn when Aleema Khan, sister of former prime minister Imran Khan, was briefly detained by women police officers inside an Anti-Terrorism Court.
Aleema, one of 11 charged with arson and obstructing government operations during a protest on 26 November last year, appeared before ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah.
At the outset of the hearing, the court was informed that lawyers would be arguing on an application filed by an accused named Safai regarding the jurisdiction of the ATC over the matter. The court noted that 11 accused, including Aleema Khan, had already been indicted in the case.
Prosecutor Zaheer Shah informed the court that the accused were facing charges under terrorism-related laws due to allegations of arson and encirclement during last year’s protest.
During the hearing, Aleema Khan attempted to exit the courtroom. “Our lawyers are busy in the Supreme Court, we should be allowed to go,” she said.
Women police officers, however, intercepted her and brought her back inside. Prosecutor Zaheer Shah insisted that the accused was “in judicial custody under Section 351” and therefore could not leave without the judge’s explicit permission.
Defence lawyer Faisal Malik strongly objected, arguing that Aleema Khan had voluntarily surrendered before the court and that there was “no order to take her into custody”. He termed the police action “unacceptable” and urged the court to initiate proceedings against the officers involved.
The judge, responding to the defence protests, remarked, “If you had come on time, this might not have happened”.
The courtroom witnessed heated exchanges as the prosecution maintained that the accused and her lawyers were creating hurdles in the trial.
Prosecutor Zaheer Shah added that eight police witnesses were present in court despite their official duties and that unnecessary delays were obstructing proceedings.
Following arguments, the court allowed Aleema Khan to proceed with filing her bail bonds. Additionally, the court ordered the accused to pay Rs 10,000 each to the eight police witnesses, citing the inconvenience caused by repeated adjournment requests.
During the proceedings, defence lawyers also requested that the court direct authorities to unfreeze the bank accounts of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust and Namal University, Mianwali.
The prosecutor, Zaheer Shah, responded sharply. “We regret that Shaukat Khanum’s account had to be frozen due to the irresponsible behaviour of the accused,” he said.
In a brief interaction with the judge, Aleema Khan said she had faith in the court and believed justice would prevail.
After hearing arguments, the court accepted the defence’s request and adjourned the hearing until Dec 1.

ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has signalled a clear shift in the government’s economic direction, saying the goal is no longer to pursue short bursts of five to six per cent GDP growth that have repeatedly led to instability.
“We do not want to repeat the past cycles of unsustainable growth,” he said while addressing a two-day economic dialogue organised by the Pakistan Business Council (PBC) on Wednesday. The focus, he added, is moving towards steady, sustainable growth that can break recurring boom-and-bust cycles and place the economy on firmer footing.
He said the growth trajectory itself is not the issue; the real challenge is maintaining momentum once achieved. Previous attempts, he noted, proved unsustainable.
He cautioned against repeating earlier patterns and reiterated that export-led growth remains the only path to stronger performance.
Without naming the country, he referred to a neighbouring economy moving towards 8pc growth but facing high unemployment. In Pakistan, he said, the debate centres on equity and representative growth.
Discussing sectoral performance, Mr Aurangzeb highlighted the government’s aim to revive industrialisation, saying the upcoming industrial policy will place special emphasis on this effort. He expressed hope for 3.5pc GDP growth in the current fiscal year.
He projected growth of around 4pc over the next two to three years, with the potential to reach 6-7pc over the medium term, provided the momentum in agriculture, manufacturing and services continues.
He also gave updates on remittances and external inflows, noting stable monthly remittance levels through formal channels and strong performance of the Roshan Digital Account. He said remittances this year are expected to reach around $41 billion.
The minister said easing monetary conditions would help reduce financing costs, but urged corporate leaders to diversify beyond bank borrowing and make greater use of capital markets for longer-tenor, more competitive financing.
Mr Aurangzeb reaffirmed the government’s commitment to addressing structural issues in taxation and energy. “We are going to hold the first tax advisory council meeting on Thursday. The council will now reach out to businesses for input ahead of the next budget.”
Responding to concerns about security raised by foreign investors, the minister stressed that national security is non-negotiable. Security, macroeconomic stability, and smooth profit repatriation, he said, are the basic prerequisites for attracting and retaining global investment.
He said the inaugural meeting of the 11th NFC will be held on Dec 4. “We will engage provinces to come up with some tangible results.”
He also announced that Pakistan is preparing for its first Panda Bond issuance, expected before the Chinese New Year.
Mr Aurangzeb pointed to renewed interest from global companies such as Aramco, and firms from Turkiye and Abu Dhabi, which have begun investing in energy, mining, technology, logistics and automotive sectors. He described this as a sign of growing confidence in Pakistan’s economic direction.
Dr Zeelaf Munir, chairperson of the PBC, highlighted the role of productive businesses in national progress. “Pakistan’s economic strength depends on evidence-based policy, stability and long-term reform,” she said.
She added that growth requires predictability, fairness and confidence for business, and that sustainable progress needs partnership between government, business, academia and civil society.
Long-term stability
At another session, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan said exports must grow faster than imports to ease pressure on the economy and secure long-term stability. He described industrial development as essential for national prosperity and called industry the backbone of economic progress.
He said stronger export performance requires support for manufacturing and local production, adding that producing key inputs such as steel domestically is necessary to expand export capacity. He was of the opinion that Pakistan should strengthen domestic investment before relying on foreign investors. Faster economic progress, he said, is needed to create employment.
Mr Haroon said a tax package under the upcoming industrial policy will be presented to the IMF. The reform measures being prepared, he added, are intended to support long-term, sustainable economic growth.

The committee, headed by Muhammad Farooq Sattar, asked the privatisation commission to present the timeline at its next meeting. The committee also emphasised safeguarding PIA employees’ jobs before the sale.
It called for retaining staff based on performance and merit and ensuring benefits, such as pensions and gratuity, are processed fairly. Officials were instructed to consult the PIA employees’ union and address their concerns to ensure a transparent process.

 

The privatisation commission has already approved a transaction structure to sell a stake of 51 per cent to 100pc in PIACL, along with management control.
Four bidders have been pre-qualified for the sale: Lucky Cement Consortium, Arif Habib Corporation Consortium, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited Air Blue Limited.
According to the commission, the pre-qualified bidders now have access to a virtual data room, can conduct site visits and participate in the pre-bid conference. Negotiations are ongoing to finalise commercial terms, advancing the privatisation process.
In a separate matter, an additional secretary for the power division told the committee that the government has begun the phased privatisation of public sector power generation companies (GENCOs), under a 2024–29 programme.
He said only operational plants will be offered, with the Guddu (747MW) and Nandipur (525MW) facilities identified for privatisation once pre-conditions are met. Non-operational units are proposed for delisting from the programme.
The privatisation commission advised GENCOs may dispose of old, non-functional assets with the board and ministry’s approval.
The committee also sought a detailed report from the power ministry on the installation of 1.5 million smart meters nationwide and requested a formal briefing for Karachi’s elected representatives about the project’s progress and to explain why Karachi is not included in the current phase.
