Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka removed the observation from the judgment and forwarded the amended version to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) registrar earlier this week in a sealed envelope, a senior court official confirmed.
Sources said the judge had dictated the judgment to his stenographer, and during the first reading, expressly directed that the paragraph containing the observation be deleted. However, the stenographer inadvertently retained the paragraph and resubmitted the judgment, which was signed by the judge later in the evening.
The issue came to light after the prosecution pointed out the paragraph and moved an application seeking its deletion. The judge subsequently expunged the observation, placed a corrected copy on the judicial record, and dispatched another sealed copy to the IHC registrar.
According to sources, disciplinary proceedings have also been initiated against the stenographer, who has been served a show-cause notice.
The deleted observation appeared in para 36 on page 18 of the verdict, where the court made remarks regarding the classification of certain countries as “terrorist states” while discussing the broader context of international conduct and security narratives. The paragraph had no direct nexus with the offences on trial, which related to alleged violations of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
A day earlier, the Foreign Office distanced itself from the remarks, saying they did not reflect Pakistan’s policy and had no basis in international law.
“We have seen the judgment. These are views of the learned judge,” Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said during a weekly media briefing, when asked about the conviction of Imaan and Hadi.
“Pakistan, of course, does not subscribe to this opinion. This kind of designation of terrorist states does not exist either in UN parlance or under international law,” he added.
Judge Majoka on Jan 24 convicted Imaan and Hadi under Peca for social media posts critical of state institutions. Both were sentenced to 17 years’ rigorous imprisonment each, along with heavy fines, over posts made between 2021 and 2025 that the court deemed anti-state.</p><small>2026-01-30 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/30150458ffc25ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969903/syrian-government-kurdish-forces-announce-integration-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Syrian government, Kurdish forces announce integration deal</strong></a><br><p>The Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group declared a ceasefire deal on Friday that foresees a phased integration of Kurdish forces with the state, staving off a potentially bloody battle for the northeast.
The sides announced the agreement after government forces under President Ahmed al-Sharaa captured swathes of northern and eastern Syria from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) this month, forcing the Kurdish forces to retreat into a shrinking enclave.
The fate of the SDF, which once held a quarter or more of Syria, has been one of the biggest issues looming over the country since fighters led by Sharaa toppled President Bashar al-Assad 14 months ago.
US envoy Tom Barrack, who has been closely involved in mediation efforts, declared the agreement “a profound and historic milestone in Syria’s journey towards national reconciliation, unity, and enduring stability”.







Deal aims to unify Syria
Under the agreement, forces that had amassed on front lines in the north would pull back and Interior Ministry security forces would deploy to the centre of the cities of Hasakah and Qamishli in the northeast, both held by the SDF.
The agreement includes the formation of a military division that will include three SDF brigades, in addition to the formation of a brigade for forces in the SDF-held town of Kobani, also known as Ain al-Arab, which will be affiliated with the governorate of Aleppo.
Governing institutions established by the Kurdish-led groups in the northeast are to be merged with Syrian state institutions.
Damascus and the SDF first struck an integration deal last March, but made scant progress towards implementation before a year-end deadline, paving the way for government forces to go on the march.
Noah Bonsey, senior adviser with the International Crisis Group think-tank, said the deal was “a potentially historic turning point”.
“It looks like both sides have succeeded in defining a middle ground that works for both of them on some incredibly difficult questions,” he said.
“It spares northeast Syria what could have been a really ugly military showdown. Implementation will be tricky. There are a lot of challenges ahead,” he said, adding that he was waiting to see all the terms.
An SDF statement said the deal “aims to unify Syrian territory and achieve full integration in the region by strengthening cooperation between the concerned parties and unifying efforts to rebuild the country”.
Syrian state-run broadcaster Al-Ikhbariya published an almost identical statement, citing a government official.
A senior Syrian government official told Reuters the deal was final and had been reached late on Thursday night, and that implementation was to begin immediately.
The United States has been closely involved in efforts to mediate a deal between the sides for almost a year.
The SDF was once Washington’s main Syrian ally, helping the US military fight the Islamic State. But its position grew weaker as President Donald Trump built close ties with Sharaa.
Kurds on high alert
The areas seized by Damascus this month have included Syria’s main oil fields and important agricultural land.
The statements did not address control of the last remaining SDF-controlled border crossing to northern Iraq, known as Semalka.
The Syrian official said the Syrian state would take over all border crossings. A spokesperson from the SDF did not immediately respond to a Reuters question on the crossing.
The Syrian official said the military division in the northeast would include “groups from the SDF within brigades, alongside other brigades”.
The official said that fighters would join such brigades as “individuals” and that the whole division would be under the authority of Syria’s Defence Ministry.
There was no immediate response from the SDF to questions on the method of integration and the command structure of the brigades.
Kurds have been on high alert for a potential government push into the Kurdish-majority areas of the northeast, mindful of last year’s violence against minority Alawites and Druze.</p><small>2026-01-30 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/301219196b17661.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969894/kp-cm-afridi-reaches-sc-to-request-cjp-to-facilitate-meeting-between-imran-khan-and-physicians' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Afridi reaches SC to request CJP to facilitate meeting between Imran Khan and physicians</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Friday approached the Supreme Court to request the chief justice to facilitate a meeting between incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his personal physicians.







“The whole nation is concerned about the health of the country’s most popular leader, Imran Khan,” said Afridi while speaking outside the apex court, adding that he would try to arrange a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians with the help of the chief justice.
The KP chief executive said the party would announce its future course of action if its attempts to arrange a meeting with Imran don’t bear fruit after approaching the apex court.
He lamented that while the courts are issuing decisions on petitions, “we are not getting justice”.
“Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi’s cases have not been listed for one year. If the cases are listed today and we are provided justice, Khan sahib and Bushra Bibi, along with other leaders, will be released from prison within half an hour,” he claimed.
“We were left with no option, so we opted for the only one available,” he added.
In response to a question on concluding the protest outside Adiala jail, where the KP chief minister, along with other lawmakers and party workers, had camped, he said, “I have come here.”
Following their arrival at the SC, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and party leader and lawmaker Sardar Latif Khosa met the registrar of the apex court and the attorney general of Pakistan.
Addressing the media outside, Khosa said he reminded the registrar and the attorney general of Pakistan that the CJP should promote good practices before he retires, as “this (Imran’s case) is not only a human rights issue, but he (Imran) is also being deprived of his basic rights.”
“He (CJP) has taken an oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of the basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said.
Khosa claimed that the procedure of retina rupture did not last “20-minutes” as shared by the information minister, but “it is 2.5 hours”.
He said Imran’s health was PTI’s “red line” and any matter related to his health “will not be tolerated at any cost”.







“This is his legal and constitutional right,” added Khosa.
“I told the registrar to share our concerns with the CJP,” he said.
Meanwhile, Afridi and other party leaders staged an impromptu sit-in outside the apex court, saying they would sit there till they received a response from the registrar.
A large contingent of police, with prisoner vans, was deployed outside the SC premises.
‘Secrecy is cancer to democracy’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and party leader Babar Awan, addressing the media on Friday at Islamabad’s KP House, said the “one-point agenda” for the press conference is Imran’s health.
A day earlier, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed that incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad.
Tarar said the former premier was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
Referring to the former prime minister’s brief stay at Islamabad’s Pims hospital, he said, “Secrecy is cancer to democracy. His (Imran Khan’s) family is worried due to his health.”
Gohar demanded that doctors from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be allowed to examine the former prime minister. “Dr Faisal and Dr Asim should be allowed to meet Khan sahib.”
The party chairman added that neither the party nor Imran’s family was informed about his health or treatment.
Awan, addressing the media, said if the report regarding Imran’s health is not made public, “it will have grave consequences” and added that the party and its supporters were anxious regarding the former premier’s health.
On Thursday, Afridi rushed to Adiala jail in Rawalpindi after a report that Imran was taken briefly to Pims hospital for a medical procedure. The KP CM said he would be camping at the spot overnight outside the prison, along with the party’s general secretary, Salman Akram Raja.
However, Afridi, along with the party’s leadership, left the spot at around 3am.
Afridi, has been seeking a meeting with the incarcerated prime minister since he assumed office of the provincial chief executive in October last year, but to no avail.
However, he, as well as Imran’s sisters and lawyers, have been barred from meeting him for the past several weeks — a restriction that has made sit-ins and protests near the prison a usual occurrence. On several occasions, police have also used force to disperse the protesters, who often camp at Factory Naka.
Speaking to the media on Thursday, Afridi announced his plans for an overnight stay and said “most of [PTI] parliamentarians have also reached the spot and some others will be arriving in some time”.
The KP CM said if Imran’s sisters were allowed to meet him, the situation could be prevented from worsening.
CM Afridi’s visit comes after the PTI on Tuesday raised concerns about Imran’s health. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed earlier in the day that the PTI founder had undergone a medical procedure for an eye ailment at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad on Saturday night.
Referring to Tarar’s statement, Afridi said he had “serious reservations” about the former premier’s health.

In his letter to SHC Chief Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput dated January 27, the Muttahida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader requested the SHC CJ to constitute a judicial inquiry commission to “investigate the Gul Plaza fire incident and to dig out the root cause, negligence facts or violations of law that may have led to this unfortunate occurrence”.
A letter was issued by the high court in response to the governor’s request to constitute a judicial inquiry regarding the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
The response, dated January 28, stated that the chief justice was “pleased to record minutes that the procedure for a formal, independent inquiry into matters of public concern, typically led by a judge or legal expert, is to be appointed by the government so as to establish facts, determine responsibility and make recommendations for cases involving significant public interest, as stipulated under section 3 of the Pakistan Commissions of Inquiry Act, 2017”.
However, it added, the need for consultation with the head of an institution arose in the event where the inquiry envisioned was to be conducted by any member of that particular institution.
The letter stated that this need arose in view of the case law “reported as Abid Shahid Zuberi versus Federation of Pakistan PLD 2023 Supreme Court 493”.
“Accordingly, the entreaty made in the subject letter cannot be approved until the procedure enunciated in the above quoted statute and cited case law is not followed in the letter and spirit,” stated the response.
However, official sources in the SHC told Dawn that the Sindh government’s letter, formally requesting the court to nominate a sitting judge to conduct a judicial inquiry, was under consideration.
According to a letter from CM House to the registrar of the Sindh High Court, a cabinet sub-committee headed by Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah reviewed the matter during its meeting held on Thursday (Jan 29). The committee discussed the circumstances surrounding the fire incident at Gul Plaza and agreed that an independent judicial probe was necessary.
“In order to ensure transparency, accountability and institutional learning, the sub-committee decided that the Honourable Chief Justice of the High Court of Sindh may be requested to nominate a sitting judge of the High Court to conduct a judicial inquiry into the Gul Plaza fire incident to ascertain responsibility and regulatory lapses,” the letter stated.
The correspondence added that the inquiry would focus on fixing responsibility and examining any failures in regulatory oversight linked to the incident, which claimed multiple lives and caused extensive damage to the commercial building.
The CM House also urged the registrar to process the request promptly, stating that “an early response is solicited”.
The deadly inferno at Gul Plaza, which erupted on the night of January 17 and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
Tessori’s letter was issued amid growing calls from the opposition parties to form an inquiry commission in response to preliminary findings on the incident, which suggested that the fire was caused accidentally by a minor son of the owner of a flower shop.</p><small>2026-01-30 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/301159056378459.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969891/pm-shehbaz-announces-rs44-cut-in-electricity-rates-for-industries' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz announces Rs4.4 cut in electricity rates for industries</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday announced a Rs4.4 reduction in the per unit rate of electricity for the industrial sector in a bid to improve productivity and exports.
The premier stated this during an address to the country’s major exporters and business figures at a ceremony in Islamabad, which was held to honour their contributions.







“A Rs4.4 reduction is being made in the electricity unit rate for industries,” said the premier, adding that “if it were in his control, he would reduce it by another Rs10.”
“However, my hands are tied, as you all know well,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also announced a reduction in wheeling charges for industries, stating that “it will be less than Rs9”. He hoped that the move would help “industries sell their power to neighbouring industries”.
To provide additional relief, the premier said that “with the cooperation and support of Pakistan’s banks, we are announcing a reduction in the export refinance rate from earlier 7.5pc to 4.5pc”.
At the outset of his address, the premier lauded business leaders and major exporters for their “hard work and efficiency for achieving major milestones in their relevant sectors in the past year”.
“The billions of rupees you have earned for Pakistan, the entire nation congratulates you [on that],” PM Shehbaz said.
The premier recalled that in 2023, the country was on the brink of default.
“Day and night, there were reports that Pakistan was going to default,” he said, adding that it was a “big challenge for the nation”.
The premier recalled a meeting with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in Paris, during which she flagged Pakistan’s inconsistency during previous programmes.
He recalled the lending agency’s managing director as saying: “I was told that time was running out, and it will be difficult to offer a new structure.”
PM Shehbaz added, “I told her that I was giving her my word of honour that we will ensure implementation and commit to the agreement in letter and spirit.
“When I came back to Pakistan, she called me to tell me [..] that our team will sit down with you and you must honour the commitment you made. This is how Pakistan was saved from default.”
Shifting his attention to the present situation, PM Shehbaz continued: “At this moment, in the third quarter, our foreign exchange reserves have doubled, but that includes loans from friendly countries as well.”
PM Shehbaz detailed that he, along with Chief of Defence Forces and the Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, went to many countries for assistance, told them about the IMF programme and requested them for funds.
The premier said he was “grateful to the countries for helping, […] but you know whoever takes a loan, […] there are obligations associated with it”.
“China helped us out in the most difficult of times, as well as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar,” he said, adding that “this is how the programme was stitched”.
‘Pakistan has become a stable economy’
The premier, during his address, also stated that he could now say “without hesitation” that Pakistan’s economy had become “stable”.
PM Shehbaz noted that the inflation was in “single digits and the policy rate is at 10.5 per cent”.
The premier recalled that “there was a time when the policy rate used to be 21.5-22pc, and inflation was galloping,” adding that people did not know what was to come.
“We faced a lot of difficulties, and our industrialists and businessmen faced these difficulties head-on,” PM Shehbaz recalled. “There was hope that maybe there would come a better time, and Pakistan would be on its way to progress.”
However, he cautioned that while the “economy has stabilised, this is not enough”.
“I want to present a harsh reality to you,” he said and went on cite increased poverty and unemployment rates and the dearth of profits from current exports.
He noted that industries were struggling to compete with other countries due to higher costs.
The prime minister also acknowledged that “the government cannot dictate the private sector,” and stressed the need for moving towards sustainable growth.
“We have to grow our economy, and it has to be sustainable, and we must encourage export-led growth,” he said, stressing that there was “no other way”.
The premier also spoke in favour of encouraging small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He stressed that the private sector and the government must “hold the hand of SMEs” in order to provide support.
PM Shehbaz expressed “full faith” in business leaders’ “vision and commitment, which he said held the potential to “transform Pakistan’s economy in a few years”.
As he appreciated their role, he also announced blue passports for the exporters awarded during the ceremony and declared them “ambassadors at large”.
‘Restore PIA to its past glory’
During his address, the premier also recalled the recent privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), expressing hope that the airline would soon be restored to its “past glory”
“PIA’s legacy — ‘great people to fly with’ — was on banners in London and Brussels […] Where did that era go?” he said, adding that it used to be one of the “top ten” airlines in the world.
“I think this is what we need to revive,” he stressed.
“I have full faith that he (Arif Habib) and his partners can revive that era. I want to reiterate that once again, you have the full support of the government,” the premier said.

A consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited had won the auction for 75 per cent shares of PIA in December last year, after making a winning bid of Rs135 billion.</p><small>2026-01-30 09:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/301317497814671.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965451/its-time-public-toilets-are-treated-as-core-urban-infrastructure' target='_blank'><strong>It’s time public toilets are treated as core urban infrastructure</strong></a><br><p>As cities swell and skylines thicken, urban planning has quietly become a matter of life and health. City planning and policy decisions increasingly dictate how people breathe, move, and survive within the urban sprawl.
From walkable neighbourhoods and cycling infrastructure to accessible parks and green spaces, modern urban planning is increasingly framed as a public health intervention. Efforts to curb air and water pollution through green infrastructure, wastewater management and hygiene facilities, alongside reducing vehicle emissions by promoting public transport, all sit at the heart of healthier cities.
Equally critical is the promise of equity: fair access to housing, healthcare and mobility for all residents, not just the privileged few.
Each of these pillars warrants scrutiny in its own right.
This article, however, narrows the lens to the provision of hygiene infrastructure and specifically examines the availability and condition of public toilets in Karachi’s market areas, where the absence of basic sanitation poses a serious public health risk.
Pakistan’s toilet crisis
Access to toilets is central to safe sanitation, which is fundamental to human health and dignity. This understanding has slowly gained global traction over the past two decades, beginning with the establishment of the World Toilet Organisation in 2001 and culminating in the United Nations’ recognition of World Toilet Day in 2013, observed annually on November 19.
Together, these milestones helped catalyse a broader shift in how cities approach public toilets. Long relegated to the margins of urban planning, public toilets have begun to enter mainstream policy conversations — a shift largely driven by efforts to break the silence surrounding sanitation and recognise toilets as essential urban infrastructure.
Despite this progress, the scale of the crisis remains staggering. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef, 3.4 billion people worldwide still lack access to safe toilets. As a result, drinking water sources are routinely contaminated with human waste, leading to the spread of preventable diseases.
Each day, nearly 1,000 children under the age of five die from illnesses linked to inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene. Environmental damage is equally severe; lakes, rivers, and groundwater continue to be polluted due to insufficient sanitation infrastructure.
In Pakistan, the situation is particularly acute. An estimated 79 million people lack access to proper toilet facilities, per World Bank data. The crisis is most pronounced in rural areas, compounded by rapid population growth, weak infrastructure planning, recurring natural and man-made disasters, and shifting economic pressures. Open defecation contaminates groundwater and natural water sources, fostering bacteria and pathogens that make water unsafe for consumption.
Beyond public health, inadequate access to toilets has serious social and gendered implications. Limited or unsafe facilities disproportionately affect women, exposing them to harassment, abuse, and infection, while also forcing many to delay relieving themselves (behaviour that can result in severe medical complications). The Covid-19 pandemic and the continued emergence of infectious diseases have further underscored the importance of functional public toilets as a basic prerequisite for healthy cities.
A private struggle in a public space
Karachi, a city that contributes substantially to Pakistan’s national economy, continues to function with a strikingly minimal presence of basic public amenities. Among these, access to hygienic and dignified sanitation facilities remains severely limited. Embedding hygiene into dense urban environments requires deliberate planning aimed at providing a humane and convenient experience that can significantly enhance urban livability.
To examine this gap, a study was undertaken by the Department of Architecture and Planning at NED University, focusing on public toilet accessibility in Saddar, one of Karachi’s most prominent commercial localities. Saddar is characterised by a diverse mix of retail and wholesale activity housed within buildings of varying sizes, ages, and typologies. Its vibrancy and chaos are driven by constant flows of shoppers, vendors, workers, and vehicles, resulting in exceptionally high pedestrian and traffic density throughout the day.
The study revealed deeply concerning deficiencies in sanitation infrastructure and access to public toilets. This issue remains largely invisible because visitors and passersby may not immediately feel the absence. But for those who spend long hours in these areas, such as workers, vendors, and shoppers who stay from morning till evening, the lack of clean or even functional toilets is a daily hardship. In Pakistan, the much-discussed global “toilet revolution” has yet to meaningfully materialise.


Five key blocks in Saddar, each representing zones of high commercial activity.

For analytical clarity, Saddar was divided into five key blocks, each representing zones of high public or commercial activity. Toilet facilities located in ancillary spaces, such as petrol pumps, were also documented. The research team comprised the author alongside three student interns: Faryal Raza, Ghulam Rasool Magsi, and Khadija.
Block 1: NED University’s city campus and surroundings
The first block, encompassing NED University’s city campus, includes public toilets located within institutional premises such as SM Arts and Commerce College, the National Museum, and People’s Square. People’s Square, a pedestrianised public space, offers centrally located and reasonably maintained toilet facilities. However, these remain accessible only after 5pm, significantly limiting their utility during peak daytime hours.
Additional facilities are present near the mosque on Strachan Road, outside SM Arts and Commerce College. These are male-only and consist of three open WC stalls without doors and a single enclosed toilet. Such a layout not only raises sanitation concerns but also renders the facility entirely unusable for women.
Toilets at the National Museum, while clean and equipped with separate male and female sections, are semi-public (restricted to museum visitors or those visiting Burnes Garden), thereby limiting their role as truly public infrastructure.
Block 2: Lighthouse Market area
The Lighthouse Market area, one of Saddar’s busiest zones, is frequented by a constant stream of shoppers and vendors. Despite this, no formal public toilet facilities were identified, apart from those within a nearby mosque.
The mosque’s toilet complex includes several open WC stalls (without doors) and a limited number of enclosed units. Low partition walls, lack of women-only facilities, and poor maintenance make these toilets unsuitable. Notably, these inadequately maintained facilities are fee-based. Given the scale of commercial activity in the area, the absence of accessible public toilets is a particularly alarming finding.


Public toilets across Empress Market

Block 3: High Court and Sindh Secretariat area
Block 3 comprises the Sindh High Court (SHC) and Sindh Secretariat precinct, catering primarily to government employees, legal professionals, and visitors. Washrooms are available within the SHC premises near the entrance; however, these are semi-public and accessible only to authorised users. While these facilities are well-maintained, offering gender segregation, privacy, wheelchair accessibility, and acceptable hygiene standards, they do not cater to the broader public. Nearby areas, such as the passport office, where large crowds queue daily, remain entirely devoid of public toilet facilities.
Block 4: Zainab Market and surrounding shopping complexes
The retail hub surrounding Zainab Market, Medina City Mall, Victoria Mall, and the Leather Market was identified as Block 4. While toilets exist within these commercial buildings, their placement and design reveal that sanitation was treated as an afterthought. Facilities are typically located on upper floors, away from primary circulation areas, reducing visibility and accessibility.
Gender segregation is largely compromised, with minimal consideration for privacy or cultural norms. Circulation space within toilet areas is often restricted to the bare minimum (approximately 3ft), making movement difficult and uncomfortable. All documented stalls consisted of squatting WCs, with no alternatives for elderly users, people with disabilities, pregnant women, or children.
Medina City Mall contained the largest toilet complex, comprising 14 enclosed stalls and seven open toilets. However, only one toilet was designated for women, positioned directly at the shared entrance used by men. This arrangement reflects a disregard for privacy and cultural sensitivity, leading many women to avoid the facility altogether.
Additionally, the presence of only four washbasins is inadequate for the volume of users. Similar issues, such as a lack of gender segregation, poor sanitation, and insufficient privacy, were observed at the Leather Market and Victoria Mall.


Toilets at Jamia Masjid, Mochi Gali, Saddar

Block 5: Jahangir Park, Empress Market, and Mochi Gali
The area encompassing Jahangir Park, Empress Market, and Mochi Gali was marked Block 5. In Mochi Gali, a well-used toilet facility is located at the Jamia Masjid at the end of the lane. This is accessible from outside the masjid and includes 12 closed toilets and eight open toilets, all of which are for men and unsuitable for women due to privacy concerns. These facilities are charged per user and also face sanitation issues.
Jahangir Park, located in close proximity, has comparatively well-maintained toilet facilities that are accessible during park hours, from 10am to 10pm. The park has two entrances: one opening onto Zebunnisa Street and the other facing Empress Market. Notably, the gate towards Empress Market remains closed to prevent users from Empress Market and Mochi Gali from accessing the park’s toilets. As a result, women from these areas must walk the full length of Mochi Gali, enter the park via Zebunnisa Street, and navigate through the park to reach the facilities. While the toilets are clean, adequately sized, and inclusive, with separate male and female sections, wheelchair access, and sufficient basins, their restricted accessibility significantly undermines their function as a public amenity.
Empress Market itself lacks any dedicated toilet facilities for its users. Directly across from the market, on a footpath, there is an illegally constructed toilet complex intended for market-goers. This facility includes nine enclosed stalls and three open toilets, but its placement on a pedestrian footpath results in severe spatial congestion.


Mapping public toilets in Empress Market area

The presence of open stalls, combined with the absence of gender segregation, renders the facility largely unusable for women. Compounding these issues is the availability of only a single washbasin for all users. Despite its inadequate design and poor accessibility, the facility charges users per visit through a payment counter at the entrance.
Accessibility remains a critical concern for women in Empress Market and Mochi Gali, many of whom are compelled to rely on Jahangir Park as the only viable option for safe toilet use. Opening both entrances of the park would substantially improve access for these underserved populations and enhance the overall usability of existing infrastructure.
Restroom facilities at petrol pumps were also assessed, as these are common alternatives for the public. Some petrol pumps, particularly those near Empress Market, keep their toilets locked due to theft concerns, while others restrict use exclusively to staff. A few stations, such as those near the provincial assembly, do provide facilities accessible to women; however, regular maintenance and oversight are required to ensure continued usability.
Across Saddar, the provision of toilet facilities remains grossly inadequate when measured against pedestrian footfall and the number of people who work in and rely on these markets daily. Existing standards for public buildings typically allocate sanitation facilities in proportion to user volume, yet the findings of this study suggest that toilets are designed only to serve those in absolute desperation.
Sharing this research is intended as an appeal to citizens, developers, regulatory authorities, and property owners to reimagine public toilets as essential market-support infrastructure. A 21st-century city cannot claim to be functional or inclusive without adequate and accessible sanitation facilities for all.
A crisis that demands immediate sanitation reform
Needless to say, there is an urgent need for improvements in public toilet facilities across Saddar. The existing infrastructure, both within the blocks and at petrol pumps, fails to adequately serve the public, especially women and vulnerable groups.
Most public toilets suffer from unhygienic conditions, including contaminated water, damaged or inappropriate flooring, and flimsy structures. Important elements such as properly defined access points and legible signage are almost entirely absent. Chronic neglect has also created serious safety hazards, including exposed and unsecured wiring that raises the risk of short circuits.
Internally, cramped circulation spaces, flawed layouts that compromise privacy, and the complete absence of waiting areas severely undermine functionality. These deficiencies are not merely design oversights but operational failures that demand immediate intervention to ensure safety, dignity, and usability.
Providing well-designed, easily identifiable convenience facilities is essential to creating humane urban environments. International case studies demonstrate that effective management and maintenance are often achieved through clearly defined public-private partnerships, where private operators maintain facilities while supporting costs through attached services, commercial activity, or advertising.
In the same vein, the public sector must play a facilitative role by ensuring access to appropriate locations, utilities, and regulatory support. As a historic and commercial heart of the city, Saddar deserves public sanitation infrastructure that pays heed to the needs of its diverse and vibrant users.

According to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operations were carried out on January 29 (Thursday), in which terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan were killed.

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the term Fitna-al-Hindustan has been designated by the state for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The military’s media wing said the presence of Fitna-al-Khawarij was reported on the outskirts of Harnai district, following which an IBO was conducted in the area.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the hideout, and after an intense fire exchange, 30 India-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement added.
According to ISPR, a large cache of ammunition and explosives was found in the terrorists’ possession and was destroyed by security forces.
Separately, an IBO was also carried out in the Panjgur district, where a “terrorist hideout was busted and 11 India-sponsored terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan were neutralised”, ISPR said.
The military’s media wing further stated that weapons, ammunition and money looted in a bank robbery in Panjgur on December 15, 2025, were found in the possession of terrorists killed in the second IBO.
“The terrorists were involved in numerous terrorist activities in the past” as well, ISPR added.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other India-sponsored terrorists found in the area.”
“Relentless counter-terrorism campaign, under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the federal apex committee on National Action Plan), by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” added ISPR.
Thursday’s IBOs were carried out nearly two weeks after security forces killed 12 terrorists and effectively thwarted their attempt to create a hostage situation in Balochistan’s Kharan district during multiple operations.
An ISPR had said about the action that on January 15, “approximately 15 to 20 India-sponsored terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out multiple terrorist activities in Kharan City, District Kharan”.
“The terrorists attacked [the] City Police Station, National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited. They also looted Rs3.4 million from the banks,” ISPR said, adding that security forces effectively responded and engaged the them, prompting them to retreat.
During the ensuing clearance operation, 12 terrorists were killed in three different engagements.
More recently, on January 19, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) foiled an alleged terror plan of a banned organisation, killing five suspected terrorists during an operation in the Dasht area of Mastung district.
“A major intelligence-based operation was conducted by Quetta CTD in Dasht after receiving information about the presence of armed men,” a CTD spokesperson said at the time, adding that five suspected terrorists belonging to the proscribed Balochis­tan Liberation Army were planning to block the Quetta-Sibi Highway and carry out subversive activities.
Pakistan has been facing the problem of terrorism for long. Despite record militant deaths, the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p><small>2026-01-30 09:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/301209174f5d1c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969892/gold-slumps-4pc-as-bets-of-a-more-hawkish-fed-chair-rise' target='_blank'><strong>Gold slumps 4pc as bets of a more hawkish Fed chair rise</strong></a><br><p>Gold slid more than 4 per cent on Friday on rumours the Federal Reserve could get a more hawkish chair, but was still on track for its strongest monthly gain since 1980 as investors flocked to the safe haven amid lingering geopolitical and economic strains.
Spot gold lost 3pc to $5,232.57 per ounce, as of 05:20 GMT, after falling more than 5pc earlier. It scaled a record high of $5,594.82 on Thursday.
Prices have risen more than 20pc so far in January, heading for a sixth straight monthly gain and the largest monthly advance since 1980.
US gold futures for February delivery fell 1.8pc to $5,225.0 per ounce on Friday.
“So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar, and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,” KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer said.
US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, with speculation intensifying that the nod will go to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.
“Rumours that Kevin Warsh will replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair have weighed on gold during Asian trade,” said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at StoneX.
The dollar recovered from multi-year lows, supported in part by the Fed’s decision on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged, but was poised for a second straight weekly decline.
A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced gold more expensive for overseas buyers. Markets still expect two interest rate cuts in 2026.
Gold exports from Switzerland to the UK, home to the world’s largest over-the-counter gold trading hub, jumped to their highest since August 2019, customs data showed on Thursday.
The Hang Seng Gold ETF surged more than 9pc on its trading debut in Hong Kong in the previous session.
Spot silver slipped 3.6pc to $111.99 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $121.64 on Thursday. The metal has surged 56pc so far this month, on track for its best-ever monthly performance.
Spot platinum lost 3.7pc to $2,531.84 per ounce after hitting an all-time high of $2,918.80 on Monday, while palladium eased 4pc to $1,925.50.</p><small>2026-01-30 08:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/301244551fce73d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969896/trump-warns-britain-on-china-ties-as-starmer-hails-progress-in-beijing' target='_blank'><strong>Trump warns Britain on China ties as Starmer hails progress in Beijing</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said it was dangerous for Britain to be getting into business with Beijing, as Prime Minister Keir Starmer lauded the economic benefits of resetting relations with China during a visit there on Friday.
As Western leaders reel from Trump’s unpredictability, Starmer is the latest to head to China.
In three-hour talks with President Xi Jinping on Thursday, the British leader called for a “more sophisticated relationship” with improved market access, lower tariffs and investment deals while also discussing football and Shakespeare.

In Washington, however, replying to questions about the closer ties, Trump said, “Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that.” He was speaking to reporters ahead of the premiere of the “Melania” film at the Kennedy Center.
He did not elaborate.
Trump, who plans to travel to China in April, threatened last week to impose tariffs on Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney struck economic deals with Beijing on a recent visit.
A Downing Street spokesperson and China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Around the time of Trump’s comments, Starmer told a meeting of the UK-China Business Forum in the Chinese capital that his “very warm” meetings with Xi had provided “real progress”.

Starmer hailed deals on visa-free travel and lower whisky tariffs as “really important access, symbolic of what we’re doing with the relationship”.
“That is the way that we build the mutual trust and respect that is so important,” Starmer said.
Before heading for the financial hub of Shanghai, he met Chinese business leaders, such as Yin Tongyue, chief executive of carmaker Chery, which plans to open a research and development centre for its commercial vehicle arm in the English city of Liverpool, a city official said during Starmer’s visit.
Not choosing between US and China
Starmer, whose centre-left Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, has made improving relations with the world’s second-largest economy a priority.
His visit to China comes amid Trump’s on-off threats of trade tariffs and pledges to grab control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which have rattled long-standing US allies, Britain among them.



Because of his country’s long history of working closely with the United States, Britain could continue to strengthen economic ties with China without angering Trump, Starmer told reporters on the aeroplane en route to China.
“The relationship we have with the United States is one of the closest … we hold,” he said, enumerating areas such as defence, security, intelligence and trade.
Starmer said Britain would not have to choose between closer ties with the United States or China, highlighting Trump’s September visit to Britain that unveiled 150 billion pounds of US investment into the country.
Washington also received advanced notice of Britain’s objectives for the China trip, a British government official said on condition of anonymity as the matter is a sensitive one.
Starmer, who normally avoids criticising Trump, has been more willing to defy the US president in recent weeks.
He urged Trump to apologise for his “frankly appalling” remarks last week that some NATO troops avoided frontline combat and said he would not yield to his demands to annex Greenland.
Tough export market
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is expected to visit China soon, and Carney was preceded by French President Emmanuel Macron in December, when Xi accompanied him on a rare trip outside the capital.
“To all world leaders meeting with Xi Jinping: China sells nothing but cheap products and cheap friendships,” the Republican-led US House Foreign Affairs Committee said on X on Thursday.







Before Trump’s comments on the closer ties, his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said it was unlikely that Starmer’s efforts with China would pay off.
“The Chinese are the greatest exporters and they are very, very difficult when you’re trying to export to them,” he told reporters. “So good luck if the British are trying to export to China … it’s just unlikely.”
Asked if Trump would threaten Britain with tariffs as he did Canada, Lutnick replied, “Unless the prime minister of Britain sort of takes on the United States and says very difficult things, I doubt it.”</p><small>2026-01-30 08:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648047-41-indian-backed-terrorists-killed-in-balochistan-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>41 India-backed terrorists killed in Balochistan operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

A total of 803 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in Karachi in 2025. The Karachi traffic police, however, maintains that the situation began to improve during the latter half of the year.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that one accident occurred at 1:05am on Friday morning.
According to him, a couple and a child were on a motorcycle when a trailer hit them at the Native Jetty Bridge. They sustained critical injuries and were transported to Civil Hospital Karachi, where doctors pronounced them dead.
The victims’ identity could not be immediately ascertained.
“The errant driver managed to escape from the spot along with the heavy vehicle,” Raza said.
In another fatal accident, a man was killed in Baldia Town.
The DIG said the man was on a motorcycle when a loaded dump truck hit him at Baldia-4. He suffered critical injuries and was taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, where he was declared dead.
“The police rushed to the spot, arrested the errant driver … and impounded the heavy vehicle,” the DIG said.
In December, the Sindh government banned the daytime movement of heavy traffic vehicles in Karachi for two months as the city had witnessed a steep increase in traffic accidents, with many resulting from collisions with heavy vehicles such as dumper trucks and water tankers.
A seven-year-old boy was killed on Wednesday when a truck ran him over in Korangi’s Mehran Town area, while another seven-year-old boy was killed earlier this month by a water tanker in Karachi’s Manghopir area.
Also this month, two men lost their lives in separate reckless driving incidents when they were hit by trailer trucks, near Mowach Goth and Valika, respectively, police and rescue service officials said.</p><small>2026-01-30 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/30113417b3a3ecd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969888/kse-100-rebounds-174678-points-during-intraday-trading' target='_blank'><strong>KSE-100 rebounds 1746.78 points during intraday trading</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan benchmark index, KSE-100, rebounded slightly on Friday morning by 1746.78 points after shedding 6131.53 points on Thursday.
The benchmark index hit 184,084.90 points at 11:10 am, a 0.96 per cent increase from yesterday’s closing of 182,338.12 points.
The top active stocks so far have been K Electric Limited, rising by 0.7pc to Rs7.17 at a volume of 25,649,093, followed by Worldcall Telecom Limited, falling by 0.60pc to Rs1.66 at a volume of 18,070,396, and Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd, rising by 3.51pc to Rs62.55 at a volume of 16,775,864.
The top advancers included Apna Microfinance Bank Limited, rising 10.01pc to Rs17.92, First Tri-Star Modaraba, rising 10pc to Rs44.21, and Blessed Textiles Limited, rising 10pc to R557.66.
Yesterday’s volatility at the stock exchange was triggered by Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited’s result, which disappointed the market as earnings and a mismatch between expectations and outcomes led to panic selling, prompting investors to book recent gains and intensifying the sell-off, according to Maaz Mulla, vice president, equity sales at Topline Securities.
Analysts said 180,000 now stands as a key support level.

Pakistan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are among the Asian locations that tightened airport screening checks this week to guard against such a spread after India confirmed infections.
“The WHO considers the risk of further spread of infection from these two cases is low,” the agency told Reuters in an email on Friday, adding that India had the capacity to contain such outbreaks.
“There is no evidence yet of increased human-to-human transmission,” it said, adding that it has coordinated with Indian health authorities.
But it did not rule out further exposure to the virus, which circulates in the bat population in parts of India and neighbouring Bangladesh.
Carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, the virus can cause fever and brain inflammation. It has a fatality rate ranging from 40 per cent to 75pc, with no cure, though vaccines in development are still being tested.

 

It spreads to humans from infected bats, or fruit they contaminate, but person-to-person transmission is not easy as it typically requires prolonged contact with those infected.
Small outbreaks are not unusual and virologists say the risk to the general population remains low.
The source of infection was not yet fully understood, said the WHO. It classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen because of a lack of licensed vaccines or treatments, a high fatality rate, and a fear it could mutate into a more transmissible variant.
Nipah not new to India
The two health workers infected in India’s eastern state of West Bengal late in December are being treated in hospital, local authorities have said.







India regularly reports sporadic Nipah infections, particularly in its southern state of Kerala, regarded as one of the world’s highest-risk regions for the virus, linked to dozens of deaths since it first emerged there in 2018.
The outbreak is the seventh documented in India and the third in West Bengal, where outbreaks in 2001 and 2007 were in districts bordering Bangladesh, which reports outbreaks almost annually, the WHO said.</p><small>2026-01-30 06:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648013-preps-in-full-swing-as-lahore-gears-up-for-three-day-basant-festival' target='_blank'><strong>Preps in full swing as Lahore gears up for three-day Basant festival</strong></a><br><p>

Score: 5/7 — A solid little adventure game that’ll tug at your heart, though it may be pricey for some.
Price: Available as part of PlayStation Plus Extra subscription; $29.99 (Xbox, Steam).

Reviewed on PlayStation 5; available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC (Windows and MacOS) and Nintendo Switch.

Cats and humans have had a deep relationship for literal millennia. They are a huge part of our lives as pets, internet content or as pest control.
French studio Annapurna Interactive knew the impact cats have and decided to develop a game centred around playing as one. Right down to the stretching, napping and scratching on sofas and carpets.
I know it’s an old game, but 2022’s Stray is one of those games that feels special, not because it’s a very good cat simulator, but a solid adventure, if a short one.



Here, kitty kitty
Without a single spoken word, Stray establishes what it is right out of the gate. We’re introduced to the player character — an orange cat whom we’ll name Buttons for this review — waking up from a nap alongside his family.



The group decides to venture out of a storm drain into a post-apocalyptic world. However, Buttons unfortunately misses a jump and falls into an abandoned underground city in one of the most painful sequences of the game.
Not only does Buttons get separated from his family, but he also falls from a great height and gets injured. Poor little guy.

After a while, doors mysteriously unlock and electronic signs in the environment guide Buttons to the next area of the game. Following signs and messages, he ends up in an apartment and comes across a drone called B12, which has the consciousness of a scientist who tried to escape the city, but has lost most of his memories.
Your goal is clear: escape the city by ascending its three main levels and reunite with your family.



The opening not only communicates this, but is also emotionally impactful when you see Buttons alone in an unforgiving city with an oppressive atmosphere.
It’s not just because he’s a cat, but that feeling of being alone in an unfamiliar and dangerous place is a relatable fear. This is emphasised when pressing the dedicated “meow” button, with Buttons mewing into the void with no answer.
This impact being achieved without spoken dialogue makes it all the more impressive.



It is a pretty brief adventure, though; I managed to finish it in three hours, and that includes time spent exploring the levels.
Moreover, I was left disappointed by the ending. Without spoiling it, it was very emotional, but it was also abrupt and left several key questions unanswered. It’s a shame that they capped off such a solid experience with a subpar conclusion.
Hardcore purr-kour
At its core, Stray is a platformer in which you need to navigate the world and either find items or solve puzzles to proceed through the story.



It’s very simple: run to an area, fetch something and bring it back to progress the quest. Or move empty barrels around to reach higher ground. Rinse and repeat. However, it didn’t get repetitive, at least not in my opinion.
I think this was down to the movement. You press the jump button when the prompt appears on screen, but holding it down allows you to jump across multiple objects in a row.



It’s a lot like free running — maintaining your flow of movement without losing speed or momentum. But sometimes the prompt doesn’t appear, leaving Buttons looking like a bit of a plum.
Escalating challenges emerge throughout, from creatures called Zurks to police drones called Sentinels. Later, laser fences are introduced, forcing you to find alternate paths. Gameplay is varied enough that it doesn’t get boring.
Zurks will kill Buttons by chasing and swarming him, so you need to run past them to survive these sections. You get a weapon at one point that makes them explode, but it overheats way too quickly to be effective.



Sentinels introduce stealth sections to the game — you have to stay out of their sight, otherwise they’ll chase and shoot Buttons. But this is where I found a bit of a problem: stealth is way too easy because of how dumb these things are.
If you’re spotted, the large circle that represents their line of sight will turn red, and you’ll hear a laser charging up. But if you dart round a corner and jump into a box, the Sentinel gives up its chase. I did this right in front of one and it just floated away.



These sections become more frequent in the game’s second and third acts but offer no challenge. You’re not tested, so stealth becomes somewhat boring.
It’s a cat’s world and we’re just living in it



After the frankly heart-wrenching opening, we’re introduced to the world of Stray, which is detailed, highly interactive and immersive.
Buttons traverses a dark, abandoned city, with neon signs with arrows and text lighting up when approached, guiding the player further down the correct path.
An abandoned urban area reclaimed by nature is a bit of an overdone aesthetic in gaming, but Stray’s environments are varied, vibrant and feel lived in, like people were once here.
In the Slums, there are rusty metal sheets, messy apartments and random items and trash scattered everywhere. These are contrasted by bright neon signs, which bathe these oppressive environments with bright colours.
As you ascend, the environments get cleaner; the second main hub, Midtown, has boutiques, restaurants, a nightclub and an apartment block. Neon signs are more widespread and the place is patrolled by police robots and Sentinels.



Though the levels are easy to navigate once you get used to the layout, the immersion is amazing: the world itself is guiding you to your next objective, not an arbitrary marker on your screen. In fact, there is barely a heads-up display at all.
The game has no compass or health bar, and button prompts, though visible on specific items in the world, only appear when approached.



It makes for a very clean display, with your view as a player not obstructed by visual clutter. You can appreciate the game’s art style and environments (which are excellent by the way), allowing you to enjoy the experience more.
Stray is also devoid of any human characters and populated entirely by robots and Zurks. It’s an interesting setting since, despite being robots, they exhibit human behaviour.



They express a range of emotions, play music, and respond positively or negatively to Buttons’ mewing or nuzzling against them.
For example, when two robots are playing Mahjong, Buttons can jump on the table and disrupt the game, causing tiles to fly everywhere and the robots to grow angry. This encounter demonstrates Buttons’ impact and the game’s physics on the world.



Speaking of physics, multiple objects can be knocked off tables or interacted with in general. Walls can be scratched, and bottles and billiard balls can be knocked off tables. If there’s spilt paint and Buttons walks through it, he’ll leave little pawprints behind. It’s an impressive level of detail and interactability.



Robot’s best friend
While the world is well crafted, we need to take a look at Buttons himself, since his animations are extremely lifelike and make gameplay all the better.
During production, Annapurna put real cats into motion capture suits to record their movements and use them to animate Buttons. If the behind-the-scenes documentary was anything to go by, it was a difficult process (because they’re cats), but it paid off.

Running, jumping and other actions are well-animated, making this probably the best rendition of a cat in a game yet, purely from an animation and rendering standpoint. Even Buttons’ expressions, such as when he hisses at Zurks, are animated very well.
If Buttons rubs up against something or purrs, you can feel it through the PS5’s DualSense controller. With the haptic feedback, you feel the vibration only in certain spots. You can also hear purring and meows through the controller’s built-in speaker.

However, we can’t ignore B12. As Buttons’ companion throughout the game, he’s the player’s main source of backstory about the world, interacting with control panels and storing items. But their bond goes beyond that.
Throughout their journey, Buttons and B12 grow closer as they journey up through the various levels of the city and B12 regains his memories. The pair rescue each other on several occasions too, strengthening this bond as they try to escape the city. Again, no spoken dialogue, yet you can feel their chemistry.
Purr-fection?
Stray isn’t a perfect game by any means, but it’s one that I truly enjoyed and can recommend wholeheartedly.
It took me back to an era where gaming was simpler: there were no microtransactions, battle passes or other effects of corporate greed. It’s just you, a cat and a world to explore.
It’s a solid, well-animated experience that should be celebrated, even if it is a very short one. If you’ve got a PlayStation Plus subscription, download it; if you’re on Xbox or PC, bear in mind you’ll be paying $30 for a three-hour game.

Trump said he is speaking with Iran and left open the possibility of avoiding a military operation after earlier warning that time was “running out” for Tehran as the United States sends a large naval fleet to the region.
When asked if he would have talks with Iran, Trump told reporters: “I have had and I am planning on it.”
“We have a group headed out to a place called Iran, and hopefully we won’t have to use it,” the US president added, while speaking to media at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania.
As Brussels and Washington dialled up their rhetoric and Iran issued stark threats this week, UN chief Antonio Guterres has called for nuclear negotiations to “avoid a crisis that could have devastating consequences in the region”.
An Iranian military spokesman warned Tehran’s response to any US action would not be limited — as it was in June last year when American planes and missiles briefly joined Israel’s short air war against Iran — but would be a decisive response “delivered instantly”.
Brigadier General Mohammad Akraminia told state television US aircraft carriers have “serious vulnerabilities” and that numerous American bases in the Gulf region are “within the range of our medium-range missiles”.
“If such a miscalculation is made by the Americans, it will certainly not unfold the way Trump imagines — carrying out a quick operation and then, two hours later, tweeting that the operation is over,” he said.
An official in the Gulf, where states host US military sites, told AFP that fears of a US strike on Iran are “very clear”.
“It would bring the region into chaos, it would hurt the economy not just in the region but in the US and cause oil and gas prices to skyrocket,” the official added.
‘Protests crushed in blood’
Qatar’s leader Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian held a call to discuss “efforts being made to de-escalate tensions and establish stability,” the Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported.
The European Union, meanwhile, piled on the pressure by designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a “terrorist organisation” over a deadly crackdown on recent mass protests.
“‘Terrorist’ is indeed how you call a regime that crushes its own people’s protests in blood,” said EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, welcoming the “overdue” decision.
Though largely symbolic, the EU decision has already drawn a warning from Tehran.
Iran’s military slammed “the illogical, irresponsible and spite-driven action of the European Union”, alleging the bloc was acting out of “obedience” to Tehran’s arch-foes the United States and Israel.
Iranian officials have blamed the recent protest wave on the two countries, claiming their agents spurred “riots” and a “terrorist operation” that hijacked peaceful rallies sparked over economic grievances.
In Tehran on Thursday, citizens expressed grim resignation.
“I think the war is inevitable and a change must happen. It can be for worse, or better. I am not sure,” said a 29-year-old waitress, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
“I am not in favour of war. I just want something to happen that would result in something better.”
Another 29-year-old woman, an unemployed resident of an upscale neighbourhood in northern Tehran, told AFP: “I believe that life has highs and lows and we are now at the lowest point.”
Trump had threatened military action if protesters were killed in the anti-government demonstrations that erupted in late December and peaked on January 8 and 9.
But his more recent statements have turned to Iran’s nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb.
On Wednesday, he said “time is running out” for Tehran to make a deal, warning the US naval strike group that arrived in Middle East waters on Monday was “ready, willing and able” to hit Iran.
Iranian authorities acknowledge that thousands were killed during the protests, giving a toll of more than 3,000 deaths, but say the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by “rioters”.
Billboards and banners have gone up in the capital Tehran to bolster the authorities’ messages.

According to Justice Arbab Muham­mad Tahir’s written order, released on Thursday, Advocate Salman Akram Raja told the bench that he was unable to effectively assist in the case as he had been denied access to his client.
He said meaningful progress on key legal points could not be made without receiving direct instructions from his client.
The court noted that it had earlier directed the authorities to allow the meeting and now sought an explanation for the non-compliance.
The state counsel has been ordered to submit a detailed report before the next hearing, scheduled for Feb 24.

State counsel told to submit detailed report before next hearing on Feb 24

The petition, currently being heard by the IHC, raises constitutional and legal questions relating to freedom of expression, due process and the regulation of social media platforms.
Meanwhile, a Pakistan Telecom-mu­nication Authority report submitted to the court revealed that over the past three and a half years, the PTA made three separate requests to X to block or restrict the PTI founder’s account but received no substantive response.
The first request was sent on Aug 21, 2022, followed by another on April 18, 2024, citing court convictions in the Toshakhana, cypher and unlawful marriage cases. Despite this, X did not act on the requests.
On Nov 27, 2025, the PTA sought the blocking of 47 tweets from the PTI founder’s account, but X blocked only one.
During recent proceedings, the IHC had expressed dissatisfaction with PTA’s response and questioned how the case could proceed if counsel continued to be denied access to the PTI founder.
The court had also taken note of increasing restrictions on meetings between the former premier, his family members and party leaders.

The operation, which continued from morning till evening, was launched in the Sperka and Kotka Akbar Ali Khan areas of the tehsil and at least seven militants were inju­red in the heavy shootout. The security forces targeted the terrorists’ hideouts with more than 25 quadcopter strikes, while a heavy exchange of fire continued throughout the clashes, sources claimed.
The slain commander was identified as Zewaran alias Al-Badri, who was wanted in several cases. Following the operation, continuous surveillance by drones and helicopters was being carried out in the region to round up the remaining terrorists trying to flee the area.
According to locals, the operation also resulted in the death of three civilians, including two women, whose bodies were retrieved from a house in the afternoon. A local resident told Dawn that the deceased included Naeemullah, his mother, and his grandmother. The deceased’s son, wife, sister and cousin also sustained injuries and were taken to a hospital. Separately, Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital spokesperson Muhammad Noman told Dawn that four injured persons were brought to the hospital, including two women and two children.
Sources said the operation started in the morning and heavy contingents of police and security forces reached the area, while the residents were told to stay inside their houses.
The operation was supervised by Bannu RPO Sajjad Khan, DPO Yasir Afridi, and other senior security officials. They remained present in the field and personally monitored the action.
Earlier this week, two terrorists were killed in a shootout with police in Domel. On January 13, armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee in the district. The incident took place in the Gulbadin Landi Dak area of Bannu district.

CAIRO: The Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have accepted the estimate that approximately 71,000 Palestinians were killed during its war on Gaza, Israeli outlet Haaretz reported.
Prior to this, Israel had never officially accepted the tally and described the numbers issued by Gaza’s Health Ministry as “misleading and unreliable”, even though the UN considered them reliable.
The IDF noted the casualty count excludes missing persons likely buried under rubble and only count those killed by military fire, excluding deaths from starvation or disease due to the conflict. Over 90 per cent of casualties have been identified by name and ID number.
According to the Gaza Health Ministry, 71,667 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since Oct 7, 2023.
2 killed; prisoners swapped
Meanwhile on Thursday, Israeli forces killed at least two Palestinians in Gaza, even as Hamas and Israel move to implement the second phase of a US-brokered peace plan.
Medics said two men were killed by Israeli fire in eastern Khan Younis, in an area adjacent to where the army operates.
According to the Gaza health ministry, Israeli airstrikes, tank shelling and gunfire have killed at least 490 people since the truce took effect in October. Israel said four soldiers have been killed by Palestinian groups in the coastal territory over the same period.
By advancing to phase two, the US and mediator partners Egypt and Qatar must confront the contentious issue of Hamas disarmament, which the group has long rejected.

 

Separately, the Red Cross said it facilitated the transfer of 15 Palestinian bodies to the Gaza Strip on Thursday after the last prisoner held in the territory was returned to Israel earlier this week.
Palestinian statehood
Meanwhile, Pakistan reaffirmed its demand for a credible, time-bound path to Palestinian statehood on Wednesday.







Speaking at a Security Council open debate, Pakistan’s Permanent Repres­entative to the United Nations Asim Iftikhar Ahmad emphasised that the unresolved question of sovereignty lies at the heart of Middle East instability.
Mr Ahmad strongly condemned Israeli actions against UN facilities, including the recent demolition of a UN compound in Sheikh Jarrah, stressing that such acts undermine stabilisation efforts.
He urged an immediate end to illegal settlement activity and attempts to alter the demographic, legal or historical character of the occupied territory.

ISLAMABAD: Iran’s ambassador to Pakistan, Dr Reza Amiri Moghaddam, has said that Tehran would accept dialogue only if it results in a win-win outcome.
He also acknowledged that Iran was ready for talks ‘if approached’, but warned that if war was imposed, “the Islamic Republic would respond in the same coin against any enemy”.
The ambassador was briefing the media at the Iranian Embassy on Thursday about the official findings related to the recent protests in the country. He said peaceful protests were hijacked by conspirators and acknowledged that some Iranians were also involved in the conspiracy.
The envoy emphasised that the extensive imposition of unilateral sanctions and coercive measures has a direct and adverse impact on the economic, social and cultural rights of the Iranian people.
Detailing the background of the situation, he said that on Sunday, December 28, 2025, sector-based protest gatherings began in Tehran’s Bazaar following an increase in foreign exchange rates.
The primary demand of the protesters was the restoration of stability in the market, he said, adding that the agents of the US and Israel later infiltrated the gatherings, resorted to violence and carried out arson by mingling with traders and peaceful demonstrators.
“The Zionist regime seeks to exploit every opportunity to sow division within Iranian society and undermine national cohesion,” he added.
The ambassador said statements and actions by the prime minister of the Zionist regime, as well as certain extremist and hardline American officials, were aimed at inciting violence, terrorism and criminal acts.
He said at the same time dissenters exploited the protests through foreign interference to create turmoil and unrest in the country.
“Some organised gangs and groups, along with foreign-backed terrorist and secessionist elements, diverted the protests into violent and armed clashes with law-enforcement forces and civilians,” he said, adding that these acts had no connection with the legitimate economic demands of the protesters and were neither endorsed nor supported by the majority of the population.
The briefing also referred to a message posted on X by former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo stating: “Happy New Year to every Iranian in the streets, also to every Mossad agents walking beside them.”
The ambassador said that the Iranian people became aware of the true intentions behind the acts of arson and sabotage, and citizens of Islamic Republic came out on Monday, January 12, 2026 to demonstrate in support of the government.
‘Iran is an open country’
Meanwhile, responding to a query about the recurring resurgence of foreign saboteur networks in Iran, an Iranian diplomat told Dawn that Iran is an open country with a large number of tourists and a sizeable diaspora, adding that some individuals abroad fall prey to conspirators in Western countries.
Details of the damages caused during the unrest were also shared, including destruction of two churches, 200 schools, 15 libraries, 350 mosques, hundreds of ambulances, and numerous government and private buildings and properties.
The Iranian ambassador said the government had taken tangible and positive steps to address the root causes of economic and social concerns. He added that support packages for vulnerable groups had been implemented and consultative meetings held with representatives of guilds, bazaar unions and business communities in major cities.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday opposed the use of force and coercive measures against Iran, stressing that disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy as Western pressure on Tehran intensified with a continuing US naval build-up in the Gulf and fresh European designations and sanctions.
The Pakistani position was articulated across official engagements and public statements, including a telephone call bet­ween Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Iranian President Masoud Pezesh­kian, con­­tacts between the two foreign ministers, and remarks by the Foreign Off­ice spo­kesperson at the media briefing.
In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz “underscored the importance of sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement for promoting peace, security and development in the region”.







Separately, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi, conveying concern over the evolving situation and reiterating Pakistan’s position.
Mr Dar “expressed concern over the evolving regional situation and underscored that dialogue and diplomacy remain the only viable way forward”, the Foreign Office said in a statement.







At the weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Andrabi expanded on Islamabad’s stance, linking it explicitly to opposition to force, sanctions and external pressure.
“Pakistan has always advocated for peace and diplomacy to settle all outstanding issues. Our advocacy for peace diplomacy continues and this remains our stated position,” he said. “This region cannot afford war, turmoil because this in essence stops the economic development and prosperity. So, we hope that peace and diplomacy will prevail. We oppose the use of force. We are against coercive measures against Iran and interference in its internal affairs,” he added.
Referring to the nuclear issue and multilateral diplomacy, the spokesman said Pakistan supported efforts anch­ored in international law, citing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and subsequent UN Security Council resolutions, including resolutions presented at the Council in September last year.
He also cited a recent UN Human Rights Council resolution on Iran that opposed the use of force and called for upholding the UN Charter, noting that “we subscribe to these positions, and we will continue to do so”.
Islamabad’s emphasis on dialogue came as the European Union significantly hardened its stance on Iran and the build-up of US forces in the Gulf continued.

 

EU foreign ministers on Thursday unanimously agreed to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation. At the same time, the Council of the European Union adopted a fresh sanctions package over human rights violations and Iran’s military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, adding 15 individuals and six entities to its blacklist.
Moreover, a significant American military build-up in the Middle East is underway, which has been described by analysts as the largest since the 2025 strikes.
The US has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, accompanied by three destroyers and more than 5,000 troops, joining existing assets including F-15E Strike Eagles and THAAD and Patriot missile systems, raising total US forces in the region to around 50,000 by late January.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration is hosting senior defence and intelligence officials from Israel and Saudi Arabia for talks on Iran this week, American news website Axios reported on Thursday.
‘Crushing response’
Iran’s army chief Amir Hatami on Thursday vowed a “crushing response” to any attack, according to state television, which reported 1,000 “strategic drones” had joined the combat regiments.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman have pressed for dialogue while signalling they will not allow their airspace, territory or waters to be used for military action against Iran, because of fears of retaliation and economic disruption.
Turkiye on Thursday said it would offer to mediate between Washington and Tehran during an upcoming visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, after Ankara’s top diplomat urged Washington to start nuclear talks with Tehran.
“It’s wrong to attack Iran. It’s wrong to start the war again. Iran is ready to negotiate on the nuclear file again,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Al-Jazeera.
Nato member Turkiye is also weighing contingency plans along its 530-kilometre border with Iran should the dispute escalate, a senior official told AFP.
Iran ally Russia on Thursday also said that “the potential for negotiations is not exhausted”.
“Any use of force can only create chaos in the region and lead to very dangerous consequences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty in a call with his French counterpart Jean-Noel Barrot stressed the need for “the resumption of dialogue between the United States and Iran regarding the Iranian nuclear file”, Cairo said.

At a public hearing presided over by legal member of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), Amina Ahmed, the government also reported that it was working on another tariff package under which unutilised electricity would be offered at marginal cost — the actual cost of power supply — to various consumer categories during day time to absorb surplus capacity because of low demand amid rising solar penetration.
“The government is currently working on various options to offer an incentive tariff package (as an alternative to growing net metering), and soon we will approach Nepra for approval”, after its clearance from the federal cabinet, said an official of Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) of the Power Division.
He was responding to Nepra member Maqsood Anwar Khan, who asked whether the government intended to address the widening gap between day and night utilisation of grid electricity, as net-metered consumers draw from the grid at night. Officials cited a low of around 8,261MW and a peak of 14,888MW in Dec.

Consumers in for Rs1.41 per unit hike in February

A CPPA official said the consumers enjoyed a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of 93 paise per unit in January on account of consumption in November, which had come to an end. He said power distribution companies (Discos) would now need 48 paise per unit additional FCA on account of December consumption, resulting in a net increase of Rs1.41 per unit to be charged to consumers in February billing.

 

They confirmed that the higher FCA cost was mainly due to an incremental incentive package that increased consumption by about half a billion units, resulting in the need for utilisation of expensive power plants, given the limitations of hydropower and nuclear plants. On average, consumption in December was 6.5 per cent higher than in November and 8.47pc higher than in December 2024, while annual growth in demand was reported at 2.45pc.
Industrial representatives Rehan Javed and Amir Shaikh challenged a 22pc growth in consumption by the industrial sector on account of a three-year incremental incentive package claimed by the CPPA and PPMC officials and argued that official data was not based on facts.

Commodore Muhammad Yasir Tahir of Pakistan Navy assumed command from Commodore Fahad S. Al Joaid of the Royal Saudi Naval Forces (RSNF).
According to a press release shared by the Pakistan Navy on Thursday, while addressing the audience, the incoming Commander CTF-150 assured that his team is fully prepared to shoulder this prestigious responsibility and contribute towards maritime security and stability across the region.







Commodore Muhammad Yasir Tahir also reaffirmed Pakistan Navy’s resolve to counter illicit maritime activities while ensuring the safety and security of vital sea lines of communication.
CTF-150 is one of the five task forces operating under the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF). Its mission is to deter and disrupt non-state actors engaged in the trafficking of weapons, narcotics and other illicit goods across the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman.
Successful anti-narcotics operations conducted by Pakistan Navy ships during the RSNF’s command of CTF-150 are a testament to Pakistan Navy’s resolve and commitment to regional peace and security through collaborative maritime efforts.
The change of command ceremony was attended by the Ambassador of Pakistan to Bahrain, Mr Saqib Rauf, Comm­ander of Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), Vice Admiral Curt A. Renshaw, Commander of Royal Bahrain Naval Forces, Rear Admiral Ahmed Mohamed Ebrahim Al Bin Ali and representatives of several other navies operating under the CMF.

PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir witness the exchange of PIA’s privatisation documents.—White Star

• PM says airline’s ‘glory days’ to return under Arif Habib-led consortium• NA panel seeks detailed report on PIA accord, employee safeguards
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the “glory days” of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) would return under the new management, as the government signed transaction documents for the airline’s privatisation.
“PIA will reach new heights under the leadership of the Arif Habib Consortium. The airline will improve its performance, punctuality, cabin service and professional standards,” the prime minister said while speaking at the signing ceremony.
The ceremony was attended by Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and federal ministers.







PM Shehbaz congratulated the nation on the signing of the transaction and said Arif Habib and his team were among Pakistan’s “distinguished business ambassadors” who had contributed to the country’s progress. He said the new owners’ first priority would be passenger comfort and safety.
Recalling the airline’s past, the prime minister said PIA had been at its peak in the 1960s, with a recognised presence across Pakistan and in world capitals. He also praised the role of federal ministers and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali in completing the transaction.
The prime minister said the privatisation process was conducted transparently and telecast live. He said the bidding closed at Rs180 billion, of which the consortium would spend Rs135bn on improving PIA.
He hoped that the new PIA owners would help the airline regain its past glory through “untiring efforts and innovation”.
Mr Ali explained the salient features of PIA’s privatisation and said the public would benefit from improved services.
NA body seeks details
Meanwhile, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation on Thursday sought further clarification and comprehensive information on the transaction from the Privatisation Commission.
Chaired by Dr Muhammad Farooq Sattar, the committee asked the commission to submit a comprehensive report at its next meeting, including employee participation, consultation mechanisms and grievance redress.
The meeting was convened to review ongoing privatisation transactions. The secretary of the privatisation ministry briefed the committee on the PIA process, including its stages and the current status of the deal.
The committee was also briefed by the power ministry on the installation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) meters.
It was told that as of Jan 9, a total of 1,614,296 AMI meters had been installed across distribution companies, surpassing the target of 1.5 million.
The panel was also briefed on Pakistan Re-Insurance Company Limited (PRCL), which is listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange and remains majority-owned by the government.
The committee was told that PRCL is planned for partial privatisation through a secondary public offering, but the transaction has been deferred due to unfavourable market conditions and valuation concerns.
Regarding Sukkur Electric Power Company Limited (Sepco), the committee was informed that the government was considering private-sector participation as part of power sector reforms, given the utility’s high losses, weak recovery and governance issues.
Outright privatisation was not considered feasible at this stage, while options under consideration included a management contract or partial privatisation, supported by preparatory reforms and financial restructuring.
The committee str­essed that consumer protection, Nepra oversight and employee safeguards must remain integral to any reform process.

The border closure triggered sharp revenue losses for KP as the collection of infrastructure development cess (IDC) fell to Rs3.48 billion, from Rs7.42bn, during the first seven months of the current fiscal year over the corresponding period of last year.
Muzammil Aslam, the KP chief minister’s finance adviser, has written a four-page letter to Commerce Minister Jam Kamal, seeking an urgent meeting of provincial and federal stakeholders.
The meeting is expected to deliberate on the revenue implications for KP and the challenges faced by exporters and traders, including stuck payments and the loss of business activity.

Collection of cess has dropped to Rs3.48bn in 7MFY26 from Rs7.42bn

The provincial government has already constituted a revenue review committee to examine the situation and found an alarming decline in IDC since suspension of the border trade.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan remain heavily concentrated at Torkham and Ghulam Khan, while trade through Kharlachi and Angoor Adda, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, continues to decline, indicating a post-Taliban shift in cross-border trade patterns. Torkham’s growth reflects its role as the gateway to Afghanistan’s key consumption centres, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border stations accounting for nearly 80 per cent of total exports in FY25.
Prolonged disruption
Mr Muzammil informed the federal commerce ministry that the prolonged border disruption was creating serious revenue, economic, and employment consequences for the province. He said revenue shortfall has emerged as a major blow to provincial finances.
He said the initial disruption in cess collection had originated from a court stay order, which was resolved in November. Recovery efforts were launched immediately after the legal hurdle was removed.
But those efforts failed to produce results as cross-border trade remained suspended, effectively bringing commercial activity to a standstill.

 

The adviser further pointed out that exporters and traders now face consignments and payments stranded across the border, intensifying liquidity pressures across the trading community.
The financial stress has left many businesses unable to meet their statutory cess obligations because of the sudden and prolonged trade suspension.
Muzammil Aslam further pointed out that the decline in IDC collection is visible each month, with particularly steep drops recorded since October, when receipts fell from Rs1.3bn to under Rs487 million. In November, collections dropped to just Rs198m from Rs1.29bn during the same month in FY25.
The collection of cess is directly linked to the movement of goods across borders and commercial activity. With trade suspended, achieving collection targets has become virtually impossible.
Traders’ grievances
Mr Muzammil also spoke about problems faced by traders. “They have genuine difficulty in making payments because they are unable to receive funds from buyers due to the overall stagnation of cross-border business.
“This situation is beyond the control of both traders and tax collectors and may result in a broader slowdown in economic activity across the province if trade disruptions continue.”

“Any audit observation made by the Auditor Gen­eral in relation to the accounts of, e.g., the Inland Revenue Department or the FBR or any other governmental entity or any authority or body established by the federation or a province cannot form the basis of enabling or allowing any tax authority exercising powers and performing functions under a fiscal statute to regard that observation as information that would allow for the audit or inspection of the accounts or activities of a taxpayer or sustain the issuance of any notice or initiation of any proceedings under the fiscal statute,” affirmed Justice Munib Akhtar.
Headed by Justice Akhtar, a two-member bench had taken up an appeal against the July 7, 2025, Peshawar High Court’s (PHC) quashing of proceedings against the private company Diamond Filling and CNG Station, Peshawar. The direction came in a sales tax case that was moved by the Inland Revenue commissioner, Peshawar, against the high court decision.
The tax department had initiated proceedings against the private CNG station based on audit observations made by the Director General of Revenue Receipt Audit (DGRRA), a wing of the Auditor General’s office.

Justice Munib Akhtar notes auditor general acts under 2001 ordinance, while tax authorities operate under fiscal statute; both are separate, work in own domains

In his six-page judgement, the judge explained the reason for the observation by stating that it was a well-settled rule that what “cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly.”
What is properly within the scope, powers, and authority of the Auditor General acting under the 2001 Ordinance, on the one hand, and of the tax authorities under a fiscal statute, on the other, are separate and operate within their own spheres, he emphasised, adding that they constitute distinct compartments that do not overlap.
The judgement explained that Article 169 of the Constitution mandated that the Auditor General of Pakistan, in relation to the accounts of the federation and the provinces, shall perform such functions and exercise such powers as may be determined by federal law.
The statute currently in the field is the Auditor General’s (Functions, Powers, Terms and Conditions of Service) Ordinance, 2001. It appears that while exercising such powers in relation to the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and in particular the Inland Revenue Department in relation to sales tax, an officer of the Auditor General, the DGRRA, made an audit observation against the CNG company, on the basis of which the officer concerned of sales tax issued a show-cause notice on March 9, 2023, under Section 11(2) of the Sales Tax Act (STA) 1990.
Being unsatisfied, the CNG station moved against the order for the recovery of sales tax by filing an appeal before the commissioner (appeals). That appeal succeeded, and when the commissioner took the matter to the appellate tribunal, the decision of the commissioner (appeals) was upheld on Oct 24, 2024. The department then took the matter in a tax reference to the PHC, which was dismissed.
The judgement said that to stretch the provision in the manner attempted by the department — to include private sector entities in its scope and thereby allow for their audit for fiscal purposes by the auditor general — was to completely misread, misunderstand, and misapply the provision. 
In the end, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal by the Inland Revenue commissioner.

An office-bearer of a traders’ association said India “has now opened an economic front”, after facing defeat on the battlefield, by signing trade deals with several countries and the European Union.
Saquib Fayyaz Magoon, chairman of the Businessmen Panel Progressive (BMPP) and vice president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), cautioned that the agreement could erode Pakistan’s competitive edge in European markets.
Despite Pakistan’s GSP Plus status, which allows duty-free access for nearly 80 per cent of its exports to the EU, the country’s textile exports stand at $6.2 billion, marginally ahead of India’s $5.6bn exports even though the latter faces a 12 per cent tariff.
“Once India secures zero-rated access under the EU deal, Pakistan’s advantage will vanish and our exports could suffer a severe blow,” Saquib Magoon warned.

Traders fear Pakistan could lose its ‘competitive edge’ if govt doesn’t take urgent measures

He feels Pakistan could lose its foothold in the European market if urgent corrective measures are not taken. “Once a market is lost, regaining entry becomes extremely difficult,” he said, urging the government to act decisively.
Magoon called for reducing power tariff to nine cents per unit, simplifying the tax regime, and offering incentives to exporters. “The government must declare an export emergency and adopt industry-friendly policies to safeguard the country’s economic interests.”
Drawing a parallel with military success, Mr Magoon observed: “Just as the armed forces secured victory on the battlefield, the business community now needs government support to win this economic war.”
A representative of JS Global said the EU and India had concluded the agreement after two decades of negotiations. Its upshot is that India’s textile and garment products would now “enjoy a reduction, or even elimination of tariff altogether, in EU states”.
India’s textile and garment exports are currently subject to an eight to 12pc tariff under the GSP regime (which was suspended last week), while Pakistan enjoys zero tariffs under the GSP Plus status.
With the FTA now in place, Pakistan is likely to lose its advantage, which was already thin, as India benefits from higher value addition and “vertical integration”, JS Global said.
The company fears the deal would hit Pakistan’s exports, 24pc of which go to the EU. The bloc remains the top destination for textile exports after the USA.
Price undercutting
Faisal Arshad, who heads the Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMA), said India-EU FTA could lead to aggressive price undercutting by Indian exporters in the EU market, an erosion of Pakistan’s market share in hosiery, knitwear, and value-added garments. This would have a knock-on effect in the form of an increased pressure on export margins, employment, and sector sustainability.
He cautioned that Pakistan’s reliance on GSP+ alone is no longer sufficient to safeguard its exports. “Tariff-free access without recognition of compliance and cost burdens creates an uneven playing field.
“Pakistan must not be disadvantaged for adhering to international conventions while competing with countries that do not face similar obligations,” Faisal Arshad said.
The PHMA chief urged the government to immediately take corrective measures, including rationalisation of power tariffs for export-oriented industries, provision of competitive financing and export refinancing schemes.
“If India secures FTA access while Pakistan’s structural cost disadvantages remain unaddressed, our textile exports will suffer,” he said. “Strategic and timely policy intervention is essential to protect exports and jobs.”
Tough conditions
According to Mr Arshad, Pakistan’s GSP+ access comes with strict conditionalities. “We are required to ratify, implement, and continuously report on compliance with 27 international conventions related to human rights, labour standards, environment, and governance.”
In contrast, the PHMA chairman observed, India’s market access under the FTA does not carry the same obligations.
He said Indian manufacturers benefit from cheaper energy, lower financing costs, large-scale manufacturing, integrated supply chains, and stronger logistics infrastructure.
“When tariff equality is combined with lower production costs and fewer compliance obligations, the competitive gap widens substantially against Pakistan,” Faisal Arshad added.

Presiding over a high-level meeting, the minister directed the National Highway Authority (NHA) to begin construction of the Sialkot-Kartarpur Motorway, which will be named “Guru Nanak Expressway”. He said three-star, four-star and five-star hotels would be developed along the highway to facilitate pilgrims.  
To encourage investment from the global Sikh community, the NHA will launch international marketing campaigns in London, Canada and the United States, he added.  
The minister said the projects would be showcased at international roadshows to attract foreign direct investment. “These projects will be a game-changer for the region,” he said.  
Aleem Khan said the new expressway would bring significant socio-economic benefits to nearby towns, including Narang Mandi and Badu Malhi.  
The NHA has also been tasked with ensuring the construction of state-of-the-art rest areas and shopping malls along the routes.

In a statement, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said that the Bangladeshi carrier returned to Karachi after 14 years and was given a traditional water cannon salute upon landing.
The authority hailed the flight as “a new chapter” in the relationship between the two countries.
Data from FlightRadar24 showed Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight BG341 landed in Karachi at 11:03pm, having departed Dhaka at 8:15pm.
Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori spoke to the press at the airport, stating that cooperation with Bangladesh would not be limited to aviation but would extend to other sectors.
“I absolutely want to say that today, after several years, the conspiracies have died,” Tessori said, holding India responsible for “driving a wedge” between the people of Pakistan and Bangladesh.
He further said that India was responsible for terrorism in Pakistan and was also “conspiring against Bangladesh”.
“I congratulate the people of Bangladesh, for they have not only defeated the Indian conspiracies but also exposed them,” he said. The governor added that India had been unfair to Bangladesh in cricket as well, saying it was “out in the open”.
“The love between Pakistan and Bangladesh will grow because I know that the Bangladeshi people love Pakistanis,” Tessori stated. “This love will transform through trade and cooperation, and we will fight these Indian extremists together.”
Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s High Commission in Dhaka had released a statement, saying that the “fully packed” inaugural flight had departed from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka.
The flight was seen off by Bangladesh Civil Aviation and Tourism Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, High Commissioner of Pakistan to Bangladesh Imran Haider and other officials, the statement said.
“The resumption of direct flight after a hiatus of 14 years marks a significant milestone in strengthening connectivity and bilateral engagement,” it said.







Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Bangladesh’s adviser for civil aviation and tourism underscored the importance of the Dhaka–Karachi route in “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”.
The statement quoted him as saying, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people.”
He expressed hope that people of Bangladesh will visit Pakistan and explore its natural beauty, cultural heritage and diverse cuisines, it added.
During the ceremony, Pakistan’s high commissioner recalled the vision of Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh’s interim leader, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “aimed at enhancing connectivity between Pakistan and Bangladesh”.
“In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries, during the visit of the Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar to Dhaka in August last year, both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” the statement quoted him as saying.
He also expressed gratitude to the government of Bangladesh, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, and the Civil Aviation Authority for making the launch of the flight possible, the statement said.
“Passengers travelling on the inaugural flight expressed happiness and enthusiasm over the restoration of the direct air link, describing it as a milestone towards bringing the two countries closer,” the statement added.
Earlier this month, it was announced that both countries would resume direct flight operations after a 14-year hiatus.</p><small>2026-01-29 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647966-cm-maryam-orders-arrest-of-wasa-official-others-over-lahore-manhole-deaths' target='_blank'><strong>CM Maryam orders arrest of Wasa official, others over Lahore manhole deaths</strong></a><br><p>
