Ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government being toppled in August of last year, there has been a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
Dar embarked on a “historic visit to Bangladesh” today, the FO said on X, as the deputy premier departed from the Nur Khan Airbase in Rawalpindi. “In Dhaka, he will hold important meetings with Bangladeshi leaders,” it added.
“The visit is a significant milestone in Pakistan-Bangladesh relations as a Pakistani foreign minister is visiting Bangladesh after a gap of around 13 years,” the FO highlighted.
 






The last time a foreign minister paid an official visit to Dhaka was in November 2012, when Hina Rabbani Khar made a six-hour visit to Bangladesh to formally invite then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina to a summit in Islamabad later that month.
 
 

During his trip, Dar will hold important meetings with various Bangladeshi leaders, including Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus and Adviser for Foreign Affairs Touhid Hossain, according to a statement by FO.
“The whole range of bilateral relations and a number of regional and international issues will be discussed during these meetings.”
The meetings are likely to take place tomorrow, according to Bangladeshi news outlet BSS.
The visit is expected to see the signing of four to five memorandums of understanding (MoUs) to strengthen bilateral ties in the fields of trade, culture, media, training, and travel, a senior official of Bangladesh’s foreign ministry told BSS.
Dar’s visit comes on the heels of Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan’s official tour to Dhaka, where he met Bangladesh’s advisers for commerce and industries.
 
 

Islamabad and Dhaka are in the process of establishing a joint working group on trade to enhance the economic ties and foster greater cooperation in trade, according to the commerce ministry.
The two countries started direct government-to-government trade in February with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice, while Fly Jinnah has also secured approval to operate flights from Karachi to Dhaka.
Diplomatic ties were rekindled after 15 years in April with the visit of Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch for Foreign Office Consultations (FOC).
Last month, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka, Paki­stan and Bangladesh agreed to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side.</p><small>2025-08-23 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22172257c269580.gif' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932371/the-rain-that-laid-bare-karachis-vulnerabilities-and-my-own' target='_blank'><strong>The rain that laid bare Karachi’s vulnerabilities … and my own</strong></a><br><p>It was almost deja vu. We’d walked through this foul water before. Felt our way through barely recognisable streets from memory. When you live in a city like Karachi, it almost begins to feel normal. And yet, nothing can get you used to the fact that you — the privileged you, who has made a living out of writing on the city’s myriad governance issues — will be among the thousands stranded in water-clogged streets as you experience it in real time. Time and again.
In 2020, when Karachi witnessed one of its worst floods in decades — it can’t definitively be the worst because we like beating our own records — my dad and I walked back home, to Garden West, from I.I. Chundrigar Road in waist-high floodwaters.
At 55, my father was surprisingly surefooted with the stride of a mountain goat. He dragged me through the deluge, all the while making sure to keep an eye open for potholes, ragged stones and bare electric wires. He even cracked a joke here and there to ensure that the neurotransmitters in my brain remained balanced.
Five years on, as we relived the ordeal, wading through a mix of sewerage and rain water on the night of August 19, it suddenly dawned on me how drastically things had changed. The roles had reversed, and I hadn’t even realised it until we were in the thick of the storm.
Over 150mm of rain and Karachi had once again sunk. Why that happens every time and what the authorities are doing about it are questions all of us Karachiites ask every monsoon season. By now, we have come up with newer and better questions: Why does the mayor keep pretending all is well even as thousands of Karachi’s citizens remain stranded? Why can’t we plan better? Is it getting worse with each passing year? Is this the new normal?
Unfortunately, nothing has changed about the responses. It is a tale told and heard a gazillion times: “Jab zyada barish ati hay to zyada pani ata hay.”
 

A cloudy sky captured from the roof of my house.

I have been told I don’t learn from my mistakes (I get that from my dad), and so, living up to the reputation, I was at my workplace at 10am sharp on Tuesday. It had already begun raining before I logged onto my computer. The weather apps flashed red with warnings of rain that was going to last the entire day. But I was unfazed.
When are these predictions ever accurate? So I got to work, resolute and focused to file the story that was sitting in my drafts for days. At around 1pm, my boss came in and cautioned of an impending rainstorm. “Leave now,” he warned.
I brushed him off initially, but then it did start raining quite heavily. By 3pm, the sky was hidden behind thick and dark clouds, intimidating us. I immediately called my dad. “What’s the plan?” I asked him. He told me to stay put, his soothing voice devoid of any worry or anxiety.
And that’s exactly what I did. Even when nerves got the best of my colleagues, I remained calm. “Abba hain naa,” I thought to myself. You see, my father and I are partners in crime and despair. And in my head, it was supposed to stay the same forever; he would handle everything, he was invincible, and age, well, that was just a number.
 

Heavy, very heavy, downpour.

Little did I know that this city was going to prove me painfully wrong. It gets to the strongest of us.
By 6pm, panic had started to settle into our building. There was a mess outside — a massive traffic jam, inundated roads and a downpour that just wouldn’t stop. And then, to make matters worse, the power went out. As the clock struck 8pm, the water levels on the main arteries had risen significantly, and it was pitch black.
I got a call. Father was downstairs. I was told to leave my bag upstairs and come with essentials — mobile phone and spectacles — tightly packed in a plastic bag. I did as told, and when I got to the main gate of our building, my lanky dad stood in drenched clothes and jeans folded up to his knees. He had already done some walking.
He was smiling his usual toothy smile, but the stress lines were evident on his face. There was no way to get home but to walk. He gripped my hand and we began the long journey ahead of us.
As we waded through the waters in front of Shaheen Complex, mixed with a bit of everything from rainwater to raw effluent, a feeling of disgust crept through me. Immediately, my father’s hand tightened around mine, this time not to give support but to take it as his foot got entangled in a floating plastic bag.
 

The main I.I. Chundrigar Road is inundated.

At 60, he was recently diagnosed with Carpal tunnel syndrome — a condition caused when the median nerve, in the carpal tunnel of the wrist, becomes compressed.
He kept losing his footing, almost falling twice if I hadn’t caught him in time. When he almost stepped on a bare electric wire, I didn’t hold back in scolding him, and henceforth made sure to make a small announcement every time I saw one.
These announcements continued even when a slope or steps came along the way. “Acha acha, baap ko mat sikhao,” he would say, laughing it off while also listening intently. At some instances, especially when we moved from a footpath to the main road, I took the first step to make sure that the ground beneath was solid, feeling with my feet where the eyes couldn’t see through the murky water.
In a few spots, I fumbled and almost fell headfirst into the water, but, miraculously, I ended up restoring my balance and that of my father. Later at night, I saw how these instances had left red scars on my feet.
In other places, when I faltered, strangers, who were probably as vulnerable as we were in that moment, signalled an open manhole, a leaking drain or a rocky crater. Even when nothing was said, their presence alone was comforting.
 

Two men push a rickshaw through flooded streets.

We were all one, abandoned in our struggle against a force we had no control over. A man dragging his wife on a motorcycle through the inundated streets. A group of chador-clad women walking back home, cursing at every passing car that splashed water on them. A father and daughter, walking almost two hours to get home, otherwise a 20-minute drive.
When we finally got to the road opposite the Pearl Continental Hotel, the water on the roads receded from our waists down to our toes. At first, we tried to stop a rickshaw, but every one of them was occupied. Some stopped in a frenzy, not to give us a ride, but to ask for directions.
So we continued our trek. There were moments when I would walk fast, too fast for dad to keep pace. I could see him heaving, out of breath, but not saying anything, and so I would slow down, the same way he did five years ago.
 

Wading through knee-deep waters on the Ziauddin Ahmed Road.

After walking for 10 more minutes, we stopped outside a shut-down bank along the route to take shelter under a leaky makeshift shed. By then, the rain was accompanied by gusts of strong wind, and so a break was necessary. We stood there, both looking intently at the road and the cars passing by, trying to gauge the velocity of the rain droplets.
Suddenly, a man, attired in the uniform of a security guard, walked up to us. “Sir, ma’am, please take our seats,” he offered in the sweetest tone. We refused politely, but he was so insistent that my father had to give in. A few minutes later, he brought two glasses of water. It was later that I realised how this small act of kindness helped dad cover a long distance on foot.
To think of it, he understood it before I did — I was the one in charge now; looking out for potholes, stones, and bare electric wires, cracking a joke now and then, and criticising the administration that was nowhere to be seen.
When we finally reached the Abdullah Shah Ghazi shrine — which is just a few kilometres from my current residence — we stopped. I was tired and worn out. So was he, but he tried his best not to show it. We decided to get a ride home. Fortunately, we were lucky to find one.
Had my father been in the lead, he would have made sure that both of us walked all the way, that he didn’t show his fatigue to me, and that he reclaimed his title of being the saviour for the umpteenth time. I may be his daughter, but I am not him, no matter how much we resemble, both physically and in personality.
“Baap to baap hi hota hai,” he joked later that night at the dinner table when I shared details of the journey with my family. And while everyone giggled, I couldn’t help but feel the invisible weight of living in a city where everything changes but nothing changes.
And this isn’t just about me or my dad. It is about the sister who called me a dozen times, worried sick, because she couldn’t reach my 25-year-old colleague. It is about the stranded Foodpanda rider I saw near Teen Talwar. It is about my friend whose newly bought car, a white Alto, was submerged in water on Sharea Faisal. It is also about our maid who didn’t have electricity for nearly two days.
It is about us, the citizens of Karachi, called ‘resilient’ every year, but fast running out of resilience … and hope.</p><small>2025-08-23 07:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/231044195a05bba.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934722/na-66-by-election-cheemas-meet-nawaz-promise-to-lend-support-to-party-nominee' target='_blank'><strong>NA-66 by-election: Cheemas meet Nawaz, promise to lend support to party nominee</strong></a><br><p>GUJRAT: In a major breakthrough, the ruling PML-N has managed to muster support of disgruntled former MNA Dr Nisar Cheema and his brother Zulfiqar Cheema, a retired IGP, for NA-66, Wazirabad, by-election.
The ballot is scheduled for Sept 18.
The seat fell vacant after the Election Commission of Pakistan de-seated Punjab PTI President MNA Ahmed Chattha in the wake of his conviction in May 9 riots.
In the upcoming by-poll, the PML-N did not award ticket to its last two-time aspirant Dr Nisar Cheema, who won the seat in 2018 and lost in February 2024 as a runner-up.
The party announced ex-MPA Bilal Farooq Tarar, the brother of federal minister for information Attaullah Tarar, as its candidate in the Wazirabad by-poll.
Following the nomination of the PML-N candidate, the Cheema group got  annoyed as earlier Nisar Cheema’s elder brother Justice retired Iftikhar Cheema had won the seat thrice as PML-N candidate.
However, on Friday the PML-N president and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif held a meeting with Dr Nisar Cheema and Zulfiqar Cheema at his residence in Murree where Punjab PML-N President Rana Sanaullah, former federal minister Khurram Dastgir Khan, ex-MNA Mudassar Qayyum and party’s Gujranwala division president former MNA Abid Raza Kotla and others were also present.
Participants in the meeting apprised Nawaz of the political situation in Gujranwala region, particularly the party’s campaign for the by-poll.
The party chief reportedly promised to address their concerns.
 






 
 

Gujranwala division PML-N President Abid Raza told Dawn that the meeting was ‘very successful’ as the Cheema brothers had later called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in Islamabad where they announced a complete support to the PML-N candidate.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Rana Sanaullah were also present in the meeting in the PM office, Mr Raza said.
 






Sources said the Cheemas had been feeling ignored by the PML-N leadership since the February 2024 election and lack of coordination between them and the leadership had created a distance due to which the party opted to change its candidate.
The Cheema clan is said to have an edge in terms of population over the Chattha clan in Wazirabad that’s why most of the times the seat was won by representatives of this clan.
The PTI is yet to announce its candidate since it is not clear to contest the vote.
Sources said a member of senior politician Hamid Nasir Chattha’s family might contest the by-poll if the party opted to contest the election.

The government has repeatedly voiced its commitment to the development of Balochistan — a province with severe infrastructure deficits, recurring protests and a bleak law and order situation. In June, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif termed it one of the top priorities.
Field Marshal Munir interacted with Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and representatives of the Turbat civil administration during his visit.
The army chief emphasised the significance of joint civil-military efforts in addressing the challenges faced by the people of Balochistan and reaffirmed unwavering support for all initiatives aimed at improving southern Balochistan’s socio-economic development, Radio Pakistan said.
He reiterated the army’s resolve to “stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Balochistan in their pursuit of peace, prosperity and sustainable development”.
COAS Munir also highlighted the need for good governance, infrastructure development and the importance of inclusive and people-centric progress.
 






He was given a comprehensive brief on the province’s security dynamics, including threat perspective and successful operations against Fitna al Hindustan, ongoing development projects, and efforts to enhance socio-economic conditions in southern Balochistan.
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
During his interaction with troops, COAS Munir appreciated their “high morale, operational readiness and unflinching commitment to safeguarding national sovereignty”. He hailed their role in ensuring peace and stability in the region under challenging circumstances.
Addressing the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum 2025 in April, COAS Munir said Pakistan’s goal was to create manpower, experts and human resources for the mineral sector, adding that economic security has emerged as an important component of national security.
 
 

He said the military would ensure a robust security framework and proactive measures to protect the interests and confidence of Pakistan’s partners and investors in Balochistan.
Under its provincial budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026, the Balochistan government has allocated Rs249.50 billion for the Annual Development Plan (ADP) and has decided to launch several development projects under the public-private partnership model.
Last month, the Balochistan cabinet approved a series of security enhancements, economic initiatives and public welfare projects, including the establishment of new police stations and a major subsidy for farmers.</p><small>2025-08-23 07:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620037-karachi-warehouse-blast-death-toll-climbs-to-six-police-arrest-owner' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi warehouse blast death toll climbs to six; police arrest owner</strong></a><br><p>

Babar and Rizwan, once Pakistan’s revered T20I opening pair, have been sidelined from the format as the team pursues a more aggressive approach under new leadership.
The transition follows the appointments of Mike Hesson as Pakistan’s white-ball head coach and Salman Ali Agha as T20I captain earlier this year. Hesson has publicly stated that Babar and Rizwan need to refine their T20I skills to reclaim their spots in the national XI.
 
 

With the senior duo out of favour, Pakistan are relying on less-experienced players such as Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, and Mohammad Haris to bolster the top order, while Hasan Nawaz has emerged as a promising middle-order batter. All featured prominently in Hesson’s first three assignments and are set to play when Pakistan begin their tri-nation series in the United Arab Emirates on August 29.
The tournament, featuring hosts UAE and Afghanistan, will be staged entirely in Sharjah and is seen as a preparatory competition ahead of the Asia Cup, which begins on September 9 in the UAE.
“Everyone should get an opportunity. Babar and Rizwan are world-class players and have done great for Pakistan, and they will continue to do so,” Shaheen told reporters on the sidelines of the team’s training camp at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday.
 






“But everyone gets opportunities, and they should seize them. The youngsters we have are also our players, and we should back them. The more we support them, the better. Instead of criticising them for being new, we should remember they are our players and help them progress.”
The Asia Cup will provide Hesson and Salman with their first significant test, giving them a chance to assess the team months ahead of the T20 World Cup, scheduled in India and Sri Lanka in February-March next year.
Under Hesson, Pakistan have enjoyed mixed results so far, having thrashed Bangladesh 3-0 at home, lost 2-1 away, and defeated West Indies 2-1 in the United States.
The Asia Cup will feature at least one and at most three high-stakes encounters with India. With the cross-border tensions of May still fresh, the matches are expected to be intense, presenting a stern challenge for Pakistan’s revamped side.
Shaheen, however, expressed confidence in his team’s preparation.
“Obviously, it’s a high-pressure match, and plans will be made,” he said. “But with the kind of preparation we have, I don’t think Pakistan has ever prepared this early before. This time, we have a great opportunity. We can also use the stadium to our advantage. Our preparation can get even better for the big matches. But our first target is the tri-nation series, and then the Asia Cup.”
The left-arm pacer also acknowledged the threat posed by Afghanistan and UAE in the tri-series.
“In T20 cricket, no team is easy,” he noted. “But our preparation is solid; we have a young team ready to play fearless cricket. I think we have an edge, and there’s nothing to worry about. Our preparation is for the big events.”

“I never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript of her two-day interview last month with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. “The president was never inappropriate with anybody.”
During the interview, the imprisoned 63-year-old former British socialite also said she did not witness any sexual abuse by Epstein, her longtime boyfriend, and did not implicate any other prominent individuals in wrongdoing.
“He kept a lot to himself and he didn’t like to share,” Maxwell said of Epstein. “He was not a sharer. Well, at least not with me.”
The Justice Department’s release of the transcripts and audio recordings of Maxwell’s interview comes amid intense public curiosity about Epstein, a multimillionaire who socialised with the cultural and political elite, and as Trump, a Republican, tries to tamp down a political crisis stemming from the Justice Department’s decision not to release files from its investigation of Epstein despite its earlier pledges to do so.
 
 

Maxwell spoke with Blanche on the condition that she not be prosecuted for any self-incriminating statements she were to make, but she could be prosecuted if she lied in the interview.
Maxwell was previously charged with perjury for lying in a 2016 deposition about her knowledge of Epstein’s alleged behaviour, though prosecutors dropped those charges after a jury found her guilty of sex trafficking in 2021.
During Maxwell’s month-long trial in Manhattan, jurors heard emotional and explicit testimony from four women who said Maxwell recruited and groomed them for abuse by Epstein. Three of the four said Maxwell herself touched their bare breasts or took part in the encounters, which often began as massages.
Epstein died by suicide in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty.
Epstein’s death, coupled with his friendships with powerful people like Trump and former Democratic President Bill Clinton, has fueled conspiracy theories that other people were involved in his crimes, and that he was murdered to cover that up. No one other than he and Maxwell have been charged with crimes.
Blanche asked Maxwell if Epstein maintained any “client list”.
“There is no list that I am aware of,” Maxwell said.
 
 

Maxwell, who pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges brought against her in 2020, has asked the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. David Markus, Maxwell’s attorney, said in a statement on Friday that the interview supports Maxwell’s argument that she is innocent.
“She supported her answers with documents and other objective evidence. Her demeanour and credibility are clear for anyone to hear,” Markus said.
Markus has previously said Maxwell has not held discussions with Trump about a possible pardon, but that she would welcome “relief”.
‘Very cordial’
Blanche’s interview of Maxwell on July 24 and July 25 came as Trump sought to quell criticism from his conservative base of supporters and congressional Democrats over the Justice Department’s decision not to release the files.
A week after the interview, Maxwell was moved from a low-security prison facility in Florida to a less-restrictive prison camp in Texas.
Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. During Maxwell’s trial, the financier’s longtime pilot, Lawrence Visoski, testified that Trump flew on Epstein’s private plane multiple times. Trump has denied flying on the plane.
Maxwell told Blanche she never saw Trump receive a massage or engage in other inappropriate activity. Many of Epstein’s alleged victims say their unwanted sexual encounters with him began as massages.
“As far as I’m concerned, President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me,” Maxwell said, according to the transcript. “And I just want to say that I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the president now.”
 
 

It is rare for a Justice Department official as senior as Blanche — who has also served as Trump’s personal lawyer — to directly interview a criminal defendant.
Blanche asked Maxwell about her and Epstein’s interactions with a spate of prominent Democrats, including Bill and Hillary Clinton, former New York governor Andrew Cuomo and billionaire Democratic donor George Soros.
Maxwell did not implicate any of those individuals in wrongdoing.
Maxwell said she worked with Bill Clinton on his philanthropic endeavours, and that he used Epstein’s plane for a trip to Africa. But she said Clinton never visited Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands, where Epstein was accused of abusing some girls.</p><small>2025-08-23 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/231042438d2efee.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934710/encounter-another-child-molester-shot-in-private-parts-in-kasur' target='_blank'><strong>‘Encounter’: Another child molester shot in private parts in Kasur</strong></a><br><p>KASUR: In another incident in Kasur, a suspect, who had molested a minor girl, was shot in his private parts during an alleged encounter in the limits of Chunian Police Station on Friday.
The suspect was seen with a 10-year-old girl at Zaheerabad Colony of Chunain through a viral video. The child was in the street when he molested her and CCTV footage captured him committing the crime. The girl child’s father had reported the matter to the police and registered an FIR.
The police claimed when they conducted a raid to arrest the suspect, he tried to attack them with his pistol that went off. As a result, his private parts were critically injured. The suspect was hospitalised in an injured condition.
According to sources in the police, he belonged to the same area as that of the child he molested. He is stated to be 27/28 years old, a daily-wager with no regular job. He is married and has a daughter.
About three weeks back, a video of a man molesting a girl child who was playing in the street of Shah Inayat Colony had gone viral, causing an outrage on social media.
DPO Essa Khan Sukhera had taken notice of the footage and directed Station House Officer Asif Javed to arrest the suspect. Three days later, the suspect, a labourer from Okara, was arrested by City police in an injured condition. He too had suffered a bullet injury to his private parts.
The police said the suspect was caught at Dhanpat Road where he pulled out a pistol to escape arrest. However, the pistol went off during a firing exchange, causing an injury to him.
Kasur has been notorious in recent years due to child molestation, rape and sexual abuse cases. In 2015, a child pornography ring was busted for involvement in a case in which over 200 children of Hussain Khanwala village were filmed while raping young boys and girls.
As many as 285 cases of child sexual abuse were recorded in this single scandal. The busted gang had men in their 20s and 30s. According to some reports, the entire village knew about the shocking activities of the gang.
In 2018, six-year-old Zainab Amin was kidnapped, raped and killed by a suspect.
In 2020, a 12-year-old boy was arrested for raping a three-year-old boy child on the rooftop of his house. In 2021, am 11-year-old boy, a seminary student, was raped by four men, aged 30 to 40, near Rohi Nullah on his way to his seminary.

The fifth accused, Mama Abdul Ghafoor, a leader of the National Party, was released by police, who said he is no longer required for investigation.
Mahrang Baloch, along with Beebu Baloch, Gulzadi Baloch and Bebarg Baloch, was produced before the ATC in Quetta amid tight security.
Police informed the court that further investigation was needed and requested a 15-day extension in remand, which the court approved.
This is the fourth time the BYC leaders have been presented before the court since their arrest. Initially, they were detained under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (3MPO). Following the expiry of their MPO detention, terrorism-related charges were filed against them.
 
 

A large number of BYC supporters gathered outside the court during the hearing, raising slogans in solidarity with their leaders.
Speaking to the media outside the court, Mahrang Baloch said the state was attempting to intimidate the public by imprisoning BYC leaders. “We want to make it clear that no national or public movement retreats because of imprisonment.”
She said that the arrests were an effort to suppress the voice of the people of Balochistan, but instead, “we will amplify this voice so that the world hears the demands of the Baloch people”.

In a special report, the IIF noted that while Pakistan has successfully rebuilt its economic buffers and secured financing, the gains will likely prove short-lived without comprehensive structural reforms, particularly in tax broadening, privatisation, and the resolution of circular debt.
The report emphasised that Pakistan has made little headway in these critical areas, particularly privatisation and energy-sector restructuring, with circular debt still unresolved. The IIF warned that these unresolved issues pose a significant risk to Pakistan’s economic outlook for FY26.
 
 

Notably, inflation has decreased significantly, allowing the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to cut its policy rate to 11pc since the easing cycle began in June 2024.
In addition, Pakistan posted its first current account surplus (0.5pc of GDP) since FY11, along with the highest primary balance surplus (2.4pc of GDP) in over two decades in FY25. These developments have resulted in sustained multilateral and bilateral support and improved credit ratings.
However, the IIF highlighted that despite these positive headlines, the economic situation is not as promising as it may seem. Geopolitical tensions, both regional and global, pose significant challenges for FY26, while domestic political instability, though subsiding, remains fragile. The relationship between the military establishment and the opposition PTI party remains tenuous, adding to the uncertainty.

Highlights structural weaknesses in tax broadening, privatisation and energy sector, undermining long-term stability

While fiscal and external buffers accumulated in FY24/25 have provided some relief, they remain limited. The $5bn increase in reserve assets has boosted the country’s import coverage to just 2.4 months, while the primary balance surplus has led to a slight reduction in total public sector debt, which remains high at around 67pc of GDP. These figures suggest that while short-term stability has been achieved, long-term sustainability remains uncertain.
The IIF also pointed out that the recent trade agreement with the United States, Pakistan’s largest export partner, could provide some support to the textile industry, though the benefits are expected to be modest. Agriculture, which accounts for nearly a quarter of GDP and employs 40pc of the workforce, will likely remain sluggish. The kharif season, covering key crops such as rice, sugarcane, cotton, and maise, has faced early water shortages followed by heavy monsoon rains, which could weigh heavily on harvests in the first half of FY26.
Furthermore, deadly flash floods have exacerbated the challenges, plunging Pakistan into its second major flooding crisis in three years. This could have serious implications for growth, as well as for the country’s external and fiscal balances.
Inflation, while improving, remains a concern. A sharp rise in food prices, caused by the floods, led to a 2.9pc month-on-month increase in headline inflation in July, the largest increase in two years. Core inflation remains sticky, hovering around 7pc in urban areas and 8pc in rural areas. Additionally, energy price adjustments (including higher gas tariffs, subsidy removals, and increased fuel costs) and new tax measures are expected to feed into inflation in the near term. As a result, the SBP paused interest rate cuts in June and July, and the IIF expects interest rates to remain on hold for an extended period, with inflation averaging 6.5pc in FY26.
On the external front, the IIF forecasted that Pakistan’s current account will be influenced by the normalisation of imports (particularly machinery, raw materials, and consumer goods). Exports will depend largely on the progress of the US-Pakistan trade deal, though the IIF remains sceptical of its impact on exports. In the absence of a sharp increase in commodity prices, the current account deficit is expected to stay modest (about 0.5pc of GDP in FY26), allowing some reserve accumulation, though import coverage will remain critically low at about 2.5 months.
 
 

The IIF also expressed concerns over Pakistan’s fiscal situation. Although the country’s fiscal deficit narrowed to 5.4pc of GDP in FY25 and total revenues grew by 35.6pc, much of this growth came from one-off factors, such as record profits from the State Bank of Pakistan.
The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) fell short of its target by about 1pc of GDP, and the federal tax-to-GDP ratio remains stuck at around 10pc. For FY26, authorities are forecasting another large increase in tax revenues, but this may be difficult to sustain given the already high tax burden on the formal sector and the exclusion of the retail/wholesale sectors, which account for about 20pc of GDP, from the tax net.
On the expenditure side, reductions in subsidies (particularly on electricity) and net lending to public enterprises have helped, but total spending still rose by 18pc in FY25. The IIF also noted that recent tensions with India could lead to an increase in defence spending in FY26.
As a result, the authorities’ targets of a 3.9pc of GDP deficit and a 2.4pc primary surplus for FY26 appear overly ambitious. The heavy reliance on domestic financing is also a cause for concern, and the IIF warned that fiscal performance will remain a key test for the IMF programme, with vested interests complicating the progress of reforms.

• Over 330 households affected across six villages; no casualties reported
• Dozens of homes, acres of farmland, bridges and trees submerged
• GB CM orders immediate rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure
GILGIT: A glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) caused widespread devastation in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Ghizer Valley early on Friday mor­n­ing, but the quick thinking of a local shepherd helped avert a human tragedy.
According to Rescue 1122, the flood, triggered by a burst from a glacier in the Tildas village of Gupis Valley, occurred at around 3am, wreaking havoc downstream.
The flood debris blocked the Ghizer River for several hours, significantly raising the risk of further flooding in adjacent areas. Gilgit-Bal­t­istan Secretary Fida Hussain explained that a gla­cial lake had formed above Tildas and Rawshan villages. The high temperatures led to the burst of the lake, causing a flash flood in Sado Nallah on Wednesday night.
A shepherd, Wasiyat Khan from Rawshan village, who was near the glacier, used his mobile phone to alert the community about the impending flood. His warning gave villagers enough time to evacuate and local volunteers swiftly moved residents to safer locations.
 






Mr Hussain confirmed that although the flood swept through the downstream areas of Tildas and Rawshan, no casualties were reported. However, around 40 people were initially stranded in the floodwaters on Friday morning. The Pakistan Army was called for a helicopter rescue, but by the time the helicopters arrived, local volunteers had already managed to rescue the stranded individuals. All affected residents are reported to be safe.
Local sources said that the flood devastated approximately 80 per cent of Tildas village, displacing 65 households and washing away homes, land, infrastructure and personal belongings. The floodwaters also blocked the Ghizer River for six hours, creating an artificial lake and submerging homes, farmland, bridges and trees in nearby villages.
According to a local administration report, the flood affected over 330 households across six villages — Tildas, Raushan, Hakis, Gawat and Molaabad — after the river was blocked. The report highlights that of the 906 houses in these villages, 330 were severely damaged, leaving these families in dire need of emergency assistance.
Public infrastructure was also submerged, including a mosque, a school, a Jamat Khana and an RCC bridge on the Gilgit-Ghizer Road. The artificial lake on the Ghizer River submerged parts of the Gilgit-Shandur Road, cutting off access to the upper Gupis, Phander and Yasin regions.
According to Rescue 1122, some 200 people were rescued from the flood-affected areas and relocated to the Yangal and Samal areas of Ghizer. The rescue teams also provided medical assistance to those traumatised by the destruction of their homes.

Displaced families, who fled with little more than the clothes on their backs, are now in urgent need of shelter, food and medical supplies. The local administration has said that while water has begun to recede from the artificial lake, the risk to downstream settlements persists.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and cabinet members visited the affected areas in Ghizer and announced the immediate rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, including bridges, power supply lines, drinking water and irrigation channels.
The chief minister also directed the home secretary and the director general of the GB Disaster Management Authority to assist in the rescue efforts and ensure the safety of the affected populations.
In recognition of the heroic actions of the shepherd, Wasiyat Khan, the GB police department issued an official commendation certificate.
His timely alert saved several lives, and local communities and officials alike have hailed him as a hero.
 
 

Ghizer Valley has been severely affected by flooding this year. On Aug 14, the region was struck by multiple floods, resulting in 13 deaths, several injuries and widespread displacement across the Ghalti, Ishkoman, Gupis, Yasin, Daen and Chaturkhand areas.
These disasters occurred without early warning systems in place, which could have saved lives and property.

The five-member panel, which met under the chairmanship of Justice Jamal  Khan Mandokhail, with a majority of three to two referred the  recommendations back to the JCP for perusal and final decision.
The subcommittee considered three agenda items: drafting criteria for judges’ selection for the constitutional benches, framing rules for performance evaluation of judges of all high courts, and considering rules for the service structure of JCP secretariat.
The service rules were approved by the subcommittee.

Justice Mandokhail-led subcommittee approves rules for service structure of JCP secretariat, defers framing of rules for performance evaluation of judges of all high courts

Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, Sena­tor Farooq H. Naek from the treasury, and representative of the Pakis­tan Bar Council (PBC) Mohammad Ahsan Bhoon opposed the proposal to develop criteria, whereas Senator Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, on behalf of the opposition, highlighted the need for outlining such rules. Justice Mandokhail abstained, the source claimed.
 
 

On June 19, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi constituted the broad-based committee for judicial performance evaluation of high court judges.
It comprised members from the judiciary, parliament, executive, and the legal fraternity, tasked with preparing draft rules for annual judicial performance evaluations as well as developing criteria for judges’ selection for the constitutional bench.
During the meeting, it was considered that Article 191A does not empower drafting rules for judges’ nomination for the constitutional benches, since all Supreme Court judges had been elevated from different high courts where they had exercised constitutional jurisdiction while hearing legal matters.
Filters may bar judges from full court
It was argued that if any filters were developed through such criteria, it would mean that judges who did not meet the standard would be excluded from sitting on the full court. This would particularly affect demands to enlarge the constitutional bench into a full court by including all available SC judges. In such a case, the constitutional bench could never become the full court, since some judges might not fulfil the yardstick, the source said. He added that if such judges could not sit on the full court, then questions would arise as to why they were included earlier when the full court decided constitutional matters such as the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
Meanwhile, the subcommittee deferred the agenda of framing rules for regulating performance evaluation of all high court judges, though it acknowledged that Article 175A (4) empowers the committee to develop fitness evaluation rules. The matter will be revisited in near future.
In June, the JCP in a majority decision extended the tenure of the SC constitutional bench till Nov 30, 2025.
Under the 26th Amendment, a seven-judge constitutional bench was initially formed on Nov 5, 2024 for a period of 60 days. The bench included Justices Aminuddin Khan, Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Moham­mad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha A. Malik, Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan, and Shahid Bilal Hassan.
In December, its tenure was exte­nded for six months. In February, the constitutional bench was expanded to 13 members with the inclusion of Justices Hashim Khan Kakar, Salah­uddin Panhwar, Shakeel Ahmad, Aamer Farooq, and Ishtiaq Ibrahim.

• Urban flooding warnings for major cities; hilly areas at risk from landslides and rockfalls
• UK trains around 2,400 volunteers, announces £1.3m aid for flood victims
RAWALPINDI / ISLAMABAD: The Nat­ional Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) issued a red alert on Friday, urging provincial and district administrations to brace for pot­­ential flooding as a fresh monsoon spell is forecast to lash the country from Aug 23 to 29.
The alert, follows a Pakistan Me­­teoro­logical Department forecast predicting that strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal will penetrate the country’s upper regions, bringing torrential rains, wind and thundershowers to large swathes of the country.
According to the NDMA, the first wave of heavy rainfall is expected to lash upper and central Pakistan from Aug 23 to 27, with a second wave targeting Sindh and the eastern and southern parts of Balochistan from Aug 27 to 29.
The authority warned that the weather system could trigger flash floods in local streams and nullahs in Murree, Galiyat, Islamabad and Rawalpindi, as well as in the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and northeast Punjab.
 
 

Urban flooding is also a significant risk in low-lying areas, including Islamabad, Raw­al­pindi, Gujran­wala, Lahore, Sialkot, Sar­godha, Fai­salabad, Peshawar and Nowshera.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balo­ch­istan, Gil­git-Baltistan and Azad Jam­­mu and Kash­mir, the NDMA cautioned that heavy to very heavy rainfall could lead to flash floods in local waterways and trigger landsli­des and rockfalls in hilly areas such as Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Ab­­bottabad, Buner, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera and Swabi.
The NDMA highlighted isolated hailst­o­rms could damage infrastructure, orchards, farms and vehicles, as well as windstorms capable of destroying crops and loose structures.
It urged the public to be aware of hazards posed by lightning strikes and loose structures like billboards, electrical poles and solar panels.
Tourists are advised to remain cautious before travelling and farmers to plan their activities in line with the weather forecast.
It also added that people should move away from drainage canals and seek immediate shelter indoors during storms.
All federal ministries, provincial governments and local administrations have been instructed to take necessary precautionary measures.
 
 

The NDMA also called on authorities to alert residents in low-lying areas and ensure that communication channels for disseminating weather advisories are streamlined and efficient.
Federal departments were dire­c­ted to enhance inter-agency coordination, advising to implement strict and proactive monitoring of areas su­­rrounding nullahs and water chan­­nels to prevent potential drowning incidents.
In case of any incident, the authority has requested that twice-daily updates be shared with the NDMA.
UK pledges £1.33m aid
Separately, the United Kingdom annou­nced £1.33 million in humanitarian aid to support Pakistan’s response to the devastating effects of the current monsoon season and to help over 223,000 flood-affected people across seven districts in Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
As part of this aid, the UK had trained 2,400 community volunteers for search and rescue operations across Pakistan’s vulnerable districts.

The ADB is in advanced talks to lead the financing of a $2 billion upgrade of a 500-km stretch of the railway line, which had previously been part of the Chinese project, two sources with direct knowledge of the discussions told Reuters.
The proposed rail upgrade would modernise the track and bridges from the com­mercial capital Karachi to Rohri, near Suk­kur, so that trains can run faster.
In Rohri, the line will meet a branch coming from the area of the Reko Diq mine and will carry the copper concentrate to port.
The upgrade has become urgent, sour­ces said, as it is needed to transport copper ore from the Reko Diq mine currently being developed by Canada’s Barrick Mining Corp.
Earlier this week, ADB announced $410 million in financing for the Reko  Diq mine itself, and its president is due to visit Islamabad next  week, they said.
 
 

Tim Cribb, Reko Diq’s project director, told Reuters that the government  and Barrick would work together on securing financing for the upgrading of the branch coming from the west to Rohri.
The Reko Diq copper and gold mine is due to enter production in 2028 with anti­cipated annual output of some 200,000  metric tons of copper concentrate.
One of the world’s largest untapped copper deposits, it is Pakistan’s largest foreign investment in recent years.
“We will have a crisis. How will you evacuate output from Reko Diq? The exhausted line will come under even more pressure,” a senior government official said.
There was no immediate comment from Pakistan’s railways ministry or China’s foreign ministry.
The ADB would not confirm the finance package, which is being reported for the first time by Reuters. But it said Pakistan’s government and the regional lender  “have regular discussions on railway sector development”.
“Any potential ADB assistance would be subject to comprehensive due diligence and consideration under ADB’s policies and procedures before any commitment is made,” it said.

• Iranian FM Araghchi warns of snapback ‘consequences’
TEHRAN: Iran will meet next week with Britain, France and Germany on its nuclear programme, the parties said on Friday, as the European powers warned Tehran to engage swiftly to avoid snapback sanctions.
The Islamic republic suspended cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in July in the wake of its 12-day war with Israel, citing the UN nuclear watchdog’s failure to condemn Israeli and US strikes on its nuclear facilities.
The European trio — parties to the landmark 2015 Iran nuclear deal — have threatened to trigger a “snapback mechanism” by the end of August.
The move would reimpose sweeping UN sanctions lifted under the 2015 agreement unless Iran agrees to curb its uranium enrichment and restore cooperation with IAEA inspectors.
 
 

“It was agreed that Iran’s talks with the three European countries and the European Union would continue next Tuesday at the level of deputy foreign ministers,” Iran’s foreign ministry said after a phone call between Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and senior European diplomats.
France confirmed the talks and cautioned that Iran faced a narrowing window of time. “We have just made an important call to our Iranian counterpart regarding the nuclear programme and the sanctions against Iran that we are preparing to reimpose,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on X, noting he was joined on the call by his British and German counterparts and the EU’s top diplomat.
“Time is running out. A new meeting will take place next week on this issue,” he added.
German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on X that his country remained “committed to diplomacy but time is very short”.
“Iran needs to engage substantively in order to avoid the activation of snapback,” he said. “We have been clear that we will not let the snapback of sanctions expire unless there is a verifiable and durable deal.”
 






The EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, made a similar statement. “With the deadline for the snapback mechanism fast approaching, Iran’s readiness to engage with the US is crucial. Iran must also fully cooperate” with the IAEA, she said.
It was not immediately clear where the talks, the second since the Iran-Israel war, would take place.
 






Snapback ‘consequences’
Iran and the European trio — known as the E3 — held talks in late July at the Iranian consulate in Istanbul, which Tehran described as “frank”.
Iran’s 12-day war with Israel derailed its nuclear negotiations with the United States and saw it suspend cooperation with the IAEA.
The 2015 nuclear deal was aimed preventing Iran from developing an atomic bomb — an ambition it has consistently denied.
The deal was torpedoed in 2018 when Donald Trump, during his first term as US president, unilaterally withdrew the United States from the agreement and slapped crippling sanctions on its economy.
Iran has ever since criticised Europe over failing to meet its commitments under the deal.
Araghchi reiterated on Friday the “lack of legal and moral competence of these countries to resort to the said mechanism” while warning about “the consequences of such an action”.
 






Iran has previously said it would leave the non-proliferation treaty — or NPT — if the mechanism, envisaged in the nuclear deal, is activated by the European parties.
The deadline for activating the mechanism ends in October, though Europeans have set an internal target of the end of August to trigger it if diplomacy fails. They have also offered an extension to buy time for talks.
Araghchi said that “this is a decision that must essentially be taken by the United Nations Security Council; and while the Islamic Republic of Iran has its own principled positions and views in this regard, it is not involved in this process.”
The foreign minister said earlier this month that Iran was working with China and Russia to prevent the snapback of sanctions.

In a column published on Aug 16, Warraich — a senior editor at the Jang newspaper — wrote that COAS Munir had spoken to him during a stopover in Brussels, on his way back from a recent trip to the US. “On a question about politics, he (the army chief) said that political reconciliation is possible only if there is a sincere apology,” the column read, without specifying who the army chief was referring to or who the question was about. However, that quote ended up stirring a controversy in the commentariat.
Challenging the impression that the army chief had “sought an apology over the May 9 riots”, the military’s spokesperson had said on Thursday that Field Marshal Munir did not make any political statements during a recent trip to Brussels. He had also rebuked the senior journalist in remarks carried by state-run Radio Pakistan.
In his first public comment on the situation since then, Warraich issued a statement on X today. It must be pointed out that, when approached for a comment following the DG ISPR’s clarification, Warraich had declined to make one.
On Friday, he said that while he had respect for Lieutenant-General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, “the points he (Chaudhry) refuted were never mentioned in my column. Perhaps he spoke based on a misunderstanding.”
Warraich said that he was ready to offer further clarification if there were any further questions.
He said the Inter-Services Public Relations director general had firmly said that the army chief had given no interview. To this, he responded: “Please reread my entire column — nowhere does it use the word ‘interview’. The title of my column is simply ‘First Meeting’, neither more nor less. I never wrote it was a one-on-one meeting.”
Warraich said it was “absolutely correct” that no discussion had taken place about the May 9 riots or PTI founder Imran Khan, adding: “Kindly reread the column; it contains no mention of May 9, Imran Khan or his apology. I wrote only one sentence: that regarding political reconciliation, he (the army chief) cited verses of the Holy Quran and their translation. What impression people or trolls drew from it is their prerogative.”
He said the points refuted “on such a large scale” were not even a part of his column. “If they’re in someone’s mind then it depends entirely on their choice,” Warraich added.
 






Regarding the criticism he received from various quarters, he said there was no need for a response.
“The coming time and the history to be written will clarify every matter. I have always avoided fights and arguments in life and even after much thought, my opinion remains the same.”
Concluding his statement, he said the bits he had written about in his column were but a “fragment” of the army chief’s address and whatever interpretation one wanted to take from them was their wish.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s recent visit, under the umbrella of the Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue, reiterated Beijing’s commitment to improving bilateral ties. Mr Wang had earlier travelled to India and Afghanistan, stating that the South Asian states are China’s “natural partners”.
 
 

It is significant that China’s top diplomat emphasised that Islamabad was the “most important stop” on the three-nation tour. During his meeting with Pakistan’s top civil and military leaders, Wang Yi principally discussed economic and security issues, while observing that Pakistan and China have a “shared future”.
The message from China seems clear: Beijing does not want antagonistic relationships with any of its South Asian neighbours, and values a cooperative approach to addressing disputes. For example, Mr Wang reassured his Indian hosts that Beijing is committed to improving ties with New Delhi “despite setbacks”. He also told the Taliban-led Afghan regime that it needed to act against terrorist groups, while offering greater economic cooperation, including expanding CPEC to Afghanistan. Islamabad, too, was part of the discussions in Kabul, under the framework of the trilateral Pakistan-Afghanistan-China dialogue.
With the US displaying unpredictable behaviour under President Donald Trump’s watch, states around the world are hedging their bets, and updating their foreign policies accordingly. Perhaps this is one of the factors prompting India to improve ties with China, as New Delhi’s relations with the US experience turbulence. Regardless of external triggers, an integrated, prosperous and peaceful South Asia is desirable for all, and China could be the main catalyst that brings the region’s states closer.
 
 

As for bilateral relations, ties between Islamabad and Beijing — covering geopolitics, economics and defence links — should be deepened. China is a time-tested partner and friend of Pakistan, and has stood by it in difficult times, while China has also acknowledged that Pakistan has supported it “at key junctures”.
Irritants in the way of greater cooperation must be addressed. For example, Wang Yi publicly noted in Islamabad that Beijing expects Pakistan to protect Chinese citizens and projects in this country. Terrorist groups and hostile actors cannot be allowed to damage bilateral ties by harming Chinese interests in Pakistan.
Also, some states, such as the US, have said openly that they do not view Pakistan-China collaboration positively. This presents a diplomatic quandary for Pakistan, especially in light of its improving ties with the US. Islamabad must balance its ties with both states; better relations with America should not come at the cost of economic and defence cooperation with China.

Some entities have proposed converting the existing 32 administrative divisions into provinces while another recommendation is to go back to the original 12 administrative divisions that existed in erstwhile West Pakistan at the time of independence.
The sweeping conclusion of these proposals is that practically all our governance problems will be resolved once we create more provinces. Although different political parties had been advocating for the creation of new provinces for various reasons in the past, the current proposals apparently seek a greater number of provinces to facilitate the devolution of authority and achieve administrative efficiency.
 
 

If the idea of these proposals is to generate a fresh national debate to see if a consensus can be developed on the question, there should be no quarrel with the intention, but the debate needs to be organic and not stoked or moulded by vested interests. The consensus-building process should not be hurried; an important but contentious question like the creation of new provinces should be debated and scrutinised on the basis of facts and figures, both inside parliament and outside.
Since the question of carving out new provinces from existing ones is a highly emotive one, there is a risk that the debate could result in outbursts. It is, therefore, important that the debate does not take place in a vacuum and a carefully prepared document, framing the key issues, forms the basis of the issue.
The timing of the debate is questionable. As we deal with the resurgence of terrorism, an ailing economy, which is just about showing signs of improvement and an explosive geopolitical situation, one wonders if the creation of new provinces should really be on our agenda.
The impetus for the debate may not be organic. There have been times in the past when strong and sometimes violent movements for separate provinces in south Punjab, the non-Pashto-speaking Hazara division and Sindh’s urban areas were active at different times, but at present there doesn’t seem to be such an active movement, probably because there are more critical issues which need to be tackled first.

Is creating new provinces the best way to achieve better governance?

In the ongoing discourse, India’s example of increasing its states from the original 17 provinces to the current 28 states is also cited. One should keep three points in mind, while comparing our situation to India’s. First, the impetus for the creation of new states in India came from fierce and, and at times violent, movements particularly in the south, which demanded states on the basis of language. These movements led to the formation of Linguistic Provinces Commission (Dhar Commission) in 1948.
The demand for language-based states had gained so much momentum by 1952 that an activist demanding a Telugu state died after a fast-unto death. This tragic incident provoked agitation across the country, with many linguistic groups demanding separate states. In today’s Pakistan, no such violent movement exists, although the demand for separate provinces for Sindh’s Urdu-speaking people, Seraiki speakers in various provinces and KP’s Hindko-speaking population has been raised from time to time. While Urdu is the national language, separate provinces already exist which are inhabited by the majority of speakers of regional languages, including Punjabi, Sindhi, Pashto and Balochi.
 
 

The second distinction is that India is not a classic federal state. It is a ‘union’ which has certain characteristics of a federation. The change in the boundaries of the Indian states is therefore much simpler than is the case in Pakistan, which is a constitutionally declared federation. Altering provincial boundaries requires a two-third majority in the concerned provinces, before a constitutional amendment can be moved in the two Houses of Parliament, where again a two-third majority is needed in each to separately pass the constitutional amendment.
The third distinctive feature of the Indian quest for new provinces is important to note by the proponents of new provinces in Pakistan. India formed a States Reorganisation Commission in 1953 which worked on reorganisation proposals for 21 months and presented its report in 1955. The States Reorganisation Act was subsequently passed in 1956, incorporating most of the recommendations made by SRC. This act led to the creation of 14 states and three union territories. Subsequently, 14 additional states were gradually created from 1956 to the present.
In the context of today’s Pakistan, the real question is whether creating new provinces is really the most cost-effective and practical way to achieve the objective of better governance and devolution of powers. Apparently, the answer is in the negative.
Assuming that 12 provinces are to be created, each new province will come with a huge price tag as taxpayers will have to pay for eight new provincial assemblies, governors, chief ministers, cabinets, high courts, public service commissions, civil secretariats, to name a few, along with the necessary physical infrastructure, etc. Such extravagance is not acceptable in any case but in the present economic scenario it would be almost criminal. Securing a two-third majority in the assemblies will be next to impossible.
 
 

There is a much simpler option available for achieving the objective of devolution and administrative efficiency — making the local governments effective, while underwriting their continuity and funding through a constitutional amendment as India did 45 years after the passage of its constitution.
Large provinces are not so much an issue as the lack of devolution of powers to the local level. The UK is a unitary state but an empowered local government there has helped provide good governance and the decentralisation of powers. The way forward for devolution in Pakistan is, therefore, empowered local governments and not the tedious route of creating new provinces.

A factory worker, he took his usual route to work on Monday morning, but only made it back late on Tuesday night.
“My family was gasping out of dread. They were unable to reach me because my mobile fell in the water. A man walking a few steps ahead of me vanished. He either fell unconscious or was electrocuted. How can I ever forget that?” he said.
Frustrated by the plummeting quality of life in the country’s commercial hub, Hazim is now determined to leave the city and move his family to Lahore.
 
 

For him, and many others, the city that held the promise of turning dreams into reality now resembles a post-apocalyptic vision of the future.
In this week’s cosmic downpour, amid raging torrents that were its streets, sunken roads, fallen trees and buildings, and over 17 casualties, Karachi drowned in acute administrative apathy.
On that fateful day, Sharea Faisal — perhaps the country’s most ubiquitous main artery — was without a single rescue service in sight.
Hazim says he saw furious waves of water flip vehicles over, the current carrying the heavier ones till they crashed into something else. Meanwhile, social media was replete with videos of people ‘pickling’ in their submerged cars.
Rickshaws, SUVs, cranes; none escaped the water’s wrath and were swallowed whole by large pools forming in construction sites along the thoroughfare.

For Justin, an English expat living in Karachi, the deluge was the worst he had witnessed in his 20 years in Pakistan.
After driving across town from his DHA home to help those stranded in other parts, he too was in shock.
“I know that last year Dubai and Houston were flooded. The UK saw routine shutdowns during storms. But in those places, it seems that the failure is mechanical and temporary. Sadly, in Karachi it is systemic and permanent. The people’s strength is a testament to the human spirit.”
The hard rain also washed away all polite barriers of class. From swanky DHA and KDA to the tight lanes of Baldia Town, Orangi, Korangi, Saddar and other parts, everything from electricity poles to motorcyclists vanished in the brown, waist-high waters.
Saeed, a labourer in DHA, knew what was in store. “Another committee, more promises with no results. If this place is destroyed, then my area will never recover.”
Even hospitals were not spared; with videos of emergency rooms filled with ankle-deep water doing the rounds.
 
 

The fierce rainfall also unleashed a landslide at Kati Pahari — with huge boulders rolling down towards fragile settlements, reminiscent of the destruction wrought in the hilly parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Then, there were the throngs of poor women, drenched to the bone, lining the streets in knee-deep waters. These were the working women, making their way from the posh societies where they worked to homes in Qayyumabad, Korangi, Azam Basti and Akhtar Colony — each area a more sobering portrait than the last.
Ambareen and her husband saw their plight, took out their jeeps, packed eight to nine women in each vehicle — including an old lady with a deep gash from an overturned rickshaw — and made multiple trips to save almost 80 to 100 hapless Karachiites.
Fraught conversations along the way offered hurried sketches of their ordeal.
“We leave our homes to earn. Normally, the parlour drops us to the main road. But today, the driver dashed to save his little son who fell into a manhole in this rain. I have spent hours navigating these roads. You can imagine what I am going home to,” said Christina.

Sadaf, a maid, was angry: “I have walked for hours with a cut in my foot because my chappal fell apart. I have to reach Korangi dhai number. We are perpetually miserable because of these thieves.”
Alongside her sat a frail Khadija. “My rickshaw toppled into a ditch and my head is injured. How much can we weather! This Sindh government has never worked for us,” was her lament.
In a new era that brings its own kind of deluge, the battle between memory and money is more apparent than ever before in Karachi.
The rain will stop. The rage, after a long time, will stick like a bloodsucker, or loss.

“We are very confident that these relations are stable and sustainable on their own and will continue to grow and achieve new heights,” Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said during the weekly media briefing.
His remarks came a day after Chi­n­ese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Pakistan as part of his three-nation South Asian tour to attend the sixth Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue.
While the Pak-China dialogue broadly reviewed various aspects of the bilateral relationship, both sides carefully navigated the region’s shifting geopolitical landscape marked by warming China-India ties, Pakistan’s growing engagement with the United States, and tensions in US-India relations driven by President Trump’s tariffs and policies.
 



FO terms New Delhi’s missile capabilities a global security threat

India’s leg of Yi’s visit strengthened China’s rapprochement with New Delhi after years of hostility. The visit resulted in agreements to resume suspended trade talks and accelerate negotiations on border disputes.
Speaking at a media conference following the bilateral dialogue, Yi had emphasised China’s partnerships with both India and Pakistan “were not targeted at any third party, nor were they affected by any third party.”
 
 

Both Yi and FM Ishaq Dar underlined the importance that Pakistan and China attach to each other. Yi described Islamabad as “the most important stop” on his three-nation trip and highlighted the “stronger internal drive” behind bilateral ties.
Echoing these sentiments, the FO spokesperson said: “Pakistan-China relationship is a very sustainable, longstanding, and robust relationship.” He expressed confidence that Pakistan-China relations, including their growing economic and strategic cooperation, would not be affected by regional developments, including those involving China.
Dialogue offer
Mr Khan said Pakistan is ready for an all-encompassing dialogue with India and welcomed the mediatory efforts of ‘friends’. “We are ready for composite dialogue. We welcome any effort which helps us achieve our objectives,” he remarked.
 
 

Although Wang Yi did not publicly comment on India-Pakistan tensions or offer to mediate, he said, “A peaceful, stable, and prosperous South Asia serves the common interests of all sides and meets the expectations of all peoples.”
Mr Dar, soon after Yi’s visit, signalled Pakistan’s readiness to engage in dialogue with India. The FO spokesman stressed that unlike India’s insistence on focusing solely on terrorism, Pakistan believes “this would just be one item during the composite dialogue.”
Pakistan was not reluctant to address terrorism, as “we have complete and detailed evidence about India’s acts of terrorism against Pakistan”, he said.
Agni-V test
The FO warned that India’s expanding missile capabilities pose a threat to both regional and global security and criticised the selective application of export control regulations by the Western countries that enabled New Delhi to advance its missile programme.
 
 

“The acquisition and testing of int­ercontinental ballistic missile capabilities reflects a growing military threat posed by India extending far beyond the region and even the continent. This development seriously undermines peace, security and strategic stability at both regional and global levels,” the spokesperson said.
“India’s expanding missile arsenal, including systems with intercontinental range, raises serious concerns about the selective and discriminatory application of Export Control Regulations that have enabled such destabilising advancements,” Mr Khan added.
Expressing concern over India’s accelerating arms buildup, Mr Khan warned: “It is dangerous not only for Pakistan’s security but also for regional stability.”

Recent cases indicate that traffic violations and campus protests may be reported to the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS), raising alarms among the Pakistani community.
Two Pakistani students in northern Virginia were shocked when a traffic court judge informed them that courts are now required to share records of traffic violations with DHS.
“We were planning to drive to Chicago, but we’ve been advised not to,” said Yunus Khan, a student from Baltimore, Maryland. “We are on visas and even a minor mistake could lead to revocation.”

US reviewing social media for anti-American or extremist content; Pakistani embassy says it’s monitoring the situation, advises caution in political activities

Students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests, are even more anxious. “Some of us joined those demonstrations and now we don’t know if we can stay or might face deportation,” said Samina Ali, also from Baltimore.
 
 

Mohammad Sajid, a student at George Mason University, said, “Most of us work part-time to pay tuition. Now we don’t know whether we can continue working.”
Khalid, who attends a community college in northern Virginia, added, “Almost all foreign students are scared. We don’t know whether we can work, drive, or even go out. This is not the America that we dreamed of.”
Those living in the US under political asylum face even greater concerns.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington estimates that between 700,000 to a million Pakistanis live in the United States, most as citizens or long-term residents. Many do not register officially, so exact numbers are unclear.
According to the latest Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education, the United States hosted 1,126,690 international students in 2024, up 7 per cent from the previous year.
Pakistan sent 10,988 students in 2024, compared to 17,099 from Bangladesh and 16,742 from Nepal. India topped the list with 331,602 students.
The Pakistani embassy estimates that the number of Pakistani students has risen to about 12,500 in 2025, still far below other South Asian countries.
 
 

As part of the broader vetting process, US authorities are reviewing social media activity for any signs of hostility toward US citizens, culture, government, or institutions.
Officials have also been instructed to monitor for support of designated foreign terrorists or engagement in antisemitic harassment or violence.
Matthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for US Citizenship and Immigration Services, stated, “America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies.”
In addition, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in the issuance of worker visas for truck drivers, citing safety concerns and the impact on American livelihoods.
Visa holders from Malawi and Zambia are now required to pay a $15,000 deposit for tourist or business visas, while travel bans remain in effect for 12 countries, with partial restrictions on seven more.
The crackdown has left Pakistani students and visa holders anxious about their future.
Pakistani authorities in Washington continue to receive queries from students and other visa holders and forward them to the US State Department. Embassy officials are closely monitoring the situation, emphasising the importance of legal documentation, awareness of rights, and caution in political activity.

The report, compiled by the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP), said that under the law, the SECP must obtain approval from the Ministry of Finance for salary hikes. However, the SECP management proceeded with a pay raise for its employees during a Policy Board meeting on Oct 17, 2024, with effect from July 1, 2023.
The audit found that the salary package of SECP Chairman Akif Saeed reached Rs41.53m for the fiscal year 2023-24, while each commissioner received Rs35.8m due to the backdated salary increases. Additio­nally, the report revealed that SECP illegally distributed Rs110m for entertainment allowances to its commissioners and staff.
The AGP’s findings highlight that while the SECP Policy Board approved these raises, it lacked the authority to sanction such increases. Besides, the pay and allowance increases were made without prior approval from the finance division, totalling Rs377.22m.
The audit report urged the finance ministry to either approve or reverse these illegal increases.
 
 

The audit also highlighted that SECP had failed to deposit around Rs14 billion into the Federal Consolidated Fund, including Rs7.11bn in revenues. These funds were generated through licensing and registration fees (Rs4.13bn), the insurance sector (Rs591.56m), the securities market (Rs47.77m), and specialised companies (Rs1.91bn).
Under Section 37(1) of the Public Finance Management Act, 2019, all revenues collected by an autonomous entity under federal government statutory instruments must be deposited in the treasury single account. However, SECP did not comply with this requirement.
The SECP also failed to deposit a surplus balance of Rs6.99bn into the Federal Consolidated Fund, even though any surplus of receipts over actual expenditure must be remitted to the Fund.

• Hunger monitor says similar conditions expected in Deir el-Balah and Khan Yunis by next month
• Hamas demands opening of Gaza crossings after UN, IPC declaration
• Israel cries foul as world holds it responsible for ‘man-made’ calamity
ROME: The United Nations on Friday officially declared a famine in Gaza City, the first time it has done so in the Middle East, with exp­­e­rts warning that over half a million people faced catastrophic hunger.
“It is a famine: the Gaza famine,” said Tom Fletcher, the UN’s emergency relief coordinator, as the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) panel found famine was now present in and around Gaza City.
He blamed Israel, accusing it of “systematic obstruction” of aid deliveries to the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.
 






Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed the UN-backed report as “an outright lie”, while the foreign ministry insisted: “There is no famine in Gaza.”
The IPC defines famine as occurring when 20 per cent of households have an extreme lack of food; 30pc of children under five are acutely malnourished; and at least two in every 10,000 people die daily from outright starvation or from malnutrition and disease.
UN agencies have long been war­n­ing of the deteriorating huma­nita­rian situation in Gaza, particularly as Israel steps up its offensive in the besieged and war-torn enclave.
The Rome-based IPC said that “as of 15 August 2025, famine (IPC Phase 5) — with reasonable evidence — is confirmed in Gaza governorate”.
The UN estimates that nearly one million people currently live in the Gaza governorate.
 


It was the first time the IPC has recorded famine outside of Africa, and the global group predicted that famine conditions would spread to the central and southern areas of Deir al-Balah and Khan Yunis by the end of next month.
The IPC previously concluded that there was famine in areas of Somalia in 2011, South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and Sudan in 2024.
A famine was projected in Yemen in 2018, but never officially confirmed, des­pite the humanitarian crisis in the country.
‘Man-made’
According to figures from Gaza’s Health Ministry, verified by the World Health Organisation, deaths from malnutrition and starvation are spiking.
In the first seven months of the year, 89 fatalities were attributed to malnutrition or starvation, mostly children and teens. Just in August, there have been at least 138 deaths, including 25 minors, the ministry said on Friday.
The IPC said the famine in Gaza was “entirely man-made”, driven by a sharp escalation of the conflict in July, massive displacement of people since mid-March and restricted access to food.
In early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.
Speaking to reporters in Geneva, Fletcher said the famine should “haunt us all”.
“It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,” he said.
UN rights chief Volker Turk said “it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare”.
 






UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access to Gaza, adding: “We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”
The International Red Cross described the declaration of famine as “devastating and entirely foreseeable”.
“Under international humanitarian law, Israel, as the occupying power, must ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met,” it said in a statement.
Outrage
Hamas called on Friday for an immediate end to the war in Gaza and the lifting of the Israeli siege on the territory.
In a statement published online, the group called for “immediate action by the UN and the security council to stop the war and lift the siege” and demanded that crossings be opened “without restrictions to allow the urgent and continuous entry of food, medicine, water and fuel”.
It said the declaration by the UN confirmed the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza — but lamented that it came far too late.
Britain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday condemned the famine in Gaza as a “moral outrage” and a “man-made catastrophe”.
Calling it “utterly horrifying and wholly preventable”, he called on Israel to take urgent action to remedy the situation.
 






“We are seeing the worst possible humanitarian catastrophe that we can even measure,” said Jeanette Bailey, a child nutrition lead at the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based aid organisation.
‘Too weak to cry’
In July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished – a six-fold increase since January, according to UN agencies.
“The signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat, babies dying from hunger and preventable disease,” said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell.
 






The local food system has collapsed, with an estimated 98pc of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, the IPC said.
Meanwhile, livestock is decimated and fishing is banned.
The IPC said conditions in the North Gaza Governorate, north of Gaza City, may well be worse, but said it did not have enough data.

“Although it was a natural catastrophe, there is no room for man-made disaster,” the prime minister said while addressing the federal cabinet meeting.
“For how long the federal and provincial governments continue to pay compensation for the loss of lives caused by illegal constructions along rivers and water channels,” the prime minister asked.
He revealed that more than 700 people have lost their lives during rains and flooding in the country, of which over 400 deaths occurred in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

PM to convene meeting with provinces; committee of ministers will work to reduce agriculture production costs

“I will soon convene a meeting on the issue of illegal constructions such as hotels, restaurants and houses, as monsoon rains have caused catastrophic floods in northern parts of the country,” he added.
Record rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which began on Aug 15, have wreaked havoc across different parts of the province. Last week, the provincial government declared an emergency as torrential rains destroyed homes, displaced families, and left a trail of destruction in Buner, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, and other areas.
The PM expressed concern over such structures, which reflected “catastrophic beauty”, and also over deforestation in Galiyat, where plazas and houses have been built.
 
 

The PM reviewed the relief and rehabilitation work in the flood-affected areas during the meeting, saying that the federal government had exte­nded “full cooperation” to the provincial governments.
He also commended the efforts of the armed forces in rescue and relief operations. “Pakistan Army reached the distant and difficult areas to rescue the people. For this purpose, helicopters were also used,” he said.
He mentioned his visit to the flood-affected areas in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, highlighting the efforts of ministers and secretaries. “This is a collective responsibility,” he added.
Following the disaster, he said, the responsibility of the Ministry of Climate Change has increased to deal with the challenges of climate change. He added that other relevant departments will also have to play their part.
The PM also referred to the recent “destructive rains” in Karachi earlier this week. “I spoke to the Sindh chief minister and (PPP Chairman) Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to express my sympathies,” he said.
Ministerial committee formed
Later, PM Shehbaz formed a ministerial committee with a task to reduce production cost of agriculture.
The cabinet also approved the closure of Utility Stores across the country with effect from July 1. The prime minister directed the authorities concerned to protect the rights of the stores’ workers.
In a separate decision, the cabinet approved the proposed amendments to the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) Act, 2012.
PM Shehbaz stressed that providing a business and investor-friendly environment was crucial for industrial development, adding that the expansion of industries would enhance exports and create new jobs.
The meeting also approved the presentation of the Annual Report of the National Economic Council for fiscal year 2023-24 before Parliament, and endorsed decisions taken by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) on Aug 19 and the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases (CCLC) on August 18.
On Wednesday, the prime minister visited the flood-affected districts of Swat, Buner, and Shangla in KP, where 14 more bodies were recovered from debris in Swabi’s Dalori area.
While interacting with flood victims, he assured them of the government and the army’s unwavering commitment to extending maximum support “in this critical hour.”
The KP government, on Monday, released Rs800 million in relief funds for all affected districts, with an additional Rs500m specifically for the worst-hit Buner, as flash floods continue to ravage the province with over 400 deaths.

The Improved Resource Mobilisation and Utilisation Reform Programme, Subprogramme 2, includes a policy-based loan of $300m and ADB’s first-ever policy-based guarantee of up to $500m. The guarantee is expected to help mobilise up to $1 billion from commercial banks, the Manila-based lender said in a statement.
The ADB noted that Pakistan had made significant progress in improving macroeconomic conditions, and the new programme supports the government’s commitment to further reforms. These reforms are aimed at strengthening public finances and promoting sustainable growth. The programme is designed to support wide-ranging reforms to improve tax policy, administration, and compliance, while enhancing public expenditure and cash management. It also focuses on promoting digitalisation, facilitating investment, and fostering private sector development.
The primary goal of these measures is to reduce Pakistan’s fiscal deficit and public debt, while creating fiscal space for social and development spending, the ADB explained. The programme is backed by a comprehensive support package, including technical assistance and close coordination with development partners, to help Pakistan build long-term fiscal resilience and stability.
The programme follows a policy-based lending (PBL) modality, which includes two subprogrammes. Subprogramme 1, approved and disbursed in December 2023, totalled $300m and focused on establishing the foundation for policies, laws, and institutional capacities to enhance resource mobilisation and allocation. 
Subprogramme 2 builds on these foundational reforms and aims to drive substantial improvements in tax policy and administration, taxpayer compliance, public expenditure, and cash management, as well as the mobilisation and effective utilisation of national resources, including domestic private investment and savings.
For Subprogramme 2, the ADB has proposed the inclusion of policy-based guarantees (PBGs) to support the government’s financing needs within the current fiscal year. These guarantees will take the form of partial credit guarantees (PCGs) to mitigate credit risk for commercial banks lending to Pakistan, thereby facilitating the mobilisation of private capital.
Despite the significant progress in restoring economic stability through consistent policy reforms, the ADB warned that long-standing structural challenges remain. “A narrow tax base limits fiscal fairness, sustainability, and the ability to meet Pakistan’s considerable social and development spending needs,” the bank stated.

The deputy investigation of Lahore Police confirmed to Dawn.com that Shershah Khan, akin to his brother Shahrez Khan, was also arrested today for his involvement in the May 9 riots.
Aleema’s lawyer, Advocate Rana Mudassir Umar, said that “Shershah was taken from his house after his appearance at a Lahore anti-terrorism court in relation to his brother’s case”.
The PTI, in a post on X, called the incident an “abduction” and lamented that “the rule of law has been replaced with the law of the jungle”.
The move comes a day after PTI announced that men in plainclothes had “abducted” Aleema’s son from her residence. Lahore police later announced that Shahrez had been arrested in connection with a May 9 case.
Aleema addressed the arrest on social media this morning, saying, “(The policemen) brutally assaulted our staff, harassed my daughter-in-law, and forcibly took away my son, Shahrez Khan, in front of his two young daughters.”
She added, “For over three years, this fascist regime in Pakistan has unleashed a reign of terror, raiding thousands of homes, abducting and harassing countless innocent civilians.”
However, she said that it had not broken Imran and that he had set a “remarkable standard of resilience against tyranny”.
 






Speaking on the incident today, Aleema addressed the notion that the move was an attempt to scare the PTI.
“Do we look like we will be scared of such things?” she said.
She added, “In every FIR (first information report), it is written: ‘Aleema Khan comes bringing Imran Khan’s message’. So if we have to bring Imran Khan’s message in every FIR, we will absolutely do that. We will absolutely be his voice and give his complete message.”
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
Imran’s son Kasim Khan termed the arrests “blatant state repression”.
 






Lahore ATC judge sends Shahrez on 8-day physical remand
Meanwhile, a Lahore anti-terrorism court (ATC) sent Shahrez on an eight-day physical remand. The suspect was presented in the Lahore ATC today before Judge Manzar Ali Gul.
The investigating officer told the judge that Shahrez was arrested in relation to the Jinnah House attack on May 9. He added that the suspect was first named in the case on September 23, 2023, in supplementary statements.
To this, Shahrez’s counsel, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, alleged that his client had never been named in the case, branding the arrest an act of “harassment”.
He questioned why he had never been arrested before, despite being in the country for 27 months. The legal counsel called the move a “reaction to the approval of Imran’s bail pleas”.
On Wednesday,  the Supreme Court accepted Imran’s bail petitions in eight cases related to the May 9 riots. The PTI founder has been imprisoned at the Adiala Jail since August 2023 in cases related to the selling of state gifts and a £190 million graft case, while he faces pending trials related to the May 9 riots.
The investigation officer filed an application in the court for a 30-day physical remand for police investigation; however, the court approved only eight days and directed the police to present Shahrez at the next hearing.
Raja, speaking to the media outside the court, said Shahrez was “falsely implicated”. He vowed to fight against the case, saying, “We will go to every court.”
“This is a message to the nation that there is no law in this country,” he said, adding that “cases are being fabricated”.
Questioning the validity of the case, Raja alleged that during the events of May 9, Shahrez was in Chitral.
“This is madness and a well-thought-out conspiracy,” he added. “We have to stand with the founder of PTI and his family.”
Tallal Chaudhry defends arrests
Meanwhile, speaking on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry defended the arrests and said they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”, saying that both siblings were present at the scene of the Jinnah House vandalism.
“One was on the vehicle on which Hassaan Niazi was making his speech and the other, when he was arrested, himself told that he was also present there.”
In contrast to the state minister’s claims, the PTI said Shahrez was in Chitral at the time of the May 9 riots.
“Family and friends of Shahrez shared pictures, videos, and WhatsApp messages, including timestamps and metadata, which show that he and his wife were on a trip to Chitral, in the northern mountainous region of Pakistan, from May 6th through May 12th.”
 






PTI lawyer Taimur Malik also said: “The fact is that he was in Chitral during that week in May 2023 and was simply not present in Lahore.”
 






Questioned about the same, Chaudhry said: “The first thing to consider is that if there will be no evidence, then definitely, if his uncle (Imran Khan) can get bail … then so will he.”
Pushed back on the matter, the minister said it had taken time to gather the evidence and reiterated that Shershah was present with Niazi. “To say that this was preplanned or something, then the arrest would’ve been made a long time ago. So many times you have to wait for the police version and evidence.”</p><small>2025-08-22 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22185737a047aa0.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934223/pakistan-did-not-request-anyone-to-make-india-sit-down-for-talks-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan did not request anyone to make India sit down for talks: FM Dar</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday said that Pakistan had not requested anyone to make India sit down for talks of any kind.
“Pakistan did not ask anyone to arrange talks with India. Pakistan is ready for comprehensive talks with India, including on the Kashmir issue,” he told journalists at Parliament House.
Talking about the May conflict between the two countries and the subsequent ceasefire, he said the latter was still underway.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.
Talking about the halt in hostilities, Dar said: “India had requested the US for a ceasefire. I received a call from the US for a ceasefire. I had made it clear that Pakistan did not want war.”
The foreign minister said that Pakistan had been suggested to sit down at a neutral venue for talks, to which he had expressed his willingness to do so.
“I had made it clear that there will be no discussion on any single-point agenda with India. We will discuss all outstanding issues, including the Kashmir issue with India,” he said, adding that “unnecessary rhetoric” continued flowing from India meanwhile.
He also said a visit by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to Pakistan was not yet scheduled.
Pakistan ready for dialogue with India: FO spokesperson
Foreign Office spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan noted that Pakistan is ready for composite dialogue with India, reiterating remarks made earlier by FM Dar.
Fielding questions from reporters during a weekly press briefing, the spokesperson said Pakistan is ready for “composite dialogue” with India on all matters, not just the issue of terrorism.
“India says that they would talk on terrorism only; however, we want to talk on all matters, including terrorism,” Khan said. “We have complete and detailed evidence about India’s acts of terrorism against Pakistan, but this would just be one item during the composite dialogue.”
 


Khan added that Islamabad would welcome attempts by other countries, including the United States, to bring Pakistan and India to the table for talks. However, responding to a question, he said there is no meeting in the works between the prime ministers of both countries.
Responding to another question about Indian military buildup, Khan called it an “alarming trend” and a threat to regional stability.
“It becomes more sinister when you look at their declaratory policy, and the domestic developments in India, which are so hostile towards Pakistan, and increasingly Islamophobic,” the spokesperson outlined.
“We have been raising this issue with our partners. The international community turning a blind eye to India’s mad rush to develop their military capabilities is a very dangerous trend.”
However, he assured that Pakistan remains ready and has the capability to respond to any threat or action by India.
Tarar lauds media’s role during conflict with India
Separately, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar lauded the media for its role in countering Indian narratives during the military confrontation and praised it for delivering the country’s message to the world in the face of a much larger media apparatus in India.
Addressing a meeting of the Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors (CPNE) in Islamabad, Tarar labelled that period as “extraordinary circumstances”.
“Right from the beginning, it was a war of narratives,” he highlighted. “The enemy had greater resources, international interest, lobbying and PR firms. International media outlets had employees of Indian origin because of their greater population.”
The minister stated that Pakistan’s strength was not in numbers or resources, but in “having the truth”.
“The truth cannot hide or be countered,” Tarar stated. “While the prime minister asked for an inquiry into the Pahalgam attack at Kakul, India was levelling allegations without evidence.”
Tarar then described a “synergy” between the armed forces and the information ministry during wartime, noting that the ministry’s “state-of-the-art data centre was maybe made for this purpose so that we could fight a war of narratives”.
He thanked the director general of the Inter-Services Public Relations “for this synergy”.
“This war was fought by everyone together, with your help and your content. The way things were written and disseminated was a team effort,” he stated.
 


Tarar said that due to the media’s coverage during the fighting, Pakistan experienced a resurgence on the international stage.
“Across the world, people have greater respect for Pakistan and take us seriously,” he said.
“There was this false glorification of ‘rising India’, how it was this big economy and rising power in South Asia. That same Modi has to give fake medals in countries whose names we have never heard of.
“However much factual information we were spreading, they (India) were spreading as many lies,” he added.
“Their media has been terribly exposed, while our media became part of our diplomatic effort and spokespersons for our foreign policy. They took every step for our defence.”
Stating that the Pakistan Navy was ready for any Indian engagement, the minister quipped that “when the enemy found they could not destroy Karachi port, they destroyed ports in Multan and Lahore instead”.
“An Indian channel said that Indian media is a spokesperson for foreign policy and Pakistani media is adrift. I’d like to say to that person that they should be ashamed of the lies and propaganda and how they are being mocked globally,” Tarar stated.
“The whole country played a role in this effort, as did the CPNE, which will be remembered fondly for its role as a wartime body,” he said, stressing the need to acknowledge the CPNE’s “wartime cabinet” and how the council “played a role in narrative building and defeating the enemy during this war”.</p><small>2025-08-22 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/22213846300a1b4.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934392/pakistan-fisherfolk-forums-fatima-majeed-appointed-head-of-sindh-fisheries-department' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum’s Fatima Majeed appointed head of Sindh Fisheries Department</strong></a><br><p>Climate activist Fatima Majeed has been appointed as the chairperson of the Sindh Fisheries Department, becoming the first woman from the fishing community to become so, it emerged on Friday.
Majeed is an activist, social worker and senior vice-chairperson of the Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF).
The PFF, a democratic organisation with over 100,000 memberships across the country, having a minimum 35 per cent women ratio, today is one of the strongest social movements in Pakistan.
It has, over the years, proven itself as a nursery for producing leaders in the fishing and peasant communities of Pakistan.
 
 

Its struggle targets policy issues related to fishing rights, fish marketing and fish conservation, rehabilitation of the Indus Delta, sustainable fisheries policy, abolition of the contract system over inland waters, historical fishing rights on entire water bodies for indigenous fisherfolk, discouraging industrial fishing by deep sea trawlers and marine pollution, and detention of fishermen.
In a post on X today, the Sindh Information Department announced that Majeed was appointed to the role “in line with the inclusive vision of [PPP] Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and the Sindh government’s commitment to women empowerment”.
It added that she was the first woman from a fishing community to lead the vital sector.
“This milestone reflects a strong commitment to community empowerment, inclusive representation, and merit-based leadership within public institutions,” it said.
 






Majeed has participated in protests every year for the past three years against climate change and demanding climate justice.
The World Trade Organisation (WTO) said in March that Pakistan had formally accepted the Agreement on Fisheries Subsidies.
WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala had said Pakistan’s formal acceptance of the agreement marked a vital step toward ensuring the long-term sustainability of global marine resources, while safeguarding the livelihoods and food security of the millions of people, who depend on healthy fisheries.</p><small>2025-08-22 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2220061990c817e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1934294/president-zardari-constitutes-11th-national-finance-commission-to-divvy-up-revenue' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari constitutes 11th National Finance Commission to divvy up revenue</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Friday constituted the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) to announce a new award for the sharing of federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces.
According to a notification from the Finance Division, the president constituted the commission with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb as the chairman and the four provincial finance ministers as its members.
The commission also includes former bureaucrat Nasir Mahmood Khosa as a member representing the Punjab government, economist and researcher Asad Sayeed as a member representing the Sindh government, former bureaucrat Dr Musharraf Rasool Cyan as a member representing the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government and Farmanullah as a member representing the Balochistan government.
The commission will make recommendations to the president on the distribution between the federation and the provinces of the ““net proceeds of the taxes mentioned in clause (3) of Article 160 of the Constitution”, it read.
The taxes are taxes on income, including corporation tax, but not including taxes on income consisting of remuneration paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund; taxes on the sales and purchases of goods imported, exported, produced, manufactured or consumed; export duties on cotton, and such other export duties as may be specified by the president; duties of excise as may be specified by the president and other taxes as may be specified by the president.
The body will also recommend the president regarding the grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provincial governments and the exercise, by the federal government and the provincial governments, of the borrowing powers conferred by the Constitution.
The commission will further make recommendations to the president on issues relating to the sharing of financial expense incurred or to be incurred by the federation in respect of subjects and matters falling within the domain of the provinces; issues relating to the sharing of financial expense incurred or to be incurred by the federation or the provinces or both in respect of trans-provincial matters; issues relating to financial expense for national projects to be shared by the federation and the provinces; and any other matter relating to finance referred to the commission by the president.
For several years, policymakers associated with the finance ministry, as well as political actors across different parties at the centre, have spoken about revising revenue transfers to the provinces to improve the federal government’s financial position.
The 10th NFC expired on July 21. The 7th NFC Award has now been in effect for nearly 15 years — far beyond its five-year tenure. The president has extended the award every year due to a disagreement between the provinces and the Centre over the new formula.
The 18th Amendment provided constitutional protection to the share of the federating units, stipulating that a sub-federation’s share in any future award must not be less than its share in the previous award.</p><small>2025-08-22 16:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/619966-pakistan-ready-for-comprehensive-talks-with-india-says-ishaq-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan ready for comprehensive talks with India: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>
