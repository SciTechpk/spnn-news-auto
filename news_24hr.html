Speaking to the media, Lahore Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Operations Faisal Kamran said that the body was found from the disposal station on Outfall Road.
Asked about the various reports about the water flow not being fast enough to carry away a person, he said, “You should also look at the time difference. When it happened, the water flow was fast; those are peak hours.”
He said that the water flow receded as the night progressed.
Asked whether the family would register a case, Kamran said, “Whatever the family says and whatever their opinion is, we will act according to that.”
Meanwhile, Lahore Operations SSP Mohammad Tauqir told Dawn that police had taken the woman’s husband into custody, adding that he was the one who had alleged that his wife had fallen into the sewerage line along with their minor daughter at around 7:30pm.
He said the police were questioning the husband. “It would be premature to say she was murdered or died in an accident,” he said.
According to the official, the husband was taken into custody on the statement of the woman’s father who alleged that the couple was not on good terms for the past few months.
The SSP said that the deceased woman’s father had expressed his doubts over the role of her husband, who had called Rescue 1122 and alerted it about his wife falling down the sewerage pipeline along with their minor daughter.
“We are investigating the case and will share more details once it is completed,” he said, adding that the minor girl was still missing.
Meanwhile, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident and constituted a fact-finding committee to investigate the matter and submit a report within 24 hours.
It should also be mentioned that two officials of Tepa, a subsidiary of the Lahore Development Authority, were placed under suspension with immediate effect “on account of an incident [regarding] uncovered manholes”.
Earlier in the day, a Rescue 1122 spokesperson had said that teams were dispatched immediately after receiving a report of the incident and launched a vigorous search operation after receiving reports of the incident.
Last month, a seven-year-old boy in Punjab’s Bahawalpur district fell into an open manhole in Dhanote town near Lodhran city and died.
The same month, a three-year-old boy’s body was recovered from an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal area, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.

A day prior, the party said it had learned through credible reports that the ex-premier was suffering from an ailment that could cause permanent damage to his eyesight if not treated promptly.
According to a senior doctor at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences, Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on Saturday night for the procedure, which took quite some time. Another doctor, however, has denied this and said it was better not to discuss it as the PTI would make an issue out of such a development.
During a press conference in Islamabad, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan said that Imran was allegedly taken to the hospital over the weekend before being taken back to jail.
He called the situation “distressing for the nation, the party and the family”.
“The family should have been taken on board for moving him for medical treatment. To this day, we have still not been informed about the disease for which he was taken to the hospital, which doctor examined him, why he was taken back [to jail] and why the need arose for doing so,” he said.
In an apparent reference to the government, Gohar said they “are trying to consolidate their power” by making changes in the law but the people’s trust in them was failing.
He added that denying meetings with the PTI chief was causing great concern.



“The government is not understanding, but we will try to make them understand through this press conference; try to understand these problems. Let the meetings happen … do not deny meetings until February 8 under any circumstances,” he requested.
“A meeting with the family is very important. We demand that today, if not tomorrow, a meeting be arranged between Khan sahib and his family, and we are informed about his health. This is our demand,” he said.
Gohar urged the government to consider the demand so that the “anxiety within the nation, the party and his (Imran) family be immediately put at ease”.
Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas said that Imran was the most popular leader in Pakistan.
“He (Imran) is a former prime minister of Pakistan … whom Pakistan loves,” he said. Gohar termed the current situation, where Imran had been taken to the hospital without his family being informed, an “injustice”.
He said that as a result of this, the government was losing its credibility in the eyes of the nation. “This is condemnable and they will have to answer for it at some point one day,” he said.
Abbas said that the government had faced a resounding defeat in the Feb 8, 2024 general election. “If the [results] of the Feb 8 polls were accepted, then the political crisis would have ended,” he asserted. He called on the nation to join the opposition’s nationwide protest call for Feb 8.
Meanwhile, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said that Imran and his spouse, Bushra Bibi, being kept in isolation in jail was “unacceptable”. He said that the latter was last allowed to meet her daughter on November 4.
Raja said that Imran’s personal physician, who was not related to politics in any way, was not allowed to see him. He said that petitions had also been filed in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) by the party’s senators and MNAs for meeting Imran.
“I learnt today that the IHC has refused to hear these petitions as regular petitions. An objection had been placed on both pleas, saying that the petitioners had no right to approach the court,” he said.
“We mentioned in our petition very clearly that we have grave concerns about the reports regarding Imran Khan sahib’s health and that his personal doctors should be allowed to examine him immediately. But we were told that this petition does not qualify for a hearing,” Raja asserted.
“We went to the chambers of the chief justice … and we urged him to use his administrative powers and tell the advocate general that a meeting be arranged,” he added, saying that the situation “bordered on barbarism”.
He again questioned why the party was not informed about Imran being taken to the hospital.
“We demand that a meeting with Imran be arranged,” he said, also calling for the end of the couple’s solitary confinement.
Senior PTI leaders request proper medical treatment for Imran
Separately, senior PTI leaders incarcerated at Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail demanded that the government provide Imran proper medical treatment.
PTI leaders Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Ejaz Chaudhry, Omar Safraz Cheema and Mian Mehmoodur Reasheed also appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment was being administered as soon as possible.
“Imran Khan’s eye infection has resulted in central retinal vein occlusion and may produce permanent damage to the eye and loss of vision, if not treated properly,” the five leaders expressed in an open letter shared by their counsel Rana Mudassar on Wednesday.
The open letter — written by Rashid on behalf of all five incarcerated leaders — said learning about Imran Khan’s eye infection, which had resulted in central retinal vein occlusion, was extremely distressing.
“This condition is extremely serious and if not treated properly, may produce permanent damage to the eye resulting in loss of vision,” the PTI leaders said.
They urged the government to stop its “petty behaviour and ensure that he (Imran) is admitted to a hospital of his choice and given proper treatment” and called the denial of proper treatment “shameful”.
“We appeal to the chief justice of Pakistan to look into the matter personally and ensure that the recommended treatment is given as soon as possible,” they said.
“The action taken in this case should be visible to the people of Pakistan,” they added.
Meeting with Imran jail authorities’ decision: Tallal Chaudhry
Minister of State for Interior Affairs Tallal Chaudhry, meanwhile, said that allowing meetings with the incarcerated PTI founder was ultimately the decision of the jail authorities, adding that securing a meeting would be “difficult” if the PTI kept giving calls for protests outside the prison.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the state minister refrained from commenting on whether or not Imran was taken to a hospital for an eye procedure.
“Instead of speculating or sensationalising, I urge people to wait for the reports to be confirmed,” he said.
Asked whether the government’s silence on the issue was tacit confirmation, Chaudhry replied, “It’s not like that. The truth is that this is a narrative built by those people (the PTI) who spread propaganda and play the sympathy card about his (Imran) life and health, and how he can’t speak to his children and they can’t get visas, because their other narratives have failed.”
Chaudhry said that if it was proven that Imran underwent a procedure, “then it confirms that he is receiving all medical facilities”.
Asked why meetings with the PTI founder were not being allowed, the state minister replied that jail authorities would not allow a meeting if it became a law and order problem or if they were dictated.
“There are approximately 850 people who have met the PTI founder for hours, including his family, lawyers, his political team and doctors,” Chaudhry said.
At this point, Khanzada noted that there had been no meetings for two months.
“He is in prison and it is the government’s responsibility [to take care of him], do not worry,” Chaudhry replied.
Asked if there would be a meeting tomorrow (Thursday) — one of the days designated for meetings with Imran by the Islamabad High Court — the state minister replied that only jail authorities could make that decision.
“I will confirm one thing: the rumours these people spread about his life and health are not true. He is receiving all the facilities … more so than other prisoners,” Chaudhry said.
“Only jail authorities can decide on a meeting, but if they (the PTI) continue dictating, making calls and threats, or affecting the public, then this will make securing a meeting difficult,” he said.</p><small>2026-01-28 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2823361844c6185.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969551/us-agents-involved-in-latest-minneapolis-shooting-put-on-leave-reports' target='_blank'><strong>US agents involved in latest Minneapolis shooting put on leave: reports</strong></a><br><p>At least two federal agents who were involved in Saturday’s fatal shooting of a US citizen in Minneapolis have been placed on administrative leave, two US media outlets said on Wednesday.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the two immigration agents who discharged their weapons during the deadly encounter with Alex Pretti were put on leave as part of standard procedures, Fox News reported.
MS NOW earlier reported that agents involved in the shooting of Pretti were being put on leave, citing an unnamed source.
Representatives for DHS could not be immediately reached to confirm the reports.
Immigration agents on Saturday fired multiple shots at Pretti, an ICU nurse at a hospital for veterans.
His death was the second fatal encounter between Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents and US citizens in Minnesota this month, sparking a national uproar.
US review of Pretti’s killing does not mention him brandishing firearm
Meanwhile, an initial US government review of the fatal shooting of Pretti made no mention of him brandishing a firearm, despite initial statements by Trump officials highlighting the weapon.
A preliminary review by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said Pretti, 37, was shot by two federal officers, a Border Patrol agent and a customs officer, after he refused to move out of the street following an order from a customs officer.
The DHS said he “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun, but did not mention that the weapon was holstered.
The CBP review, conducted by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility and shared with lawmakers on Tuesday, is standard protocol and shared with members of Congress to promote transparency, CBP spokesperson Hilton Beckham said.
Beckham said the notifications “provide an initial outline of an event that took place and do not convey any definitive conclusion or investigative findings”.
Details in the preliminary review reinforced the disconnect between how Trump officials portrayed the shooting and the video evidence.
The review said that a customs officer tried to move Pretti and a woman out of the street, but that they “did not move”.
The officer then fired pepper spray at Pretti and the woman, it said.
CBP customs officers normally work at ports of entry, screening passengers and goods entering the US, but some have been detailed to work on immigration enforcement by the Trump administration as part of its crackdown.
The identities of the agents and officers at the scene and whether they had any experience with crowd control in urban environments have not been made public.
The CBP internal assessment said that the agency’s personnel tried to take Pretti into custody and that “a struggle ensued”.
A Border Patrol agent shouted “He’s got a gun!” multiple times during the struggle, the review said. Five seconds later, a Border Patrol agent and a customs officer fired at Pretti.
Video showed an agent removing Pretti’s gun from his waist prior to the shooting. The review was based on footage from body-worn cameras and CBP documentation, it said.</p><small>2026-01-28 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28205645767444a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969547/president-zardari-uae-vice-president-discuss-economic-trade-ties' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari, UAE vice president discuss economic, trade ties</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday met the vice president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), with the two discussing ways to further strengthen bilateral relations, with a focus on expanding economic, trade and investment cooperation.
According to the President’s Secretariat, Zardari met Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, who is also the ruler of Dubai, at Zabeel Palace.
“The two leaders discussed ways to further strengthen bilateral relations, with a focus on expanding economic, trade and investment cooperation between Pakistan and the UAE,” the handout said.
Ït went on to say that President Zardari congratulated the sheikh on his two decades as Dubai’s ruler and “commended Dubai’s remarkable transformation into a global centre for tourism, finance and emerging technologies”.







It further stated that both sides exchanged views on “benefiting from Dubai’s development experience, particularly in ports, logistics, infrastructure, information technology and digital financial services”.
During the meeting, the president also highlighted Pakistan’s ongoing economic reforms, including investment facilitation and privatisation, and explored opportunities for enhanced cooperation with the UAE in infrastructure development, logistics, food security and technology-driven sectors, the handout said.
“President Zardari extended an invitation to Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to visit Pakistan,” it added.
It further said that both sides reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen the brotherly relations between Pakistan and the UAE and “expressed satisfaction over the positive trajectory of bilateral ties”.
During the meeting, the leaders underscored the importance of high-level exchanges, recalled the recent visit of UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to Pakistan, and acknowledged the UAE’s continued support for Pakistan’s economic development, it said.
“They also highlighted the valuable contribution of the Pakistani community in the UAE in strengthening people-to-people links.”
First Lady Bibi Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UAE were also present on the occasion, according to the statement.
Logistics company DP World says Pakistan ‘natural hub’ for trade
Meanwhile, President Zardari also appreciated Dubai-based logistics company DP World’s “strong and sustained partnership” with Pakistan and its contribution towards logistics, port operations and infrastructure, in a meeting with its chairman and chief executive officer (CEO), according to a separate handout.
During a meeting with DP World Chairman and CEO Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, the president reviewed the “evolving Pakistan–DP World engagement, noting that the recent inter-governmental agreements reflect strong commitment on both sides”.
“The president said these initiatives align with Pakistan’s objective of positioning itself as a regional trade and transit hub through enhanced connectivity and modern logistics infrastructure,” it said.







It further added that bin Sulayem highlighted Pakistan’s strategic geographic location at a time of global uncertainty and stressed that the country occupied a critical position as sea routes faced growing pressures.
According to the statement, DP World’s CEO noted that Pakistan’s direct connectivity with China and Central Asia, combined with its access to the Arabian Sea and its surface connectivity through road and rail networks, placed it at the centre of regional and inter-regional trade flows.
“He said Pakistan serves as a natural hub linking key parts of the world by sea and land, and reaffirmed that the UAE would continue to work closely with Pakistan, drawing on decades of a trusted and enduring relationship,” it added.
President Zardari reaffirmed the government’s commitment to providing institutional facilitation and fast-track approvals to partner enterprises, and underscored the importance of deepening long-term cooperation in rail freight modernisation, inland logistics and integrated freight corridors, the handout said.
President Zardari, who is currently on a four-day official visit to the UAE, has held several meetings with the UAE leadership, including President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan.</p><small>2026-01-28 16:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/282039389254031.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969545/pakistan-orders-screening-of-travellers-in-view-of-nipah-virus-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan orders screening of travellers in view of Nipah virus threat</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday decided to enforce “strict and enhanced health surveillance” at all entry points in the country with immediate effect in order to prevent the cross-border transmission of Nipah virus.
Nipah, carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can trigger a deadly brain-swelling fever in humans and can also spread directly from person to person through close contact. Several vaccines are in development but remain in testing.
It is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organisation (WHO) because of its ability to spark fast‑moving outbreaks, its fatality rate of 40 per cent to 75pc, and the fact that there is no approved vaccine or cure.
The measures taken by authorities in Pakistan coincide with those taken multiple other countries — Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia — after India confirmed the detection of two cases in December last year.
In this connection, the Border Health Services-Pakistan (BHS-P) — an ancillary department of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination — issued an advisory which referred to a regional alert reported by international and regional public health surveillance mechanisms, including the WHO South East Asia Region Epidemiological Bulletin.
Citing the alert, the advisory said in view of the “suspected cases of Nipah virus infection in West Bengal, India, and considering the high case fatality rate, zoonotic nature, and potential for human-to-human transmission, it has become imperative to further strengthen preventive and surveillance measures at Pakistan’s borders”.
“In order to prevent the cross-border transmission of Nipah virus in Pakistan and to ensure early detection and prompt response, the competent authority has decided to enforce strict and enhanced health surveillance at all points of entry with immediate effect.
“These instructions shall be applicable to all points of entry, including international airports, seaports, and ground/ land border crossings, without any exception,” the advisory said.
Outlining the instructions, the advisory said all in-charges at entry points should ensure 100pc screening of all arriving passengers, transit passengers, crew members, drivers, helpers, and support staff.
“No individual shall be allowed entry into Pakistan without health clearance by BHS-P,” it said.
Under the new measures, mandatory verification of the country of origin and complete travel and transit history for the preceding 21 days shall be carried out for each and every traveller, irrespective of their nationality or travel status.
“All in-charges at points of entry shall exercise special vigilance for travellers originating from, or transiting through, Nipah-affected or high-risk regions. Any false declaration, concealment, or misreporting of travel history shall be immediately documented and reported to the competent authorities for further necessary action,” the advisory stated.
Moreover, travellers are also required to undergo thermal screening and clinical assessment at entry points.
“Screening staff shall remain alert for early signs and symptoms of Nipah virus infection, including fever, headache, respiratory symptoms and neurological signs such as confusion, drowsiness or altered consciousness.
“Any individual consistent with suspected Nipah virus case definition shall be immediately isolated at the point of entry, restricted from onward movement, and managed strictly in accordance with infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols,” it was instructed in the advisory.
Such suspected cases should be promptly referred to the designated isolation facility or a tertiary care hospital in coordination with provincial and district health authorities, the advisory said, adding that the “conveyance concerned (aircraft, vessel, vehicle) and surrounding area shall be immediately disinfected as per approved standard operating procedures”.
In-charges at entry points have been further directed to ensure strict compliance with IPC measures, including the mandatory use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, and environmental sanitation.
Any lapse in surveillance or IPC practices should be treated as serious negligence, the advisory said.
Moreover, “daily case/ nil reports from all points of entry shall be recorded in the BHS-P system already in vogue and shared with National Command and Operation Centre and the National International Health Regulation Focal Point”.
Any delay, weak surveillance, under-reporting, or non-compliance with these instructions should not be tolerated, the advisory stated.
“All in-charges at points of entry are directed to ensure strict compliance with the above instructions in letter and spirit. These measures shall remain in force until further orders are issued by the competent authority,” it added.
Separately, the National Institute of Health (NIH) also issued an alert to health departments, healthcare providers, and BHS-P regarding the potential threat of Nipah virus spillover into Pakistan.
The alert said that while Pakistan had not yet reported a human case, a significant situation was emerging in South Asia.
“As of January 2026, an outbreak has been confirmed in West Bengal, India. […] Due to its high case fatality rate ranging from 40pc to 75pc and the potential for human-to-human transmission, health authorities are placing the region on high alert,” it added.
According to the advisory, there was currently no specific anti-viral treatment or licensed vaccine available for the virus.
Management remains primarily supportive and focuses on symptomatic treatment, including management of fever, respiratory distress, and neurological complications,” it said.
“Severely ill patients often require hospitalisation and may need intensive care support, including mechanical ventilation. The clinical effectiveness of ribavirin (broad-spectrum antiviral medication) remains inconclusive and it is not routinely recommended,” it said.
It urged travellers to avoid contact with symptomatic individuals or contaminated materials.
“Travellers returning from affected areas within 21 days who develop symptoms should self-isolate, seek medical attention, and inform the provider of their travel history and exposure,” it said.
It further directed the provincial health department to designate at least one tertiary-care hospital or infectious disease unit for the isolation and clinical management of cases.
It also urged provincial public laboratories to review and strengthen their capability for safe sample handling and transportation. Further, it directed that rapid response teams be placed on standby for case investigation, contact tracing, and coordinated field response for any cluster of acute encephalitis (brain inflammation).
It further said that provinces with international airports or land border points needed to main realtime communication with BHS-P for any alerts or travellers requiring follow-up.
‘Risk in Pakistan minimal’
Talking to Dawn, Microbiologist Prof Dr Javaid Usman said that the virus was named after a place in Malaysia.
“The virus is spread through the droppings of fruit bats and pigs,” he said. He further said that if cases were reported in Pakistan, it would be through carriers.
“Currently, a few cases have been reported in the Indian state of Bengal due to which neighbouring countries have announced to screen their masses,” he said.
Replying to a question, he said that the major symptoms of the virus included fever and neurological disorders.
“People can have fits. The virus can spread through respiratory droplets, saliva and the blood of a patient who has tested positive. So positive samples are kept in isolation,” Dr Usman said.
Chief of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr Mumtaz Ali Khan, told Dawn that this was the 51st outbreak since 2001.
“Although we have issued advisories to alert airport authorities, there are very few chances of identifying patients as the incubation period of the virus is 9 to 14 days,” he said.
Infectious disease expert Dr Rana Safdar told Dawn that Nipah virus was listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen due to a high fatality rate (up to 80pc).
“Its progression is therefore being closely monitored. While efforts are underway, to date no effective vaccine or treatment is available so the management of infected cases is largely supportive,” he added.
Dr Safdar said, since its identification in 1998, the outbreaks of Nipah virus had been sporadically occurring in South and Southeast Asia, largely in rural settings. Countries which have previously reported outbreaks include Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Bangladesh and India, he said.
“While the principle ‘infectious diseases respect no boundaries’, holds, due to the peculiar transmission dynamics, the risk of spread to surrounding countries thus far remains moderate to low. Given the current outbreak in India’s West Bengal and the associated media hype, there is no reason to panic as the risk of the virus in Pakistan stays minimal,” he said.
“While executing preventive measures, it’s important to consider that the usually deployed passenger screening at airports does not help much in preventing virus importation. We otherwise need to remain prepared, anticipating and mapping risk and enhancing vigilance in identified vulnerable zones,” Dr Safdar said.

But what is Nipah virus, and how worried should people be?
What is Nipah virus?
Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic, but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40 to 75 per cent, depending on the local healthcare system’s capacity for detection and management, the World Health Organisation (WHO) says.

However, while it can also spread from person to person, it does not do this easily, and outbreaks are usually small and fairly contained, according to experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.
Candidate vaccines are under development, although none have been approved yet.
How common is it?
Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1999. Since then, there have been small outbreaks almost every year, mostly in Bangladesh. India also sees sporadic outbreaks.
According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a group that tracks emerging disease threats and funds the development of medical tools to protect against them, as of December, 750 cases had been recorded in all, and 415 of the patients died. Reuters traced the spread of Nipah in a 2023 series, Bat Lands.
How does it spread?
When first identified in Malaysia, Nipah spread largely through direct contact with sick pigs or contaminated tissues. Since then, it more commonly spreads from contact with what scientists say is its natural host: fruit bats.
More specifically, the consumption of fruit or fruit products — like raw date palm juice — containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection, the WHO says.
Human-to-human spread has been found, mainly after close contact between a sick patient and their family or caregivers.
What are the symptoms?
The initial symptoms of Nipah, such as fever, headaches and muscle pain, are not specific and can be confused with other diseases.
These can then be followed by neurological signs indicating acute encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and some people experience severe respiratory problems.

Seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to a coma in days. Most people who get better make a full recovery, but some experience long-term neurological problems.
How worried should we be?
While Nipah is a dangerous disease with a high fatality rate, it has not yet shown signs of becoming more transmissible among humans or spreading easily worldwide, scientists say.
However, it remains a significant public health concern, according to the WHO, particularly in countries where outbreaks are more common. It can also lead to the mass culling of farm animals such as pigs that are susceptible to the virus.
Scientists say, however, that it is unlikely to spread globally and also point out that airport screening may be ineffective as the virus has a long incubation period.
What vaccines or treatments are available?
There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, although several candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the Covid-19 vaccines.

The case has been registered with the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
Senior Civil Judge Abbas Shah presided over the case’s proceedings and observed that the KP chief minister had failed to appear before the court despite being summoned.
Subsequently, he ordered the Afridi’s arrest and directed relevant authorities to produce him before the court.
The case’s hearing was adjourned till February 10.
The court had issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Afridi in the case at a previous hearing on January 4 as well over his repeated absences.
During that hearing, Judge Shah had observed that the CM repeatedly ignored summons and remained absent from proceedings without any lawful justification.
The court had noted that despite being given multiple opportunities to present himself before the court and respond to the allegations, the CM failed to comply with judicial directions.
The court had taken a serious view of Afridi’s persistent non-appearance and termed it a deliberate attempt to evade the legal process.
The case
The case against Afridi was registered after he alleged during an interaction with the media outside the Adiala jail on November 6, 2025 that security forces in KP would bring dogs into mosques and tie them down there, thereby violating the sanctity of holy places. His statement sparked an outcry, drawing condemnations.
Subsequently, a first information report (FIR) was registered against him on November 9 on behalf of the state and under Sections 11, 20 and 26-A of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016.
The FIR stated that following an inquiry dated November 8, it transpired that Afridi and others had “knowingly and deliberately, with mala fide intentions and ulterior motives, uttered false, misleading, derogatory and intimidating words against state institutions, which were recorded [and] disseminated and propagated” through social media platforms. In this connection, the FIR particularly mentioned the PTI’s YouTube channel.
It said that in a video uploaded on the channel, Afridi had made a statement “containing offensive, profane, false, misleading and unfounded allegations, with the intent to malign, defame and cause harm to the reputation and integrity of the state institutions of Pakistan”.
The “false, fake and ill-will content, publicly and intentionally uttered and promoted by the accused and others through social media is an organised attempt to undermine public trust on state institutions, including racial hatred, create unrest in the country and destablise national security”, it was alleged in the FIR.
In the FIR, Afridi was also accused of being involved in “preparing, publishing, sharing and circulating fake and misleading contents publicly on social media with the intention to incite violence, create racial hatred, panic, fear, disorder and unrest among the general public alongwith promoting anti-state sentiments, which is detrimental to the security, integrity and stability of Pakistan”.</p><small>2026-01-28 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2820364390a5bda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969546/26-countries-including-pakistan-named-founding-members-of-trump-led-board-of-peace' target='_blank'><strong>26 countries, including Pakistan, named founding members of Trump-led ‘Board of Peace’</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s newly formed “Board of Peace” on Wednesday announced 26 countries designated as founding members of the initiative, including Pakistan.
A week after Trump formally introduced the initiative at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the body launched an official account on the social media platform X.
A post on Wednesday said that the Board “welcomes Pakistan as a founding member of our growing international organisation”.







The list of founding members also includes Argentina, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Albania, Bahrain, Belarus, Bulgaria, Cambodia, El Salvador, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Mongolia, Morocco, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan, and Vietnam, spanning the Middle East, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caucasus.
Notably absent from the list are major European countries such as France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, amid sharp disagreements with Trump on issues including Greenland and tariff policies, which have strained relations between Washington and several European capitals.
Ukraine questioned how it could participate alongside Russia and Belarus.
Belarus accepted the invitation to join, while Russia was not included in the board, despite President Vladimir Putin saying Moscow was ready to allocate $1 billion from Russian assets frozen by the previous US administration to the body’s budget.
Trump rescinded Canada’s invitation, citing Prime Minister Mark Carney’s speech at the World Economic Forum, in which he warned against economic coercion by major powers.
Trump announced the establishment of the Board of Peace on January 15 as part of his broader plan for Gaza, under which the ceasefire agreement was reached. The board was authorised by UN Security Council Resolution 2803 in November 2025.
The board was originally conceived to oversee the ceasefire and reconstruction of Gaza, but its charter expands its mandate to peace-building in all areas affected by or at risk of conflict.
Further details on the board’s mandate, leadership structure, and timeline for implementation have yet to be formally announced.</p><small>2026-01-28 15:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/281911192e94a15.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969542/truck-runs-over-kills-7-year-old-boy-in-karachis-mehran-town' target='_blank'><strong>Truck runs over, kills 7-year-old boy in Karachi’s Mehran Town</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: A seven-year-old boy was killed on Wednesday when a truck ran him over in Korangi’s Mehran Town area.
According to a statement by the traffic police, the truck driver was reversing the vehicle when he ran over the boy.
The statement said the boy died on the spot while the driver fled the scene along with the heavy vehicle. It added that the driver was a resident of the same area and had intially parked the truck outside his home.
The statement said that “carelessly driving the vehicle”, the driver killed the son of his neighbour.
The body was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities.
In December, the Sindh government banned the daytime movement of heavy traffic vehicles in Karachi for two months as the city had witnessed a steep increase in traffic accidents, with many resulting from collisions with heavy vehicles such as dumper trucks and water tankers.
Earlier this month, in an effort to keep slow-moving freight vehicles from mingling with faster passenger traffic, the city commissioner had announced that heavy transport vehicles (HTVs) would be restricted to a dedicated lane with a maximum speed limit of 30km/h.</p><small>2026-01-28 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28154216b011f04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969532/governor-kundi-blames-barrage-of-statements-by-kp-govt-for-tirah-exodus' target='_blank'><strong>Governor Kundi blames ‘barrage of statements’ by KP govt for Tirah exodus</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi on Wednesday blamed statements by the PTI-led provincial government for the recent evacuation of residents from Tirah Valley in the province’s Khyber district.
The federal and provincial governments have recently traded barbs over who authorised the evacuation process after hundreds of Tirah residents vacated their homes ahead of a planned military action against terrorists.
Speaking to reporters in Khyber’s Bara tehsil — where families displaced from Tirah have arrived — Kundi noted that while there was typically around 20 per cent “migration” during winters, it was between 50 to 60pc this year.
“It is 50 to 60pc this time because statements were repeatedly made that perhaps an operation will be conducted in Tirah, so people vacated [their homes].”
“In my opinion, people are suffering today due to the failure and weakness of our province’s government,” he said.
The governor noted that the KP government had issued a “barrage of statements and compelled these people to leave the area,” adding that the residents realised the situation was different when they reached Bara.



He noted that, usually, people do not live in “tent villages” after evacuating during the winter, but stay in the homes of host families.
Kundi stressed that whenever a military operation was planned, official statements were issued and necessary preparations were made.
Speaking to reporters alongside Kundi, KP Opposition Leader Ibadullah Khan, who had accompanied the governor to Bara, said their visit aimed to meet the people who had come from Tirah and “see the ground situation” and the issues faced by the area residents.

 

“This is our duty, these are our people,” he said.
“Unfortunately, the person who has government in this province is playing politics on everything,” the PML-N MPA said, referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
He stressed that “certain topics” should not be politicised.
‘Come, let’s sit with Centre’
Kundi also extended an offer to CM Afridi for dialogue with the federal government to resolve various issues.
Noting that the PPP was an ally of the PML-N-led ruling coalition in the Centre, Kundi said: “Therefore, we have always suggested to them that if they have any issue with the Centre, they should make a committee or a jirga and we are ready to accompany you.”
The governor lamented that the PTI was willing to “hold jirgas with militants but was not ready to convene a jirga or sit with Punjab or the Centre”.

 

“They are ready to work with the country’s enemies but not those who work for the country’s stability.
“[…] If there is anything under the Centre’s responsibility, we are ready to play our role, but the provincial government should bring forth its case.”
The governor noted that the law and order situation in Dera Ismail Khan, as well as the southern and merged districts of KP, was “not that good,” adding that security personnel and residents were making sacrifices.
“Come, let’s sit with Centre, with security agencies to bring peace in the province, as well as development and prosperity,” the governor reiterated.
Noting that the KP CM hailed from the merged districts, the governor said he should “provide a solution for the injustices that he says people there have faced in the past”.
“I will again ask my province’s government to come to its senses. Leave aside Qaidi No.804 — he will come out of jail after facing punishment for his acts,” he said, an apparent reference to former prime minister Imran Khan.
Kundi went on to quip that the PTI had the option to “form two parties”, one for its “Tehreek-i-Intishaar” (incitement movement) and the other to run KP. He also noted CM Afridi’s frequent visits outside the province, including to Rawalpindi, Lahore and Karachi.







“If you have a mandate — however you got it — you should work for your province’s development,” the governor said, adding that people often requested facilitation for their medical treatment in Sindh and other places.
He noted that Ibadullah and other opposition lawmakers informed CM Afridi of various issues “daily, but he remains unmoved”.
Kundi asked the chief minister to fix KP’s governance and take steps for peace in the province.
PTI concocting narrative to hide its corruption in Tirah funds: Tallal Chaudhry
Separately, in a televised statement, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry claimed that the PTI-led KP government was concocting a false narrative to “hide its corruption” in the reported Rs4 billion approved for the Tirah residents’ temporary relocation.
“The army’s name is being taken to hide their performance, incompetence, lack of capibility and their corruption in the Rs4bn dedicated for Tirah Valley,” Chaudhry said.
Echoing the Centre’s clarifications issued in the past few days, the state minister asserted that no document or notification issued in the matter mentioned the federal government or the armed forces.
“As soon as people were relocated to other places from Tirah, and they (KP govt) were paid Rs4bn, due to which there was noise, and it was found out that their own people had retained more than half of the money for some other purpose, so a baseless narrative was created after that to hide it.”
Chaudhry asserted: “Whenever an operation is planned, we will issue a notification and conduct it after informing everyone. We will take everyone onboard.
“Any kind of new operation or any operation is not taking place in Tirah Valley currently.”
However, the interior official added, “If any action is underway in the entire country, from Quetta to Gilgit and Gilgit to Karachi, it is under the National Action Plan (NAP).

 

Highlighting that the current NAP was revised in 2021 under the PTI government, Chaudhry said the KP government was “fully a part of it”.
“Each action, each IB (intelligence-based) operation or other action — the KP government is a full participant and onboard with each action taken in KP or any process carried out under the National Action Plan,” he asserted.
The PML-N leader remarked that the “issue is they want to do it but they are scared”. “You want to do it and even attempt to, are fully onboard the National Action Plan, but are also scared and hide.”
The state minister contended that the KP government was “concocting a narrative based on lies” to create a political narrative, collect votes, hide its corruption and divert attention from its performance.
Noting that Rs14bn were recovered from a “truck driver’s account” in the Kohistan graft case, Chaudhry alleged there was a “similar scandal in Tirah” involving the Rs4bn allocated.



The interior ministry official declared that the “routine” intelligence-based operations (IBOs) will continue under the NAP, and they were taking place with the “cooperation” of the KP government and its chief minister.
“But to make themselves appear good in the public’s eyes and make the army bad, lies are told,” he remarked, noting that military operations had previously been carried out after proper announcements.
“Whenever there is such a need, we do not need to hide. We will do it openly,” Chaudhry said.
“But repeatedly making false accusations against the army cannot hide your lack of capability, incompetence, or corruption, or the Rs4bn that went in your pockets in Tirah Valley,” he added.
The minister highlighted that the KP government was responsible for distributing the allocated funds, adding that the deputy commissioner who was involved in the December agreement with the tribal elders was also under the provincial administration.
“The action for which you are fully responsible, not just a participant, you pin the blame for it on someone else,” Chaudhry quipped.</p><small>2026-01-28 15:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28192122f5e3b79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969539/australia-provide-benchmark-test-for-pakistan-ahead-of-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Australia provide benchmark test for Pakistan ahead of T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The last year was supposed to be the one in which Pakistan were supposed to redefine their approach towards Twenty20 cricket. It didn’t come.
Despite the promises of more aggression with the bat and the subsequent change in personnel, the team scored at just 127.47 – more than a run (1.37 to be precise) slower than the year before. There was a record for the most wins in a calendar year — 21 — but 18 of those had come against lower-ranked or weaker sides in Bangladesh, West Indies, Afghanistan, Oman, UAE, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.
The attempted reinvention — that brought in new captain and head coach — focused towards ensuring Pakistan’s T20 World Cup campaign this year does not look similar to 2024, when they were knocked out in just the group stage following embarrassing defeats to the United States and India.
There are some positives though. Pakistan look more settled as a team with the roles for each player well defined as the selectors and team management have persisted with the same core for the last 10 months.
That was not the case in last year’s Champions Trophy when Pakistan, due to an injury to one player, rejigged their entire batting order, and before the 2024 edition of the T20 World Cup when two cricketers came out of retirement only to play that tournament.

 

For Pakistan, who are accustomed to chaos, this is a good start. But, they face their sternest challenge when they come up against Australia — albeit in the familiar surroundings of Lahore — from Thursday in three T20Is. A series against a tough and ruthless opposition like Australia is not a bad way to get ready for a world event and it will help Salman Ali Agha in shaping his playing XI.
“These games are very important because they will determine what will be our XI for the World Cup,” the Pakistan T20I captain told a press conference before his team’s final practice session ahead of the series.
“We are pretty much on track in regards to the direction we ventured upon a year ago. We have not had the conditions [in most series] to score 200 runs, but we scored 200 whenever we got them. We did so over here [at Gaddafi Stadium] against Bangladesh in almost every game. The team’s progress has been good.”
But, there remain areas that need to be fine-tuned before Pakistan departs for Colombo.
Since their T20I tri-series victory in November 2025, Pakistan have played only two matches in Sri Lanka and the last of them had to be curtailed because of the rain. Most of the Pakistan players had been playing in leagues around the world and the performances of the batters have not been satisfactory.
Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub, Pakistan’s two openers, are coming off an underwhelming BPL and Fakhar Zaman failed to fire in the ILT20. Babar Azam had a torrid BBL in which he failed to put any score of note and his scoring rate remained under scanner.
Shaheen Afridi returns to competitive cricket after a knee injury curtailed his BBL stint with Brisbane Heat. Being the most senior pacer in the side, Shaheen will carry the weight of Pakistan’s four-man fast bowling contingent and his workload will be stretched in the absence of Haris Rauf as Pakistan will often return to him in the latter half of the opposition’s innings to stop the flow of runs in the death overs.
Pakistan’s recent successes have been engineered by their spin attack and the selectors had no qualms in naming a spin-heavy contingent for the T20 World Cup, which they will play in spin-friendly conditions.
In the ongoing T20 World Cup cycle (since the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup final), Pakistan spinners have taken 140 wickets in 44 matches at an average of 18.477 and have bowled at an economy rate of 6.94. Among the full-member teams, only India have taken more wickets (161) than them at an average of 15.68. But, India’s economy rate of 7.18 falls behind Pakistan.
But, the stiff challenge that this Australian side poses will test each aspect of Pakistan’s game, which is the best possible preparation that a team can ask for before a world event. Pakistan have lost all their completed last seven T20Is against Australia, including the solitary game between these two sides on Pakistan soil (also at Gaddafi Stadium). They last won a T20I against Australia back in October 2018 when Sarfaraz Ahmed was the captain.
Australia play the series without their frontline pace attack due to the injury-related absences of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.
Middle-order hard-hitter Tim David will also not play in this series because of hamstring woes.
The three will join the team in Sri Lanka ahead of their warm-up in Colombo. But, the squad that in land in Lahore in two batches – first in early afternoon and the second in late evening – contains most of those in Travis Head, captain Mitch Marsh, Cameron Green, Marcus Stoinis, and Adam Zampa, who have turned this side into a formidable unit.
Australia decided against holding practice before the first T20I as most of their players have had a camp in the UAE over the last four days and the others arrived straight from Australia after having played in the BBL finals.
Marsh, who had landed in Lahore just a few hours before the press conference, revealed that the final call on the team composition will be made when the squad sits together as a group later in the evening.
“Thank you for having us,” Marsh said. “We’re very excited to be here. It’s a really important time in both teams’ preparation for the [T20] World Cup. Most of the squad has been in Dubai for the last four days training and getting together. Some of us have flown in a little bit later due to Big Bash commitments. But we’re ready to go and looking forward to a great series.”
But would there be any acclimatisation issues with such a quick turnaround?
“I didn’t pack too many jumpers,” Marsh said, “[I] wasn’t aware Pakistan got this cold.”</p><small>2026-01-28 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/281852460a48481.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969541/trump-threatens-iran-over-nuclear-talks-says-time-is-running-out' target='_blank'><strong>Trump threatens Iran over nuclear talks, says ‘time is running out’</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday renewed threats to attack Iran, saying “time is running out” to make a deal on nuclear weapons, after Tehran rejected talks.
“Hopefully Iran will quickly ‘Come to the Table’ and negotiate a fair and equitable deal — NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS — one that is good for all parties. Time is running out,” the US leader said in a social media post, noting that “a massive armada is heading to Iran.”







“As I told Iran once before, MAKE A DEAL! They didn’t, and there was ‘Operation Midnight Hammer,’ a major destruction of Iran. The next attack will be far worse!”
The dialling up of threats came after Iran’s top diplomat said the country would not come to the table under the shadow of military action.
“Conducting diplomacy through military threat cannot be effective or useful,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in televised comments on Wednesday.
“If they want negotiations to take shape, they must certainly set aside threats, excessive demands and raising illogical issues.”

 

Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Earlier this month, he threatened to strike Iran over its crackdown on anti-government protests. But the prospect of immediate American action seemed to recede in recent days, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance.
With a US naval strike group led by an aircraft carrier lurking in the region, top Iranian officials also reached out to key Arab states in behind-the-scenes diplomacy to rally support.
A strike group led by the USS Abraham Lincoln has now arrived in Middle Eastern waters, US Central Command said, without revealing its precise location.</p><small>2026-01-28 13:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647731-pti-chief-sounds-alarm-over-imran-khans-reported-hospital-visit' target='_blank'><strong>PTI chief sounds alarm over Imran Khan's reported hospital visit</strong></a><br><p>

A two-member SHC bench, presided over by Justice Adnanul Karim Memon and Justice Zulfiqar Ali Sangi, heard a petition filed in May 2024.

 

During the hearing, Justice Memon questioned the need for lifting the ban on student unions and remarked, “Education is already in ruins, why do you want to make it worse?
“What is the purpose and benefit of a student union?” the judge asked the petitioners’ counsel, Advocate Usman Farooq.
At this, the lawyer replied that a student union’s purpose was to provide representation to students in policy-making.
“Just as there are labour unions at factories, do students now want to threaten their vice-chancellors?” Justice Memon remarked.
Noting that the case file had documents dating back to 2021, he inquired whether the petitioners were still students.
The bench then announced a short order, dismissing the plea and ordering the petitioners to submit Rs10,000 to the SHC as fine for frivolous litigation.
The petition, a copy of which was available with Dawn, had been filed by Karachi residents Taimoor Ahmed, Muhammad Basiq Bin Nadeem and Hassan Ahmed under Article 199 (jurisdiction of high court) of the Constitution.
The Sindh government, the KU registrar and vice chancellor, and the Sindh Assembly speaker were made respondents in the case.
The petition requested the SHC to direct the respondents to “immediately commence the process of conducting student union elections” at KU in accordance with the Sindh Students Union Act 2019, the University of Karachi Act 1972, and the Constitution.
It also urged the court to order KU to formulate regulations and procedures for the conduct of student union elections within the stipulated time frame, “ensuring transparency and fairness in the electoral process”.
While the ban on student unions in Sindh was imposed in 1979, it was extended to the rest of the country in 1984 by the regime of former dictator Gen Ziaul Haq through Martial Law Orders. The orders were rescinded by the first government of ex-premier Benazir Bhutto in 1988.

 

Three years later, the unions were challenged in the Supreme Court on the grounds that they were contributing to on-campus violence.
Then, in 1993, a three-member SC bench headed by then-chief justice Afzal Zulla imposed a ban on the political nature of student unions — a restriction often blamed for the leadership crisis in the country’s political landscape.
The verdict in the M. Ismail Qureshi vs Islami Jamiat-i-Talaba secretary general M. Owais Qasim case prohibited student groups from affiliating with mainstream parties and barred students from holding positions in university statutory bodies, which would have allowed them to participate in policymaking alongside the university administration.
In December 2024, the SC’s constitutional bench admitted for hearing petitions challenging the decades-long ban on student unions in educational institutions.

“Our effort is to complete the main corridor on University Road — where there is heavy public movement and where citizens face difficulties — by March,” said the senior minister while speaking to the media in the metropolis.
“The remaining BRT work will continue, including bridges, underpasses, and U-turns,” he added.
He further said the condition of the main thoroughfare and its adjoining routes is now “far better than before”.
“Wherever the roads appear damaged, it is only because development work is currently under way,” he added.
Referring to the lack of construction activity, he maintained that the provincial government was not at fault, as there were “some serious issues at the national level”, adding that with an increase in the exchange rate, the project’s cost ballooned.
He added that the Sindh Transport Department will soon commence work on the Yellow Line BRT project. “People are currently facing difficulties, and they will face more difficulties [after the work commences]. We know this, and we apologise to the citizens.”
The provincial minister said that the Sindh government was answerable to the people on every platform and could be questioned on the matter.
“As I said, people will face difficulties, for instance, when work will commence on Yellow Line,” he reiterated, adding that however, once such projects were complete, “you, as well as your future generations, will [have access to these] facilities”.
The minister said an easier option was to buy buses and simply run them on roads. “But given the situation of traffic and population growth, what would you have done in the future? If you have no routes [to run those buses], what will you do?”
“So, we apologise for the inconvenience that you are facing today, but these difficulties will end soon once these projects are complete,” he said. “These projects worth billions are for Karachi, as Karachi is the hub of Pakistan, Karachi is the hub of Sindh, and it belongs to all of us. The responsibility of Karachi’s development lies with all of us, especially those who are in governments.”
The minister said that was why a major portion of Sindh’s budget was spent on Karachi.
He claimed that no other city in Pakistan had “state-of-the-art government hospitals” similar to the ones in Karachi, where not just people from the port city but from across the country were being provided medical treatment.
“All of us have to work together for Karachi’s development […] because if Karachi will progress, the entire country will progress. So Karachi’s progress is Sindh government’s priority,” he asserted.
Memon was also asked about the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) accusing the Sindh government of its “incapability” in the area of development and demanding the chief minister’s resignation.
In his response, Memon said it did not matter what they demand. He asserted that the Sindh government had been carrying out development work in Karachi.
He also insisted that the port city had an “empowered local government system and that is why local bodies are functioning here”.
On MQM-P’s demand to make Karachi a federal territory, he said two of the party’s leaders were federal ministers. “They should then demand from the federal government to [make Karachi a federal territory] within 24 or 48 hours and warn that they would otherwise resign,” he said, adding that they would not do so.</p><small>2026-01-28 13:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2817101397a001c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969536/pm-shehbaz-reaffirms-resolve-to-eradicate-polio-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reaffirms resolve to eradicate polio in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has reaffirmed the resolve to completely eradicate polio from the country, state-run Radio Pakistan said on Wednesday.
According to the report, he made the remarks while speaking to Gates Foundation Global Development President Chris Elias in Islamabad.
“The government is implementing a comprehensive strategy and taking practical actions with an effective team,” the report quoted him as saying.







The premier also expressed deep gratitude for the collaboration of Bill Gates and Saudi Arabia in the fight against polio, it said.
It stated that despite significant progress in the fight against polio, PM Shehbaz emphasised that emergency measures were “still necessary”.
According to Radio Pakistan, PM Shehbaz said, “The federal government is working in full coordination with the provinces to ensure the accessibility of polio teams throughout the country under an effective strategy.”
“He said relevant projects under the Public Sector Development Programme for the polio eradication campaign will continue across the country,” it added.
The state-run broadcaster said that the Gates Foundation official appreciated the prime minister’s “personal attention to polio eradication and the effective measures taken in this regard”.
“He recognised that Pakistan is taking effective steps toward complete polio eradication, which are progressing towards success,” it said.
Elias further said that there would be continued constructive consultation with federal, provincial governments and relevant institutions on polio eradication, the report added.
The development comes a day after a high-level delegation from the Gates Foundation visited the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), where Pakistan’s Polio Eradication Programme reiterated its resolve to achieve the Roadmap to Zero Polio 2026.</p><small>2026-01-28 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647695-islamabad-court-issues-non-bailable-arrest-warrant-for-cm-afridi-in-cybercrime-case' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court issues non-bailable arrest warrant for CM Afridi in cybercrime case</strong></a><br><p>

Police and local residents said the explosion occurred near Zaga Deri Sewi bazaar, leaving a man seriously injured.
Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Niaz Muhammad told Dawn that the victim, identified as 47-year-old Najibullah, died while being transported to the Khar District Headquarters Hospital for treatment.
He said the IED was planted by unidentified miscreants.
The DSP added that a team of police personnel from the War Mamund police station, led by Station House Officer (SHO) Aslam Khan, had rushed to the spot and launched a search operation for the terrorists involved in the incident.
He further said an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the blast and identify those were responsible for it.
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p><small>2026-01-28 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2815394503ea4fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969530/australian-squad-arrives-in-lahore-for-t20i-series-ahead-of-icc-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Australian squad arrives in Lahore for T20I series ahead of ICC World Cup</strong></a><br><p>The Australian cricket team arrived in Lahore on Wednesday for its T20I tour of Pakistan ahead of the ICC Men’s T20I World Cup in February.
This is the third time Australia are touring Pakistan; they played a three-match Test and an ODI series in March-April 2022, followed by a solitary T20I where they bagged a close three-wicket win at Gaddafi Stadium.
Australia also played three of their 2025 Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan.
All three matches are scheduled to take place at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on January 29, 31 and February 1, PCB said in a statement.







Addressing a press conference in Lahore on Wednesday, Australian captain Mitchell Marsh praised Pakistan’s team and said Australia was excited about the challenge of playing them on home soil in preparation for the World Cup.
“Pakistan’s got a great history of fast bowlers, so no doubt that we’re looking forward to that challenge,” Marsh said in response to a question. “Especially Shaheen: he’s an amazing bowler and it’s going to be a great challenge for our group.”







Marsh added that some of the Australian team members would meet them in Sri Lanka, as the tour was “really important for our World Cup preparations”.
“We’ve got some guys that weren’t quite ready to be here,” he said. “But they’re back home training and preparing to meet us in Sri Lanka, so absolutely no stress there from our end.”
The five senior Australian players being rested during the series are Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Glenn Maxwell, as well as Tim David and Nathan Ellis.
Answering a question about Pakistan’s Babar Azam, Marsh said, “Babar’s been a world-class player for a long period of time for Pakistan. So we have great respect for him. And we know that in these conditions he’s one of the best players in the world still, so we look forward to that challenge.”
About the Pakistani team as a whole, Marsh added, “We have great respect for them and we look forward to the challenge of playing them here … we’re just really excited about the opportunity.”
Salman Ali Agha, meanwhile, dismissed the view of teams as being “big or small” while speaking to the media.
“If you’re playing internationally, no team can be easy … any team that comes to us, we don’t look at whether they’re the number one team or lower-ranked than us; we look at how we can improve our cricket and what plan we can execute.”







He stressed the importance of the games, saying, “There are some boxes that need to be ticked — this is one of those series where, we will tick all boxes”.
Agha said that an effort had been made to prepare the same kind of pitches that would be expected in Sri Lanka.
In response to a question, he challenged the notion that the absence of senior Australian players was a “golden opportunity” for Pakistan.
“Whoever comes from the Australian team, their mentality is such that they’re all good players and they think about dominating the game,” he said.
“So you can’t say that because three or four of their main players haven’t come, this is a golden opportunity.”

Looking to lift the trophy for the first time, the 28-year-old will take on American Jessica Pegula for a place in Saturday’s final.
Rybakina fired 11 aces and 26 winners as she ended Swiatek’s career Grand Slam bid on Rod Laver Arena, winning eight of the last nine games to underline her authority.

‘Really pleased with the win,’ said Rybakina. ‘We know each other pretty well and I was just trying to stay aggressive.
‘I feel like in the first set for both of us the first serve wasn’t working so we were trying to step in on the second serve to put pressure on each other.
‘I think in the second I just started to play more free, serve better and I’m really happy with the win.’
Swiatek had made a quick start, breaking Rybakina in the opening game as she punished the Kazakh’s second serve but the number two seed failed to consolidate, immediately surrendering her advantage.
Both players held serve until the final game, when Swiatek fired into the net to give Rybakina the opening set after almost an hour’s play.

Rybakina then made the most of Swiatek’s frustrations with her service, taking the second game of the second set by crashing a forehand into the corner with the Pole rooted to the spot.
Swiatek was left questioning a marginal line call as Rybakina broke her serve again late in the set before comfortably holding to advance.
Swiatek struggled with her serve throughout the contest and the world number two said that was something she needed to improve on in the coming months.
‘I didn’t serve as well as in Cincinnati, for example, against Elena. My serve was kind of normal and sometimes it could have given me a bit more,’ Swiatek told reporters.

‘There’s some stuff on the serve that I want to change and I already changed that in the pre-season. But then matches come and you don’t have that much time to think about this.
‘You don’t want to think about these details when you play. So then it comes back to the old patterns… There’s some stuff that I can change to play better and I’ll try to do that.’ she said.</p><small>2026-01-28 10:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28133537744e67e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969522/mineral-sector-transformation-cannot-happen-without-strategic-partners-planning-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Mineral sector transformation cannot happen without strategic partners: planning minister</strong></a><br><p>Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Wednesday stressed that the development of the country’s mineral sector “cannot happen without strategic partners”, particularly China.
Pakistan’s mineral wealth is estimated at $8 trillion, spread across 600,000 square kilometres and comprising 92 identified minerals, 52 of which are commercially extracted, according to an estimate by the Institute of Cost and Management Accountants of Pakistan (ICMA).
He made the remarks while addressing the Pak-China Mineral Cooperation Forum in Islamabad.
Noting the scale of Pakistan’s mineral wealth, the minister highlighted the gap between the sector’s potential and performance, stating that the “gap is a result of structural constraints”.
He maintained that the mineral sector’s “transformation” was dependent on “strategic partners”, terming China’s role “central” in the matter.
“Chinese enterprises bring advanced expertise to the entire mining value chain, including geological surveying, modern extraction techniques, mineral processing, smelting, refining and manufacturing,” the minister said.
He held that existing projects with China, such as “Sandak copper gold, Duddar lead-zinc, and Thar coal demonstrate what the partnership can achieve”.
“Our objective now is to move decisively, and beyond extraction,” the minister said.
He elaborated that Pakistan is seeking to “develop mineral processing plants, smelters, refining facilities and mineral-based industrial [..] linked with special economic zones and transport corridors”.
On that note, he also suggested the establishment of a “Nokundi, Mashkel, Turbat, Gwadar corridor, through which we will be able to link the mineral sector in Balochistan to the Gwadar port”.
Iqbal noted that “the country hosts around 5,000 operational mines, producing nearly 68.5 million metric tonnes”.
However, Pakistan’s mineral exports stood at a “modest” estimate of $2 billion, the minister said, and added that the exports contribute “only 2-3 per cent to the GDP”.
The minister noted that despite having a “whole range of granite from Turbat to Chitral”, the country remained unable to utilise the full potential of the industry.
“We are still using blasting technology and destroying the value of the valuable treasure we have,” he added, calling for the need to bring in modern technology to enhance mineral extraction in Pakistan.
The minister further said that “only 40pc of Pakistan’s land had been geologically mapped, while 90pc of our exports are either raw or [..]”.
“Mineral exports have the potential to reach $6-8bn annually within this decade,” he stressed.
The minister also held that the mining initiatives should “strengthen national cohesion, rather than deepening disparities”.
He stressed that the people of Balochistan and parts of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa “must see tangible results in the form of job skills, infrastructure, education, and health services”.
The minister also reaffirmed the government’s commitment towards the safety and security of Chinese nationals, terming it a “top national priority”.
“The future of Pakistan-China mineral cooperation lies in co-creating values, innovation, human capital development, and long-term partnerships,” the minister said.
He extended an invitation to Chinese enterprises to “take a leading role in copper, gold, antimony, tungsten, rare earth elements and other critical minerals shaping the future of clean energy and advanced manufacturing”.
“With China as our trusted partner, we can convert mineral wealth into industrial strength, export competitiveness and shared prosperity,” the minister maintained.
In a joint communique issued earlier this month, the two countries had vowed to build an upgraded version of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), with mining as one of the key sectors. Pakistan exports nearly $1.2bn worth of copper ore to China annually.
Last year, Pakistan also formally entered the global critical minerals market by dispatching its first shipment of enriched rare earth elements and critical minerals to Missouri-based US Strategic Metals (USSM) under a $500m agreement.
The consignment sent on Oct 2, 2025, signaled Pakistan’s evolution from a resource-rich yet underutilised economy into an emerging player in strategic global supply chains.</p><small>2026-01-28 08:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647661-gul-plaza-blaze-took-79-lives-most-in-mezzanine-floor-report' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza blaze took 79 lives, most in mezzanine floor: report</strong></a><br><p>

Spot gold jumped 1.4 per cent to $5,262.66 per ounce, as of 05:58 GMT, after scaling a record high of $5,266.37 earlier. It has gained more than 20pc since the start of the year.
US gold futures for February delivery surged 3.4pc to $5,255.30 per ounce.
“(Gold’s rise) is due to the very strong indirect correlation with the dollar and … Trump’s remark to a casual question about the dollar, which implied that (there is) a broad-based consensus within the White House to have a weaker greenback going forward,” said Kelvin Wong, a senior market analyst at OANDA.
The US dollar was grappling with a “crisis of confidence” as it struggled near four-year lows, exacerbating dollar selling, after President Donald Trump said the currency’s value is “great” when asked whether he thought it had declined too much.
US consumer confidence, meanwhile, slumped to its lowest level in more than 11 years in January amid mounting anxiety over a sluggish labour market and high prices.
Trump added that he will soon announce his pick to serve as head of the Fed, and predicted interest rates would decline once the new chair takes over.
“Given the tension between the Fed’s mandates and the White House, I think the markets are just getting defensive ahead of (Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s remarks later today),” Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive said.
The Fed is widely expected to hold rates steady at its January monetary policy meeting, currently underway.
Wong added that near-term resistance for gold could be seen around $5,240/oz. Deutsche Bank said on Tuesday that gold could climb to $6,000 per ounce in 2026, citing persistent investment demand as central banks and investors increase allocations to non-dollar and tangible assets.
Spot silver was up 2pc at $115.40 an ounce, after hitting a record high of $117.69 on Monday. The white metal has jumped almost 60pc so far this year.
Spot platinum gained 1.7pc to $2,685.16 per ounce after hitting a record $2,918.80 on Monday, while palladium was up 0.7pc at $1,946.75.</p><small>2026-01-28 08:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/2815192359e4382.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969520/lhc-seeks-govt-response-on-plea-seeking-to-ban-social-media-for-under-16s' target='_blank'><strong>LHC seeks govt response on plea seeking to ban social media for under-16s</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Wednesday sought replies from the federal government and other authorities on a petition seeking a ban on the use of social media by children under the age of 16.
LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum heard the petition filed by Aliya Saleem and others through Advocate Shiza Qureshi on Tuesday.
Justice Neelum observed that it was an important matter and a policy issue that should be addressed by the government.
The counsel for the petitioner contended that social media was causing serious harm to the mental, moral and educational development of children.
The petitioner’s counsel stated that developed countries were also considering restrictions on social media use by underage children.

 

The lawyer informed the court that Australia imposed a ban on children’s use of social media in December 2025, while France, Norway, Malaysia and New Zealand were in the process of legislating on the matter.
Qureshi asked the court to order a ban on social media use for children under 16 years of age.
Justice Neelum directed a law officer to seek instructions from the government and submit a report by February 16.

 

Earlier this month, senators Falak Naz, Fawzia Arshad, Aimal Wali Khan, Saadia Abbasi and Dilawar Khan called for keeping tabs on the use of social media platforms by children under the age of 18.
Presiding over the sitting, Senator Sherry Rehman said some checks were needed and suggested forming a special committee to develop safeguards in consultation with relevant ministries.
In September, the LHC issued notices to the federal government and other respondents on a petition seeking a ban on the use of Facebook and TikTok by children.</p><small>2026-01-28 08:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/281233067416338.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969518/five-players-move-to-platinum-as-pcb-confirms-local-player-category-renewals-for-upcoming-psl-season' target='_blank'><strong>Five players move to Platinum as PCB confirms local player category renewals for upcoming PSL season</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Wednesday confirmed the category renewals of 89 local players for the upcoming season of the Pakistan Super League (PSL), promoting five players, including Salman Ali Agha, to the Platinum category.
A press release issued by the PCB said that the five players moved to the Platinum category were T20I captain Salman Ali Agha, Sahibzada Farhan, Mohammad Nawaz, Hasan Ali and Abrar Ahmed.
“Going forward, each franchise may retain a maximum of four players, limited to one player per category,” the statement said.
It added that, following the completion of retentions, the teams will participate in the first-ever PSL player auction on February 11 to complete their team rosters.
The statement also said that the registration date for foreign players had been extended to February 3.
According to the PCB, among the newly-designated Platinum players, only Sahibzada was previously in the Gold category, while the others made the jump from the Diamond category.
“Shadab Khan, Naseem Shah, Imad Wasim, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Babar Azam, Saim Ayub, Mohammad Rizwan, Faheem Ashraf and Mohammad Amir managed to remain in the Platinum category after featuring in the HBL PSL X in the same category as well,” the statement added.
A total of 11 players are in the Diamond category, which includes three from Quetta Gladiators, three from Multan Sultans, two each from Lahore Qalandars and Karachi Kings, one from Peshawar Zalmi and none from Islamabad United, it said.
Mohammad Salman Mirza, Sufyan Moqim and Mohammad Wasim Jr have jumped up from Gold to Diamond, it added.
Among the 32 players assigned to the Gold category this year, four each are from Islamabad United and Lahore Qalandars, eight from Karachi Kings, six from Peshawar Zalmi and five each from Multan Sultans and Quetta Gladiators.
The statement added that Multan Sultans have seven players in the Silver category, Lahore Qalandars have three, Peshawar Zalmi and Islamabad United have two each, and Quetta Gladiators and Karachi Kings have one each.
Meanwhile, the Emerging category comprises of 14 players with three each listed in Islamabad United, Karachi Kings and Peshawar Zalmi; two each in Quetta Gladiators and Multan Sultans, and one from Lahore Qalandars, it said.
“Hunain Shah, Ubaid Shah, Mirza Mamoon Imtiaz, Mohammad Naeem and Mohammad Azab are the players who have made the move from Emerging to Silver for the upcoming season, while Hasan Nawaz went to Gold after featuring in the HBL PSL X in the Emerging category,” the PCB added.

The storm started to develop on Friday and dumped snow across a large region over the weekend. The snow snarled road traffic and led to widespread flight cancellations and power outages before subsiding Monday, leaving behind bitter cold that is expected to linger.
By Tuesday, cities were mobilising emergency responders and resources to ensure that residents, particularly homeless people, were safe, even as more than 550,000 homes and businesses across the country lacked electricity.
Ten of the storm’s fatal victims were in New York City, where temperatures were the coldest they had been in eight years, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said at a news conference on Tuesday, when the low hit -13° Celsius.
While the 10 victims were found outside, it was not clear whether they were homeless. Mamdani told reporters Monday that some of the dead “had had interactions with our shelter system in the past. It is still too early to share a broader diagnosis or a cause of death.”

New York City postponed from this week until early February an annual count of its homeless population required by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development.
“Outreach workers should be focused on bringing New Yorkers inside, not on data collection,” Mamdani said. “Here is the bottom line, New York City: Extreme weather is not a personal failure.”
Around 500 of the more than 4,000 homeless people estimated to live in the city’s streets and subway have been placed in shelters since January 19, Mamdani said. Outreach workers were checking every two hours on 350 homeless people who are at particular risk due to underlying medical conditions.
In Nashville, Tennessee, a city of about 680,000 where more than 135,000 homes and businesses remain without power, the temperature is expected to drop to -14°C by Wednesday morning with below-zero wind chills.
“Let’s be clear about what this is,” Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell said at a Tuesday press conference. “It is an historic ice storm.”
Nashville officials said about 1,400 homeless people had filled all three of the city’s homeless shelters and two overflow shelters, with police and firefighters working overtime and emergency workers checking the streets.
The Nashville Rescue Mission, a homeless charity that feeds, clothes and offers shelter year-round, typically might have about 400 people a night, but in the cold snap that number has swollen to about 7,000.

 

“We’re always full, but we never turn anyone away,” an attendant who was not authorised to speak to reporters, so did not give a name, told Reuters by telephone. “When the weather is bad, people come in out of the cold.”
Various causes of death
Across the country, storm-related causes of death ranged from hypothermia and exposure to cardiac incidents while clearing snow.
In Bonham, Texas, about 55 miles northeast of Dallas, three young boys died after falling in an ice pond over the weekend, though the exact circumstances were unclear, according to the local fire department.

Several hours away in Austin, Texas, a person died of apparent hypothermia while trying to shelter at an abandoned gas station, authorities said. Other hypothermia deaths were reported from Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Michigan, local media reported.
Almost 200 million Americans remain under some form of winter cold warning at least through February 1.

Pawar, who hailed from a top political family, was en route to his home region to canvass in local body elections, media said.
Two of his staff and two crew were also aboard the aircraft, the directorate general of civil aviation said.
“No person on board has survived,” it added in an initial statement.
Pawar backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in the state government, leading a faction that split in 2023 from the opposition Nationalist Congress Party.
Video showed billows of smoke rising from some of the burning wreckage of the plane, scattered across an open field.







Media said Pawar’s aircraft, travelling from the financial capital of Mumbai, tried to make an emergency landing in the family stronghold of Baramati, 250 km away, where he was set to canvass in the elections.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, expressed sympathy with the families of the deceased.
“Saddened by the tragic air crash in Baramati, Maharashtra. My thoughts are with all those who lost their loved ones in the crash,” he said.
“Praying for strength and courage for the bereaved families in this moment of profound grief,” the indian prime minister added.







The incident comes a week after an Indian Air Force (IAF) training aircraft crashed in India’s northern Uttar Pradesh state, with both pilots emerging unharmed.
In July 2025, more than 200 people were killed when an Air India plane bound for London with 242 people on board crashed shortly after takeoff, in what was said to be the world’s worst aviation disaster in a decade.
Only one person was known to have survived, as the plane came down in a residential area, crashing onto a medical college hostel.</p><small>2026-01-28 06:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/647623-80-year-old-man-killed-in' target='_blank'><strong>80-year-old man killed in another deadly Karachi fire</strong></a><br><p>

The Somali-born US lawmaker, a constant target of US President Donald Trump’s attacks, had just called for the president’s homeland security chief to resign in the wake of immigration agents killing two US citizens in a matter of weeks.
The attacker, identified by police as 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak, managed to spray Omar before he was tackled and removed from the Tuesday meeting in Minneapolis. She was unharmed, police said.
Yet before he was even grabbed, Omar stepped rapidly toward the attacker with her fist raised. The lawmaker then went on to urge the crowd to settle down and listen to herremarks.



“Here is the reality that people like this ugly man don’t understand — we are Minnesota strong and we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw at us,” Omar said to the meeting of constituents.
Authorities have not reported what may have motivated the attacker, but the incident comes as Minneapolis is in a running confrontation with Trump’s aggressive deportation campaign.
Ahead of the incident, Omar’s constituents raised issues with her as eclectic as trash collections and the plight of North Minneapolis, alongside fears over the sweeping immigration operations that have sparked large protests.
Just as she called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, the attacker jumped to his feet from the front row of seats in the meeting room.
He then appeared to spray the contents of his syringe, prompting complaints about a foul smell, AFP correspondents witnessed.
Two men quickly tackled the assailant, sparking calls of “Nazis out” as he was led from the room.
Stunned onlookers gasped and recoiled as the drama unfolded against an already tense backdrop in Minnesota as its targeted by Trump’s immigration operation.
Omar has accused Trump of turning Minneapolis into a “war zone”, while he has accused her of corruption without evidence.
‘Not about him’
“It’s not about him, Ilhan,” said one bystander, seeking to encourage Omar, an outspoken Trump critic, to continue.
Undeterred, Omar proclaimed, “Please don’t let them have the show.” The suspect was arrested on suspicion of third-degree assault, according to police. An investigation was underway.
One witness said they asked themselves, “Is this really happening?”
“He could have done something else,” he told AFP.
Questions will be asked about security arrangements at the event with members of the public checked by staff, but members of the press allowed in without scrutiny.
After the event, Omar, the first Somali-American representative, posted on X, “I’m OK.”
“I’m a survivor so this small agitator isn’t going to intimidate me from doing my work,” she wrote.

In a phone call with Pezeshkian, the crown prince affirmed his country’s support for any “efforts that would resolve differences through dialogue” to bolster security and stability in the region.
Earlier, Iranian media reported that Pezeshkian told bin Salman that Tehran welcomes any process, within the framework of international law, that prevents war.







The statement by the Saudi de facto ruler follows a similar statement by the United Arab Emirates that it would not allow any military action against Iran using its airspace or territorial waters.
Uncertainty over the possibility of military action in Iran has lingered after US President Donald Trump said last week that an “armada” was heading toward the country but that he hoped he would not have to use it.
Trump said on Tuesday another US “armada” was floating towards Iran and he hoped that Tehran would make a deal with Washington.
“There is another beautiful armada floating beautifully towards Iran right now,” Trump said in a speech.
“I hope they make a deal.”



Trump’s warnings to Tehran were against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme, but the countrywide demonstrations have since abated.
A US aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East, two US officials told Reuters on Monday, expanding Trump’s capabilities to defend US forces, or potentially take military action against Iran.
Iran has been embroiled in protests during which rights groups say security forces killed thousands of people, including bystanders.
The rights groups describe the unrest as the biggest crackdown since the Iranian leadership took power in the 1979 revolution. Iranian authorities have blamed the unrest and deaths on terrorists and rioters backed by exiled opponents.</p><small>2026-01-28 06:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28101234685e5ac.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509/india-confirms-two-nipah-virus-cases-says-it-ensured-timely-containment' target='_blank'><strong>India confirms two Nipah virus cases, says it ensured ‘timely containment’</strong></a><br><p>Indian authorities said they had ensured “timely containment” of the deadly Nipah virus after two cases were confirmed in West Bengal state.
Nipah, spreads from animals to humans, has no vaccine and a fatality rate ranging from 40 to 75 per cent, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).
“Enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, and field investigations were undertaken… which ensured timely containment of the cases,” India’s health ministry said in a statement late Tuesday.
It did not give further details on the two infected patients.
“The situation is under constant monitoring, and all necessary public health measures are in place”, it added, saying 196 contacts linked to the cases had been traced, and all were negative.
Nipah was first identified in 1998 after it spread among pig farmers in Malaysia.
In India, the first Nipah outbreak was reported in West Bengal in 2001.
In 2018, at least 17 people died from Nipah in Kerala, and in 2023, two people died from the virus, also in the southern state.
Symptoms include intense fever, vomiting and a respiratory infection, but severe cases can involve seizures and brain inflammation that results in a coma.
Fruit bats are the natural carriers of the virus and have been identified as the most likely cause of subsequent outbreaks.</p><small>2026-01-28 05:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/28080202a5a8a7e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969449/pakistans-macroeconomic-outlook-to-strengthen-sampp' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook to strengthen: S&P</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: S&P Global Market Intelligence has projected a strengthening of Pakistan’s macroeconomic outlook in the current and next fiscal years, endorsing the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) projections.
Real GDP to expand 3.5 per cent in FY26, before strengthening to 4.4pc in FY27, it said while commenting on SBP’s monetary policy decision that kept benchmark interest rate unchanged at 10.5pc on Monday.

 

This is generally in line with SBP that projected real GDP growth in the range of 3.75-4.75pc in 2025-26, reflecting stronger-than-anticipated momentum in commodity-producing sectors and spillovers to services. This momentum is expected to extend into FY27, aided by earlier monetary easing and ongoing macroeconomic stability.
These projections are relatively higher than 3.2pc growth rate projected by the International Monetary Fund last week, down from 3.6pc of its previous estimate.
On the external front, the SBP projected the current account deficit to remain within 0-1pc of GDP in FY26. With continued remittance inflows and planned official financing, foreign exchange reserves are projected to surpass $18bn by end-June 2026 and rise further in FY27, approaching the benchmark of three months of import cover, the central bank had observed.
S&P Global Market Intelligence (not S&P Global Ratings) projected a current account deficit of 0.5pc and 1.3pc of GDP, respectively, in calendar years 2026 and 2027 with a disclaimer. “Risks weigh on the downside, owing to elevated global tariff uncertainty, volatile commodity prices, and geopolitical fragmentation,” S&P noted.
On inflation, the SBP expected stabilisation within the 5-7pc target range over the next two years, after temporarily exceeding the upper bound for a few months during calendar year 2026.
The S&P, on the other hand, projected inflation to come at 5.1pc in 2026 before slightly inching upwards to 5.6pc in 2027, again with a caveat. “Risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside, linked to volatility in global commodities and domestic wheat prices, possible adjustments in administered energy tariffs, and a stronger-than-assumed pickup in domestic demand,” it concluded.
