Europe is on edge. It’s losing the Ukraine war, and the leaders of France, Germany and the UK, to name a few, are facing the economic and political heat. The US is becoming ever more unpopular abroad and fractured at home, the slide underscored by the killing of a white supremacist by a white youth belonging to a family of Donald Trump’s supporters. The Republican governor of Utah, where the killing happened, bemoaned the fact that the killer was white and not someone from a minority community or immigrant, robbing the right-wing of a handy ruse to target what the Americans call the left.
Trump seems also to be reheating the 19th-century Monroe Doctrine that imperiously forbade foreign intrusion in the American hemisphere. Venezuela, for one, has been targeted for its ties with Iran and China. In Brazil, President Lula jailed right-wing opponent Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup against his elected government. Argentina’s pro-US president is reportedly losing the plot and possibly confidence too in the advice he would get from his pet dog whose bark or woof decided political and economic matters. In Eura­sia, by contrast, the Shanghai club has got a new spring in its march since China hosted a landmark summit followed by an earthshaking display of preparedness for war should one ever be imposed.
In West Asia, the Arab and Muslim world is grappling with Israel’s genocidal impunity in Gaza and its murderous assault on Doha, not without the knowledge of the US defence forces stationed in the country. Trump, though denies knowing the attack was coming.
In South Asia, Nepal saw violent protests agai­nst the ruling elite, evicting the government of a three-term prime minister. Indian media was hoping the violence would restore the evicted monarchy with its Hindu motifs, which is not happening. Since the monarch was regarded as an avatar of Lord Vishnu, it would require tearing up the secular constitution, unlikely to ever happen. Indians seem unaware that whoever rules Kathmandu, king or parliament, China has kept excellent ties with them. There’s the story, for example, of the king asking China to repatriate Maoist guerrillas hiding there. And China handed them over post-haste.

As ferment goes, the short-lived street violence in Nepal doesn’t quite seem to fit the description of any upheaval.

The interim rulers in Bangladesh have set elections in March. If the victory of the Jamaat-i-Islami-backed students in the Dhaka University polls is any indication the country’s and possibly the region’s future looks set for interesting times but little more. Meanwhile, the leftist president of Sri Lanka has jailed pro-US former prime minister Ranil Wickremesinghe for alleged graft. The president of the Maldives, for his part, was heading to Doha to participate in the Arab Muslim nations’ response to Israel’s widening aggression against whoever it chooses to target with the blessings of the Trump administration.
Meanwhile, though it could have been more cheerful, India and Pakistan played a cricket match in Dubai. The good news was marred by a curious censure of the fixture by India’s opposition parties. Relief from the pervasive stuffiness came with the Pakistani envoy at the UN delivering a heartwarming speech slamming Israel’s occupation of Palestine even as he lambasted the genocide in Gaza. While India, true to form, sig­ned a slew of defence deals with visiting far-right Israeli finance minister, scandalising much of the Global South and possibly even Europe, which has blacklisted the hateful Bezalel Smotrich.
An apocryphal story ascribed to Pakistan’s fabled poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz describes the South Asian tremors nicely. His comrades were reportedly discussing threats to Pakistan in the wake of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. India was eyeing Sindh. Iran was drooling over Balochistan, and the USSR was pondering the warm water ports of Pakistan. Did Faiz agree? The poet, the story goes, took a long puff of his cigarette, flicked the ash, pon­­d­­ered thoughtfully and concluded: “The biggest threat to Pakistan is that nothing will change.”
 
 

As ferment goes, the short-lived street violence in Nepal doesn’t quite seem to fit the description of any upheaval. Nepal is a country after all that not long ago overthrew its centuries-old religiously ordained monarchy, declared itself a secular republic and turned armed Maoist guerrillas into parliamentary democrats. The issues of corruption and nepotism are being highlighted as the main elements in Kathmandu’s recent protests. Both issues are genuine, of course, and played a key role in fomenting anger against the elected but allegedly corrupt government. Such issues, however, have the propensity to surrender their political capital to the most unworthy alternative.
Pakistan and India have seen surges of anti-corruption movements without the core shifting from its rut. The India Against Corruption camp­a­i­­gn, for example, promised to rid the country of in­­­vidious crony capitalism and deep-set corruption. It targeted Manmohan Singh’s second term and delivered Narendra Modi instead. Likewise, practically every ruler in Pakistan, civilian or in unif­orm, has come with the promise of cleaning up the system but ended up tilting at windmills at best.
While a leftist government was in bad odour in Nepal, it was the opposite in Sri Lanka where the economy improved under an erstwhile leftist guerrilla president. The Maldives too is doing fine with its own leftist president. And so, life continues along its undulating pattern of ups and downs.
Yet, across South Asia, much has changed in the last four decades, mostly for the better. Remember Dhaka’s first Saarc summit in 1985. Rajiv Gandhi represented the only functioning democracy there. Nepal’s absolute monarch was feted with Gen Ziaul Haq, autocratic Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and Junius Jayewardene. Bhutan was an absolute monarchy too, and the host was military dictator Gen. Husain Muhammad Ershad. Much has changed albeit not as much as Faiz would have wanted. South Asian democracies should count their blessings — and hope for the best for India. That’s how the roles have changed.

Published in Dawn, September 16th, 2025</p><small>2025-09-16 03:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/160817552d16c41.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942333/kabuls-choice' target='_blank'><strong>Kabul’s choice</strong></a><br><p>IT is apparently a very simple proposition. The Afghan Taliban can either cooperate with Pakistan and eliminate safe havens for the banned TTP and other terrorist outfits on their soil. Or they can continue to nurture an array of violent outfits and sour Afghanistan’s chances of regional integration and greater diplomatic recognition, along with torpedoing any chances of better ties with Pakistan.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif made the offer to Kabul’s rulers while visiting Bannu on Saturday, asking the Afghan Taliban to “choose between Pakistan and TTP”. The PM’s comments reflect the frustration of the administration towards the Taliban. The current dispensation has tried both carrots and sticks with Kabul to help stop terrorist attacks from Afghanistan-based militants, but neither approach has delivered results.
The frustration is understandable because terrorist attacks have resulted in high troop losses for Pakistan. Just last week, at least 19 troops were martyred during operations against terrorists in KP. The military also says that Afghan nationals have been involved in attacks on Pakistan. To its credit, Pakistan has tried to mend fences diplomatically with the Afghan Taliban, and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has undertaken several visits to Kabul.
Additionally, a trilateral mechanism involving Pakistan, China and Afghanistan has been launched to try and ‘mainstream’ the Taliban, offering them incentives for cutting ties with terrorist groups. On the other hand, Pakistan has also undertaken kinetic action inside Afghanistan to target militant sanctuaries. However, so far, neither method has been successful in convincing the Taliban to change their ways.
It is true that the TTP and the Afghan Taliban are linked by ideology. But if the Taliban seek greater engagement with the outside world, they must decide whether to stay wedded to their ideology, or assure their neighbours that they will not allow terrorist groups to threaten regional security. The Taliban may be reluctant to act against militant groups; however, they must guarantee that these violent actors will not pose a threat to neighbouring states.
 
 

The Taliban’s denial that they are hosting militants does not fly, as a special UN monitoring body has confirmed on several occasions that various militant groups, including the TTP, are active in Afghanistan.
For Pakistan, the dilemma is acute. The status quo is obviously not an option, as anti-Pakistan terrorist groups find sanctuary and support in Afghanistan. However, cutting ties with the Taliban is not a viable option either, as it may drive the Afghan rulers into a more extreme direction. The least bad option at present seems to be limited engagement with Kabul, with pressure from regional states, especially China, on the Taliban to do more against the militants. Moreover, Pakistan must also improve its counterterrorism methods to stop the infiltration of terrorists, and prevent troop and civilian losses.

The Waqf (Amendment) Act 2025 was criticised by opposition parties and challenged for violating the rights of the Muslim community to manage their own religious endowments, which are typically used as schools or mosques, while the Modi government asserts that it will make managing the properties more transparent, according to a BBC News report.
In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community.
Such properties — sometimes worth billions of dollars — are important to India’s 200 million Muslims as they are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages — and cannot be sold for any other purpose.

Allows nomination of non-Muslims to waqf board

Historically, these properties have been governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level waqf boards to manage them. But in April this year, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party-led government amended the act, including changes to how a waqf property is determined and managed, sparking criticism from the community.
On Monday, the SC bench comprising Chief Justice of India B.R. Gavai and Justice A.G. Masih refused to strike down the entire law, saying that “the grant of stay is only in the rarest of rare category”.
Controversial clauses
It did, however, halt a controversial provision that allowed the government to decide whether a disputed property is waqf or not.
Over the years, many properties that were donated through oral declarations or community customs have been legitimised as waqf properties because of their continuous use by the Muslim community. But under the new law, waqf boards were required to provide valid documents to claim a property as waqf. In case of disputes, the final decision rested with the government.
The court struck down the rule, saying that allowing the government to determine the rights of a citizen would go against the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary, mandated under the constitution.
Another contentious provision that was scrapped was a clause that required a waqf donor to be a practising Muslim for at least five years.
 
 

The waqf properties are currently managed by state-level boards and a central council, with nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of state bar council, Islamic scholars and the managers of these properties.
While the judges refused to stay a provision that allows the nomination of non-Muslims to the waqf board, they limited the number of non-Muslim members to four in the 22-member federal board and to three in the 11-member state boards.
The court also said, “Efforts should be made to appoint the chief executive officer of the board from amongst the Muslim community.”
The case reached the top court in early April, soon after the law was passed by parliament amid widespread criticism.

The bill was announced by Bill Huizenga, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on South and Central Asia and Republican Party lawmaker from Michigan, and co-led by Democrat leader from California Sydney Kamlager-Dove, along with representatives John Moolenaar (Republican), Julie Johnson (Democrat), and Jefferson Shreve (Republican). Additional cosponsors include Rich McCormick (Republican), Jack Bergman (Republican), Joaquin Castro (Democrat), and Mike Lawler (Republican).
The freedom and accountability bill authorizes the US President to impose sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which allows Washington to target individuals responsible for severe human rights violations or corruption. In this case, it would apply to current or former senior officials of Pakistan’s government, military, or security forces.
The legislation also reaffirms US support for free and fair elections in Pakistan and emphasises the importance of upholding democratic institutions and human rights.

Bill referred to Foreign Affairs and Judiciary committees for review

It builds on House Resolution 901 (H.Res. 901), passed in June 2024 with overwhelming bipartisan support.
That resolution expressed strong backing for democracy in Pakistan, called for protection of free and fair elections, and urged the US administration to engage with the Pakistani government to uphold human rights, rule of law, and freedom of speech.
Speaking on the new legislation, Congressman Huizenga said, “The United States will not sit idly by, as individuals who currently serve or have previously served in Pakistan’s government, military, or security forces commit or downplay blatant human rights abuses.
The Pakistan Freedom and Accountability Act is a bipartisan measure designed to protect the people of Pakistan by holding bad actors accountable and ensuring that neither the democratic process nor free speech is drowned out in Pakistan.”
 
 

Ranking Member Kamlager-Dove emphasised, “Promoting democracy and protecting human rights are core tenets of US foreign policy and must remain central to the administration’s engagement in Pakistan.
“At a time of democratic backsliding and global unrest, the US must defend these values at home and abroad—and hold those who undermine them accountable. I’m proud to join Chair Huizenga in introducing legislation to sanction those who threaten democracy, human rights, and rule of law in Pakistan.”
Democrat leader from Texas Julie Johnson added, “By holding officials accountable when they undermine free and fair elections or commit gross human rights abuses, we send a strong message: those who attack democracy will face consequences, and they will not find impunity on the global stage.”
Diaspora’s efforts
Pakistani-American advocacy groups have played a central role in promoting the freedom and accountability bill and supporting the H.Res. 901.
Ex-president of Pakistan-American Public Affairs Committee Asad Malik said, “This legislation empowers the people of Pakistan and ensures that human rights, free speech, and democracy violators will be accountable and face appropriate consequences.”
Dr Malik Usman of First Pakistan Global highlighted the broader impact of the diaspora’s efforts, saying, “This is a testament to the Pakistani diaspora’s relentless advocacy in Congress and grassroots mobilisation in our communities. This landmark bill is a major step toward Haqeeqi Azadi — standing shoulder-to-shoulder with 250 million Pakistanis for democracy, human rights, and the release of all political prisoners, including Imran Khan.”
 
 

The bill has been referred to both the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees for review. Observers note that its bipartisan backing and alignment with H.Res. 901 increase the likelihood of progress through Congress.
Mr Malik added, “This is not just a bill. It affirms that the US Congress is listening, and that Pakistani-Americans will not stop fighting until democracy and human rights are restored in Pakistan, including freedom for Prime Minister Imran Khan and all political prisoners.”
With the accountability bill, the US reasserts its longstanding position of supporting democracy, human rights, and rule of law in Pakistan while holding accountable those who threaten these values.

The Senate Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privi­leges, meeting at Parliament House under Chairman Syed Waqar Meh­di, took serious notice of a vlogger, Rizwan Razi, whose content aired on national electronic media was decried as hate speech against the Sindhi community.
The panel called the vlog a disruption of federal harmony and an attack on parliamentarians. While Pakistan Television (PTV) has terminated Razi’s services, the committee called the move an “inadequate penalty.”
“This is not just a threat to Sindh but to Pakistan’s national integrity,” Senator Mehdi said. “Such voices must be silenced with permanent measures.”

Recommends PTA to ban vlogger’s channel and blacklist him

The committee recommended that Razi be blacklisted, his YouTube channel be banned by the Pakistan Telecommunication Auth­ority, and an investigation be launched into his past content.
The committee’s session focused on the privilege motion filed by Senator Nawab Umer Farooq Kasi concerning the death of Musavir Khan Kakar, summoned the former chief secretary and inspector general of Balochistan to explain the governance failure.
“National institutions were awa­re of the abduction. If the Chief Sec­retary is unaware, why is he holding office?” Mr Senator Kasi asked.
The chief secretary of Baloch­istan then made his sharp critique of the provincial interior ministry.
“The Ministry of Interior Balochistan is no longer of any use; it should be close,” he said.
The IG Balochistan briefed the committee that five terrorists from a nine-member gang involved in the incident had been killed.
Strong displeasure was also dir­ected at the absence of CDA Chair­m­­an Muhammad Ali Randhawa, who missed a second consecutive meeting about a fraudulent property al­­lotment. The case involves the missing file for House No. 622, Street No. 99 in Sector I-10/4, Islamabad.
“Is he busier than the Chairman Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) who is here today?” Mr Mehdi said. “This misconduct is unacceptable. This is the last time an adjournment is being allowed. Next time, strict action will follow.”
Separately, the committee reviewed a privilege motion regarding the transfer of eight Customs officials from Karachi to Quetta. The FBR clarified that all transfers are based on institutional policy, merit and integrity.
The committee also addressed the eviction of students from Quaid-e-Azam University (QAU) hostels and campus security.
“People were living illegally in 14 hostels. Shockingly, drugs were being transported in an ambulance,” said Zafar Nawaz Jaspal, the acting vice chancellor.
After members expressed outrage over the absence of the Islamabad police chief, Senator Mehdi questioned the campus security’s effectiveness. “Where was your security when drugs were being transported?” he asked.
A sub-committee was formed to investigate the hostel evictions, illegal occupants and the drug trafficking issue.
The meeting was attended by Senators Dost Ali Jeesar, Saadia Abbasi, Asad Qasim, Palwasha Muhammad Zai Khan, Dostain Khan Domki, Shahadat Awan, Jam Saifullah Khan, Jan Muhammad and Nawab Umer Farooq Kasi.

• Dozens of villages submerged; motorway, other thoroughfares blocked after controlled breaches fail to contain deluge
• Water levels at Panjnad drop, but dykes still overflowing
• PDMA issues alert for fresh spell of heavy monsoon rains; PMD warns of dengue outbreak
LAHORE/Islamabad: Flood­waters from the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers continued to inundate vast areas of Multan, Baha­walpur, Lodhran, Muzaffargarh and Khanewal districts on Monday, displacing thousands of people and damaging infrastructure.
Controlled breaches meant to divert the rivers’ flow have failed to contain the deluge, submerging dozens of villages and crippling major transport routes.
Authorities carried out a controlled breach at Noraja Bhutta Bund in Jalalpur Pirwala to ease pressure from the swelling Sutlej. However, the water surged towards Gillani Road, prompting a second breach that ultimately flooded both urban localities and rural settlements.
Floodwaters reached Sukkur-Multan Motorway, forcing its closure for the past two days. The Jalalpur Pirwala Interchange and surrounding areas are now underwater. Villages, including Noraja Bhutta, Mouza Kanu, Wasti Sardar Mir Chakar Khan, Sardarabad, Tar­anda Basharat and Rasoolpur, have been submerged. Union councils such as Chenab Rasoolpur and Khair­­pur Jadeed are also severely affected.
Rescue teams recovered the body of a 65-year-old man from Bahadar­pur, near the Jalalpur Interchange. In Alipur tehsil, the Azmatpur dyke continues to cause flooding in low-lying areas despite a significant drop in water levels at Panjnad Headworks from 700,000 to 296,000 cusecs.
 
 

Deputy Commissioner Waseem Hamid Sindhu said traffic was completely suspended from Multan to Uch Sharif due to the motorway being inundated. He added that the district administration was working to protect the Jalalpur Pirwala section of the motorway amid the worsening flood situation.
During his visit to the Jalalpur Interchange, National Highway Au­­thority and motorway officials brie­fed him on the condition of the rou­te. DC Sindhu said floodwater from the Gillani Road breach ent­e­red the motorway, leading to its complete closure between Multan and Uch Sharif. He added that urgent efforts were underway to seal the breach to prevent further damage.
He said water levels were receding at the flood embankments of Basti Inayatpur and Mauza Dhondhu, while flood relief camps had been established to provide necessary facilities to the displaced. According to him, water levels are expected to return to normal within the next 24 hours.
11th monsoon spell
Meanwhile, the Punjab Provin­cial Disaster Management Auth­ority (PDMA) issued an alert for the 11th spell of monsoon rains beginning today (Tuesday).
On Sept 18 and 19, an increase in water flow is expected in streams and nullahs of Rawalpindi, Murree and Galiyat. The PDMA has direc­ted all commissioners and deputy commissioners to remain alert as flooding risks persist in major cities.
The PDMA also released a flood damage report, with Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javaid saying that over 4,700 villages have been affected due to severe flooding in the Ravi, Sutlej and Chenab rivers.
He said 2,484 villages have been inundated by the Chenab, 719 by the Sutlej and 1,458 by the Ravi. In total, 4.72 million people have been affected, with 2.564m evacuated to safe locations.
He added that 372 relief camps, 454 medical camps and 385 veterinary camps have been established in severely affected districts. About 2.07m animals have also been relocated during the rescue and relief operations.
According to the relief commissioner, Mangla Dam is 94 per cent full, Tarbela Dam has reached 100pc, while India’s Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej is 88pc full, Pong Dam 94pc and Thein Dam 88pc.
Dengue warning
Keeping in view past trends, the current and future climate outlook and the extensive flooding across the country, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has warned of a favourable environment for a dengue outbreak.
Dengue fever has become a persistent threat to public health in Pakistan over the last decade, with major outbreaks reported during the post-monsoon season (Sept 20 to Dec 5).
In its dengue alert, the PMD stated that the combined impact of favourable weather thresholds and flood-related waterlogging has created conducive conditions for the onset of dengue from Sept 20.
Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Rawalpindi, Peshawar, Sukkur, Hyderabad and Multan, as well as flood-affected areas across the country, are at high risk of a severe dengue outbreak.
The PMD advised all stakeholders, including district administrations, health departments, and the general public, to immediately adopt pre-emptive measures to counter the risk of a dengue outbreak in vulnerable areas.

Maqbool Ahmed Gondal was sworn in as the country’s 22nd AGP on Monday, at a ceremony held in the Supreme Court.
Appointed for a fixed tenure of four years, Mr Gondal will immediately have to deal with the fallout from the AGP office’s U-turn its ‘Consolidated Audit Report of Federal Government for the Audit Year 2024-25’.
The original report, released in August this year, contained the illogical figure of irregularities worth Rs376 trillion, which is 3.5 times more than the country’s total gross domestic product (GDP).

After repeatedly defending its controversial audit report, containing astronomical figure of ‘irregularities’, auditor general’s office finally blames ‘typos’ for the discrepancy

It had alleged procurement-related irregularities of Rs284tr, defective civil works worth Rs85.6tr, receivables of Rs2.5tr, and unresolved circular debt of Rs1.2tr.
The figures implied financial anomalies far beyond the size of Pakistan’s kitty, sparking disbelief even within government circles.
Although the outgoing auditor general, Muhammad Ajmal Gondal, had repeatedly defended the contents of the report, after sustained criticism and media scrutiny, the department conceded its error.
A note appended to the introduction of the fresh report says: “The executive summary of the original version of the Consolidated Audit Report uploaded on the [AGP’s website] had a few typos. At two places, the word ‘trillion’ had been used instead of ‘billion’. The actual amount after rectification is Rs.9.769 trillion.”
The revised amount of Rs9.769tr, still a staggering sum, constitutes nearly two-thirds of the federal budget for FY2023-24.
The revised report explains that the irregularities span multiple years and include out-of-budget items such as circular debt, land disputes, and corporate accounts.
This new version was uploaded to the AGP office’s official website last week.
When asked why the AGP office chose to initially defend the report which contained the incorrect figures, an official privy to the matter claimed that this seemed to have become “a matter of credibility as well as ego of the department”.
Expert opinion
Experts Dawn spoke to about the discrepancy offered their own opinions on how such a massive error could have gone undetected.
The Rs376tr figure appears to be an inflated aggregation of audit observations, not actual verified financial losses, and must be contextualised. The AGP only audited 1,362 formations with Rs24.2tr expenditure and Rs20.6tr receipts, so the Rs376tr irregularities claim exceeds the real audit scope,” argues Dr Vaqar Ahmad, an economist with audit expertise.
“The mismatch arises because AGP often records ‘procedural or regulatory deviations’ as irregularities, multiplying values far beyond actual spending,” says Mr Ahmad, who works with the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).
According to him, the Rs5.58tr reported as recovered is deposited with the national exchequer, while the remaining ‘irregularities’ are mostly audit objections unlikely to be fully realised recoveries.
A former provincial auditor general was at pains to clarify that these figures constituted irregularities, not corruption.
“There are over 30 criterions these spending are judged against. One project could fall under over a dozen conditions — like Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA), Finance Divisions Rules, the particular contract conditions, rules of the contracting bodies (Wapda, Pepco etc.) and so on. If a contract is judged on ten different criteria — its different steps falling under different legal provisions, the irregularities are bound to multiply,” he said.
According to a senior official in the Punjab government, audits in Pakistan are conducted under the obsolete and typical ‘desi’ mindset of just creating more and more audit paras having no solid evidence of corruption. Such audits are usually not specific to irregularities as per the actual budget expenditures, thus revealing exaggerated figures to put pressure on the departments.
“If the auditor doesn’t find receipt of any expense during the audit, he considers it misappropriation of funds even though the department-under audit, proves making such expense through other solid evidences. In certain cases, the auditor even declares the whole procurement process suspicious, multiplying it several times with the actual expenses.
“In my whole service, I have never seen any auditor specific to auditing the actual budget expenditures. Certain portions of the revenue targets, which are not achieved, are also considered as irregularities,” he says.
Housing and Works Division Secretary Hamed Yaqoob Sheikh, who has also served as federal finance as well as federal planning secretary, says the audit has two functions — to oversee whether the expenditures have been made correctly and in line with the rules and regulations; and to point out procedural lapses if irregularities are being committed time and again.
Believing that there is no shortage of expertise at the AGP office, Mr Sheikh stresses it needs to shift from mere auditing transactions to assessing “value for money” as is the case in the developed world.

Local sources claimed that fighter jets targeted militant hideouts in the Bakkakhel area of Bannu district, killing terrorists and injuring many others.
They said that a community hall and a school being used by the terrorists as safe havens and for storing explosive devices, rocket launchers, ammunition and explosives, were destroyed in the strikes on Saturday and Sunday.
The military’s media wing said that security forces killed 31 terrorists during the intelligence-based operations in Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts. There was no mention of the aerial strikes in the official statement.

Five security officials, including army captain, martyred in Kech blast

The ISPR said that the operations were conducted by the security forces on the reported presence of Khawarij in the area.
The term ‘Fitna al Khawarij’ is used by the state to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP). It said that during the operation in Lakki Marwat, security forces effectively engaged the terrorist location and, after an intense exchange of fire, 14 Indian-sponsored Khawarij were eliminated.
“Another intelligence-based operation was conducted in Bannu, and in the ensuing exchange of fire, 17 more Khawarij were neutralised by the security forces”, the statement added.
The ISPR said that sanitisation operation was underway to eliminate any remaining Indian-sponsored Khawarij, reaffirming that security forces were determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country.
An official source said that law enforcement agencies had received credible reports about the movement of terrorists, who were planning subversive and terrorist activities, in the region.
He said that the presence of khawarij in the Shaikh Badin mountain range in Lakki Marwat district had also been reported, prompting security personnel to be placed on high alert and launch operations.
According to the source, the successful operation by security forces would help halt the terrorists’ movements and disrupt their plans.
Five security men martyred
On the other hand, in Balochistan’s Kech district, five security personnel, including an officer, were martyred in an explosion on Monday.
Official sources while confirming the attack said that militants planted an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Mand area, near Pak-Iran border. The device was detonated by a remote control to target the vehicle moving between tehsil Dashat and Mand.
“The vehicle was blown up and all five security personnel were martyred,” a senior official told Dawn, identifying the martyred officer as Captain Waqir Kakar.
Other martyred personnel were identified as Naik Junaid, Naik Asmat, Lance Naik Khan Muhammad and Sepoy Zahoor Ahmed.
After receiving information about the incident, security forces rushed to the site and shifted the bodies to nearby health facilities.
Later, the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the IED attack.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti paid tribute in a statement on X, saying: “Another brave son of Balochistan, Captain Waqir Kakar, embraced martyrdom while defending the people and his beloved Pakistan. His sacrifice will forever remain a shining chapter of courage and honour. Balochistan and Pakistan will never forget you.”

The Arab League and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) joint session, which brought together nearly 60 countries, sought to take firm action after Israel’s attack on Qatar-hosted Hamas officials as they discussed a Gaza ceasefire proposal. It was co-sponsored by Pakistan.
A joint statement from the summit urged “all states to take all possible legal and effective measures to prevent Israel from continuing its actions against the Palestinian people”, including “reviewing diplomatic and economic relations with it, and initiating legal proceedings against it”.
Qatar’s fellow Gulf nations, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, along with Egypt, Jordan and Morocco, were among those present that recognise Israel.
The leaders of the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco, which signed the Abraham Accords recognising Israel five years ago to the day, did not attend Monday’s talks, sending senior representatives instead.
The statement also urged member states to “coordinate efforts aimed at suspending Israel’s membership in the United Nations”.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will arrive in Qatar on Tuesday, after pledging “unwavering support” for Israel’s goal of eradicating Hamas during a visit to the country earlier today.
The attack in Doha strained ties between Washington and key allies in the Gulf, raising concerns over US security guarantees in a region housing major US assets, including a major military base in Qatar. The State Department said Rubio would “reaffirm America’s full support for Qatar’s security and sovereignty” after last week’s strike.
Qatar had called for a coordinated regional response after the Israeli attack, which stunned the usually peaceful, wealthy peninsula.
The summit aimed to pile pressure on Israel, which is facing mounting calls to end the fighting and humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
 






The host country’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, accused Israel of trying to scupper ceasefire talks by firing on Hamas negotiators in Qatar, a key mediator.
Hamas says top officials survived last week’s air strike in Doha, which killed six people and triggered a wave of criticism.
“Whoever works diligently and systematically to assassinate the party with whom he is negotiating, intends to thwart the negotiations,” the emir told the summit.
Qatar’s emir said that Israel had sought to derail Gaza talks by striking Hamas negotiators in his country last week, and that its premier dreamt of an Arab world under Israeli influence.
He also said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu “dreams of turning the Arab region into an Israeli sphere of influence, and this is a dangerous illusion”.
 


The emir said in a message later on X: “The emergency Arab-Islamic summit in Doha today is [a] clear message in the face of Israeli state terrorism against our region, and outcomes will effectively contribute to intensifying our collective efforts and coordinating the positions and measures of our countries, unifying our voice and stance.”
 






Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, was among those present at the summit, as were Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas.
“Tomorrow, it could be the turn of any Arab or Islamic capital,” said Pezeshkian, whose country fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, at one point attacking a US base in Qatar in retaliation for strikes on its nuclear facilities.
“The choice is clear. We must unite.”
Pezeshkian earlier urged Muslim countries to cut ties with Israel. “It is possible that Islamic countries cut their ties with this fake regime and maintain unity and cohesion as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said before departing for Doha, adding that he hoped the summit would “reach a conclusion” on measures against Israel.
President Abdelfattah al-Sisi of Egypt, the first Arab country to recognise Israel, warned its attack in Qatar “places obstacles in the way of any opportunities for new peace agreements and even aborts the existing peace agreements with countries in the region”.
 


Israel and its main backer Washington have been trying to expand the Abraham Accords, signed during US President Donald Trump’s first term, notably courting Saudi Arabia.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accused Israel of adopting a “terrorist mentality”, as countries took turns slamming it over Gaza.
The rich Gulf countries also met on the sidelines of the summit, urging the US to use its “leverage and influence” to rein in Israel, Gulf Cooperation Council Secretary General Jasem Mohamed Al-Budaiwi told a press conference.
US President Donald Trump, who had dinner with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani in New York on Friday, made careful remarks before today’s Arab gathering as Washington’s two powerful Middle Eastern allies face a worsening rift.
“Qatar has been a very great ally. Israel and everyone else, we have to be careful. When we attack people, we have to be careful,” Trump told reporters.
 


The US president initially rebuked Israel over the attack, saying he was “very unhappy” about it. However, yesterday, Rubio said it was “not going to change the nature of our relationship with the Israelis”.
PM Shehbaz suggests task force
Addressing the summit today, PM Shehbaz Sharif suggested the formation of a task force to counter Israeli aggression and expansionism.
He said the attack on Doha was carried out by an “aggressor who seriously violates the international law”.
Pakistan condemned the attack, he said, adding that it clearly meant to undermine the peace efforts in the Middle East.
“This is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of Qatar and we express our solidarity with our brothers: the Qataris. The Israeli attack on Qatar is not separate from the other attacks, it is a hegemonic ambition on part of Israel to control the whole region and the role of mediators is always considered to be sacred and they are the hope of peace.”
He said Qatar was trying to advance regional peace while the women and children of Gaza were suffering disaster. PM Shehbaz said the whole world was “watching a massacre” in Gaza and called for it to be stopped now.
The premier said Pakistan emphasised the importance of taking urgent steps to put an end to war crimes in Gaza and to “establish a task force to take effective steps to stop Israeli expansion plans”. The prime minister called for Israel’s membership in the United Nations to be suspended and said other effective steps needed to be taken against the country.
PM Shehbaz said today’s meeting confirmed the common ideas and acts of the participants to condemn the Israeli attacks.
 






PM Shehbaz met several leaders at the summit.
 






He also held a bilateral meeting with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, with Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Field Marshal Asim Munir present as well, according to a statement issued by the government.
 






The two leaders exchanged views on the situation emerging after Israel’s aggression on Doha, the statement said . The prime minister strongly condemned Israel’s action and termed it as a deliberate attempt by Israel to derail the Middle East peace efforts, it added.
PM Shehbaz said that the convening of the Arab-Islamic Summit had sent out an important message that “Muslims around the world spoke with one voice against Israel’s unlawful and reckless aggression”, which threatened regional peace and security.
The Saudi crown prince said that he looked forward to PM Shehbaz’s upcoming visit to Riyadh later this week, which would provide both sides with an important opportunity for a comprehensive exchange of views on bilateral as well as regional and global issues, according to the statement.
The statement further said he expressed his appreciation for the prime minister’s leadership and for Pakistan’s active diplomatic efforts, including at the UN Security Council and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, to express solidarity with Qatar at a critical juncture.
 






On this visit to Doha, PM Shehbaz was accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi, according to PTV News. He was received by Qatar’s minister for culture, Sheikh Abdulrahman bin Hamad Al Thani.
 






PM Shehbaz also undertook a one-day visit to Doha on September 11, when he met with Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani to denounce the Israeli attack and show solidarity with the Gulf state.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar was already in Doha on Monday and actively participated in a meeting of foreign ministers on Sunday to craft the draft resolution that was to be discussed during today’s summit.
 
 

Ahead of the summit, analysts said the high-level moot was meant to send Israel a clear signal.
According to a Dawn report, diplomats said leaders at the summit may also weigh in on pushing Palestinian statehood at the upcoming UN General Assembly session in New York.
 
 

Moreover, the UN Human Rights Council said today that it would host an urgent debate on Tuesday on Israel’s airstrike in Qatar.
The council said the debate would “discuss the recent military aggression carried out by the State of Israel against the State of Qatar on 9 September 2025’”.
Dar seeks steps against Israel to safeguard global ordEr
Earlier today, FM Dar met with his Turkish counterpart Hakan Fidan.
The two leaders “strongly condemned Israel’s unprovoked and unjustified strikes on Qatar and other nations in the region”, the Foreign Office said on X.
“They reaffirmed unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, underlined the importance of the OIC and the Arab League in mobilising collective action of the Muslim Ummah, and welcomed the convening of the Arab-Islamic Summit.”
 






Dar yesterday also met with OIC Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, Egypt’s FM Dr Badr Abdelatty, Iran’s FM Abbas Araghchi, Malaysia’s FM Dato’ Seri Mohamad Hasan, Bangladesh’s Foreign Affairs Adviser Md Touhid Hossain and Uzbekistan’s FM Bakhtiyor Saidov.
Attending the ministerial meeting on Sunday, the foreign minister called for urgent steps against Israel to “safeguard the global order”.
During his speech, Dar highlighted that the frequency of meetings to discuss Israel’s activities in the region underlines “how Israel has become a persistent irritant and a danger to world peace and security”, according to a FO statement.
“Pakistan condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the illegal and unprovoked Israeli aggression against the brotherly State of Qatar,” Dar was quoted as saying.
The foreign minister listed the following “urgent steps” that need to be taken:


Israel must be held accountable for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It should not be allowed to get away with attacking Islamic countries and killing people with impunity.


Creation of an Arab-Islamic task force to monitor the Israeli designs in the region and adopt effective deterrent and offensive measures in a synchronised manner to ward off Israeli expansionist designs.


Pursue the suspension of Israel’s membership in the United Nations. Following up on this step would be a clear message on seriousness by the ummah.


Member states should actively consider implementing additional punitive measures against Israel, as a means to reinforce accountability and deter further violations of international law.


The UN Security Council must urgently demand [from] Israel, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter … an immediate, unconditional, and permanent ceasefire, release of hostages and exchange of Palestinian prisoners.


Unfettered, sustained and secure humanitarian access to all civilians in need, and the protection of aid workers, medical teams and UN personnel in the [Occupied Palestinian Territories].


The revival of a genuine and time-bound political process to achieve a just, comprehensive and lasting two-state solution in accordance with international law and relevant UN and OIC resolutions.

Mamdani, a 33-year-old New York state assemblyman and self-declared socialist, rocked American politics and the Democratic Party establishment in June by winning the party’s mayoral primary.
He remains the front-runner in polls ahead of the November 4 election to decide who will be the next mayor of America’s most populous city.
“Governor Kathy Hochul of New York has endorsed the ‘Liddle’ Communist,” the US president wrote.
“This is a rather shocking development, and a very bad one for New York City. How can such a thing happen? Washington will be watching this situation very closely.”
Mamdani has campaigned on a platform of narrowing the wealth gap between rich and poor New Yorkers and providing affordable housing to low-income residents.
On Sunday, Hochul gave her backing to Mamdani over Andrew Cuomo, the longtime former governor and member of one of New York’s most politically influential families. Mayor Eric Adams, the incumbent, is running as an independent.
“Affordability has long been my top priority as governor, and it is the No. 1 concern I share with Mr. Mamdani,” Hochul said in issuing her endorsement.
“As governor, I’ve taken actions to realise this goal, including lowering middle-class income taxes and making school meals free for all students. But there is more work ahead of us.”
She also took a shot at the president.
“And in light of the abhorrent and destructive policies coming out of Washington every day, I needed to know the next mayor will not be someone who would surrender one inch to President Trump,” she said.</p><small>2025-09-15 19:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/16001513496b005.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942217/govt-keeps-petrol-price-unchanged-hikes-high-speed-diesel-by-rs278' target='_blank'><strong>Govt keeps petrol price unchanged, hikes high-speed diesel by Rs2.78</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Monday increased the high-speed diesel price by Rs2.78 per litre for the next fortnight.
A notification from the Finance Division said the new HSD price was Rs272.77 per litre.
Meanwhile, the petrol price was kept unchanged at Rs264.61.
Previously, the government had kept the petrol price unchanged, while the price of HSD was reduced by Rs3 per litre.
Petrol, used mainly in private cars, small vehicles, rickshaws and motorcycles, directly impacts the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-income groups.
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD and its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.</p><small>2025-09-15 19:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1523174401b9a79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942218/uae-hammer-oman-in-asia-cup-to-keep-super-four-hopes-alive' target='_blank'><strong>UAE hammer Oman in Asia Cup to keep Super Four hopes alive</strong></a><br><p>Skipper Muhammad Waseem and Alishan Sharafu struck attacking half-centuries to lead the United Arab Emirates to a thumping 42-run win over Oman in the men’s Asia Cup on Monday.
Waseem, who hit 69, and Sharafu, who made 51, put on 88 runs for the opening wicket to guide hosts UAE to a challenging 172-5 in Abu Dhabi.
 






The home bowlers then combined to dismiss Oman for 130 in 18.4 overs for their first win in this edition of the regional tournament played in the T20 format.
Medium-pace bowler Junaid Siddique stood out with figures of 4-23. Haider Ali and Muhammad Jawadullah took two wickets each.
The batters had set up victory.  Waseem and Sharafu started cautiously but soon took the attack to the opposition with a flurry of boundaries.
Sharafu fell for his 51, but Waseem kept up the charge and reached fifty with a six. The captain was run out in the final over.
UAE play Pakistan, who went down to tournament favourites India in a key match, next on Wednesday, with the winner likely to move into the Super Four stage of the eight-nation event.
Oman were never in the chase and lost five wickets for 50 runs with captain and opener Jatinder Singh scoring 20 as they slumped to a second straight defeat.
Defending champions India, who won the previous edition played in a 50-overs format, lead the table in Group A with two wins in two matches are nearly through to the next stage.
Along with regional bragging rights, the competition will serve as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.</p><small>2025-09-15 18:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/151651109d6ef5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942190/imaan-mazari-approaches-ihc-committee-sjc-against-justice-sarfraz-dogar' target='_blank'><strong>Imaan Mazari approaches IHC committee, SJC against Justice Sarfraz Dogar</strong></a><br><p>Rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir on Monday approached an inquiry committee of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) against IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar following last week’s altercation between them.
On Thursday, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”. Multiple lawyers’ bodies had issued condemnatory statements and called for the judge’s dismissal from the post of the IHC top judge.
In a post on X today, the lawyer, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, said she had filed a complaint against the judge before the IHC’s workplace harassment committee and a reference for misconduct before the SJC.
 






The complaint, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed under Section 4 (procedure for holding inquiry) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act 2010.
A circular issued later in the day read that Justices Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, Arbab Muhammad Tahir and Saman Rafat Imtiaz would be members of the inquiry committee that would investigate harassment complaints against fellow IHC judges.
A later notification from the IHC registrar said Justice Dogar nominated Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas as the competent authority under the act, replacing Justice Imtiaz who was appointed to the role in July. Justice Minhas took his oath as an IHC judge in January.
As per the 2010 act, the inquiry committee conducts the investigation into the harassment allegations and then forwards it to the competent authority for final determination and application.
The complaint requested the IHC inquiry committee to initiate an investigation.
It further pleaded the committee to declare she was “subjected to sexist, discriminatory, hostile, threatening, intimidating and unreasonable behaviour at the hands of the respondent chief justice” and declare that Justice Dogar was “guilty of harassing the complainant and consequently issue appropriate recommendations to the competent authority (i.e. SJC) against the respondent as envisaged under Section 4(4) of the 2010 act”.
It also requested the committee to grant any other relief “deemed fair and reasonable in the circumstances” in her favour.
The complaint said that the judge had engaged in an “unprovoked and unnecessary tirade” against her during last week’s proceedings.
“Even after the incident, the complainant felt insulted, humiliated and degraded as a result of the respondent chief justice’s brazen abuse of authority. The sentiment was shared by the complainant’s husband and lawyer colleagues who were present in the courtroom and witnessed the exchange. A collective sense of disbelief and anger was expressed at the unprecedented scenes.
“Unfortunately, while the respondent chief justice had earlier made clear to the complainant that he held a personal grudge/bias against her (as reflected in his conduct and remarks in multiple cases fixed before him), his conduct on September 11 crossed all limits of decency,” the complaint said, adding that in an earlier case involving journalist Asad Ali Toor on August 12, “the respondent chief justice had passed inappropriate and personal remarks towards the complainant, including: ‘Why are you so stubborn?’ Journalists and court reporters, along with the complainant’s husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, were witnesses to the same.”
The complaint said last week’s incident was a “part of the broader pattern of intimidation and degrading treatment meted out to the complainant at the hands of the respondent chief justice, in complete abuse of his position of authority. The respondent chief justice has repeatedly, in courtrooms full of litigants, lawyers, court staff and police officials, aggressively (and often in a vulgar manner) asserted his power (which he is meant to exercise as a trust for the people of Pakistan, not to assert his personal fiefdom)”.
It further said that “apart from the fact that this conduct is completely unbecoming of a judge, the complainant was clearly subjected to a hostile, degrading and threatening work environment by the respondent chief justice, in whose court she was required to appear before for her client. The treatment meted out to the complainant was in full public view, and the complainant’s husband and lawyer colleagues”.
The complaint pointed out to the public condemnation and criticism in the wake of the “sexist, discriminatory and threatening remarks”, referring to the statements from various lawyer associations.
It added that instead of “acknowledging and apologising for his threatening, sexist and intimidating conduct, the respondent chief justice once again made further sexist remarks against the complainant, in her absence, in his courtroom, in an entirely unconnected case, the very next day on Sept 12 … The respondent chief justice continued to abuse his authority/position in once again threatening the complainant in her absence that he would initiate contempt of court proceedings against her, whilst also stating that he did not want to ruin her career and attempting to ridicule her by calling her a ‘child’ in a courtroom full of people, when the complainant is a well-respected lawyer in the community”.
The complaint read that the “sexist comments taken together with repeated threats of ‘contempt of court’ and ‘not wanting to destroy’ the ‘female child’s career’ are not only appalling but shocking coming from someone holding the office of chief justice of a constitutional court, meant to uphold the fundamental rights of all citizens”.
It argued that the judge’s conduct, “apart from being clear misconduct — also falls within the ambit of workplace harassment. Not only did the respondent chief justice make clear his views on women in open court but he also abused his position of authority to harass, intimidate, threaten and humiliate the complainant in a place where she is required to appear every day by virtue of her job/profession as a lawyer”.
It said the chief justice’s conduct fell within the definition of “harassment” in the 2010 act.
“The respondent chief justice’s conduct on Sept 11 and 12 constitutes ‘verbal communication’ of a ‘sexually demeaning attitude’ and ‘derogatory’ expression that caused ‘interference with work performance’ and also created ‘an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment’. Further, the sexist, discriminatory and threatening conduct of the respondent chief justice also constitutes ‘discrimination on the basis of gender’ which does not necessarily have to be ‘sexual in nature’ but which ‘may embody a discriminatory and prejudicial mind set or notion, resulting in discriminatory behaviour’,” the complaint argued.
It added that Mazari was “made to feel extremely uncomfortable in her workplace and was at the receiving end of hostile, threatening and sexist language used against her by the respondent chief justice in an open court” in the presence of lawyers, police officials, journalists and litigants.
The complaint said the “power balance” between the two parties was also “evident”.
“The continued abuse of authority by the respondent chief justice has clearly been fuelled by the power imbalance between the parties, which led to his further misogynist statements/remarks on Sept 12, in the absence of the complainant,” it added.
The complaint said the Thursday incident was a “glimpse of the respondent chief justice’s opinions on women, particularly how he views them as possessions of husbands, to be controlled and reigned in when he feels they are overstepping their gender roles.
“The respondent chief justice’s conduct is the clearest possible manifestation of a patriarchal mindset, which cannot be tolerated, especially in the superior judiciary which is meant to safeguard citizens’ constitutional rights, including the right to basic human dignity. The conduct of the respondent chief justice on Sept 12 was yet another manifestation of his patriarchal mindset … once again attempting to humiliate and demean her in a professional setting where she is required to appear every day”.
Separately, a district and sessions court summoned Mazari and her husband on Wednesday in connection to a case registered against them on the charges of alleged anti-state activities on social media. The challan of the case was presented in court before Judicial Magistrate Abbas Shah today.</p><small>2025-09-15 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/152205170c57ac7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942215/indias-top-court-appointed-committee-clears-ambani-sons-wildlife-centre-of-wrongdoing' target='_blank'><strong>India’s top court-appointed committee clears Ambani son’s wildlife centre of wrongdoing</strong></a><br><p>A wildlife rescue centre run by the philanthropic arm of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s group has been cleared of allegations of illegal animal acquisition and mistreatment, India’s Supreme Court said on Monday, citing findings from a court-appointed committee.
In August, India’s top court appointed a special investigation team (SIT) to investigate complaints from non-profit and wildlife groups alleging animal mistreatment at Vantara and raising questions over how the animals were brought to the centre.
However, the court has said the evidence did not support claims of illegal acquisitions or abuse.
Located in western Gujarat state and led by Anant Ambani, the billionaire’s son, Vantara is a key project of the Reliance Foundation and the Ambani family.
Housing more than 150,000 animals across more than 2,000 species, the facility claims its 998-acre (404 hectares) elephant welfare trust is the world’s largest care facility for rescued elephants.
The Indian top court said today that the SIT’s inquiry had covered allegations related to animal acquisition, smuggling, welfare, conservation, breeding, climate suitability and financial misconduct, but found no violation of wildlife rules.
“The SIT’s report and the honourable Supreme Court’s order have made it clear that the doubts and allegations raised against Vantara’s animal welfare mission were without any basis,” Vantara said in a statement.</p><small>2025-09-15 17:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623863-gandapur-admits-rifts-within-pti-denies-role-in-groupings' target='_blank'><strong>Gandapur admits rifts within PTI, denies role in groupings</strong></a><br><p>

“The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC (Marylebone Cricket Club) Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket,” Naqvi posted on X, referring to referee Andy Pycroft.
“The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the match referee from the Asia Cup,” he added.
 






According to an earlier press release by the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), Pycroft was scheduled to be the match referee for the Pakistan-UAE match on Wednesday.
The Asia Cup match between the two sides took place on Sunday in Dubai, where spinners led by Kuldeep Yadav helped India beat Pakistan by seven wickets as the neighbours met on the cricket pitch for the first time since a military conflict between them in May.
After hitting the winning shot, Suryakumar and his teammates refused to shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts. The captain said in the post-match press conference that the move was in alignment “with the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India) and the government”.
 


In the post-match presentation, Suryakumar said India took the match against Pakistan as “just another game” and dedicated the win to the Indian armed forces.
“We stand with the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack, and we express our solidarity,” Suryakumar said. “We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.”
The April 22 attack on civilians in India-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam triggered Pakistan-India hostilities in May. New Delhi, without evidence, accused Pakistan of backing the attack — a charge Islamabad strongly denies.
After the match, the PCB confirmed to Dawn.com that Pakistan team manager Naveed Akram Cheema had “registered a protest against the match referees’ behaviour.”
“It was against the sportsman spirit that the Indian team did not shake hands,” the PCB statement quoted the manager as saying. It alleged that the “match referee had asked the captains not to shake hands at the time of the toss”.
Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha did not show up in the post-match ceremony as a reaction to the Indian team’s move.
Pakistan’s coach Mike Hesson explained that the reason Salman was absent from the ceremony was because of the Indian team’s “disappointing” conduct at the end of the match.
“It was a follow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match, but that obviously didn’t happen,” Hesson said.
Following the developments, PCB chief Naqvi earlier today said on X: “Utterly disappointing to witness the lack of sportsmanship today. Dragging politics into the game goes against the very spirit of sports.
“Let’s hope future victories are celebrated by all teams with grace.”
 






The match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to ‘boycott’ the fixture.
The Indian cricket board had said it could not boycott an international event and that such a move would “bring a lot of negativity for all our future endeavours of hosting any multinational tournament”.
New Delhi only cleared the match in a recently announced sports policy, saying the Indian national team can play Pakistan in multi-national events but not in bilateral competitions. Pakistan last played a bilateral series against India in 2012, when the Green Shirts toured India for an ODI and T20I series.</p><small>2025-09-15 15:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/15205004a6b9335.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942205/pakistan-skipper-fatima-says-focus-on-world-cup-ahead-of-south-africa-series' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan skipper Fatima says focus on World Cup ahead of South Africa series</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan captain Fatima Sana said on Monday that her team’s focus was on the Women’s World Cup ahead of the one-day international (ODI) series against South Africa in Lahore.
The World Cup, to be hosted later this month under a hybrid model across India and Sri Lanka, will see all of Pakistan’s fixtures staged in Colombo, with political tensions ruling out travel between the two neighbours.
Pakistan open their immediate run-in with a three-match ODI series against South Africa in Lahore from Tuesday, following the conclusion of a training camp at the National Cricket Academy and the Gaddafi Stadium.
Speaking at the pre-match press conference in Lahore, Fatima said: “The specific aim is to prepare for the World Cup and execute our plans in this series.”
 


“A series like this is very beneficial for the team ahead of the World Cup. It gives the players a good opportunity to put into practice all the preparation they have done in recent times,“ she was quoted as having said by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).
She added that it is widely known that Pakistan rely on their bowling attack, so this time the Green Team’s focus will be on getting more support from the batting unit as well.
“We worked a lot on batting during the camp,” the Pakistani skipper said.
The ODIs will be staged at the Gaddafi Stadium on September 16, 19 and 22, with the first ball of all matches to be bowled at 3:30pm, according to the PCB.
Pakistan’s 15-member squad will be captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt will lead the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches.
The squad features one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August.
In Pakistan, the fans will be able to watch the matches on A Sports, while live-streaming for viewers across the Pakistan region will be available on Tamasha.
Cricbuzz and Sportainment (Middle-East and North Africa), Super Sports (Africa), Sports Central (Global outside Pakistan), and Willow TV (North America) will broadcast matches internationally, the PCB added.
 


The forthcoming series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka.
In head-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on September 14, 2023.</p><small>2025-09-15 15:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/15194151f8cf7d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942206/president-zardari-assures-shanghai-electric-of-amicably-resolving-any-outstanding-issues' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari assures Shanghai Electric of amicably resolving ‘any outstanding issues’</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Monday assured the Shanghai Electric Power Company that “any outstanding issues” would be amicably resolved as he invited the firm to invest in Pakistan’s energy infrastructure.
The firm last week decided to terminate its offer to acquire up to 66.4 per cent of K-Electric Ltd due to changes in Pakistan’s business environment. It added that since the planning of the “major asset purchase”, the company had strictly adhered to relevant laws, regulations, and normative documents, actively promoting the various tasks involved in this major asset purchase.
“Given that the counterparty has consistently failed to meet the conditions precedent for closing and the changes in the business environment in Pakistan have rendered this transaction no longer aligned with the company’s international development direction, after careful study and analysis, in order to effectively safeguard the interests of the company and all its shareholders, the company has decided to terminate this major asset purchase,“ it had said.
KE is the only electricity generator, transmitter, and distributor for Karachi and its adjoining areas, and the only listed electricity supplier. It was privatised in 2005. Shanghai Electric Power had agreed to buy a controlling shareholding in KE from Abraaj Group back in 2016 for a sum of $1.77 billion. The transaction never materialised because the seller failed to obtain the required approvals from different authorities and liquidity constraints as a consequence of mounting circular debt in the country’s power sector.
President Zardari met Shanghai Electric Chairman Wu Lei today and later visited the company’s facilities in Shanghai while on a 10-day trip to China.
“He invited Shanghai Electric to explore further investment in the modernisation of Pakistan’s transmission and distribution network. President Zardari assured Shanghai Electric that any outstanding issues would be resolved amicably and in a spirit of mutual cooperation,” said a statement from the PPP.
 






The president also thanked the chairman for the company’s contribution to meeting Pakistan’s energy needs, generating employment and supporting socio-economic development.
President Zardari further reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to enhancing security measures to ensure a safe and conducive environment for Chinese workers in the country, with CEO Lin Jigen expressing gratitude to the government for the security arrangements provided to its employees working in Pakistan.
The company chairman gave a briefing on its projects in Pakistan, including its work in Thar coal, nuclear energy, and coal-fired power plants.
President Zardari underlined the importance that Pakistan attached to the development of the Thar coal project, including the potential of coal-gasification, and witnessed the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the establishment of a coal gasification plant in Thar.
The MoU was signed between MFTC Coal Gasification & Manufacturing (Pvt) Ltd and Sino Sindh Resources (Private) Ltd/Shanghai Electric.
 






The statement said this was the first coal gasification and fertiliser project based on Thar coal, which would not only contribute to meeting the country’s energy needs but also play a vital role in supporting the agriculture sector.
The president was accompanied by First Lady Bibi Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Senator Saleem Mandviwalla, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon, Sindh Planning and Energy Minister Syed Nasir Shah, China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong and Pakistan’s Ambassador to China Khalil Hashmi.</p><small>2025-09-15 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/1519301539b70e2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942204/us-china-reach-framework-deal-on-tiktok-during-madrid-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>US, China reach framework deal on TikTok during Madrid meeting</strong></a><br><p>The United States and China have reached a framework agreement to switch short-video app TikTok to US-controlled ownership, top US officials said on Monday, with President Donald Trump set to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer announced the agreement after a meeting between senior US and Chinese officials in Madrid, but declined to give any of the commercial terms of the agreement.
Bessent told reporters that further details would wait to be determined in a call on Friday between Trump and Xi.
Trump said on Monday that trade talks with China had gone very well and hinted that a deal had been reached to resolve issues the US has over TikTok ownership.
“The big trade meeting in Europe between the United States of America, and China, has gone very well! It will be concluding shortly,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
“A deal was also reached on a certain company that young people in our Country very much wanted to save. They will be very happy! I will be speaking to President Xi on Friday. The relationship remains a very strong one!!!”
 


Earlier on Monday, a US official with knowledge of the negotiations had said that Washington would press ahead with a ban on TikTok if China didn’t drop its demands for reduced tariffs and technological restrictions as part of a divestiture deal.
American and Chinese delegations met to discuss the divestment from TikTok by Chinese owner ByteDance as part of a round of broader talks on tariffs and economic policy taking place in Madrid.
TikTok faces being shut down as early as September 17 in the US unless it moves to US ownership. Speaking to reporters earlier, Bessent and Greer said China wanted concessions on trade and technology in exchange for agreeing to divest from the popular social media app.
“Our Chinese counterparts have come with a very aggressive ask,” Bessent said, adding: “We are not willing to sacrifice national security for a social media app.”
Poor timing
The US-China negotiations at the Spanish foreign ministry’s baroque Palacio de Santa Cruz, which began on Sunday, were the fourth round of talks in four months to address strained trade ties and a looming divestiture deadline for TikTok.
They took place as Washington demands that its allies place tariffs on imports from China over Chinese purchases of Russian oil, which Beijing on Monday said was an attempt at coercion.
Beijing separately announced on Monday that a preliminary investigation of Nvidia had found the US chip giant had violated its anti-monopoly law. Bessent said the announcement on Nvidia was poor timing.
The probe is widely seen as a retaliatory shot against Washington’s curbs on the Chinese chip sector.</p><small>2025-09-15 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/15185407fe10168.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942201/two-new-polio-cases-reported-in-southern-kp-taking-country-wide-tally-to-26' target='_blank'><strong>Two new polio cases reported in southern KP, taking country-wide tally to 26</strong></a><br><p>Two fresh polio virus cases have been detected in the south of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, taking the nationwide tally to 26, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) said on Monday.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.
According to a press release issued by the NIH, one of the cases was detected in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali tehsil in a 19-month-old infant, while the other case was confirmed in an 11-month-old infant in Lakki Marwat’s Suleman Khel tehsil.
The two new cases have taken the total number of cases reported in KP to 18, the highest out of any province in the country. The nationwide tally now stands at 26, with six cases from Sindh, 18 from KP and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan, NIH said.
Detailing the results of August’s environmental sewage samples regarding polio — collected from 87 districts across the country — the NIH said, “of the 126 environmental samples tested, 75 were found negative with no poliovirus detected, while 51 samples tested positive.”
As per NIH,  out of a total of 23 samples tested for polio in Balochistan, only one was positive, while in KP, out of 34 samples tested, 10 were found to be positive.
Punjab recorded 14 polio-positive samples, out of 31 tested; Polio virus was found in 24 of the 29 samples tested in Sindh, 12 of which were in Karachi, as per the NIH.
One sample each was found positive for the virus in GB and Islamabad.
 
 

“Balochistan reported a marked reduction, with only one positive environmental site in July and August, down from 19 in January,” the press release said.
“In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, positive environmental sites dropped from 13 in April to 10 in August,” it noted, adding that “seven out of the 10 positive sites were in the south of the province, while all samples from Peshawar tested negative for the virus.
 
 

“In Islamabad, the number of positive environmental sites has decreased from three in July to one in August,” the press release said.
NIH expressed concern at the “continued detection of cases, particularly in southern KP,” stating that “children living in hard-to-reach areas and those in communities with low vaccine acceptance remain most at risk.”
In connection with that, a sub-national polio campaign began in southern KP today and is set to run for the next three days until September 18.
 
 

“A special action plan for southern KP was developed and [is] being implemented under the supervision of Chief Secretary KP, focusing on strengthening monitoring, addressing access challenges, and promoting community-led initiatives to reach unreached children in high-risk areas,” the statement read.
KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah has “directed urgent, intensified efforts to ensure no child is left unvaccinated,” the press release said.
“Earlier this month, the National Emergency Operations Centre conducted a sub-national polio vaccination campaign from 1–7 September 2025 in 81 districts across the country, successfully reaching more than 19.8 million children under five,” it added.
NIH urged parents and caregivers to play their part in helping eradicate polio.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-09-15 14:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/151839540dc70ca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942198/social-media-influencer-samiya-hijab-agrees-to-withdraw-complaint-in-kidnapping-and-harassment-case' target='_blank'><strong>Social media influencer Samiya Hijab agrees to withdraw complaint in ‘kidnapping and harassment’ case</strong></a><br><p>Social media influencer Samiya Hijab on Monday agreed to withdraw her complaint in her alleged harassment and kidnapping case, with the court granting bail to the suspect.
The suspect was arrested on September 2 and a case was registered in the capital’s Shalimar Police Station at her complaint under Sections 354 (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 365 (Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person), 392 (punishment for robbery), 500 (punishment for defamation), 509 and 511 of the Pakistan Penal Code. He is currently on judicial remand.
During today’s hearing at an Islamabad district and sessions court — presided over by Additional District and Sessions Judge Amir Zia — Samiya recorded her statement before the court, stating that the case had been resolved and she withdrew her complaint.
“I have no objection to granting bail to the accused and his acquittal,” Samiya said in her statement.
When asked by the judge if she was forgiving the suspect, the social media influencer replied in the affirmative.
The judge set bail for the suspect at Rs20,000.
The hearing
At the start of today’s hearing, the investigating officer (IO) appeared in court, but Samiya did not, with the IO stating that she would participate in the hearing through video link.
“If the plaintiff has a brother or father, they can appear on her behalf; if not, then the plaintiff will have to appear,” Judge Zia stated. “If the plaintiff cannot appear today, then we can fix a later date.
The hearing was briefly adjourned before Samiya appeared in court later today. Media persons and court staff were asked to vacate the courtroom for the hearing.</p><small>2025-09-15 13:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/151446457c3b1b5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942178/pakistan-again-holds-interest-rate-at-11pc-as-floods-stoke-inflation-fears' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan again holds interest rate at 11pc as floods stoke inflation fears</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) maintained its policy rate steady at 11 per cent on Monday for a third straight meeting as policymakers weighed inflation risks from flood-hit crops against a fragile economic recovery.
After slashing the interest rate by 1,000 basis points (bps) from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, the central bank has maintained it at 11pc since May. However, the business community had expressed disappointment over the decision.
“The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent in its meeting today,” an SBP statement said.
The MPC noted that inflation remained “relatively moderate in both July and August, whereas core inflation continued to decline at a slower pace”.
“Economic activity — as captured by high-frequency economic indicators, including large-scale manufacturing (LSM) — gained further momentum. However, the near-term macroeconomic outlook has deteriorated slightly in the wake of the ongoing floods,” the committee noted.
 
 

It cautioned: “This temporary yet significant flood-induced supply shock, particularly to the crop sector, may push up headline inflation and the current account deficit from earlier expectation in FY26.”
Meanwhile, it added, economic growth was projected to moderate compared to the previous assessment.
“In view of the evolving macroeconomic outlook and the flood-related uncertainty, the MPC deemed today’s decision as appropriate to maintain price stability.”
Floods in the country, which have caused losses estimated at billions of rupees due to crop and land damage, have added pressure to inflation, particularly in agriculture-based products. There has been a significant price increase for items such as rice and vegetables.
Business stakeholders have expressed divergent views on the impact of floods on supply chains, with some citing delays in interprovincial cargo movement and crop damage, while others insisted supplies of food, fuel, and medicines remain normal.
However, the committee observed that the “economy is on a significantly stronger footing to withstand the negative fallout of the ongoing floods” compared to previous major flood events.
“Given the low inflation environment, moderately growing domestic demand and relatively benign global commodity price outlook, the excessive inflationary and external account pressures witnessed after the previous floods are projected to remain in check this time.
“Furthermore, the build-up in external and fiscal buffers over the past two years, which was achieved via a coordinated and prudent monetary and fiscal policy mix, will need to continue to make the economy more resilient to shocks and ensure higher growth on a sustainable basis.”
The statement also said that since the last MPC meeting, SBP’s forex reserves
remained stable, despite net debt repayments and a current account deficit; inflation expectations of both consumers and businesses inched up in September in the sentiment surveys jointly conducted by the SBP and the Institute of Business Administration; tax collection by the Federal Bureau of Reserves “fell slightly short of target” during July-August 2025, though it “grew significantly” on a year-on-year basis; and the announcement of revised import tariffs by the US has led to some reduction in global trade uncertainty.
“In view of these developments and outlook, the MPC assessed that the real policy rate remains adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the medium-term target range of five to seven per cent, notwithstanding some expected short-term volatility in inflation out turns.”
The statement further said that inflation in the country rose 4.1pc year-on-year in July before falling to 3pc in August.
“These out turns largely reflected volatility in food and energy prices, whereas core inflation remained on downward trajectory, albeit at a slower pace.”
The MPC noted that the recent floods had increased uncertainty related to the near-term inflation outlook, particularly for food inflation, adding that weekly sensitive price index data had already recorded a “substantial increase” in prices of perishables, wheat and allied products.
Meanwhile, after dropping below the 155,000-point mark on Friday, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) saw signs of recovery today as it regained that level.
Ahead of today’s meeting, the PSX gained 1,138.1 points at 10:24am to reach 155,577.78.
Shares dropped as low as 154,486.21 points at around 1pm, before closing at 155,384.50, gaining 944.82 points (0.61pc) compared to the previous session in the wake of the MPC announcement.
 

This screengrab from PSX’s data portal shows the PSX activity on Sept 15, 2025.

Last month, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb noted that there was a “room” for lowering the policy rate by the end of this year, but stressed that it was the purview of the SBP and its MPC.
A recent survey conducted by the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) Institute revealed that 92pc of respondents expected the interest rate to remain unchanged, despite trade and industry groups calling for further cuts to stimulate economic activity.
The MPC had kept the rate steady at its last meeting in July, citing potential inflation risks from rising energy prices and geopolitical tensions, even though inflation had been moderating.</p><small>2025-09-15 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623823-islamabad-rawalpindi-travel-time-to-be-shortened-to-20-minutes-heres-how' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad-Rawalpindi travel to take just 20 minutes — here's how</strong></a><br><p>

India and the US will “fast-track” trade talks, Rajesh Agarwal, India’s chief negotiator and a special secretary in its commerce ministry, told reporters at an event for the release of trade data, but gave no details.
“US Trade Representative for South Asia Brendan Lynch is set to make a one-day visit to New Delhi on Tuesday,” Agarwal said.
India’s exports slowed to $35.10 billion in August from $37.24bn in July, and its trade gap narrowed to $26.49bn, from $27.35bn in July.
The US imposed an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods over New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil starting August 27, taking the total on Indian exports to 50 per cent, among the highest for any US trading partner.
Exports to the United States fell to $6.86bn in August from $8.01bn in July. New Delhi’s shipments to Washington in the period from April to August stood at $40.39bn.

A few months ago, AJK police initiated a strike with an 11-point charter of demands. These include increases in medical allowance, conveyance allowance, house rent, and the implementation of a career progression system similar to that of Punjab police. Additionally, there are demands for improved retirement policies, training, housing, and educational facilities for the children of police personnel.
In July, AJK police observed a pen-down strike and subsequently organised a state-wide strike to demand better rights and facilities in major districts.
The manpower for law enforcement in AJK should consider the police protests and strikes in the region. Moreover, the government suspects that the AJK police may extend their protests and strikes, potentially expressing further resentment.
Sources within the interior ministry told Dawn that a few days ago, in a meeting, the heads of five departments and forces, including Islamabad Police, FC, and FIA, were instructed to mobilise forces for deployment in AJK, particularly at key, sensitive, and significant installations.
They have also arranged the equipment resources currently used by the forces for deployment in AJK.
The department heads were urged to assemble the forces promptly and prepare to respond positively. They requested time to organise the necessary manpower and equipment.
They were instructed to expedite the process; however, they will have three days to reach AJK once the deployment order is issued.
The sources revealed that 4,000 personnel from the capital police and FC were asked. In response, the capital police agreed to provide a force of 2,000 officers, and the FC and FIA also committed to arranging manpower.
Subsequently, in line with their commitments to the interior ministry, the capital police are preparing to deploy 2,000 personnel to AJK.
A letter issued by the office of the AIG Establishment on Saturday, addressed to the DG Safe City, DIGs of Operations, Law and Order, AIGs of Special Branch, Logistics, SSPs of Security, CTD, and Traffic, requested a “provision of strength”. It stated that, according to the directions of the IGP Islamabad, the specified police personnel must be sent to AJK temporarily.
DG Safe City, DIGs of Operations, Law and Order, AIGs of Special Branch, Logistics, SSPs of Security, CTD, and Traffic were asked to submit their lists of suitable police officers and officials on Saturday to ensure the timely departure of the force to AJK.
This team will include an SSP, four SPs, eight DSPs, 16 Inspectors, 88 Sub-Inspectors, Assistant Sub-Inspectors, 1,718 Head Constables and Constables, 132 lady constables, and 33 other staff members.

“On 13-14 September, 31 khwarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in [the] Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It has also designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said an IBO was conducted in Lakki Marwat on the “reported presence of khwarij”.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, 14 Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell,” it added.
The ISPR added that another IBO was carried out in Bannu, where 17 more terrorists were killed in a gun battle.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored khwariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country,” the ISPR stated.
On Saturday, the ISPR said the military had killed 45 terrorists between September 10 and 13 and 19 soldiers were martyred during these operations in KP.
Following those developments, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif vowed to continue responding to terrorism in the country with “full force”.
He said terrorists and their facilitators responsible for attacks in Pakistan were operating from the Afghan soil with the backing of India.
“The Afghan interim government has been clearly told to choose between supporting the khwarij or stand with Pakistan,” he added.
PM Shehbaz warned that “anyone facilitating or advocating” for terrorists or “acting as proxies for India” was essentially their agent and would be “dealt with accordingly”.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-09-15 09:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623790-31-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-kp-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>31 Indian-sponsored terrorists killed in KP operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

At issue is the provision of information on individuals living in, or entering, the United States illegally. Trump’s threat adds to a move critics have seen as federal overreach, with more than 2,000 troops patrolling the city.
The comments come after several thousand protesters hit the streets this month over Trump’s August deployment of National Guard troops to “re-establish law, order, and public safety“, after calling crime a blight on the capital.
“In just a few weeks. The ‘place’ is absolutely booming … for the first time in decades, virtually no crime,” Trump said on Truth Social.
 


Bowser’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Trump’s post.
Earlier, he had put the metropolitan police department under direct federal control and sent federal law enforcement, including members of ICE, to police the streets. It is unclear when their mission will end.
Trump blamed “radical left Democrats” for pressuring Bowser to inform the government about the non-cooperation with ICE, adding that if the police halted cooperation with ICE, “crime would come roaring back”.
He added: “To the people and businesses of Washington DC, don’t worry, I am with you and won’t allow this to happen. I’ll call a National Emergency, and federalise, if necessary!!!”
Bowser, who has previously praised Trump’s surge of federal law enforcement, bringing a sharp decline in crime, earlier signed an order for the city to coordinate with federal law enforcement.
The National Guard serves as a militia answering to the governors of the 50 states, except when called into federal service. The DC National Guard reports directly to the president.</p><small>2025-09-15 08:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/15124022a684fa7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1942152/indian-forces-gun-down-top-maoist-rebel-two-others' target='_blank'><strong>Indian forces gun down top Maoist rebel, two others</strong></a><br><p>Indian security forces killed a top Maoist commander and two other rebels in a gun battle on Monday, officials said, as the government intensifies efforts to crush the decades-long conflict.
India is waging an all-out offensive against the last remaining traces of the Naxalite rebellion, named after the village in the foothills of the Himalayas where the Maoist-inspired guerrilla movement began nearly six decades ago.
More than 12,000 rebels, soldiers and civilians have been killed since a handful of villagers rose up against their feudal lords there in 1967.
The latest gun battle took place early on Monday in the mineral-rich eastern state of Jharkhand, India’s Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) said in a statement. The federal police described the operation as a “major breakthrough”.
Three “top Naxal commanders” were killed in the fight, the CRPF said, including Sahdev Soren, who was part of the central committee of the Maoist organisation. Authorities had issued a bounty of around $113,000 for his capture.
Last week, forces killed another Maoist commander and nine others in a fierce gun battle along the forested border between the states of Odisha and Chhattisgarh.
The Indian government has vowed to crush the rebellion by the end of March next year.
The rebellion controlled nearly a third of the country with an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 fighters at its peak in the mid-2000s. A crackdown by Indian troops across the “Red Corridor” has killed more than 400 rebels since last year, according to government data.
The group’s chief, Nambala Keshav Rao, alias Basavaraju, was gunned down in May, along with 26 other guerrillas.
The conflict has also seen several deadly attacks on government forces. A roadside bomb killed at least nine Indian troops in January.</p><small>2025-09-15 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623777-pti-presses-commonwealth-group-to-publish-report-on-elections-2024' target='_blank'><strong>PTI presses Commonwealth group to publish report on elections 2024</strong></a><br><p>

According to eyewitness accounts, victim Z took cover behind an iron gate as two unidentified motorcyclists allegedly opened fire on him. The victim, however, escaped unharmed and the attackers managed to escape from the scene. The Harappa police registered a case under sections 506 and 34 of the PPC against two unknown suspects, based on Z’s complaint.
Speaking to Dawn, Z said that he was standing near the gate of his house when two young men — estimated to be between 20 and 25 years old — approached on a motorcycle and fired directly at him. “It was dark, and I managed to hide. That’s what saved me,” he said. He claimed that he would be able to identify the attackers if he saw them again.
Local villagers, who witnessed the incident, confirmed hearing multiple gunshots.
The area has a documented history of communal tensions, particularly following the rise of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan. Notably, Z’s elder brother was also murdered by unknown assailants in a previous incident. At that time, police interrogated individuals affiliated with the Tehreek Tahafuz Khatm-e-Nabuwwat.
ASP Raosen Taj Raisani confirmed his presence at the crime scene shortly after the incident. “We are pursuing two to three leads and hope to trace the suspects soon,” he said.
WHEAT RECOVERED: Around 15,000 metric tons of wheat has been recovered from alleged hoarders during difierent raids conducted over the past three days at 15 warehouses across the Pakpattan and Sahiwal districts.
Pakpattan Deputy Commissioner Asif Raza said that the district administration, special branch and the food department conducted joint operations based on intelligence reports. He said that while some warehouse owners had declared their wheat stocks, most were found to be storing large quantities without disclosure. A total of 9,860 metric tons of wheat had been confiscated in the district.
Separately, Sahiwal Deputy Commissioner Shahid Mahmood confirmed the recovery of 4,285 metric tons of undeclared wheat from a rice mill located at 99/9-L, Sahiwal.
Meanwhile, Commissioner Asif Tufail announced the official retail prices for flour in the Sahiwal division at Rs905 for a 10kg bag and Rs1,810 for a 20 kg bag. The price of roti had been fixed at Rs14, while the wheat support price was set at Rs3,000 per 40kg. The commissioner warned that strict action would be taken against those involved in illegal stockpiling.
Despite these measures, ordinary consumers continue to face rising flour prices following the government’s announcement of the new wheat rates.
