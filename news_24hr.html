The 27-year-old threw a massive 77.43m on his sixth and final attempt to snag a podium finish and smash his previous season’s best of 76.07m set at the Asian Athletics Championships in May.
Sri Lanka’s Pathirage Rumesh Tharanga won gold with an 82.06m throw and became the only athlete to cross the 80m barrier this morning. Behind him was Japan’s Gen Naganuma with 78.60m.
 


Yasir clinched a silver at last year’s championships with a 78.10m throw, and a bronze in 2023 with a 79.93m throw, which still stands as his personal best.
The javelin ace has yet to shatter the 80m barrier.

I have no choice but to leave her with a milk bottle, which breaks my heart.”
Her words echo in factories, offices, and classrooms across Pakistan, where mothers are often forced to choose between their newborn’s nutrition — crucial in the early months — and maintaining a livelihood.
The reality is stark: only 48 per cent of infants under six months in the country are exclusively breastfed, far below the global target of at least 70pc. According to Unicef, this shortfall is directly linked to high rates of stunting (low height for their age, resulting from chronic poor nutrition, repeated infections, and inadequate care, particularly during the first 1,000 days of life), 37pc, and wasting (a severe form of malnutrition where a child is dangerously thin for their height, indicating recent and severe weight loss), 7pc, among Pakistani children under the age of five.
While the benefits of breastfeeding — from protecting children against infections to lowering mothers’ risk of cancer and diabetes — are well-documented, it seems that Pakistan’s workplace culture is either unaware of them or has turned a blind eye toward them.
The tough choice
Many women, struggling to balance motherhood and a career, return to work within weeks of childbirth. Maternity leave — up to 180 days under the Maternity and Paternity Leave Act, 2023 — is often too short or unpaid. The situation only gets worse; lactation rooms are rare, and daycare facilities are barely functional.
“There is no clean space to feed or pump, and if I ask for extra time, they cut my wages,” said a mother who works at a garment factory in Karachi.
 
 

For those in leadership roles, the struggle takes a different shape.
“I wanted to set up a breastfeeding space for one of my female team members, but when I raised the idea before management, it wasn’t supported,“ shared a Karachi-based woman, employed at a non-profit organisation. “I didn’t push further due to the fear of losing my position.”
In these circumstances, some mothers are even forced to simply quit the labour force altogether because it fails to accommodate them.
“When my baby was born, I had to choose between going back to work or staying home to breastfeed him. I chose my baby, and I am not sure if I will ever return — but I know this choice gives me peace,” said another new mother.
A missed opportunity
These choices, as personal as they may look from afar, have significant economic implications for Pakistan, the key amongst them being the declining female labour force participation (FLPR) in the country, which currently stands at a meagre 24pc — the lowest in South Asia. The FLPR in Bangladesh stands at 44pc, while in India it is 33pc.
Among women who continue to work, only 16pc are formally employed; the rest, in the informal sector, have no maternity protection.
According to data compiled by the World Bank, industry employs 15pc of women, while 19pc work in services of the employed women; the remaining 66pc are employed in the agriculture sector.
This gap between women’s participation in the workforce and the growth of industries and services is a missed opportunity for economic expansion.
What is vs what should be
Over the past two decades, Pakistan has made legislative strides when it comes to breastfeeding rights. Case in point: The Protection of Breast-feeding and Child Nutrition Ordinance, 2002, which set the foundation for protecting breastfeeding mothers and regulating the marketing of breast milk substitutes.
Legislation at the provincial level — the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Protection of Breast-Feeding and Child Nutrition Act (2015), the Balochistan Protection and Promotion of Breastfeeding and Child Nutrition Bill (2014), and the most recent Sindh Protection and Promotion of Breast-Feeding and Young Child Nutrition Act (2023) — has also expanded these protections.
The law in Sindh mandates the establishment of an Infant and Young Child Nutrition Board, bans aggressive marketing of breast milk substitutes, restricts their sale to pharmacies with a doctor’s prescription, and prohibits public advertising for children up to 36 months. It is aligned with recommendations by the World Health Organisation and Unicef.
 
 

Yet, business councils have challenged the restrictions, and enforcement remains uncertain.
Maternity leave is now enshrined in the Maternity and Paternity Leave Act (2023), which grants maternity and paternity leave to working parents. However, the reality is that many private employers either ignore the law or circumvent it by keeping women on short-term contracts.
Even in regulated urban sectors like banks and financial institutions, such arrangements for women employees are often absent. On the other hand, for women employed in the informal sector, these legal protections are almost meaningless without efficient enforcement mechanisms.
While initiatives such as the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) are proven to improve breastfeeding outcomes worldwide, Pakistan has yet to integrate these standards into its hospital accreditation system. Some facilities have partially implemented these standards, but nationwide scaling — and embedding compliance into hospital licensing — would ensure early initiation of breastfeeding, rooming-in, and elimination of pre-lacteal feeds.
Bridging the gap
What is equally critical is community-level support.
Lady health workers (LHWs), midwives, and peer counsellors are trusted channels for providing breastfeeding counselling. Yet, no structured, nationwide home-based breastfeeding support programme has been documented.
Flexible clinic hours and mobile health teams could bridge the gap for breastfeeding mothers.
The Mamta programme in Sindh is one such initiative that offers a promising model. Designed to provide conditional cash transfers to over 1.3 million pregnant and lactating women over five years, it links financial incentives to antenatal visits, institutional deliveries, and breastfeeding practices.
By addressing both economic and health barriers, such programmes can improve outcomes, but only if coupled with nutrition education, micronutrient supplements, and consistent supply chains.
But beyond policy gaps, it is the cultural attitudes toward breastfeeding that pose a big challenge. Taboos against breastfeeding in public or at work discourage women from continuing their jobs once they return to employment.
“I attend classes with my newborn at home,“ said a PhD student. “I can barely concentrate during the lectures because my mind is on whether my baby has been fed or not. I feel like I am compromising her health for my education.”
The stakes are high
Moreover, during emergencies such as floods, ensuring safe breastfeeding is critical to child survival, yet disaster response plans often fail to include infant and young child feeding (IYCF) protocols. Shelters in flood-affected areas often breach women’s privacy, forcing them to breastfeed in crowded, exposed spaces, which causes mental strain and, for some, leads to early cessation.
Mother-baby friendly spaces in shelters, staffed by trained responders, are therefore essential for protecting breastfeeding moms during disasters.
 
 

National nutrition assessments often lump women and children into broad categories, overlooking the specific barriers faced by women in paid employment. This lack of disaggregated data means that nutrition policies rarely address structural constraints such as workplace inflexibility, lack of childcare, and mobility restrictions.
Collecting and analysing breastfeeding data by employment status, maternal education, and service access could enable more targeted interventions. Budget allocations for infant and young child feeding programmes remain insufficient, particularly in high-burden provinces such as Sindh and Balochistan. Protecting and increasing these budgets through child-responsive budgeting could ensure sustained investment in early childhood nutrition.
There is a need for realisation that breastfeeding must be treated as a workplace right, not a privilege. This means enforcing maternity leave in line with standards outlined by the International Labour Organisation, mandating functional breastfeeding spaces, integrating maternal and child health into labour inspections, and educating employers on the economic returns of supporting working mothers.
For Pakistan, the stakes are high. Failing to support breastfeeding not only compromises child health and development but also limits women’s economic participation and perpetuates gender inequality.

A senior officer of investigation police said Shahrez Khan, son of Aleema Khan, was wanted in the 2023 violence which erupted following the arrest of Imran Khan.
Rejecting police claim, PTI Secretary-General Salman Akram Raja said Shahrez had nothing to do with politics.
Shahrez’ father Suhail Khan said his son was doing business and now he was preparing to go abroad to participate in a world triathlon championship. Earlier, Salman Raja said plainclothes men attacked the residence of Aleema Khan and abducted her son Shahrez.
“Aleema Bibi’s home in Lahore has been attacked by men in plainclothes and her son Shahrez abducted,” tweeted Mr Raja.
 






He also alleged that the intruders harassed Aleema Khan’s family members and even thrashed staff.
PTI lawyer Rana Mudassar told Dawn.com that Shahrez was “kidnapped” from his home in Lahore.
“People dressed in plainclothes entered the house and took Aleema Khan’s son with them,” he claimed. “No case has been registered against Shahrez, nor is he related to politics.”
Mudassar said no information had been given about Shahrez’s whereabouts and that he would approach the Lahore High Court for his recovery.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram wrote on X: “During an attack, people dressed in plainclothes abducted the son of Aleema Khan from her home.
 






“We strongly condemn this thuggery and oppression. We demand from the current government and the Chief Justice that her son be immediately recovered and safely returned to her,” he added.
At night, Salman Raja reached the residence of Aleema Khan and told media the men in civvies came in tinted glass vehicles and drove away Shahrez Khan without presenting any warrant. Raja said the “powers that be” were busy in victimising Imran Khan and added Shahrez Khan had nothing to do with politics.
Advocate Hassan Niazi, another nephew of Imran Khan, was convicted in a May 9 case in December last.

The limit — which will be recommended for all residents in central Japan’s Toyoake City — will not be binding and there will be no penalties incurred for higher usage, according to the draft ordinance.
The proposal aims “to prevent excessive use of devices causing physical and mental health issues… including sleep problems”, mayor Masafumi Koki said in a statement on Friday.
The draft urges elementary school students to avoid smartphones after 9:00pm, and junior high students and older are advised not to use them after 10:00pm.
The move prompted an online backlash, with many calling the plan unrealistic.
“I understand their intention, but the two-hour limit is impossible,” one user wrote on social media platform X.
“In two hours, I cannot even read a book or watch a movie (on my smartphone),” wrote another.
Others said smartphone use should be a decision for families to make themselves.
The angry response prompted the mayor to clarify that the two-hour limit was not mandatory, emphasising that the guidelines “acknowledge smartphones are useful and indipensable in daily life”.
 
 

The ordinance will be considered next week, and if passed, it will come into effect in October.
In 2020, the western Kagawa region issued a first-of-its kind ordinance calling for children to be limited to an hour a day of gaming during the week, and 90 minutes during school holidays.
It also suggested children aged 12 to 15 should not be allowed to use smartphones later than 9:00pm, with the limit rising to 10:00pm for children between 15 and 18.
Japanese youth spend slightly over five hours on average a day online on weekdays, according to a survey published in March by the Children and Families Agency.</p><small>2025-08-22 06:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/220945124d41609.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1933615/chinas-foreign-minister-wang-coas-munir-discuss-regional-security-and-counter-terrorism' target='_blank'><strong>China’s Foreign Minister Wang, COAS Munir discuss regional security and counter-terrorism</strong></a><br><p>China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a meeting with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir in Islamabad during his official visit to the country, discussing regional security and counter-terrorism, the military’s media wing said on Friday.
The Chinese foreign minister arrived in Pakistan late Wednesday night to attend the sixth Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue on Thursday morning. He also met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, reaffirming China’s commitment to working with Pakistan to promote regional peace, development, and stability.
Wang—who had earlier met his Afghan counterpart in Kabul on Wednesday—said that China was prepared to support its neighbours on issues concerning their core interests and to firmly oppose external interference in the region, per a Chinese foreign ministry handout. He stressed the need to improve the security dialogue mechanism, deepen law enforcement and security cooperation, strengthen the fight against transnational terrorism, and eliminate conditions that promote extremism.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today, Wang and COAS Munir held discussions focused on regional security, counter-terrorism and matters of mutual interest.
“Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen the strategic partnership and enhance coordination at regional and international forums.”
Wang reiterated China’s steadfast support for Pakistan’s sovereignty and development, the statement said, adding that COAS Munir expressed gratitude for China’s consistent support for Pakistan.
The meeting concluded with a shared commitment to advance peace, stability, and prosperity in the region, it said.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership that covers trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. Their militaries have built deep mutual trust and cooperation, and both sides agreed to sustain high-level visits while enhancing collaboration in joint training, exercises and military technology.
On August 1, COAS Munir, while speaking at an event marking the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Islamabad and Beijing will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.
Last month, during COAS Munir’s visit to Beijing, the Chinese leadership had lauded the role of the Pakistan Army and hailed it as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.

Islamabad hopes the project will serve as a springboard to draw more foreign interest to its mineral sector, particularly to exploit rare earth deposits. Pakistan has already attracted interest from the Trump administration and offered future concessions to US companies.
The loans and a financing guarantee will support development of Reko Diq, which is expected to produce copper and gold from 2028 and generate about $70 billion in free cash flow over its lifespan.
The financing is composed of two loans totalling $300m to Barrick and a $110m financing guarantee for the Government of Pakistan, both sources said ahead of the official announcement.
The $6.6bn project in Balochistan is 50pc owned by Barrick with the other half held by the federal and provincial governments.
ADB, the petroleum ministry and Barrick did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The project aims to raise upwards of $2bn and has a previous agreement for $700m in financing from the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank’s private investment arm.
The project’s developers are in talks with other prospective financiers, including the US Export-Import Bank, Export Development Canada and Japans JBIC and expect to sign term sheets this quarter, project director Tim Cribb told Reuters in April.

To realise the country’s full potential, increa­sing women’s economic participation is critical.
Pakistan hit rock bottom in the World Economic Forum’s 2025 Global Gender Gap Index out of 148 countries, with 56.7pc gender parity; it has closed only 2.3pc of the gap since 2006. It ranks below Sudan, Chad, Iran, Guinea and Congo. In South Asia, Bangladesh holds the 24th position, demonstrating a far more favourable gender equality landscape. This is the second year in a row that Pakistan’s gender parity score has declined.
This alone is a damning indictment of the little progress made — despite millions being poured into gender equality initiatives by international development agencies. However, the deeper problem is not lack of funding, but the misuse of a noble narrative to justify wasteful development programming. It should lead to deep introspection about why gender equality efforts keep failing.
Take, for example, the Asian Development Bank’s (ADB) initiative with Pakistan’s National Transmission and Despatch Company to increase female participation in technical and leadership roles.
A $182,000 technical assistance grant — part of the broader Power Transmission Enhance­ment Investment Programme — was awarded to support ‘gender mainstreaming’ through drafting a workplace gender policy, training 20pc of female staff and auditing an internship programme. This reads more like an HR department’s annual plan than a serious development intervention. Any functional organisation with a competent HR team can perform such tasks.
So why is our ailing power sector the testing ground for gender experiments scripted in distant multilateral offices?

The broader problem is a development culture that rewards symbolism over substance.

This is not an isolated case. ADB partnered with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to develop a Wo­­men Entrepreneurs Finance Code under a Wom­en-Inclusive Financial Sector Development Prog­ramme funded through a $5.5m grant and $150m loan.
In June 2025, another $350m loan was app­ro­ved to support women’s access to finance and provide credit to women-led micro SMEs. The code, launched with fanfare, is merely a declaration of intent to close financing gaps by designating a leader to monitor data and introduce targets.
While gender-responsive finance is a valid policy goal, was this multimillion-dollar donor intervention truly necessary when the SBP already has the legal mandate, institutional capacity and technical expertise to design such policies? Or is this just donor funding chasing headlines, not solutions?
Has the central bank run out of ideas to promote financial inclusion, which it championed until a decade ago when the Economist Intelligence Unit rated Pakistan’s microfinance regulatory framework the best in the world in 2010 and 2011, and the third best in 2013 and 2014? Either way, such supply-driven initiatives only weaken state institutions.
ADB has been involved in Pakistan’s financial sector since 2000, when it launched a $150m microfinance sector development programme to provide financial services to the poor, especially women. The World Bank is also actively involved in gender empowerment projects, focusing on education, economic participation and access to fin­ance.
In March this year, the World Bank approved a $102m loan to enhance access to microcredit and support the resilience of the microfinance sector. ADB and World Bank have extended loans for the same purpose for over 25 years. Similarly, bilateral donors continue to fund gender empowerment initiatives. The UK’s FCDO-owned Karandaaz also invests in profitable banks and established corporates to increase access to SME finance, including for women entrepreneurs.
This unneeded donor exuberance in Pakistan’s most profitable financial sector underscores a lack of interest in addressing core development challenges. These initiatives mainly advance the careers and networks of donor staff, consultants and local counterparts. There is clearly a problem when aid becomes a lucrative industry. It absolves the government of its responsibility to work for the welfare of its citizens. This aid addiction — fostered by international donors — has contributed to institutional decay, economic stagnation and insurmountable debt.
In fact, the actual outcomes of donor programmes implemented over the past decades show deteriorating trends. Pakistan’s credit-to-GDP ratio fell from 27pc in 2008 to 9pc in 2024 — the lowest among emerging countries. Credit remains concentrated in large corporates, with nearly 70pc allocated to manufacturing.
This reflects banks’ disconnect from the broader economy as well as the ineffectiveness of SBP regulation and donor involvement in the financial sector. More troubling is the steady decline in SMEs’ access to finance; their share of total private sector credit dropped from 17pc in the mid-2000s to just 6pc in 2024. The number of SME borrowers also declined from 185,000 in 2007 to 172,000 in 2024. Most financing is directed towards medium enterprises.
The broader problem is a development culture that rewards symbolism over substance. Pakistan’s addiction to foreign aid has fostered a policy environment where any externally funded programme is welcomed without scrutiny. Frivolous projects are designed to please donors, not solve real problems, reflecting waste and abuse. Whether in foreign-funded tax reforms, energy sector financial sustainability projects, or gender mainstreaming campaigns, the pattern is consistent: poor design, poor results.
 
 

Tragically, these projects are celebrated with MoUs, photo-ops, and social media hype, while the women they claim to empower remain invisible. This isn’t just inefficient — it’s unethical. Tokenism empowers donor staff, consultants and policymakers, not women; it reduces gender equality to a funding checkbox. Worse, they hide behind bizarre buzzwords like ‘gender-responsive climate finance’ or ‘gender-transformative value chains’ — jargon-masking emptiness.
We must not confuse real gender empowerment with bureaucratic parody. Genuine change means women’s access to education and healthcare, legal rights (especially inheritance), protection from violence, and more women in the workforce — not elite seminars, lavish launches, or pricey consultants churning out reports that nobody reads. Pakistan needs genuine reforms, not donor-driven theatre. And it is time we start calling out the phoney feminism that masquerades as development.

This umbrella includes chronic diseases and conditions like cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, liver and kidney dysfunction, chronic obstructive respiratory disorders, cancers, mental disorders, etc.
Globally, 74 per cent of deaths are caused by these diseases. Seventy-three per cent of all deaths due to NCDs occur in low- and middle-income countries. In 2010, the burden of disease posed by NCDs in Pakistan surpassed that of communicable diseases with ever-increasing presentations.
Currently, every fourth adult above the age of 20 in Pakistan suffers from Type II diabetes; that’s 33 million adults, making us the third-largest population in the world, right after India and China. Every third Pakistani adult above the age of 45 years suffers from high blood pressure.
 
 

One in every nine women is likely to face breast cancer. In Pakistan, years lived with disability — a product of prevalence and disability weight — for women aged 10 to 24 years, due to breast cancer, is the highest in the world. Every fourth woman quietly struggles with perinatal depression.
A study spanning 30 years on BoD trends in Pakistan shows that all NCDs are on the rise. Ischemic heart disease, for example, has increased by more than 25pc in the last 30 years. In terms of changes in the BoD ranking of diseases, diabetes moved from 26th place in 1990 to eighth place in 2019, and breast cancer from 38th to 18th in the same period.
The WHO lists the following five key risk factors for major NCDs: tobacco use, an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, harmful intake of alcohol and air pollution.

Lifestyle medicine is about holistic care.

A major element of these diseases, conditions and their associated risk factors comprises our behaviours in daily lives. The burden of disease of NCDs will not change until we change our individual lifestyle choices.
Lifestyle medicine is about holistic self-care and supporting others to change their daily unhealthy behaviours in terms of what they eat (nutrition); how much they exercise (physical activity); how much they sleep (restorative sleep); how they handle stress (stress management); their use of any harmful substances (addictions); and the quality of their social connectedness. These are the six evidence-backed pillars of lifestyle medicine.
Though the ideas posited are not new, this is still, in a way, a new branch of medical science. Lifestyle medicine has reorganised old ideas into a new, preventive and therapeutic framework, with strong evidence at the base of each of its six pillars. Many credible studies speak to the effectiveness of these lifestyle behavioral changes when sustained. The collective and synergistic effect of these six behaviours is transformative in the truest sense of the word.
Adopting these behaviours when we are ‘healthy’ or ‘disease-free’ tremendously lowers the chances of developing NCDs. However, since lifestyle medicine in its current form has primarily been developed by medical practitioners in the West, understandably, the emphasis is on treatment.
In the therapeutic sphere, this medicine has indeed shown unequivocal effectiveness, to an extent that patients with NCDs not only experience remission but also a reversal of their diseases, which I have discussed in my column ‘Reversing NCDs’ (March 21, 2025) focusing solely on the disease or symptoms.
Lifestyle medicine employs a holistic approach rather than focusing solely on the disease. Its aim is to entrain the whole person by aligning with the circadian rhythm and restoring homeostasis. It generally employs non-pharmaceutical lifestyle interventions. In the hands of a skilled lifestyle medical practitioner, the results are astounding.
The American College of Lifestyle Medicine, established in 2004, conducts various ‘continued medical education’ activities year-round, including a board exam. The International Board of Lifestyle Medicine was set up by the ACLM in 2018 and hosts lifestyle medicine certification exams around the world, which have produced, to date, over 8,000 IBLM diplomats in 92 countries, including 41 in Pakistan, according to the last count. In 2015, the ACLM also initiated the Lifestyle Medicine Global Alliance comprising professional lifestyle medicine associations from around the world.
The only national body from Pakistan in this global alliance is the Pakistan Association of Lifestyle Medicine, which was founded in 2016 by the visionary Dr Shagufta Feroz, the first IBLM diplomat from Pakistan. It has since grown in terms of its membership, credibility and global standing. Since 2021, PALM is the only organisation in Pakistan authorised to conduct the IBLM certification.
Dr Feroz started out as a family physician in Lahore. Getting fed up over time with the way general practice was being conducted, with its irrational use of medicines, and the pharmaceutical industry’s unethical practices, she began to explore alternatives. Dr Feroz ended up completing two PhD degrees in nutrition and integrated medicine from the US.
During this period, she came across lifestyle medicine and finally found her nirvana. She has since been promoting this science by contextualising it in Pakistan’s case, and is currently running the 11th Postgraduate Lifestyle Medicine Certificate Course. I myself recently graduated from the 10th course, which I enjoyed and benefited from tremendously. She has developed a great team of professionals, with ‘positive deviation’, that continues to grow.
That said, PALM still has a long way to go in terms of mainstreaming lifestyle medicine in the healthcare system. For starters, it needs to be integrated at the undergraduate level into the education of health professionals. Further, the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Pakistan needs to seriously attend to the initiation of postgraduate membership and fellowship programmes in lifestyle medicine.

The PDMA asked authorities to take all precautionary measures to avoid or minimise damage to public life and property, cattle and infrastructure.
It urged local administrations to plan provision of additional resources and exercise control over traffic leading to and in vicinity of vulnerable choke points and tourist places and keep people away from structures under construction, advertisement hoardings, electric poles and solar panels.
The PDMA also called for the removal of debris and obstacles from drainage systems to ensure efficient flow of water and minimise the risk of urban flooding, and coordinate with the relevant municipal administrations to ensure mitigation and preparedness measures for landslides and urban flooding.
It also emphasised the removal of billboards and hoardings to prevent damage to public life and property due to wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms.
It asked people to seek shelter in sturdy buildings or underground structures to prevent damage from wind, dust, thunder and hailstorms, or lightning.

• Exposes recurring systemic issues in federal govt finances
• Massive supplementary grants allocated without parliamentary approval
• 87pc of expenditure in FY24 on debt, interest payments
ISLAMABAD: The Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) has identified a record over Rs375 trillion worth of irregularities, financial mismanagement and loss of public money in the affairs of the federal government and departments and entities working under its control.
The AGP expressed grave concern that only 13 per cent of public funds were directed towards the public good, raising significant questions about the country’s financial affairs.
In its report for the audit year 2024-25, the AGP examined the accounts of the federal government, including ministries, divisions and other government bodies, for FY24. The report said that the “recurrence of these irregularities indicates that systemic issues were cropping up either due to inadequate oversight mechanisms or inappropriate design of internal controls”.
It pointed out unnecessary allocation of supplementary grants leading to blocking of public funds, massive supplementary grants without approval of the parliament, demand for budget without need assessment leading to surrender of budget, lapse of funds due to non-surrendering of funds in time and non-recording of commitments leading to poor budget management.
It said that “a high percentage of expenditure, i.e. 96.26pc, was expended on General Public Service, which includes 86.69pc on repayment of debt and interest payments during 2023-24, which was 91.42pc during 2022-23”.
Therefore, the federal government was left with a meagre 13.31pc of total expenditure for socio-economic functions (other than debt), which is slightly higher than the last year‘s percentage of 8.58pc.
Some of the key audit findings included a massive Rs284.17tr procurement-related issues, Rs85.6tr worth of defective, unexecuted and delayed civil work and Rs2.5tr worth of receivables and recovery-related issues.
There were Rs1.228tr worth of non-settlement of circular debt issues, Rs958bn worth of violation of law and regulations, Rs677.5bn of weak internal control, Rs628bn of poor asset management and Rs281bn worth of poor contract management.
There were Rs165bn worth of audit findings relating to miscellaneous financial issues, Rs73bn worth of value for money and service delivery issues and Rs92bn worth of loss to the state due to non-recovery of government shares and encroachment on public land.
 
 

The report noted that although many government entities had internal audit setups, the financial irregularities observed during the current audit reflect that this function failed to deliver effectively. “The efficient functioning of internal audit would have helped the management in effective implementation of internal controls and strengthening the internal control environment in audited entities,” it observed.
The audit analysis revealed certain deficiencies and shortcomings that were shared with the management and all the stakeholders, which include the Accountant General of Pakistan Revenue (AGPR), Cont­roller General of Accounts (CGA), Ministry of Finance and all principal accounting officers of the relevant ministries and divisions and other entities for corrective measures.
The report revealed that 29pc (Rs513.87bn) of supplementary grants for FY24 had been issued without parliamentary approval, an unauthorised action. Non-surrender of savings under 12 grants led to a lapse of Rs212.08bn, and Rs12.6bn worth of expenditure exceeded the approved grants.
It said that as per the appropriation accounts for the financial year 2023-24, there was a total provision of Rs46.57tr. However, after surrender and supplementary grants, the final allocation was Rs 40.315tr. The actual expenditure was Rs39.945tr, with Rs369.97bn (0.92pc) savings, which was lower than the final allocation.
Overall appropriation figures revealed that the federal government approved supplementary grants of Rs1.765tr, of which Rs513.87bn was not approved by parliament. It said the Ministry of Finance claimed that supplementary grants not approved by parliament during the year would be presented for regularisation at the time of the next budget.
The AGP is required under Articles 169 and 170 of the Constitution to conduct an audit of the accounts of federal and provincial governments and the accounts of any authority or body established by these governments.
The consolidated audit report of the federal government is based on audits of the accounts of 7,879 formations working under entities of the federal government for the financial year 2023-24, and also contains some audit observations for the previous years.
The audit was conducted during 2024-25 on a test check basis to report significant audit findings to the stakeholders. The report includes only the systemic issues and audit findings carrying high monetary value.
Relatively less significant issues shall be pursued with the respective principal accounting officers (PAO) and, if unresolved, have to be brought to the notice of the Public Accounts Committee in the next year‘s audit report.
The AGP claimed that its audit activities had contributed towards adding value to the control mechanism of organisations, which complied with audit recommendations. As a result of the audit, management‘s awareness about internal controls and overall financial discipline has improved compliance with rules and regulations.

KOT ADDU: Villagers carrying their children on their shoulders wade through floodwaters in Ehsan Pur village.—AFP

• Fresh spell of torrential rains forecast across the country
• PDMA issues high-alert warning for Punjab
• Tarbela Dam is at maximum capacity; Mangla Dam is 74pc full
LAHORE / RAWALPINDI: Thousands of families in south Punjab have been displaced as floods caused by overflowing Indus and Chenab rivers have destroyed homes, crops and farmland.
Districts including Layyah, Taunsa Sharif, Kot Addu, Dera Ghazi Khan, Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur and Multan are among the worst affected.
In Multan, floodwaters entered several villages, destroying crops and mango orchards. In Kot Adu, residents of Ehsanpur and Hinjrai union councils were forced to evac­uate along with their livestock.
“Houses are surrounded by water, crops have vanished and land is eroding,” a rescue official told Dawn on condition of anonymity, adding that his team had evacuated over 150 people and their cattle by boat.
In Layyah, floodwaters washed away roads connected to the Layyah-Taunsa bridge, breaching the protective bunds. Residents of multiple union councils in Layyah and Taunsa have fled their homes, many now living under the open sky. At Head Taunsa, water flows have reached 500,000 cubic feet per second (cusecs), threatening downstream areas of Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur.
 
 

Jampur tehsil has also been devastated, with villages such as Shero Jadu, Jakhar Imam Shah, Lundi Pitafi and Qabool Chowk submerged. Residents said they lost homes and crops without receiving any government assistance. “We have to leave on our own with our cattle,” said Khalil Malik, a resident of Jampur.
In Muzaffargarh, floodwaters breached locally built bunds in Jatoi and Alipur tehsils, forcing residents to evacuate. Entire villages near Khairpur, Basti Laskani and Kehal have been abandoned.
Fresh spell of rains
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast another spell of heavy monsoon rains from Aug 23, warning of torrential downpours, wind and thunderstorms in the upper and central parts of the country until Aug 27, followed by heavy rains in Sindh and eastern and southern Balochistan from Aug 27 to 29.
According to the Met Office, strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal are expected to penetrate the country’s upper regions from Aug 22, with a westerly wave likely to approach the same night.
Under the influence of these meteorological conditions, widespread rain, wind and thundershower (with scattered heavy falls) are expected in Azad Kashmir (Neelum valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawalakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, Mirpur) and rain, wind and thundershowers (with isolated heavy falls) in Gilgit-Baltistan (Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, Shigar) from Aug 23 to Aug 27 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, widespread rain, wind and thundershower (with scattered heavy falls) are expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank and Dera Ismail Khan from Aug 23 to 26.
Similar weather is expected in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Hafizabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad and Sahiwal from Aug 23 to 27 with occasional gaps.
 
 

Scattered rain, wind and thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) are also likely in D.G. Khan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan, Bahawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rajanpur and Rahimyar Khan from Aug 24 to Aug 27.
In Sindh, rain, wind and thundershowers are expected in Mithi, Tharparkar, Umerkot and Mirpurkhas from the evening or night of Aug 23 to Aug 26 with occasional gaps.
In Balochistan, similar weather is expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibbi, Zhob, Kalat and Khuzdar from Aug 23 (evening or night) to Aug 26.
The PMD has warned of flash floods in streams and nullahs of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, northern Punjab, Islamabad, Murree, Galliyat and Kashmir between Aug 23 and 26. Urban flooding is likely in low-lying areas of Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Peshawar, Nowshera and Mardan. Landslides and mudslides are also feared in hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Murree and Kashmir.
The Met Office has urged authorities to remain on high alert and advised citizens, tourists and travellers to avoid unnecessary exposure in vulnerable areas. It warned that strong winds, heavy falls and lightning may damage weak structures, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
PDMA issues high alert
Separately, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has issued a high-alert warning across the province as increased water flows, fuelled by glacial melt and ongoing rains, threaten several districts.
According to the PDMA, medium-level flooding is reported at Taunsa Barrage on the Indus, while Chashma and Kalabagh are experiencing low-level flooding. On the Sutlej River, Ganda Singh Wala and Bed Sulemanki are under low-level flood stage, with the Pulkhu and Basantar streams also affected.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said Tarbela Dam has reached 100 per cent capacity and Mangla Dam is 74pc full, raising concerns of further water releases into already swollen rivers.
“Citizens living in riverbeds should immediately relocate to safe areas,” DG Kathia warned, urging people to comply with evacuation orders and avoid recreational activities near rivers. He stressed that bathing in rivers, canals and ponds is strictly prohibited and parents must not allow children near water bodies.
While water flows in the Jhelum, Chenab and Ravi rivers remain normal, the PDMA cautioned that the situation could worsen rapidly. “Protecting lives and property is our paramount responsibility,” DG Kathia said, calling for vigilance and immediate action from communities in at-risk areas.

The exchange of fire took place near Karmazi Stop, as troops were carrying out an operation to take control of a key militant stronghold. Sources said security forces managed to establish two new posts in the area.
Officials said that several militants initially managed to take refuge inside a nearby structure, but later fled during the clearance operation.
The crossfire left 11 residents injured, who were provided first aid before being shifted to the District Headq­uarters Hospital in Wana.
 
 

Witnesses said intermittent firing continued throughout the day, and residents said the area remained tense throughout the operation, with families confined to their homes for several hours. The Wana-Azam Warsak Road remained closed until around 1pm, disrupting routine life and leaving thousands unable to reach Wana Rustam bazaar.

Several militants believed to be among those killed in Bajaur explosion

Security officials confirmed that the road was later cleared.
Separately, several people were killed an explosion in the remote Charmang region of Bajaur’s Nawagai tehsil.
Although the exact cause of the incident is yet to be established, some sources claimed that a number of militants were among those killed. By some accounts, over two dozen individuals were killed in the explosion, which occurred in a mosque located in a hilly area. The remoteness of the region made it difficult to obtain independent confirmation of the incident.
It may be recalled that Operation Sarbakaf is currently underway in Bajaur, and residents have been evacuated from parts of the district as security forces work to root out a militant presence in the area.
There was no official word from Inter-Services Public Relations, the military’s media wing, on either incident, until going to press.

A letter, authored by two of the senior-most justices serving in the Supreme Court, surfaced on Wednesday and was circulated on various social media forums. Unsurprisingly, it quickly became the topic of heated debates on the 26th Amendment and how a controversial piece of legislation enacted under questionable circumstances was allowed to become a fait accompli by the highest court.
The missive, which its authors said had been prompted by a recent decision to publish the minutes of an Oct 31, 2024, meeting of the court’s Practice and Procedure Committee, read like a riposte to two notes recently uploaded to the Supreme Court website and attributed to the chief justice, in which he had explained why challenges to the 26th Amendment were sent to the Constitutional Bench to adjudicate and not presented before a full court.
The controversy is already well known. However, the judges’ letter does shed some fresh light on the chief justice’s decision to set the petitions challenging the amendment before the Constitutional Bench. The judges point out that the meeting of the Practice and Procedure Committee, which decided to place the petitions before a full court bench, had been called in accordance with the relevant law, and the decision could not be ignored or overruled. This much was previously known. However, they assert that the decision was ignored after the chief justice informally and individually met the other judges of the court without their knowledge or involvement. The chief justice later concluded from these meetings that placing the matter before the full court “could dampen the much-needed spirit of collegiality among the judges and further expose the court to public scrutiny”.
That is certainly not a very satisfactory explanation, and the two senior judges appear correct in their indignation over the Committee being overruled. Arbitrary decision-making by past chief justices had been the primary justification for the Supreme Court Practice and Procedure Act, 2023, which subsequently mandated that the Committee decide all crucial issues before the court.
Meanwhile, “The challenges to the 26th Amendment continue to remain pending, and a golden opportunity to decide them […] before the institution as a whole — ie, the full court as it then stood — has been lost, perhaps irretrievably”, the judges regret in the letter. One hopes that this is not so.
The chief justice must reconsider. It has since become clear that this amendment has done substantial harm to both the judiciary and the constitutional order. The Supreme Court must decide this matter as a whole and reaffirm its solidarity in this moment of crisis.

• Inaugurates Pakistan’s first business facilitation centre
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Thursday reached out to leaders of mainstream political parties and assured them of the federal government’s cooperation and support in dealing with the aftermath of floods and monsoon rains.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the PM telephoned PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and expressed grief over the loss of lives caused by the torrential rains and urban flooding in southern Sindh, particularly Karachi.
He offered full support from the federal government to assist the Sindh government in addressing the emergency situation.
Prime Minister Shehbaz directed the National Disaster Management Autho­rity (NDMA) chairman to stay in close coordination with the Sindh government, provide all possible assistance to the Provincial Disaster Management Autho­rity (PDMA), and ensure the early warnings to the people about potential risks.
 
 

The prime minister also spoke with Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman and Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.
During his conversation with the JI emir regarding the damage caused by recent rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and ongoing relief efforts, the PM appreciated the proactive role of the Al-Khidmat Foundation in rescue and relief operations.
He also discussed with Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui the recent rains and flood situation in Sindh, as well as potential risks from expected rainfall, assuring full cooperation from NDMA and other federal institutions to address any emergency situation.
Business Facilitation Centre
Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz inaugurated the country’s first-ever Business Facilitation Centre (BFC), aimed at promoting ease of doing business and attracting investment in Pakistan by providing a one-stop solution for investors and entrepreneurs.
Established by the Board of Investment (BoI), the BFC will facilitate the business community by providing a wide range of services, including guidance on regulatory requirements and facilitating business registration, licensing, and permits.
The centre will serve as a one-stop service, reducing hurdles and facilitating efficient interaction between businesses and government entities.
The prime minister was briefed on the centre’s operations, including investor gui­­dance, application processes for special economic zones, and streamlined procedures for licensing and payments with significantly reduced timelines.
He also unveiled the project plaque and exp­res­sed his intent to replicate the mo­­del acr­oss the country if it meets its objectives.
The prime minister urged all the relevant departments to efficiently run the centre to make it a success by facilitating and guiding the investors from other sectors, just like other countries.
“Otherwise, this will be nothing more than brick and mortar. That is not my vision… We should welcome customers with a smiling face combined with genuine support without any delay, not even for a second,” he advised.
The PM emphasised the need to promote the facilitation centre internationally and establish it as a model to be replicated in other parts of the country.
PM Shehbaz, who also visited different desks of the facilitation centre, was told that the investors would be able to submit their applications for setting up special economic zones or other projects at the centre, by answering different queries such as the nature of the business, loan and equity structure, target market, export potential, expected employment generation, and utility requirements.
The system will reflect all attached documents as well as an activity log, besides enabling the applicant to track their application, who will also be timely informed about any shortcomings on their part.
In his remarks, BoI Minister Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh described the centre’s establishment as a major breakthrough in investment facilitation. He noted that previously, investors had to visit multiple departments to complete the procedures for setting up businesses.

Things didn’t come easy for him as a player, he says. And he doesn’t expect them to be any better for him as coach. That’s what has brought the Peruvian former Newcastle United cult hero to football’s backwaters in Pakistan.
The sport in the country has seen little progress due to a decade-long institutional crisis in the Pakistan Football Federation. There have been some highs, notably Pakistan’s historic victory over Cambodia in 2023 — the first time the national team won a FIFA World Cup qualifier — but otherwise, it’s been a tale of woe compounded by a non-existent domestic structure.
Stephen Constantine, Solano’s predecessor who guided Pakistan to that famous victory over Cambodia, departed under a cloud; the newly-elected PFF leadership under president Mohsen Gilani having opted to look for other options. Enter the 50-year-old Solano, whose breathtaking skill on the wing made him a fan favourite at Newcastle but who still has a lot to prove as a coach.
None of his stints as head coach since leaving the job as Peru’s assistant coach, where he notably oversaw his nation qualify for their first World Cup in 36 years, has lasted more than a year. The Pakistan job offers him a chance to reset but he believes that any success will have a lot of contributing factors.
“My journey hasn’t been easy at any time,” Solano told Dawn in an exclusive interview just before he was unveiled to the media here at the PFF headquarters on Thursday. “And it won’t be easy here too.”
Solano recalled how he first broke into the consciousness of his first club side Sporting Cristal through a trial arranged by his father, who became a taxi driver after leaving the Peruvian army.
“I had to work very hard to impress at the trial,” said Solano. “In Peru, there is fierce competition for places … Everyone there loves football. Everyone there wants to be a footballer.”
Sparkling performances for Cristal saw Solano earn a move to Argentine giants Boca Juniors where he played with the legendary Diego Maradona. Only a year later, he had English Premier League clubs hovering over him and at a time when South American players preferred to go to Spain or Italy, he opted to take a path less trodden when he opted to sign for Newcastle in 1998.
“During that time, Spain or Italy was the easier option because there was no language barrier,” reflected Solano, who not only took upon himself to learn a new language and culture but also adjust to a different playing style with English football being more physical.
“The spell at Boca somewhat made it easier [to make the transition] because it is very similar,” said Solano. “But it was a test, and I wanted to test myself because [forward] Faustino Asprillia, who was Colombian, had a successful spell at Newcastle.”
He didn’t disappoint. Arriving after Asprilla had joined Parma, Solano became a first-team regular at Newcastle with not only his playing ability but also his personality making him a fan favourite.  But major silverware eluded both Newcastle and Solano, who also had spells at Aston Villa, West Ham United, Leicester City and Hull City in England before retiring.
Solano’s biggest regret, though, remains that he was unable to help Peru qualify for the World Cup as a player but some consolation came when he helped his country end that long drought in Russia 2018.
“It was a big achievement for the whole country as a whole to get to the World Cup after such a long time,” said Solano. “[Head coach] Ricardo Gareca did a wonderful job in unifying the team and we were able to do that. I think the lack of discipline was one of the reasons my generation was unable to qualify for the World Cup.”
Targets and expectations, though, are more modest with Pakistan.  But Solano is keen on not only bringing the South American flair but also grit and determination, and the fighting spirit, to the national and Under-23 teams. Many players, the local-based ones in particular, have had to do without any kind of domestic action. But in his first few training sessions, he has seen that the talent is promising.
“I’ve seen some really talented players who have had to make do without domestic football,” he said. “That [domestic football] is something  we need to collectively work on: me, the PFF and its leadership. But the big thing is that they’re willing to fight for a spot on the national team.
“It is something I’ve told the diaspora players I’ve spoken to since I took over. I’ve told them that they have to try and make their presence felt at the training camps because those who are here are willing to give everything to make the team.”
For a man who has fought so many battles himself, Solano is counting on that desire to lift Pakistan football.

Explaining the unexpected change in weather over the past two days, Focal Person of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) Anjum Niaz Zaigham said the current monsoon system has lost its intensity and its likely impact on Karachi is almost over.
“Though as we speak, the city is likely to see good showers within an hour or so (late evening) as rain bands are approaching Karachi after bringing about showers in Hyderabad, Sanghar, Tando Allah Yar and other parts of Sindh,” he said.
He said that Orangi Town saw 113mm rain on Wednesday.

Light to moderate showers continue for third day

According to him, the weather system released its maximum energy on August 19 and the circulation over Gujarat, India dissipated early than expected.
“We were thinking that the low pressure area and the circulation over Gujarat would combine together but that didn’t happen, fortunately. Even, then, we wanted to remain cautious as it’s difficult to predict the system’s behaviour with complete accuracy,” he said.
Karachi, he pointed out, is expected to have its next monsoon spell on Aug 27, though the ongoing system is likely to impact south-east parts of the province on Friday (today).
Meanwhile, the Met department in an advisory has forecast mostly cloudy weather with slight chances of light rain / drizzle over the next two days (Friday-Thursday) in Karachi with maximum temperature ranging between 32 and 34 degrees Celsius.
According to the PMD’s 24-hour rain data of Aug 20, the maximum rain was recorded in Orangi town 113mm followed by PAF Faisal Base 43mm, Korangi 36mm, Keamari 31mm, PAF Base Masroor and University Road 24mm each, DHA 21mm, Nizamabad 19mm, Saadi twon 16mm and North Karachi 9mm.
Man dies of electrocution
A young man died of electrocution in the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) on Thursday, bringing the death toll to 15 in three days of rain.
Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn that the Sahir Qamar, 30, was brought dead from DHA to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre on Thursday. He died of an electric shock, she said.
Officials said that most deaths were caused by falling house structures and electrocution.
‘Situation fully under control’
While the city administration is struggling to drain rainwater accumulated in many underpasses and roads, Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi claimed that rainwater had been cleared from most markets in the city and adjoining roads had been reopened for traffic.
He stated in a statement that the drainage work at Nazimabad and Tariq Road underpasses had been completed and both reopened for vehicular traffic. Similarly, water accumulated at NIPA had been removed and the road restored for traffic flow. Work is continuing at Drigh Road, Sohrab Goth, and Gulbahar underpasses, where pumps have been installed and are operational. The Commissioner said these underpasses will be cleared soon, he added.
Sindh Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani also paid a visit to the city and told the media that the overall situation in Karachi remained fully under control.
He said that despite the continuing showers, municipal staff, civil administration, elected representatives and provincial ministers are all present on the ground to supervise relief efforts. He added that after clearing major roads, drainage work on link roads and residential streets has been expedited.
He appealed to citizens to avoid unnecessary travel during the downpour to prevent any untoward incidents.

The report has prompted Pakistan to call on the international community to adopt a global counterterrorism strategy.
The UN report, presented to the Security Council on Wednesday, highlights the threat posed by ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K), which continues to represent one of the most serious challenges to Afghanistan and the greater South and Central Asian region, with approximately 2,000 fighters.
Speaking at the UNSC, Pakis­tan’s Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad described Afghanistan as “precarious” and underscored the serious threat ISIL-K poses to Pakistan’s security.

Pakistan calls on international community to adopt a global counterterrorism strategy

“Our principal adversary in the region is actively sponsoring terrorism in Pakistan. It bankrolls and supports terrorist proxies, and carries out extraterritorial assassinations,” he said.
 
 

Pakistan also warned of the dangers posed by collaboration among the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and Majeed Brigade, noting that these groups “share terrorist training camps, target strategic infrastructure and economic projects, and most tragically — ordinary citizens”.
Ambassador Ahmad described the TTP as the largest UN-desig­nated terrorist group operating from Afghan soil, directly threatening Pakistan’s national security.
 
 

The UN report notes that nearly 3,000 fighters remain active in Syria, attempting to rebuild operational capacity and exploit local security gaps, and some of them may relocate to Afghanistan.
The report also raised concern over tens of thousands of individuals detained in camps in northeast Syria, many women and children with alleged ISIL links. Prolonged confinement in unsafe conditions risks radicalisation, prompting calls for the “safe, voluntary, and dignified repatriation” of these individuals, particularly children.
UN officials warned that Daesh is increasingly exploiting digital tools and artificial intelligence to raise funds, recruit youth, and spr­ead propaganda, creating a com­­plex, multi-dimensional threat.
Ambassador Ahmad emphasis­ed the need for a holistic approach to counter terrorism, ad­­dressing un­­d­erlying drivers such as state op­­pression and occupation. He conde­mned collective punishment, hu­­man rights violations, demographic changes, and the misuse of counterterrorism narratives in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kash­mir (IIOJK) and the Occupied Pal­estinian Territories. He stressed that terrorism must be differentiated from legitimate struggles of people against foreign occupation.
He also criticised bias in UN counterterrorism frameworks, noting that all listed individuals are Muslim while non-Muslim extremists often escape scrutiny. “It is not understandable, and indeed unacceptable, that every name on the Security Council’s terrorism lists is Muslim, while terrorists and violent extremists elsewhere escape scrutiny. This must change,” he said.

However, unlike the PTI workers who are expected to be released from jail, Mr Khan’s detention is unlikely to end soon, as he is facing over 100 cases in the courts of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
The court of Judicial Magistrate Mureed Abbas granted bail to the detained workers against surety bonds of Rs100,000 each.
 
 

The magistrate had reserved the verdict after hearing arguments from both sides and reviewing the case record, later announcing the decision in favour of the petitioners.

FIA court adjourns hearing of Bulgari jewellery set case until Aug 26

According to police, 40 PTI workers were arrested in a case registered at the Margalla Police Station, while 23 others were detained in a case registered at the Industrial Area Police Station. The cases were filed in connection with a protest held on August 15 under various legal provisions.
Meanwhile, the Special Court of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) adjourned the hearing in the case related to a Bulgari jewellery set that Mr Khan allegedly received from the Toshakhana. Judge Shahrukh Arjumand conducted the brief proceeding at Federal Courts Complex instead of Adiala Jail and adjourned the hearing until August 26.
Mr Khan is currently serving a 14-year sentence in the £190 million corruption reference and is also in judicial custody in connection with multiple FIRs.
According to statistics provided by Isl­a­mabad Police, Mr Khan is facing 67 cas­es registered under the Pakis­tan Penal Code (PPC) and the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). These FIRs are related to PTI’s protests during the Azadi March and events on October 5 and November 26.
The former premier is also facing 43 cases in various courts of Rawalpindi. These FIRs were registered by Rawal­pindi and Attock Police. Additionally, Mr. Khan is facing 12 cases in the Anti-Terrorism Court of Rawalpindi related to the violent protests of May 9, 2023.

The Islamic Relief’s emergency response team is on the ground distributing food and water, and the team’s assessment found that 73 per cent of houses are destroyed or partially damaged; sixty per cent of people in Buner and 53 per cent in Swat are now unable to support their families; eighty per cent of agricultural land in Buner has been damaged; nearly 50 per cent of livestock animals have died and been washed away.
 
 

According to the assessment, 40 per cent of households are already reporting cases of diarrhea, with water-borne diseases spreading as the water supply is contaminated by bodies of victims and livestock and the destruction of sanitation facilities.
Acting country director of Islamic Relief Pakistan, Raza Narejo, said that “now the flood waters are receding, but the impact is enormous and it will affect people here for a long time. The poorest communities have seen their jobs and income wiped out in a flash, with 60 per cent of workers in Buner district now unable to sustain themselves following the floods.“

The restriction was initially imposed on April 24 this year amid ongoing tensions between the two countries. It was first extended on May 23, followed by further extensions up to July 23, and then until August 24.
Sources confirmed that the Pakistan Airport Aut­h­ority had previously exte­nded the airspace closure for Indian aircraft from July 18 to August 24. Now, ac­cording to the latest NOTAM, the Pakistani airspace will remain closed to Indian aircraft from Aug 25 until Sept 25.
The ban applies specifically to Indian-registered or leased aircraft, whether op­­erated, owned, or leased by Indian operators, including military fli­ghts, as per NOTAM A0472/25 issued by the authorities con­­cerned. However, Pak­is­tan’s airspace remains open to all other international flights, it said.

The audit report also indicated there was significant public dissatisfaction with the performance of the NDMA in terms of its awareness campaigns, preparedness, and relief efforts.
This observation was made after the Directorate General Audit (Cli­mate Change and Environm­ent) conducted an audit of the NDMA Islamabad.
A public questionnaire was used to gather opinions on their effectiveness.
A significant portion of participants had limited, or to some extent, awareness about natural disasters (72 per cent combined), while the awareness of NDMA as an agency was also limited (72pc) had knowledge to some extent.

Auditors raise Rs28bn objections; authority accused of overpaying firms for Karachi drains project

Overall, 76pc disagreed or were neutral when asked if the NDMA prepared communities for potential disaster or not; only 36pc agreed.
A majority (76pc) was dissatisfied or neutral regarding the speed of relief efforts by the NDMA, with only 24pc expressing satisfaction. Satisfaction with overall performance ratings was also low, with 84pc dissatisfied or neutral. Only 16pc were satisfied.
The auditor general pointed out in the report that an unauthorised expenditure out of the National Di­­saster Management Fund (NDMF) was carried out in 2023-24.
The NDMA incurred an expenditure of Rs21.677 billion out of the National Disaster Management Fund Account on the procurement of relief items, civil works of the National Emergency Operation Center building, project employee salaries, and civil works on the the Karachi Transformation Plan (KTP), including the reconstruction and revamping of major nullahs in the port city during the financial year 2023-24.
“The audit held that expenditure out of the National Disaster Manag­ement Fund Account without ap­­pr­oved and notified national authority by the federal government stood unauthorised,” said the report.
Similarly, it pointed out overpayment on account of escalation to the National Logistics Cell (NLC) for Orangi Nullah worth Rs2.437 billion. During the audit for the financial year 2023-24, it was ob­­served that an amount of Rs3.267 billion was paid to the NLC on account of escalation for the Orangi Nullah work, leading to the overpayment of Rs2.437 billion.
The audit recommended that the recovery of the overpaid amount of Rs2.437 billion may be made from the NLC and be deposited into the public exchequer. It also recommended the recovery of the overpaid amount of Rs1.839 billion from the NLC.
Similarly, the audit report highlighted unauthorised expenditure out of the NDM Fund on event management services worth Rs23.254 million, overpriced award of contracts to the state-owned entities on account of Gujjar and Orangi nullah works, amounting to Rs5.674 billion, and the “mis-procurement of family tents on pre-qualification basis instead of open competitive bidding” causing a loss of Rs4.829 billion.
According to the audit report, the procurement of the tents without a technical evaluation also caused a further loss of Rs2.58 billion. The audit held that procurement of winterised and shelter tents from the suppliers was a violation of PPRA Rules. The audit recommended that the matter be inquired into and responsibility be fixed over the violation of the PPRA Rules.

If approved, the refund could amount to approximately Rs23 billion, which would be reflected in August bills.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has scheduled a public hearing on Aug 28 to review the petition. The fuel cost adjustment (FCA) refund will also apply to K-Electric consumers, in line with a recent decision by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the cabinet.
Nepra has also sought public feedback on whether the Power Division’s request to implement the ECC’s decision before formal cabinet ratification should be accepted. This will determine how the FCA is applied to K-Electric’s consumers and ensure uniformity across the country’s power tariffs.

Power consumption falls 5pc in first month of FY26

As per the ECC’s directive, Nepra is required to implement the same tariff rationalisation for K-Electric consumers as for those of the Discos. Any disparity between K-Electric’s FCA and the official rate will be adjusted through subsidies or cross-subsidies. The uniform FCA, applicable from June 2025, will be reflected in bills issued in August 2025. Nepra has already notified a negative fuel adjustment of 78 paise per unit, payable by consumers in the current billing cycle.
The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA), which filed the petition for the July FCA, reported that power consumption in July was 5pc lower than the same month last year but 2.6pc higher than June 2025. The total electricity delivered to Discos was 13,666 gigawatt hours (GWh) in July, up from 13,310 GWh in June but down from 14,410 GWh in July 2024.
The CPPA revealed that the average fuel cost for electricity generation was Rs8.18 per unit in July, compared to Rs9.04 per unit in the same month last year. The reference fuel cost was initially set at Rs9.88 per unit.
According to the CPPA, 14,123 GWh of electricity was generated in July for Rs109.90 billion (Rs7.78 per unit). Of this, 13,666 GWh was delivered to Discos, with a total expenditure of Rs111.86 billion (Rs8.18 per unit).
Hydropower remained the dominant source of electricity, contributing 40pc of the total generation in July, up from 36pc in the same month last year. Other major contributors included RLNG (17.3pc), local coal (10.64pc), nuclear power (10pc), and imported coal (8pc). Domestic natural gas accounted for 7.74pc of the energy mix.
RLNG-based generation was the most expensive, with a cost of Rs22 per unit, followed by imported coal (Rs14.49 per unit) and local gas (Rs13.38 per unit). Local coal was cheaper, at Rs11.34 per unit, while furnace oil-based generation cost Rs31 per unit, but contributed less than 1pc to the grid.
Nuclear energy cost Rs2.42 per unit in July, up from Rs1.48 per unit last year. Renewable sources, including wind and solar, contributed 4.8pc to the grid, with no fuel cost. Electricity imports from Iran made up about 0.25pc of the total supply, costing Rs24.15 per unit, a slight increase from Rs22.5 per unit in June and Rs25 per unit in July 2024.
The FCA is reviewed monthly, and adj­ustments are passed on to consumers thr­ough their bills for the corresponding mon­­th. The mechanism allows for chan­ges in fuel costs to be automatically adj­us­ted in consumers’ bills, while quarte­r­ly tariff adjustments account for variations in power purchase prices, capacity char­ges, and transmission and distribution losses, all of which are factored into the base tariff by the federal government.

“The State Department revokes visas any time there are indications of a potential ineligibility, which includes things like any indicators of overstays, criminal activity, threats to public safety, engaging in any form of terrorist activity, or providing support to a terrorist organisation,” the official said.
In a written comment to The Associated Press, the official said that if a visa holder presents these indications, their visa will be revoked and they will be subject to deportation if they are already in the US.
US President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a focus of his presidency, boosting resources to secure the border and arresting people in the country illegally.
Earlier this month, the US government announced that it could require bonds of up to $15,000 for some tourist and business visas under a pilot programme to crack down on visitors who overstay their visas.
The programme gives US consular officers the discretion to impose bonds on visitors from countries with high rates of visa overstays, according to a Federal Register notice, which adds that bonds could also be applied to people coming from countries where screening and vetting information is deemed insufficient.
In July, US broadcaster CNN reported that the US would soon require international visitors to pay a “visa integrity fee” of at least $250, a new addition to existing visa application costs, according to a provision in the Trump administration’s domestic policy bill.
The fee is to be paid at the time visas are issued. Although there will be no fee waivers for the payment, the provision states that travellers who comply with the terms of their visa can have the fee reimbursed after their trip.
In June, United States consulates in Karachi and Lahore requested that all applicants for F, M or J nonimmigrant visas make their social media accounts public for vetting.
US consular officers are now required to conduct a “comprehensive and thorough vetting” of all student and exchange visitor applicants to identify those who “bear hostile attitudes toward our citizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles”, said a US diplomatic cable.</p><small>2025-08-21 19:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/21225142c0e4453.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1932287/china-affirms-commitment-to-working-with-pakistan-on-regional-peace-and-stability' target='_blank'><strong>China affirms commitment to working with Pakistan on regional peace and stability</strong></a><br><p>China affirmed its commitment on Thursday to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership with ties ranging across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure. The fifth round of Strategic Dialogue in May 2024 was co-chaired by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in Beijing. The Chinese foreign minister is currently on a visit to Pakistan.
Wang called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the Prime Minister’s House, according to a statement from the PM Office. The meeting was also attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and senior cabinet members.
“FM Wang Yi emphasised that China regarded Pakistan as an ironclad friend and all-weather strategic partner. He expressed China’s desire to elevate bilateral relations with Pakistan to new heights of cooperation and collaboration. Commending Pakistan’s resolute commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty and territorial integrity, he affirmed that China would continue working jointly with Pakistan to promote regional peace, development, and stability,” the statement said.
 






Welcoming the Chinese foreign minister, PM Shehbaz expressed “deep appreciation for the leadership, government and the people of China, for their steadfast support to Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, territorial integrity, and national development.
“Reaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support for China on its core issues, he reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further deepen its All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership with China, as envisioned by the leadership and aspired by the peoples of the two countries.”
The statement said the premier lauded President Xi Jinping’s “visionary leadership and his role in strengthening the ironclad friendship” between Pakistan and China.
Recalling his “most cordial and productive meeting” with President Xi during his visit to Beijing last year, PM Shehbaz stated that he was greatly looking forward to his upcoming visit to Tianjin and Beijing to participate in the Shan­ghai Cooperation Organi­sation Council of Heads of States (SCO-CHS) summit meeting, as well as the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People’s War of Resistance and the World Anti-Fascist War.
The prime minister said he looked forward to his meeting with President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang, as well as other senior Chinese leaders, during the forthcoming visit.
“The prime minister reiterated Pakistan’s desire to deepen bilateral cooperation with China in trade, investment, ICT, agriculture, industrialisation, mines and minerals and other key sectors. He also underscored the importance of CPEC (China Pakistan Economic Corridor) for Pakistan’s socio-economic development and its vital role in enhancing regional connectivity, while expressing satisfaction at the steady progress of CPEC Phase-II.”
Wang also met President Asif Ali Zardari at the President’s House with FM Dar, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and federal ministers present as well.
According to a statement from the PPP, President Zardari said that Pakistan and China were “iron brothers, time-tested friends and all-weather strategic partners”, adding that friendship with China was the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy, which enjoyed “unanimous public, political, and institutional support” in the country.
“The president thanked China for its consistent support for Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, national development, and its principled and just stance on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
“The president also conveyed his condolences on the loss of precious lives in the recent floods in Beijing and Gansu province of China,” the statement said.
He added that 2026 marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two nations, saying that Pakistan was planning to celebrate the milestone in a “befitting manner”.
“He said both the countries can use this opportunity to pass on the finest traditions of Pakistan China friendship to our younger generations.”
The president also regarded CPEC as having “immense strategic significance” for both Pakistan and China, adding that it was an important component to realise their joint vision of enhanced regional connectivity, economic integration and a peaceful neighborhood.
“Expressing his views, Mr Wang Yi said that friendship between China and Pakistan has lasted for generations and is based on good faith, credibility and strong all-weather strategic partnership.
“He said President Xi Jinping’s vision is that Pakistan and China have a shared future and work should be done to bring the two peoples closer to each other. He said China acknowledges Pakistan’s support to China at key junctures.”
Matters relating to bilateral cooperation and regional security also came under discussion.
 






In a meeting between FM Dar and Wang earlier, the two reaffirmed their unwavering commitment to the accelerated development of CPEC during the 6th Strategic Dialogue.
The two sides reviewed the entire gamut of Pakistan-China relations and discussed important regional and global issues. They also exchanged in-depth views on multiple facets of bilateral cooperation, including CPEC 2.0, trade and economic relations, multilateral cooperation, and people-to-people ties.
Underlining the “All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership between Pakistan and China”, both officials agreed that their friendship was significant for maintaining regional peace and stability and indispensable for their progress and prosperity. They also agreed to continue close coordination and communication,  both bilaterally and at multilateral forums.
 






Addressing a joint press conference after their meeting, FM Dar termed his talks as being “fruitful” as the two leaders discussed various matters of mutual interest.
“We held fruitful and substantive discussions today covering diverse areas of mutual interest,” Dar said.
He continued, “We took stock of progress achieved since the last round of Strategic Dialogue. We also exchanged views on the entire gamut of Pakistan-China relations, including CPEC, trade and investment, science and technology and people-to-people cooperation.”
“The important developments pertaining to our region and the world at large were also reviewed,” he said, adding that both sides enjoyed “complete unanimity of use and consensus on all important matters”.
 


Dar also mentioned the tri-lateral meeting with Afghan FM Amir Khan Muttaqi, stating, “Recently our two countries have worked together to establish tri-lateral partnerships with other countries in the region.
“These mechanisms signify our joint resolve to promote regional peace, stability and prosperity, and to share the dividends of Pak-China friendship with other countries in the region and beyond.”
He further said, “We also discussed preparations for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s forthcoming visit to China. The PM will attend the SCO-CHS summit and also meet top Chinese leadership, including President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang.”
He announced that the Pak-China B2B Investment Conference will also be organised during the PM’s visit to China.
Wang described CPEC as the cornerstone of Pakistan and China’s strategic partnership, stating that the current priority was to advance development of the corridor.
He said that during the sixth strategic dialogue, both sides agreed to upgrade CPEC into “a growth corridor, livelihood-enhancing corridor, green corridor and open corridor”.
“We will work hard to deepen our industrial agriculture and mining cooperation to improve the Pakistani people’s welfare, accelerate Pakistan’s capability for self-sustained development and increase Pakistan’s economic resilience,” Wang said.
He added that China was also supporting the development and operation of Gwadar Port and promoting the Karakoram Highway realignment project.
Wang also welcomed third-party participation in the ML-1 (Main Line) railway project.
Additionally, China’s top diplomat said that Beijing would warmly welcome PM Shehbaz for the SCO-CHS summit in Tianjin at the end of this month.
“The two sides will jointly prepare and ensure the success of the series of activities for the 75th anniversary of China-Pakistan diplomatic relations next year,” he said.
Wang also extended his condolences for the lives lost in the recent floods, assuring that Beijing would “immediately provide emergency humanitarian assistance”.
The Chinese foreign minister also commended Pakistan’s role in combatting terrorism, stating that Islamabad was “effectively protecting the safety of Chinese personnel and institutions” in the country.
“China highly commends Pakistan’s tireless efforts in combatting terrorism, as it firmly believes that Pakistan’s counter-terrorism operation will secure victory,” Wang stated.
In response to a question about China’s relations with India, Wang stated that the partnership would “not affect any third party”.
Wang arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier today, to attend the sixth Strategic Dialogue between China and Pakistan, where he was received by FM Dar.
 






Wang had arrived in Islamabad last night, where he was received by Dar.
“Delighted to receive my dear friend, H.E. Wang Yi, Foreign Minister China, in Pakistan this evening,” Dar wrote on social media yesterday.
He added, “I look forward to productive discussions tomorrow at our dialogue, and with the leadership during his calls on President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.”
 






A day earlier, the Sixth Trilateral Foreign Ministers Dialogue was held in Kabul between Dar, Wang and Afghan counterpart Muttaqi on the topics of political, economic and security cooperation.
“The three sides committed to strengthening joint efforts against terrorism,“ the Foreign Office said. “They also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration in trade, transit, regional development, health, education, culture, and combating drug trafficking, as well as extension of CPEC to Afghanistan.”
 






Last month, Pakistan and China agreed to launch joint training programmes in multiple fields, including construction engineering, artificial intelligence, agriculture and hospitality management, under the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC-II).
PM Shehbaz is expected to travel to Beijing at the end of this month to attend the SCO summit from August 31 to September 1. On the sidelines, he is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian leader Vladimir Putin.
Earlier this week, the government announced that this upcoming visit will mark the formal launch of CPEC-II, focused on industrial cooperation, after a delay of about five years.
