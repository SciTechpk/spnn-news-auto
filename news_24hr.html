The petitioner also asked the FSC to declare that the state and its organs were under a continuing obligation to ensure that all laws, constitutional provisions and institutional arrangements remain consonant with the injunctions of Islam as enshrined in the Holy Quran and the Sunnah.
Citing the Ministry of Law and Justice and Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs as respondents, petitioner Barrister Ali Tahir stated in the petition that the impugned amendment has fundamentally altered the balance of power among the country’s institutions and that it has centralised authority in the executive, weakening judicial independence and entrenching military supremacy in constitutional law.
He submitted that Islamic governance was founded on the principles of justice, trust and accountability and the Quran repeatedly commanded the rulers and judges to uphold justice and to be accountable to Allah and the people and that Islamic jurisprudence mandated that the judiciary must be independent from executive and legislative interference.
The petitioner stated that lifetime immunity for the president of the country and military leaders creates a privileged class above the law, violating the Quranic command for equality and accountability and this erodes public trust in institutions and undermines the legitimacy of the state.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s unemployed population surged by a staggering 31 per cent, or 1.4 million, rising from 4.5m in 2020-21 to 5.9m in 2024-25, highlighting mounting challenges in the country’s labour market.
The rise in unemployment was observed across all age groups and both genders over the past four years, indicating a broad-based deterioration in labour market conditions, according to a government report released by Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday.
The unemployment rate also showed an upward trend across all age groups. For the prime age group of 15-24 years, it was estimated at 12.6pc in 2024-25, up from 11.1pc in 2020-21.
Among individuals aged 15-29, the rate rose to 11.5pc from 10.3pc, reflecting growing joblessness among the youth. Overall, the average unemployment rate increased to 6.9pc, compared to 6.3pc in the previous labour force survey.
Among males, the unemployment rate climbed from 5.5pc to 5.9pc, while for females it increased more sharply from 8.9pc to 9.7pc. In rural areas, unemployment rose from 5.8pc to 6.3pc, and in urban areas, it edged up from 7.3pc to 8pc.
 
 

The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) conducted the Labour Force Survey (LFS) 2024-25 at the provincial level. This was the 37th round in the series of surveys, with data collected electronically using tablets.
The findings revealed a notable rise in the Labour Force Participation Rate, indicating greater engagement of the working-age population in economic activities. The proportion of people aged 10 and above, who are either employed or actively seeking employment, increased from 44.9pc in 2020-21 to 47.7pc in 2024-25.
A sex-disaggregated analysis showed increases in participation rates for both males and females. Male participation rose from 67.9pc to 69.8pc, while female participation increased from 21.4pc to 24.4pc. Rural participation rose from 48.6pc to 52.3pc, and urban participation from 38.8pc to 40.8pc, reflecting broader workforce inclusion across regions.
The labour force, encompassing all persons aged 10 and above who are employed (including own-use producers) or unemployed, increased from 71.8m in 2020-21 to 85.6m in 2024-25, adding roughly 3.5m people per year.
For the first time, the LFS provides estimates of gig-economy labour supply. For primary jobs, 2.9pc of workers are engaged in gig-based work, while for secondary jobs, gig (short-term) work rises to 10.6pc, with women playing a more prominent role — 15pc of women with secondary jobs rely on gig work, compared to 9.8pc of men.
The share of agricultural employment declined from 37.4pc in 2020-21 to 33.1pc in 2024-25, while the services sector grew from 37.2pc to 41.2pc. Industry’s share declined slightly to 24.9pc from 25.4pc.
The report highlighted robust wage growth, with average monthly wages rising from Rs24,000 to Rs39,000. The gender wage gap fell from Rs4,500 per month in 2020-21 to less than Rs2,000 in 2024-25.
The share of own-account workers increased from 35.5pc to 36.1pc, driven largely by women. Female entrepreneurship rose sharply from 19pc in 2020-21 to 25.2pc, while the share of contributing family workers — predominantly unpaid women — declined from 21.1pc to 19pc, reflecting greater female entry into paid labour.
Out of 179.6m working-age individuals in 2024-25, 117.4m are engaged in unpaid domestic and care activities. Among 92m men, 50.7m (55pc) perform unpaid work, while among 87.6m women, 66.7m (76pc) are engaged in unpaid domestic and care responsibilities.
Employees constitute the largest group (43.5pc), followed by own-account workers (36.1pc), contributing family workers (19.1pc), and employers (1.3pc). Nearly half of female workers are contributing family workers (49.7pc), while almost half of male workers are employees (49pc). Between the two surveys, the share of employees rose from 42pc to 43.5pc, and own-account workers from 35.5pc to 36.1pc, while contributing family workers declined from 21.1pc to 19.1pc, and employers from 1.4pc to 1.3pc.
In non-agricultural work, the informal sector continues to dominate, accounting for 72.1pc of jobs — 75.5pc in rural areas and 68.3pc in urban areas. Formal sector work is more common in cities, reaching 31.7pc.
Female participation is higher in the formal sector at 33.7pc, while male participation in the informal sector reaches 73pc. Formal work has grown slightly over time.

An ordinary girl from Swat who, at 15, was shot by the Taliban for advocating for girls’ education, went on to become the global face of courage — a Nobel Peace Prize winner and a poster girl for education. Now, with the release of her new memoir, her story is back in the spotlight. Yet in Pakistan she is dismissed as a ‘puppet’, criticised for being ‘too Western’, or condemned for ‘not doing enough’. It is a paradox worth examining using economic theories, forcing us to confront what her story reveals about ourselves.
Economists George Akerlof and Rachel Kranton, in their theory of ‘economics of identity’, argue that people obtain satisfaction from belonging to social groups: nation, religion, gender and feel loss when someone from their group seems to violate its norms. In Pakistan, national identity is often defined in contrast to the West. When a girl from Swat became a fixture in Western media, her success was misread as defection, a signal that she now ‘belonged’ to another group. The conspiracy theories that followed were, in economic terms, society’s way of restoring identity balance: re-labelling her as an outsider to protect the in-group’s sense of coherence.
There is also a theory of fairness and relative comparison at play. Human beings judge success not in absolutes but through comparison. Economists Ernst Fehr and Klaus Schmidt call this ‘inequity aversion’: we dislike outcomes that feel unearned, even if they don’t harm us directly. Many Pakistanis viewed Malala’s sudden global fame as disproportionate to her age and actions. She became a Nobel laureate before she could vote or graduate while millions of girls were struggling to find their way into schools. Instead of being proud of her, people felt deprived — as if the world had rewarded one girl and ignored the rest.
Yet this instinct to doubt or diminish her says more about us than about Malala. Economic theory explains our discomfort but it also shows why changing the narrative can yield better outcomes. If identity and fairness shape behaviour, then reshaping those perceptions can reshape incentives. Instead of treating Malala’s success as alien, Pakistan can treat it as ‘collective capital’ — proof of what is possible when a girl from an ordinary background is allowed to speak and learn.

The suspicion surrounding Malala is not unique.

Economists call this the ‘role-model effect’: when girls see people like them succeed, they start to believe they can too, and that belief changes what they aim for and how hard they try. Bell et al. (2019) find that girls in the US growing up in regions with more female inventors were significantly more likely to become inventors themselves. The mechanism is simple but powerful: visibility expands the ‘aspiration window’. Malala’s story can do the same for Pakistan’s daughters, not because she is flawless, but because she is recognisably human. Her very ordinariness makes ambition feel reachable.
 
 

Her light-hearted Instagram reels reflect how she has grown into a confident young woman: founding the Malala Fund, finishing a degree at Oxford, and continuing to speak for children denied schooling. Malala has done far more than most Pakistanis care to acknowledge. When the attack happened, she was just a child, still figuring out who she was. But instead of standing by her side, we turned our doubt into judgement. In doing so, we taught our own children that speaking up leads to punishment — that curiosity and confidence will be met with doubt.
The suspicion surrounding Malala is not unique. It is the tale of nearly every woman who choo­ses to stand out. Economists term this ‘statistical discrimination’. It oc­­curs when individuals do not have enough information, leading them to rely on stereotypes to bridge the gaps. A different woman is not seen in terms of her own effort or worth, she’s seen in terms of what society believes she ought to be — “too outspoken”, “too different”. And if she does succeed, it’s discounted as an exception, not an example. This scepticism is like a hidden tax on women’s progress, causing every woman who dares to rise to first prove, time and again, that she deserves it.
Pakistan cannot keep doubting its daughters. They deserve better — girls who feel free to question, to learn and lead. Each time we tell a girl to stay quiet or fade into the background, we shrink our own future. When women grow, the nation grows. Celebrating Malala is not about idolising one person; it’s about showing our daughters what’s possible. Let’s teach them that strength, curiosity, and ambition are not flaws to hide, but values to nurture — for their sake, and for Pakistan’s. Because in the end, the real question isn’t why Pakistanis are triggered by Malala, but why we fear the strength she represents.

The latest by-elections in Punjab and KP have further exposed the hollowness of the hybrid set-up. Predictably, the ruling PML-N has won almost all the national and provincial assembly seats in the virtually uncontested polls. This does not come as a surprise given the PTI’s boycott of the poll for seats that the party was forced to vacate following the disqualification of its members. After all, those seats were not snatched to be given back. The by-elections have been aptly described as an extension of the electoral manipulation seen in the 2024 general polls.
While the outcome of the by-elections on six National Assembly seats mostly from Punjab will help the PML-N consolidate its strength in parliament and reduce the opposition’s numbers in the House, it will not really change the power equation. The ruling coalition already had a two-thirds majority in parliament after depriving the PTI of reserved seats for women and minorities. The disqualification of some PTI lawmakers after a dubious trial had further reduced the opposition numbers.
 
 

The ruling alliance’s manipulated strength will not empower parliament whose credibility remains questionable. The real power remains with unelected forces whose domination has been further boosted through amendments to the Constitution. Parliament has virtually surrendered its powers.
There is now talk of another amendment that may completely alter the federal structure of the state. While the contours of the much-speculated 28th amendment are still under wraps, some ministers have hinted about the restructuring of the powers of the federating units. It is likely that the exercise for the 28th amendment will be expedited now that the by-elections are over. Most probably, like the previous amendments, the full text of the changes will only be made available to lawmakers at the last moment.

Any action through the proposed 28th amendment will further alienate the people.

In fact, any such move will be extremely damaging for the federation as the state already faces serious internal and external challenges. While the hybrid regime is preoccupied with accumulating further powers, the situation in KP and Balochistan is getting out of hand with the escalation of terrorist violence in both provinces. The attack on the FC headquarters in a high-security zone in Peshawar is yet another reminder of the gravity of internal security challenges. The attack claimed by a faction within the TTP shows the capacity of terrorist groups despite kinetic action by the security forces.
Notwithstanding the security forces’ claim of having killed hundreds of militants in intelligence-based operations, the violence hasn’t stopped. The writ of the state is practically non-existent in troubled KP districts. The suicide attack on the FC headquarters in the heart of the provincial capital demonstrates the inability of the security agencies to deal with the growing terrorist threat. This year, which has yet to end, is said to be the deadliest in a decade, having exacted a heavy toll on the security forces.
One of the reasons for the rising terrorist activities is the breakdown of civil law enforcement because of the constant confrontation between the PTI government in KP and the federal government. The conflict has heightened with Islamabad’s move to push the opposition to the wall. Differences between the KP government and the establishment over military operations in the province are also providing space to the terrorists.
The situation is probably worse in Balochistan where a separatist insurgency has gripped large parts of the province. There has been a marked escalation in terrorist attacks on security personnel and government installations this year despite the government’s claim of the situation being under control. State curbs on democratic and economic rights in the province are cited as a major reason for the alienation of much of the Baloch population, thus providing greater space to the separatists. Stressing on kinetic actions, the state has failed to realise that the Balochistan crisis is directly linked to the denial of democratic rights to the people. The province is in the throes of unrest while the regime is more interested in tightening its control. Any action through the proposed 28th amendment will further alienate the people.
Moreover, the worsening tension on the western frontiers will have a direct bearing on both KP and Balochistan, given their long borders with Afghanistan which serves as the main sanctuary for the terrorists. It is an extremely grave situation for the country and it is the state’s responsibility to unite the people and the federation, rather than alienate citizens through divisive policies and curbs on democratic rights. No country can defend its sovereignty while fighting its own people.
Political instability is not the only issue in the two provinces; the crisis of governance has also exacerbated in recent years. The IMF’s recently released Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment has exposed how poor governance and rampant corruption have stunted the country’s economic growth, and how the lack of transparency, fragmented regulations and political capture are major impediments in the way of economic progress in Pakistan. The lending agency has also called for the military-backed SIFC to develop “enhanced transparency arrangements”. The review has come at a time when the regime is trying to further consolidate its control, thus adversely affecting governance.
It is time for the ruling set-up to heed these warning signs and bring the country together allowing the democratic process to advance. The recent constitutional amendments have already worsened the crisis of state.

Speaking at a presser along with VBMP leader Hooran Baloch, he said that a few days ago security forces personnel raided a house in Hub Chowki and detained Nasreen Baloch, the daughter of Dilawar and a resident of Tirtaj, before shifting her to an undisclosed location.
 
 

He said the family has not been provided any information about her whereabouts, causing severe distress and mental anguish among family members.
He said the family members of Nasreen Baloch contacted VBMP regarding her enforced disappearance, after which the organisation is now raising the matter to bring it to the notice of higher authorities through the media.
 
 

He said that earlier in May this year, Mahjabeen, the daughter of Ghulam Mustafa and a student of the University of Balochistan from Basima, was taken into custody from Quetta Civil Hospital and even after six months, she has not been produced in any court of the country and her family has been given no information about her whereabouts.

A disaster was narrowly averted on Monday morning when the swift response of security forces prevented terrorists from staging a mass-casualty attack at Peshawar’s Federal Constabulary headquarters. At least three security men were martyred in the episode, while several terrorists were gunned down after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the gates of the facility. Hundreds of troops were reportedly present inside the FC HQ at the time of the assault.
The attack resembled the raid targeting the Wana Cadet College earlier this month, in which the terrorists were also neutralised by security forces before they could cause major damage. As for the perpetrators behind the Peshawar attack, state media are saying Afghan nationals were involved, while some observers have pointed to the involvement of the Jamaatul Ahrar, a terrorist outfit in the banned TTP’s fold.
There is cause for serious concern if the JuA was involved, and it has indicated that it was. The terrorist group has staged several bloody attacks, including the January 2023 Peshawar Police Lines atrocity. That it struck a secure installation in the heart of the provincial capital speaks of the need to vastly improve intelligence-gathering and counterterrorism capabilities. Some officials have not ruled out the possibility of the attackers having inside information — something that must be thoroughly probed.
 
 

The current year has witnessed a high number of attacks; as per one count over 2,400 people had lost their lives in more than 950 attacks up till September. KP, along with Balochistan, has been the hardest hit. If this worrying tide is to be reversed, then the federal and provincial administrations must put their heads together and formulate an effective CT strategy.
The Afghan Taliban may well be involved in facilitating violent actors; this is the biggest obstacle standing in the way of better ties with Kabul, and the state has and should continue to press the Afghan side to stop cross-border terrorism. Yet we must strengthen our own defences and not wait for others to act. This means busting local networks of terrorist groups, and stopping cross-border infiltration. The military and civilian arms of the state must together defeat the monster of terrorism before it draws even more blood.

Police said area people informed the local administration about some suspected activities near the railway track passing through Dera Murad Jamali, which links Balochistan with other parts of the country.
Security personnel, including police officials, immediately rushed to the site along with a bomb disposal squad and started searching the area during which an improvised explosive device was found planted near the railway track.
“The bomb disposal squad immediately defused the IED, weighing around 3.5kg,” Nasirabad SSP Ghulam Sarwar Bhio told Dawn, adding that initial investigation revealed it was a remote-controlled device.
He said the IED was planted to target Quetta-bound passenger train coming from Peshawar.
Just a day earlier, armed men opened fire on the train between Mach and Aab-i-Guam area of Kachhi district. However, the security personnel deployed on the train returned fire, forcing the attackers to escape the area.

The ECP had summoned the CM after he threatened the election staff during a political gathering in Havelian, Abbottabad, ahead of a by-election in Haripur (NA-18). CM Afridi was accused of threatening the staff since he had warned officials of consequences in case of rigging in the by-elections.
Arguing before a bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja, his lawyer, Ali Bokhari, said the CM had not threatened anyone, claiming it was within the CM’s right to admonish officers.
He said the CM had already been issued a notice by the district monitoring officer, asking whether the case could simultaneously be heard by two forums. Mr Bokhari said DMO had also asked them to submit a reply on 27th.
He also pointed out that the election was held in Haripur while the CM addressed the rally in the Abbottabad district. Summoning the CM over a political rally in a district where the by-election was not taking place would “open a new Pandora’s box”, he warned.
The lawyer questioned the ECP if it would summon the PM and the Pun­jab chief minister for similar actions, noting that the Punjab CM had anno­unced development projects worth Rs2.5 billion in Hassanabdal.
The CEC said action would be ta­­k­en “without discrimination” and cla­rified that if the prime minister had made such a speech before the election, he too would have been issued a notice. The ministers and candidates in other constituencies had also been summoned over code of conduct violations, he added. It may be noted that Talal Chaudhry was also issued a notice for code of conduct violations in the recent by-election.
Mr Bokhari pressed the commission to first decide on the maintainability of the case. The ECP directed the KP CM’s lawyer to submit a written reply at the next hearing, saying that an appropriate order on maintainability would be issued.
The commission granted Sohail Afridi an exemption from appearing at the next hearing and adjou­rned proceedings until December 4. Later, CM Afridi’s lawyer formally challenged the ECP’s jurisdiction.

In the proper course, a larger bench should hear the matter since the earlier decision was given by a seven-judge SC bench, Advocate Sameer Khosa argued before the FCC bench.
 
 

The bench, headed by Justice Aamer Farooq and comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, Justice Muh­a­m­mad Karim Khan Agha, Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Arsh­ad Huss­ain Shah, had taken up an intra-court appeal (ICA) seeking a declaration that the ordinance amending the Supr­eme Court (Prac­tice and Procedure) Act 2023 was ultra vires the Constitution.
Soon after the promulgation of the ordinance on Sept 20 last year, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa altered the composition of the three-judge committee under the Act by replacing Justice Munib Akhtar with Justice Aminuddin Khan, now chief justice of the FCC.
The committee filed in the Supreme Court under the now-omitted Article 184(3) of the Constitution. One of the petitioners, Gohar Ali Khan, argued that giving the CJP discretion to nominate any judge to the committee effectively ensured a majority aligned with the CJP.
He termed the ordinance a direct attack on judicial independence and an attempt by the executive to influence fixing of cases in the Supreme Court. He also said the ordinance violated Article 89 of the Constitution, adding that its timing, motivation and manner of issuance were questionable.
 
 

On Tuesday, after the hearing, Justice Aamer Farooq dictated an order issuing notices to the respondents, mainly the president and law ministry, noting that the petitioner had a right to appeal. He said the objections raised by the counsel would be considered when the main plea was heard.
Justice Farooq added that the issue was likely to recur because the Supreme Court Rules, which the FCC had adopted for the time being, state that an appeal should be heard by a larger bench. “We will interpret the points raised by the counsel since the matter may surface again.”
During the hearing, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi asked whether any express bar exists requiring that only a bench larger than the one that issued an earlier decision may hear an appeal against it.
Asked to assist, Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Aamir Rehman said Article 189 suggests that the FCC is now the superior court and, under Article 175E, all pending SC cases have shifted to the FCC. Therefore, it is for the FCC to determine its procedure and how to fix and hear cases.
He also cited instances where a three-judge SC bench heard appeals against decisions of seven-judge high court benches. But Sameer Khosa argued Section 5 of SC Practice and Procedure Act required a larger bench.
At this, Justice Agha said Section 5 was no longer in the field and the FCC would regulate bench strength.
Justice Farooq observed that a smaller bench could take up a matter and issue notices, but if a decision was to be set aside, a larger bench would be required.
Separately, in a case concerning the appointment of sitting LHC judges as election tribunals under Section 149 of the Elections Act 2017, Sameer Khosa said he had advised his clients, including Salman Akram Raja, to consider engaging other counsel because he had reservations about the FCC’s independence. He sought time for them to decide how to proceed.

Earlier today, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, claimed that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country. In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces. The military spokesperson rejected the allegations.
Asked in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ about whether Pakistan was denying carrying out any strikes or civilian casualties during the alleged strikes, the defence minister replied: “Both things are non-existent at this time. We do react and retaliate, but [targeting] civilians is not at all our manner. We have a disciplined force that has traditions and a code of conduct; we are not a ragtag group like the Taliban, who neither have a code of conduct nor religion nor traditions.”
“But you know, hope should always be present unless all limits are crossed. But today, we are completely writing them off and we have no good hope from them.”
A question about the Taliban’s stated intent to retaliate according to Islamic law irked the defence minister, who asked which Islamic law the Afghan Taliban follow that requires them to live in their neighbour’s home for decades and then spill blood.
“Is this some self-invented Shariah of their own? This is not the Shariah of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).”
When asked about the timing of any retaliation, Asif said Pakistan’s well-wishers, including Turkey, Iran and Qatar, were urging regional peace, arguing it would benefit everyone and create jobs for all, including Afghans.
He added that the Afghan Taliban were more than welcome to pursue and open up trade with India through whichever route they wanted, adding that Pakistan did not care for it.
“All these goods are ultimately sold in our market.”
Pushed for a response on the Taliban’s threat, the defence minister downplayed it as merely words and said it was meaningless to take them seriously or trust them. “There will be no greater idiocy than trusting them,” he added.
Asif maintained that Pakistan had pursued cordial relations, adding that he himself welcomed the Afghan Taliban after they retook Kabul and made frequent visits to Afghanistan, but “I don’t think we have gained any dividends, successes, or changes in their behaviour from these visits; there has been no change in their attitude.”
The defence minister reiterated that the Afghan Taliban were ultimately destroying their own country.
He expressed the belief that the situation would eventually escalate to a point where regional neighbours seeking peace would intervene..
“It won’t take long; otherwise, they will be isolated and their total isolation will ultimately result in a collapse,” he added.
Pak-Afghan relations
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.</p><small>2025-11-26 02:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/69266654659a6.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957428/pakistan-iran-look-to-align-on-major-fronts' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran look to align on major fronts</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Ali Ardeshir Lari­jani, secretary of Iran’s Supreme National Security Council, on Tues­day discussed ways to deepen economic cooperation, besides coordinating positions on regional and international developments, particularly the Gaza peace plan, in meetings with Pakistan’s civilian leadership.
The top Iranian security official, who began a two-day visit to Islamabad by holding talks with President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, is scheduled to meet Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir and National Security Adviser and ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik on Wednesday.
The visit is focused on reviewing bilateral ties, pursuing pending agreements and discussing regional developments, including those in the Muslim world.
After landing in Islamabad, Mr Larijani told reporters “changing conditions of the region necessitate enhanced cooperation across multiple fields”, while noting Pakistan’s “privileged position” in shaping regional security.

The trip comes as Iran expressed reservations about US President Donald Trump’s Gaza plan, now moving into its implementation phase after being adopted by the UN Security Council on Nov 17. The initiative includes an international stabilisation force for Gaza, a move Tehran fears could entrench foreign military involvement. Pakistan has supported the plan and is seen as a potential contributor to the force.
Though the various statements on the top security council official’s meetings by the Pakistani side didn’t say much on discussions about Gaza peace plan, the Iranian official in a post on X at the end of the day, conveyed greetings of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei to “honourable people of Pakistan” for supporting Iran during the 12-day war with Israel and said it showed the “firm and principled thinking of the Pakistani people”.
 






In what many saw a possible balance act, Mr Larijani in the same post on X said, “We extend our gratitude to the government, the parliament, and the armed forces of Pakistan.”
The PM Office said Shehbaz Sharif and Mr Larijani exchanged views on major regional and international developments and “stressed the importance of coordinated efforts to promote peace and stability.”
 






The premier expressed appreciation for Iran’s engagement, while the Iranian official thanked Pakistan for its role in advocating dialogue and diplomacy for peaceful settlement of disputes, possibly a reference to Islamabad’s role of a messenger between Tehran and Washington.
The two sides agreed that a delegation led by Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would soon visit Tehran to advance cooperation, particularly in agriculture and connectivity.
The Foreign Office said Mr Dar and Mr Larijani reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties and expanding cooperation on regional and international issues.
 






In comments to Iran’s state news agency IRNA, the deputy premier said he held “detailed and frank discussions” with Mr Larijani, adding he was “very pleased” with the visit. The security official told IRNA the talks covered economic progress, ways to expand cooperation, and regional and international developments.
During his call on President Zardari, cooperation in energy, commerce and railways were discussed.
 






 
 

The president underscored Pakistan’s desire to boost trade with Iran and pressed for strengthening the rail link to facilitate commerce and travel, especially for religious pilgrims. He emphasised the need for a “mutually workable solution” on the stalled Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline, citing Pakistan’s growing energy needs, and welcomed technical discussions held recently in Islamabad.
Mr Larijani said directives issued after the Iranian President Pezeshkian’s visit to Pakistan in August including for preferential access for Pakistani products had set the path toward achieving the $10 billion bilateral trade target.
Mr Larijani also met NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq at Parliament House, where they discussed parliamentary cooperation, regional security and opportunities for expanded economic engagement.
 






His trip follows a visit by Iranian parliament speaker Bagher Ghalibaf last month, marking the second senior Iranian delegation to Islamabad in weeks and underscoring intensified diplomatic activity between the neighbors amid shifting regional dynamics.
Iran and Pakistan share a long, often tense border where terrorist groups have carried out attacks on both sides, prompting growing security coordination. Tehran has also offered to mediate between Islamabad and Kabul as cross-border tensions are rising.

“Despite some improvement in the last two years, Pakistan has consistently struggled with weak budget credibility, which has generated several macro-critical governance weaknesses … there are a number of shortcomings in public investment management resulting in failure to protect funding for approved projects over the project life cycle and major project delays and cost increases in projects”, said the IMF in its Governance and Corruption Diagnosis Assessment (GCDA).
It demanded immediate steps, within three to six months, to enhance cash management by implementing the overarching sectorisation exercise to unify decision-making around TSA institutional coverage, while also improving analytical capabilities and adopting a forward-looking approach to cash forecasting.

Calls for immediate steps to combat corruption and inefficiencies

It said the situation was compounded by a weak TSA framework without a firm institutional coverage decision that undermined effective control over the government’s cash balances. “The current set-up in debt management involves multiple entities with overlapping roles and responsibilities, which complicates decision-making and coordination”, it said, elaborating that mechanisms for monitoring and accountability were weak, including in the management of financial and non-financial assets, and state-owned enterprises. “Institutions that use budgetary resources but are designed to operate outside of standard fiscal accountability constraints undermine other state institutions and increase corruption risks”, it said.
Moreover, fiscal and economic governance vulnerabilities reflect a persistent gap between formal policy and actual practice, creating space for the misuse of public authority for private gain. Parliamentary oversight of spending is weakened by substantial differences between approved budgets and actual expenditures. For example, the National Assembly approved Rs9.4 trillion in expenditure overruns in 2024-25, five times higher than the previous year.
On top of that, constituency development funds under the direct control of legislators further skew capital investments and complicate oversight. “Current arrangements for cash management, debt management, and the management of state financial and non-financial assets remain insufficient, providing officials with substantial discretion”.
The fund noted that a weak TSA framework without a firm institutional coverage decision undermined effective control over the government’s cash balances, leading to inefficiencies in the use of public funds and weakening overall budget authority. Without centralised oversight, fragmented cash holdings across various accounts can result in idle balances that are not optimally utilised for government priorities.
“Moreover, the lack of transparency raises concerns about potential foregone interest revenue for the federal budget. It remains unclear who benefits from the interest earned on accounts held by federal government entities in commercial banks, and whether such earnings are captured in the national budget”, said the IMF and emphasised that addressing these gaps was essential to strengthen fiscal discipline, reduce corruption vulnerabilities, and enhance the efficiency of public financial management.
It acknowledged that the MoF had set up the institutional framework for cash and debt management, but the implementation of the framework has been weak in practice. It said the legal changes over the years required a high-level Cash Coordination Committee (CCC) and a Cash Forecasting Unit (CFU) at the MoF to consolidate external commercial borrowing and domestic wholesale borrowing functions. The CFU was currently not operational as it was not staffed, and CCC met on an ad-hoc basis with long intervals rather than monthly as intended, and did not align with the principle that it should be systematically assessing cash forecasts and reviewing the cash buffer policy, constraining the effective borrowing programme.
Pointing to weak budget controls, the IMF said that several stages of the expenditure process were carried out manually and are not presently captured in the Financial Accounting and Budgeting System, presenting governance vulnerabilities in budget execution.

“One eye on the barrel of the gun and another on the sky,” a senior police officer in Bannu remarked.
For months, militants from the adjoining tribal areas launched multiple armed quadcopter sorties to try to attack police posts and police stations.
“Fifty attempts in one week,” Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed recalled.
Police in Bannu said they faced more than two hundred attacks, which employed commercially available, low-cost drones weaponised by militants to target them since June.
Changing tactics
Militants usually employ improvised munitions during quadcopter attacks. Weapons of choice are grenades used in Russian-origin under-barrel grenade launchers, such as the GP-25, and small calibre mortar rounds.

Unprepared for the deployment of quadcopters modified to drop improvised munitions on targets, the police started to deploy nets over their installations or simply installed a canopy overhead to obstruct the munitions ahead of impact.
“We had to position snipers on rooftops to shoot down any approaching object,” Bannu Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Sajjad Khan said.
In one instance, a drone chased a vehicle evacuating 11 policemen, one of them wounded, following an ambush in the city’s outskirts.
 
 

“It was hovering and chasing,” Ebaad Wazir, the second-in-command in the Bannu police, who was driving the vehicle, recalled. Militants filmed a video of the chase, and it went viral on social media.
The introduction of drone warfare by militants — the first time they have been employed against Pakistani forces — manifested a new phase and perhaps the most deadly transformation of the decades-long war that has claimed thousands of lives, both civilian and uniformed, and uprooted hundreds of thousands of others.
The quadcopters, equipped with thermal imaging, are used for surveillance and dropping munitions. Militants are also adapting to changing battlefield conditions and now routinely change the frequencies on which their drones operate to try and stay one step ahead of jammers employed by security forces.
Intelligence and police officials said such tactics and knowledge require training and can only come with expertise shared by seasoned terrorists.
“Tactics deployed in complex suicide bombings carry telltale signs of this as well.”
Officials also did not discount the presence of foreign terrorists in the region, and said they could have been a likely source of such expertise.
Losing ‘the edge’
For nearly two decades until August 2021, Islamabad and its forces had the edge in terms of weaponry and tactics, although for the police, it still was an almost equal fight; close-quarters combat while armed with AK-47 rifles.
All of that changed when the United States, exhausted by the seemingly unending war in Afghanistan after spending trillions of dollars, withdrew from the country and left behind $7.1 billion worth of military equipment and defence articles.
 
 

According to a November 2022 report by the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, among the abandoned weapons were more than 300,000 small arms — including M-4s, M-16s, M-24s and M-249s — and 48,000 pieces of specialised equipment such as night vision goggles, thermal imaging scopes, and radio surveillance equipment.

“The Americans left Afghanistan in a deliberate mess,” a Pakistani security official, posted at the time in Kabul as part of the tripartite commission, recalled.
It did not take long for celebrations in some circles in Pakistan to turn into nightmares. Not only did militants’ attacks increase manifold, but the lethality of their attacks also spiked.
The battlefield landscape changed dramatically. Armed with US weapons with night vision and thermal capabilities, snipers shot and killed elements of security forces from as far as 1,500 metres, while steel-core 5.56 millimetre ammunition could pierce through bulletproof vests and helmets.
“They were killing our men like sitting ducks,” a senior police officer said.

Even the military-issued G-3 rifles, chambered in the 7.62mm Nato calibre, fell short on range and efficacy compared with the US M-4s and M-16s.
“They had an edge over us,” the police officer added.
As casualties began to mount, with militants relishing targeting unsuspecting personnel with thermal imaging scopes and uploading the videos on the internet, policymakers began to figure out what to do next.
What followed, according to senior police officers, was a process of long deliberations, interviews, and debriefings with scores of their colleagues in uniform who survived night attacks, to understand militants’ tactics and weapons used in the assaults and “reshape our tactics”.
It was not long before realisation dawned: not only had militants improved their strategy and tactics, but they also had much better weaponry.
“We were very late in adopting new technology,” IG Hameed acknowledged.
His men were not only short on better weapons but also on trained manpower to use them. It was a race against time to procure weapons and assemble a team to use them.
Soviet-era Dragunov designated marksman rifles, trusted by many soldiers and still in use, were fitted with long-range thermal scopes for better accuracy.
‘Tipping the balance’
With help from the military, efforts to procure an assortment of weapons and equipment from the international market began immediately.
Billions of rupees were spent and many billions more are to be poured in by the end of the next financial year to purchase weapons and equipment to keep up with the rising behemoth of militancy.
The list of the systems purchased so far includes American M-16s, M-24 sniper rifles, M-249 machine guns, light sniper rifles (LSRs), thermal weapon sights (TWS), anti-drone guns, medium and long-range surveillance and assault drones and high frequency jammers to shield armoured vehicles from roadside bombings.

Personnel are also being trained in marksmanship and special operation teams (SOTs) are being formed at the divisional level. They would later be expanded to district levels and are being armed and equipped with the latest weaponry to respond to threats and defend positions.
Police and military officials say the availability of better weaponry is already having an impact on the battlefield.
“We are tipping the balance”, the IG said.
In Bannu, the police say they are now seeing fewer quadcopter attacks on their police stations, thanks to anti-drone guns. In the past month, five drone attacks were repulsed; one was shot down by a police sniper, while two others were made dysfunctional with anti-drone guns.

The number of drone and night attacks is declining in areas where militants realise state forces have night vision and anti-drone capabilities.
But as one senior police officer remarked, this was a long haul, a battle of nerves, resources and strategy.
“We may be killing them, but are we killing the problem?”

In a written reply submitted to the court, the superintendent said the PTI founder is under strict surveillance and has no access to any prohibited device, “particularly mobile phones”.
He said mobile signal jammers have been installed inside the jail and in surrounding areas, making the use of mobile phones or internet facilities “impossible for any inmate”.
He added that Mr Khan is barred under jail rules from engaging in political discussions, though some visitors allegedly violate these restrictions by initiating political conversations during meetings.
The superintendent also recalled that political instructions attributed to the former premier had previously contributed to social unrest, but insisted that no such communication is now possible as Mr Khan lacks access to any mobile or internet-enabled device.
The superintendent stressed that the X account associated with the PTI founder “is not being operated from the jail” and that its activity “is clearly being managed from outside”.
He said the prisoner receives only routine facilities allowed under jail rules or ordered by the court, none of which include any digital or online communication privileges.
The statement came in response to a petition filed by a citizen, Ghulam Murtaza, through Barrister Zafarullah, alleging that Mr Khan is issuing “illegal and provocative messages” from his X account despite being incarcerated.
Bail extended
Meanwhile, a district and sessions court in Islamabad extended the pre-arrest bail of Mr Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, until Dec 23 in multiple cases, including those related to the May 9 violent protests. The court also stayed their arrest in the various cases.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka presided over the hearing. Due to the PTI founder’s unavailability, arguments on his bail applications could not be presented. The judge directed that he be produced either in person or via video link at the next hearing.
The proceedings were adjourned until Dec 23.

During a meeting of the Senate’s standing committee on interior, Senators Aslam Abro, Saifullah Abro and Naseema Ehsan complained that they had been receiving life threats but none of them had been provided security.
Senator Shahadat Awan, who chaired the meeting, directed that until the provincial threat assessment committees take up the matter, IG Islamabad, IG Sindh, and IG Balochistan must provide security to the three senators. 
Senator Saifullah Abro questioned the integrity of certain FIA officials, noting that an FIA officer had made billions of rupees property in a single year.
Members suggested formation of a sub-committee for identification of those involved, but the chairman of the committee said there was no need for a sub-committee at this stage and directed that the investigation report against the responsible FIA officers be completed at the earliest and submitted to the committee. 
The committee was also given a compliance report from Additional IG Sindh and representatives of IG Balochistan regarding arrest of the accused involved in the murder of Senator Muhammad Aslam Abro’s brother and nephew.
The Additional IG of Sindh informed the house that police teams are currently in Quetta pursuing the suspects; property confiscation proceedings have begun; the identity cards of the accused have been blocked; and the bank accounts of the accused have been frozen. 
He said that call data records of only two suspects have been traced.

Party stalwart and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser told Dawn he was hopeful that the white paper would be released next month, as different teams would be working on it and all the findings would be compiled.
He alleged that the recent rigging in the by-elections, especially in Haripur, once again proved that the incumbent government had failed and become unpopular.
“The white paper will cover all issues, including economic conditions, corruption, election rigging, law and order situation, etc,” Qaiser said. “Moreover, we will also give the comparison of the performance of the incumbent government with the tenure of PTI.”
Replying to a question, Qaiser said that the legal team headed by PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja will look into issues related to law, election rigging and legislation passed by the government as part of the white paper.
“It is a fact that the incumbent government has passed a number of bills and has done legislation, but not a single legislation was done to address the issues of the masses,” he added.
 
 

Regarding the section of the white paper dealing with economic downturn and corruption, Qaiser said that party leaders, including Taimur Khan Jhagra, Muhammad Zubair and Muzzammil Aslam, would work on it.
“Similarly, other teams will work on different issues and in the end all will be compiled in the white paper, which will be released next month,” he said.
While talking to media persons earlier, Raja also announced that the white paper would be released, but said that “the law will also be followed”.
He said that during the hearing in the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), Ali Bukhari demanded that all party members should receive the same treatment, as leaders from Punjab travelled to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and made statements, but the ECP did not take the issue up seriously.
“The KP chief minister has directed that the bureaucracy must implement the law and there should not be rigging,” Raja said. “It is the duty of the CM to ensure that the laws are implemented and followed.”
KP CM Sohail Afridi said that he has informed the ECP that, in case of rigging, legal action would be taken against the officials.
“In Haripur, presiding officers were KP government servants, but the returning officer was from the ECP and his office employees were from the federal government, so they issued Form 45 despite ‘pressure’,” he said.
Replying to a question, the CM said that the PTI would continue criticising policies that violate the law and claimed that Form 45 has signatures of polling agents from both sides, but the tickers shared from the RO office were different.
CM Afridi also said that the federal government should pay Rs3 trillion to the KP government so that development work could get started.
“The movement for the release of Imran Khan is ongoing and will continue,” he added.</p><small>2025-11-25 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/252317532dad8dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957316/barrick-committed-to-reko-diq-copper-project-says-interim-ceo' target='_blank'><strong>Barrick committed to Reko Diq copper project, says interim CEO</strong></a><br><p>Barrick Mining Corp remains committed to its Reko Diq copper mine in Pakistan, one of the world’s largest undeveloped deposits of the metal, its interim CEO said on Tuesday after reports of a possible withdrawal.
The $7 billion project in Balochistan is held in an equal partnership between the company and the government and is expected to start production by the end of 2028.
Barrick’s board had raised the possibility of splitting the company’s assets, which could include an outright sale of the Reko Diq mine and the company’s African assets, Reuters reported this month, citing sources familiar with the company’s thinking.
“Barrick remains committed to the Reko Diq project and to Pakistan,” Mark Hill told Reuters.
Security, scale, stake
Balochistan suffers frequent attacks by terrorists, making security a major concern for the mine. The project also requires a railway line upgrade to transport copper concentrate to Karachi for processing abroad.
Lenders, including the International Finance Corporation and the Asian Development Bank, among others, are assembling a financing package exceeding $2.6bn.
The Reko Diq project added 13 million ounces to Barrick’s gold reserves in 2024 and is expected to produce 200,000 metric tonnes of copper a year in its first phase, doubling after expansion, with projected free cash flow of more than $70bn over 37 years.
Pakistan’s mineral play
The remarks from Barrick underscore Reko Diq’s importance to both Pakistan and the company, with Islamabad counting on the mine to anchor its minerals strategy while the Canadian miner advances one of its largest long-term projects.
Sources familiar with the company’s thinking told Reuters this month that board members and some shareholders worry that exposure to riskier assets in Pakistan and Africa may be weighing on Barrick’s valuation compared with its safer North American operations, particularly in the context of any potential takeover interest.
Barrick returned to Pakistan in 2022 after a years-long legal dispute was settled, and the mine has since become a flagship investment for the country as it seeks to draw more capital into its minerals sector.</p><small>2025-11-25 18:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635546-no-hopes-from-ragtag-taliban-regime-anymore-says-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>'No hopes' from ragtag Taliban regime anymore, says defence minister</strong></a><br><p>

Devout Hindus believe that Ram was born in Ayodhya around 7,000 years ago, but that during the rule of the Mughal Empire, the Babri Masjid mosque was built on top of his birthplace in the 16th century. Thousands of Hindu activists, led by politicians of the Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), demolished the mosque in 1992. The Ram Temple was built at the site of the destroyed mosque and was inaugurated last January.
The FO condemned the flag hoisting at the site and stated that judicial processes allowing the construction of the temple over the mosque “speak volumes about the Indian state’s discriminatory approach towards minorities”.
“This reflected a broader pattern of pressure on religious minorities in India and deliberate attempts at eroding Muslim cultural and religious heritage under the influence of majoritarian Hindutva ideology,” the statement added.

The FO warned that other historic mosques in India face similar threats of desecration or demolition, while Indian Muslims continue to experience growing social, economic and political marginalisation under the majoritarian BJP.
It called on the international community to acknowledge rising Islamophobia, hate speech, and hate crimes in India and urged the United Nations to play a role in safeguarding Islamic heritage and minorities’ religious and cultural rights.
Pakistan also urged the BJP government to “uphold its responsibilities by ensuring the security of all religious communities, including Muslims, and by protecting their places of worship in accordance with international human rights obligations”.</p><small>2025-11-25 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251752178f03fbd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957292/australian-govt-app-allows-visa-applicants-to-submit-passport-biometric-details-on-phone' target='_blank'><strong>Australian govt app allows visa applicants to submit passport, biometric details on phone</strong></a><br><p>The Australian government on Tuesday announced that visa applicants can apply through the Australian Immi App, which allows them to directly submit facial biometric and passport information through their phone.
In a post on X, Australian High Commissioner to Pakistan Tim Kane wrote that applying for a visa from Pakistan “just got easier”, attaching a link to the Australian Department of Home Affairs website.
 






The website states that the Immi App, available on both Android and iOS, is available for eligible applicants to provide their passport details and a facial image.​
“To provide your identity information using the Australian Immi App, you need to have a Requirement to provide personal identifiers (biometrics) letter with a Visa Lodgement Number (VLN) commencing with AUI or AUH [and a] valid passport,” the Australian home department said.
It added that the applicant’s mobile device requires location access and near-field communication to be enabled, with permission for the Immi App to use the phone’s camera.
A five-step guide was also shared on how to perform the biometric identity check.
“The Australian Immi App will send your passport details and facial images to the Department of Home Affairs,” the website stated, adding that unless there is an error, the applicant’s account should be updated within 24 hours.</p><small>2025-11-25 16:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635540-pakistan-warns-world-of-escalating-islamophobia-heritage-desecration-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan warns world of escalating Islamophobia, heritage desecration in India</strong></a><br><p>

The large majority of Gaza’s two million people were forced from their homes during Israel’s two-year ground and air onslaught in the small, crowded enclave triggered by Hamas’ October 2023 attack, with many now living in tents and other basic shelters.
A ceasefire has broadly held since mid-October, but the conflict demolished much of heavily built-up Gaza, including basic infrastructure, leaving grim living conditions for most people.
“This suffering, this rain — and the low-pressure weather systems haven’t even started yet. It’s only the beginning of winter, and we’re already flooded and humiliated,” Um Ahmed Aowdah said outside her tent as rain pelted down on Tuesday. “We haven’t received new tents or tarps. Our tarp is two years old and our tent is two years old — they’re completely worn out.”

Amjad Al-Shawa, head of the Palestinian NGOs Network, said there was an urgent need for at least 300,000 new tents to house the roughly 1.5m people still displaced from their homes.
The Palestinian Civil Defence Service said thousands of tents housing displaced families had been inundated by rainwater or damaged by torrential rainstorms over the past week.
Some tents were completely washed away as floodwaters rose 40 to 50 centimetres above ground level in some areas of the coastal enclave, while a field hospital had to suspend operations due to flooding, medics and witnesses said.

The United Nations said on Monday that while it was working to bring winter supplies into Gaza, the number of trucks able to enter the enclave was limited by Israeli curbs on aid groups.
Gaza authorities say Israel is not letting in as much aid as was promised under the ceasefire deal. Aid agencies say Israel is preventing many essential items from entering.

Israel says it is complying fully with obligations under the truce deal and does not stop any aid from entering Gaza, and that aid agencies have been inefficient in distributing it or have failed to prevent theft by Hamas. Hamas has denied stealing aid.</p><small>2025-11-25 16:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251948551a0f23b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957302/ali-tareen-bows-out-as-multan-sultans-owner-after-franchise-denied-renewal' target='_blank'><strong>Ali Tareen bows out as Multan Sultans owner after franchise denied renewal</strong></a><br><p>Ali Khan Tareen bowed out as owner of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Multan Sultans on Tuesday after the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) did not extend him a renewal offer.
The development comes as all five remaining franchises have renewed their agreements with the league for the next 10 years over the past two days, with Islamabad United and Karachi Kings being the latest to do so.
Tareen announced his departure in a note posted on X, describing the decision as a difficult but unavoidable conclusion to an increasingly strained relationship with the PCB.
“Despite the financial losses year after year, I never once thought about walking away,” he wrote. “The Sultans have always meant more to me than just numbers. And I have always been willing to go as far as needed to protect it.”
Acknowledging that his forthright views had not always been well received, Tareen said he had “always spoken his mind”, even when it put him at odds with the league’s management.
“I never learned how to play it safe or just play along,” he said. “And if staying means compromising those principles there is only one choice I can make. I would rather lose this team while standing on my feet than run it from my knees. So, this is goodbye.”
Tensions between the PCB and Tareen had escalated earlier this year after he publicly questioned the board’s commitment to strengthening the PSL amid increasing competition from T20 leagues worldwide. He had argued that the PSL leadership was not taking sufficient steps to protect the league’s standing as a leading T20 brand.
The dispute worsened after the PCB issued Tareen a legal notice for what it termed a “breach of contractual obligations”, prompting him to respond with further criticism. The resulting standoff eventually evolved into a complete breakdown in relations.
Tareen had maintained in recent weeks that he had not been approached regarding a renewal. His claim was borne out on Tuesday as the PCB moved ahead with franchise extensions for all other teams, leaving Multan the only side not offered continued ownership under its existing holder.
With his departure, Multan Sultans enter a period of uncertainty over their future ownership, even as the franchise remains one of the PSL’s most consistent performers on the field.</p><small>2025-11-25 16:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25210412ca4335f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957306/pm-shehbaz-to-visit-bahrain-from-nov-26-27-to-deepen-bilateral-linkages-fo' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz to visit Bahrain from Nov 26–27 to deepen bilateral linkages: FO</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will visit Bahrain from November 26-67 in a visit aimed at deepening linkages with the gulf country, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Tuesday.
In a press release issued today, the FO said: “The visit is expected to reinforce the traditionally warm and cordial ties, identify new avenues of partnership, and deepen people-to-people linkages, contributing to mutually beneficial cooperation.
“This official visit underscores Pakistan’s continued engagement with the Kingdom of Bahrain, aimed at fostering a results-oriented and strategic partnership between the two countries.”
It added the visit reaffirmed the “longstanding and multifaceted relationship” between the two countries.
 






The FO said PM Shehbaz will hold high-level engagements with Bahrain’s leadership to further enhance bilateral cooperation in the areas of trade, investment, energy, technology, education, and culture.
He will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, federal ministers and senior officers.
The two countries in September had agreed to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics and immigration.
The agreement was reached during a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and his Bahraini counterpart, General Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa.
The two sides had also agreed to establish a Joint Working Group to enhance collaboration across multiple sectors, including counter-narcotics, counter-terrorism, coast guard operations, border security, immigration and police training.
They also decided to sign Mem­oranda of Understanding covering extradition, mutual legal assistance, and specialised battalion training.

“The system is equipped with state-of-the-art guidance and advanced manoeuvrability features,” the ISPR said in a statement.
“The flight test was witnessed by Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Chief of the Naval Staff, senior scientists and engineers.”
The ISPR deemed the successful test launch “a testimony to Pakistan’s technological prowess and Pakistan Navy’s unwavering commitment to safeguard national interests”.

On September 30 this year, the Pakistan Army successfully conducted a training launch of a newly inducted, indigenously-produced Fatah-4 cruise missile at a range of 750 kilometres, the military’s media wing said.

US and Ukrainian officials are trying to narrow the gaps between them over a peace plan, with core issues still unresolved and Ukraine wary of being strong-armed into accepting a deal largely on the Kremlin’s terms.
“Late Monday and throughout Tuesday, Secretary Driscoll and team have been in discussions with the Russian delegation to achieve a lasting peace in Ukraine. The talks are going well and we remain optimistic. Secretary Driscoll is closely synchronised with the White House … as these talks progress,” said US Army Lieutenant Colonel Jeff Tolbert, a spokesperson for Driscoll.
The exact nature of the discussions was not immediately clear, and it was not known who was in the Russian delegation. A US official said that Driscoll, who has emerged as a point man for US diplomatic efforts on Ukraine, was also expected to meet Ukrainian officials while in Abu Dhabi.
Underlining the high stakes for Ukraine, its capital Kyiv was hit by a barrage of missiles and hundreds of drones overnight in a Russian strike that killed at least six people and disrupted power and heating systems. Residents were sheltering underground, wearing winter jackets, some in tents.
Will discuss sensitive issues with Trump: Zelensky
US policy towards the war has zigzagged in recent months.
A hastily arranged summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska in August raised worries in Kyiv and European capitals that the Trump administration might accept many Russian demands, though it ultimately resulted in more US pressure on Russia.
The latest US peace proposal, a 28-point plan that emerged last week, caught many in the US government, Kyiv and Europe off guard and prompted fresh concerns that the Trump administration might be willing to push Ukraine to sign a peace deal heavily tilted toward Moscow.
The plan would require Kyiv to cede more territory, accept curbs on its military and bar it from ever joining Nato — conditions Kyiv has long rejected as tantamount to surrender.
The sudden push raises the pressure on Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is now at his most vulnerable since the start of the war after a corruption scandal saw two of his ministers dismissed, and as Russia makes battlefield gains.
Zelensky could struggle to get Ukrainians to swallow a deal viewed as selling out their interests.
He said on Monday the latest peace plan incorporated “correct” points after talks over the weekend in Geneva.
“The sensitive issues, the most delicate points, I will discuss with President Trump,” Zelensky said in his nightly video address.
Zelensky, who could visit the US in the next few days, said the process of producing a final document would be difficult. Russia’s unrelenting attacks on Ukraine have left many sceptical about how peace can be achieved soon.
“There was a very loud explosion, our windows were falling apart, we got dressed and ran out,” said Nadiia Horodko, a 39-year-old accountant, after a residential building was struck in Kyiv overnight.
“There was horror, everything was already burning here, and a woman was screaming from the eighth floor, ‘Save the child, the child is on fire!’”
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said an amended peace plan must reflect the “spirit and letter” of an understanding reached between Putin and Trump at their Alaska summit.
Macron warns against European capitulation
A group of countries supporting Ukraine, which is known as the coalition of the willing and includes Britain and France, was set to hold a virtual meeting on Tuesday.
“It’s an initiative that goes in the right direction: peace. However, there are aspects of that plan that deserve to be discussed, negotiated, improved,” French President Emmanuel Macron told RTL radio regarding the US-proposed plan. “We want peace, but we don’t want a peace that would be a capitulation.”
He added that only the Ukrainians could decide what territorial concessions they are ready to make.
“What was put on the table gives us an idea of what would be acceptable for the Russians. Does that mean that it is what must be accepted by the Ukrainians and the Europeans? The answer is no,” Macron added.
In a separate development, Romania scrambled fighter jets to track drones that breached its territory near the border with Ukraine early on Tuesday, and one was still advancing deeper into the Nato-member country, the defence ministry said.
Tensions have risen along Europe’s eastern flank in recent months after suspected Russian drones breached the airspace of several Nato states.</p><small>2025-11-25 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635525-pakistan-conducts-successful-test-of-ship-launched-ballistic-missile' target='_blank'><strong>Navy conducts successful test of ship-launched ballistic missile</strong></a><br><p>

During the meeting, the army chief commended General Mirza for his “exemplary leadership, strategic foresight, and dedicated service to the Pakistan Armed Forces”, according to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
“He (COAS) lauded the CJCSC’s pivotal role in enhancing tri-services synergy, strengthening joint operational preparedness, and advancing Pakistan’s national security objectives at the strategic level,” ISPR said.
Furthermore, Field Marshal Munir also highlighted General Mirza’s contributions towards regional stability, military diplomacy, and the strengthening of Pakistan’s partnerships with friendly countries, as per ISPR’s statement.
“General [Mirza] expressed gratitude to the COAS and the armed forces for the support extended during his career,” the statement said. “Upon arrival at GHQ, the CJCSC laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and was presented a guard of honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army.”

CJCSC meets air chief
Separately, General Mirza also visited Air Headquarters in Islamabad where he was received by Pakistan Air Force Chief of the Air Staff Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, ISPR said.
“[The air chief] commended the CJCSC’s exemplary services and his pivotal role in strengthening tri-services synergy,” according to ISPR’s statement. “He appreciated [General Mirza’s] significant contributions towards national defence and reaffirmed PAF’s unwavering resolve to continue working closely with sister services to eradicate the menace of terrorism.”
Furthermore, the statement added that the CJCSC expressed his satisfaction over the combat readiness of air force and the progress achieved through its modernisation and upgradation initiatives.
“He lauded the professionalism and dedication of PAF personnel in safeguarding Pakistan’s aerial frontiers and acknowledged the vital role of the Service in the national fight against terrorism. He also appreciated the seamless coordination among the tri-services and expressed confidence that this cooperation would continue to flourish in the years ahead,” it said.

Abolishment of CJCSC office
Earlier this month, the national security establishment was restructured through Amendment in Article 243 of the Constitution and the subsequent changes in the legislations governing Army, Air Force and Navy.
The legislation also abolished the office of CJCSC, the tri-service post designed to maintain institutional balance and coordination within the armed forces.
The dissolution of the chairman’s office, effective November 27, would formally end nearly five decades of joint-service representation in armed forces decision-making at least during war time.</p><small>2025-11-25 14:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/251647470436aea.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957296/fazl-objects-to-legislations-enacted-to-combat-child-marriages-and-domestic-violence-protect-transgender-people' target='_blank'><strong>Fazl objects to legislations enacted to combat child marriages and domestic violence, protect transgender people</strong></a><br><p>Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday strongly objected to recent legislations aimed at reducing domestic violence, protecting children from child marriages, and safeguarding transgender community’s rights.
On November 13, the National Assembly also passed a bill — awaiting the Senate’s approval — to protect people against domestic violence in Islamabad. A day later, the Balochistan Assembly adopted a bill to ban child marriages with a majority, amidst a protest by opposition lawmakers, including JUI-F’s Younis Zehri.
In September, the Balochistan cabinet approved the province’s first-ever transgender policy to ensure the community’s social and economic inclusion.
Addressing the media in Islamabad today, the JUI-F chief said, “Some legislation has been enacted regarding the marriage of children below the age of 18 years, regarding transgenders, and regarding domestic violence.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

The Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill 2025 aims to establish an effective system of protection, relief and rehabilitation of women, men, transgender persons, children and any vulnerable person against domestic violence. It provides jail terms ranging from six months to three years, and a fine of up to Rs100,000, if the offence does not fall under the Pakistan Penal Code.
Speaking about child marriages, Fazl took exception to terming those under 18 as “na-baaligh” (minors), asking which sect’s Islamic laws stated as such.
“Strengthening the law to the point that if a marriage or nikkah is done before 18, it will be called sexual abuse and will be interpreted as rape, and a punishment will be given accordingly,” he said.
Pakistan is home to over 19 million child brides, with nearly 1 in 6 young women married before the age of 18, according to the United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (Unicef).
 
 

While Sindh and the Islamabad Capital Territory already enforce 18 as the minimum marriage age for girls, the Punjab government is also set to introduce the Child Marriage Restraint Act to set the same threshold.
During his media talk, the JUI-F chief also criticised the Protection of Women Bill 2006, which had been introduced amid opposition from religious parties during Gen Pervez Musharraf’s dictatorship, to amend widely criticised Hudood laws.
He pointedly said the PPP had voted in favour of that bill, and “today as well, hindrances were being created in the way of permitted nikkah”. The PPP is in power in Balochistan, where the recent anti-child marriage bill and the transgender policy were introduced.
Fazl went on to term it a “weird point” and a “joke” that, although child marriages would be considered as rape, a child born out of it would be legitimate. “And the father will be bound to pay for its expenses,” he added.
It is unclear whether any of the recent legislation specified this. However, in March, the Lahore High Court ruled that a biological father was under an obligation to maintain his child even if born as a consequence of rape.
On the legislation pertaining to the transgender community, Fazl sought the “justification” for individuals born as a “complete male or a complete female” being allowed to change their gender.
“Perhaps, they do not even have as much freedom there in the West as we have given them here in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he claimed.
The JUI-F chief said he did not “expect” such decisions from the government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his PML-N.
He alleged that the new laws were being passed on an “agenda” of the United Nations. He described laws and conventions enacted by international rights bodies as “slavery”.
Fazl objects to ‘lifetime perks’ under 27th Amendment
During his media briefing, Fazl also “completely rejected” the recently enacted 27th Amendment, which had been assailed by other opposition parties as well.
While praising the armed forces’ performance and courage during the May conflict with India, Fazl objected to the “lifetime perks” given to top military officers.
“These are perhaps such unique perks that Pakistan’s democratic society does not require them at all,” the senior politician said.
 
 

He urged President Asif Ali Zardari and the three services chiefs to reject the lifetime immunity offered under the 27th Amendment themselves.
Fazl expressed his reservations about the PPP “playing a role in the backslide of democracy instead of raising the slogan of democracy”, as it could not block the changes that were earlier opposed during the 26th Amendment.
The JUI-F chief said the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and the Supreme Court Shariat Appellate Bench’s jurisdictions were not kept in mind when drafting the 27th Amendment. He contended that appeals against FSC decisions would be marred by confusion about whether the SC would hear them or the Federal Constitutional Court.

Investi­gators and intelligence agencies are hunting for facilitators and support networks behind the attack, which saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage.
Questioned about the progress of the investigation and whether any evidence had come to the fore about the assailants being Afghan citizens, IG Hameed said: “We are saying this because, based on the evidence so far, when someone does not have a citizenship record, they are assumed to be Afghan or something similar.”
He confirmed that authorities had identified the location where the terrorists spent the night before attacking the FC Headquarters. However, he added that no facilitators had been arrested so far.
IG Hameed added that the CCTV footage showing their arrival was obtained and the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) was working to verify their identities.
The KP police chief elaborated that the authorities were also determining the route the terrorists used to enter Peshawar.
 


He further said that the terrorists’ motorcycle was seized and fingerprints taken from the vehicle were now part of the ongoing forensic investigation.
IG Hameed highlighted that recent measures taken by the KP Police had significantly reduced terrorist incidents, and the provincial police force was being equipped with weapons, modern technology, including anti-drone systems, and bulletproof jackets and vehicles for officials and police stations.
He praised the bravery of the KP Police, noting that despite operating in a stressful environment, the force continued to make sacrifices for peace in the region.</p><small>2025-11-25 13:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635486-cjcsc-gen-sahir-pays-farewell-to-munir' target='_blank'><strong>CJCSC Gen Sahir pays farewell to Field Marshal Munir: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

The statement by the head of the military’s media wing came hours after the Afghan Taliban spokesperson accused Pakistan of attacks in Khost, Kunar and Paktika provinces.
According to state broadcaster Pakistan TV, the military spokesperson refuted the claims of conducting strikes inside Afghanistan. “Pakistan Army has not attacked civilians inside Afghanistan,” it quoted him as saying.
 






“Whenever Pakistan attacks someone, it announces it,” he said, according to local media.
“In our view, there are no good and bad Taliban,” he said, adding that there was “no distinction” between terrorists.
“The Taliban government should make decisions as a state, not as non-state actors,” said Gen Chaudhry. He also wondered how long the current set-up in Afghanistan would remain an interim one.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in Istanbul. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Turkiye’s and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.
Gen Faiz court martial proceedings
The military spokesperson also addressed the court martial proceedings against former intelligence chief Gen (r) Faiz Hameed. “The trial is a legal matter; there should be no speculation about it. There will be an immediate announcement when the matter reaches its final conclusion.”
Gen Hameed has been in custody since August 2024 and the military annou­nced the initiation of court martial proceedings on Aug 12, 2024, on the charges of violating the Army Act and misconduct filed by the owner of a private housing society.
The army said in December 2024 that he was indicted by a military court on three counts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority.
The case against Gen Hameed was made following a Supreme Court ruling in November 2023, which directed petitioner Moeez Ahmed Khan, owner of Islamabad’s Top City housing society, to pursue grievances thro­ugh appropriate channels, including the Ministry of Defence.
Khan had alleged that a May 12, 2017, raid on his property by Pakistan Rangers and Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) officials resulted in the seizure of valuables, including gold, diamonds, and cash, under the pretext of a counter-terrorism operation. This is one of the most high-profile court martial cases in Pakistan Army’s history, as Gen Hameed is the second three-star general and the first former ISI chief to face such proceedings.
Under military laws, an indictment follows a court of inquiry and a summary of evidence, which form the basis for framing cha­rges. Following his indictment, Gen Hameed will be allowed to hire legal representation.

The attack killed 12 people and injured 35 others, with the government saying days later that it had arrested four terrorists belonging to the TTP.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Tarar detailed the correspondence between these four facilitators and TTP commanders in Afghanistan. Displaying their pictures, Tarar identified them as the suicide bomber’s handler Sajidullah alias Sheena, Kamran Khan, Muhammad Zali and Shah Munir.
The minister said Mehsud “planned this attack through his commander Daadullah”, whom Sajidullah met in 2023, 2024 and in August 2025 as well. He added that Daadullah and Sajidullah “remained in touch through an app”.
 


Tarar identified Daadullah as a resident of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur, adding that he was currently in Afghanistan.
He also played a video statement of the man he identified as Sajidullah, who the minister said arranged the suicide jacket and brought the bomber, Usman Shinwari, to the site of the attack.
“He was planning this incident in collaboration with Noor Wali Mehsud’s commander Daadullah. Their target was to carry out such an act in either Rawalpindi or Islamabad,” Tarar said, highlighting that the country evaded a “major loss”.
The minister said Sajidullah joined the TTP in 2015 and received training in various TTP camps across Afghanistan. He also visited the neighbouring country’s Jalalabad city in 2024.
During his 2024 visit, Sajidullah met Daadullah to “plan this suicide bombing and hired two more people upon his return”, who were Zali and Khan.
Then, in August 2025, Sajidullah and Zali visited Afghanistan together, Tarar said. According to the minister, they first met TTP militant Abdullah Jan alias Abu Hamza in Shigal district, where they stayed overnight, then met Daadullah in Kabul’s Arzan Qimat neighbourhood.
“Daadullah conveyed the orders of Noor Wali Mehsud to them, that they have to carry out a suicide bombing in the areas of Rawalpindi, Islamabad,” Tarar said.
“Once back in Pakistan, Sajidullah met with Shinwari, the suicide bomber,” who Tarar said was a resident of Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province.
 
 

Detailing the correspondence between Sajidullah and Shinwari, the information minister said they scouted multiple locations but “failed to reach their target” due to security.
“There is no doubt in the fact that all of this was orchestrated from Afghanistan. Daadullah is present in Afghanistan, [and] the main perpetrator, named Sajidullah, was also trained in Afghanistan.”
Tarar further said that the bomber was also a resident of Afghanistan.
After playing Sajidullah’s video statement, Tarar asserted, “This is very clear-cut evidence that the TTA (Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan) and the TTP jointly did this.”
The minister said the four men arrested had “some role in some capacity in the suicide bombing”. He noted that the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) and the Intelligence Bureau (ID) had arrested them within 48 hours of the incident during a joint operation.
He said a “huge racket” had been uncovered through the arrests of these four terrorists, terming it a huge success for the CTD and the IB.
The PML-N leader affirmed that security and law enforcement agencies, along with the armed forces, were fully active to eliminate terrorism.
Alleged terrorist details facilitating attack
In the video statement played during the press conference, the man identified as Sajidullah said he went to Afghanistan in 2016, met Abu Hamza and returned to Pakistan after receiving training for a month.
Sajidullah said he met with Abu Hamza during his 2023 visit to Kunar, and then days later, went to Daadullah’s hideout, who “brainwashed and forced me to take an oath of allegiance”.
“Six months ago, Daadullah contacted us and told us to come to Afghanistan and told me to bring my friend along as well,“he said, adding that subsequently, he and Zali headed to Jalalabad.
They met with Daadullah at his residence, where the TTP commander tasked them with transporting the suicide jacket provided by him to the bomber, according to Sajidullah’s account.
“We came to Peshawar and went to Akhun Baba Graveyard,” Sajidullah said, adding that he picked the jacket from there and entrusted it to Munir to “keep it safe”.
 
 

A few days later, Sajidullah continued, he was informed that a man from Afghanistan named Usman would contact him. “He stayed with me for one to two days. I said he was a guest when my family members asked about him,” Sajidullah said, adding that he later had Munir provide shelter to Usman.
However, Munir also said he could not leave Usman alone with his children, and therefore, Munir’s “cousin” Zali rented a room from a man named Muhammad Ali, Sajidullah added.
He further said he told the suicide bomber to arrange his accommodation on his own after 15 to 25 days had passed. Then, on November 11, the day of the blast, Sajidullah said he picked up the jacket from Munir, and both of them, along with Zali, “made [Usman] wear the jacket”.</p><small>2025-11-25 12:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635428-islamabad-suicide-attack-plotted-by-ttp-chief-in-afghanistan-info-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad suicide attack plotted by TTP chief in Afghanistan: info minister</strong></a><br><p>
