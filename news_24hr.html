Basant is returning to Lahore after 18 years, following the passage of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025 by the provincial assembly on December 24.
So far, only the Lahore deputy commissioner has notified the three-day festival starting on February 6, 2026, while deputy commissioners in other districts were expected to follow suit.
However, the 46th Cabinet Committee on Law and Order — chaired by Khawaja Salman Rafique — met at the Punjab Home Department today and noted that Basant would be celebrated only in Lahore and on a limited scale.
Though there was no need for all divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners to be present at the meeting, sources in the Home Department told Dawn that they were specially invited to attend via video link, particularly for the “Basant agenda”.
Punjab Home Secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi told the cabinet committee meeting, “The provincial cabinet had allowed limited Basant on February 6, 7 and 8 in Lahore only,” adding that kite-flying would remain completely banned elsewhere in the province under the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Bill, 2025.
A divisional commissioner, on the condition of anonymity, told Dawn that an official informed the meeting that Basant would not be allowed across the district.
The Home Department had held several meetings on the revival of Basant and discussed permitting the festival at specific locations or at specially notified rooftops, both in the Walled City and elsewhere in the district.
The department had also instructed all divisional commissioners and deputy commissioners to begin registering twine and kite manufacturers ahead of Basant.
Meanwhile, the divisional commissioner said the government was piloting Basant in Lahore, calling it an opportunity for citizens to demonstrate responsibility and adherence to instructions, a move that could lead to the festival’s revival on a larger scale.
“People should watch their neighbourhoods and ensure that no illegality is committed and that no one is injured … in the best interest of the Basant festival,” he said.
Expressing apprehension, the commissioner noted that any serious accident during the festival could lead to Basant being banned for good.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed buses and rickshaws on city roads to offer free rides and minimise the use of motorcycles in Lahore. The government may employ buses from city colleges and universities during the three-day festival.
Eventually, the Home Department wrote to all commissioners, deputy commissioners, and senior police officers in the province regarding incidents of kite flying and injuries caused by stray kite twines on Wednesday, seeking action against those involved in the activity in violation of the Punjab Regulation of Kite Flying Ordinance, 2025.
The home department has expressed concern in the letter about illegal kite flying observed in certain parts of the province. It stated that incidents were being reported in which passersby had been injured.
In the letter, the department said, “such practices pose a serious threat to human life and public safety,” adding that action could be taken against violators, including the arrest of kite fliers and the manufacturers and suppliers of kite flying material, in accordance with the law.
The meeting also instructed authorities to adopt foolproof security arrangements for New Year’s Eve, besides taking strict action against those involved in aerial firing, hooliganism and one-wheeling.
Additionally, the meeting approved the extension of the deployment of Rangers in Mianwali, Attock, and Dera Ghazi Khan.
Kite flying has been the cause of multiple injuries and fatalities across the province, usually caused by kite strings coated with chemicals or glass, or made from metal.
Last Saturday, a six-year-old girl was injured by a kite string near Adda Maan on Ganda Singh Road, within the jurisdiction of the Saddar Police Station.
The victim was riding on the front of a motorcycle with her brother when a chemical-coated twine slashed her throat. She was immediately rushed to the DHQ Hospital for medical treatment.</p><small>2025-12-31 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31221709801872a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964303/petrol-price-slashed-by-rs1028-diesel-by-rs857-for-next-fortnight' target='_blank'><strong>Petrol price slashed by Rs10.28, diesel by Rs8.57 for next fortnight</strong></a><br><p>The government on Wednesday slashed the rates for petrol and high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs10.28 and Rs8.57, respectively, for the coming fortnight.
In a late-night announcement, the Petroleum Division said the revision followed movements in international markets and recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
According to the announcement, the ex-depot petrol price was reduced to Rs253.17 per litre from its previous price of Rs263.45. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and directly impacts the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes.
Meanwhile, the ex-depot price of HSD was decreased to Rs257.08 per litre for the current fortnight from Rs265.65 per litre. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD.
Its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells, threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.
Although general sales tax (GST) is zero on all the petroleum products, the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high octane products on account of petrol levy and an Rs2.50 per litre climate support levy (CSL).
The government is also charging about Rs16-17 per litre custom duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of their local production or imports. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and HSD are the major revenue spinners with their monthly average sales of about 700,000 – 800,000 tonnes per month compared to just 10,000 tonnes of monthly demand for kerosene. The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY2025 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during the current fiscal year.</p><small>2025-12-31 18:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/312251259fd8e04.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964301/ptcl-completes-acquisition-of-100pc-issued-share-capital-of-telenor-pakistan-and-orion-towers' target='_blank'><strong>PTCL completes acquisition of 100pc issued share capital of Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited (PTCL) on Wednesday completed the acquisition of 100 percent of the issued share capital of Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers, said a press release.
The Pakistan Tele­communication Authority (PTA) approved the merger of Telenor Pak­i­stan with PTCL earlier in December.
The regulator, however, imposed strict conditions to prevent abuse of market power and to bind the new entity to invest in upcoming spectrum auctions.
“Telenor Pakistan and Orion Towers will operate as 100% owned subsidiaries of PTCL, alongside Pak Telecom Mobile Limited (PTML) commonly known as Ufone 4G, and U Microfinance Bank.”
However, Telenor Pakistan will continue to operate as a separate entity during the transition period, said the statement, adding that PTML and Telenor will then be merged as a single entity in “due course of time”, subject to regulatory approvals.
Acknowledging the contribution of Telenor to Pakistan’s telecom landscape, PTCL said the telco “played a defining role in elevating service quality and expanding connectivity over nearly two decades”.
“This milestone brings together complementary strengths to create a platform with a stronger focus on customer centricity, broader reach, and accelerated innovation,” added the press release.
“This is a proud moment for PTCL and a significant milestone for Pakistan’s telecom sector. Our focus remains on delivering a customer-centric, seamless, and high-quality services for improvement in user experience as we bring combined strengths at scale upon completion of regulatory approvals,“ said the press release, quoting President & Chief Executive Officer PTCL and Ufone Hatem Bamatraf.
“Together, we will build a stronger, future-ready organisation that serves customers better, empowers its people, and advances Pakistan’s digital future,” he added.
In October, the policy board of PTCL accepted the terms and conditions set by the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) for the merger with Telenor Pakistan.</p><small>2025-12-31 17:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642539-islamabad-admin-extends-m-tag-deadline-for-vehicles-by-15-days' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad admin extends M-tag deadline for vehicles by 15 days</strong></a><br><p>

Here are a few glimpses of the fireworks shows.

Midnight arrived first on the islands closest to the International Date Line in the Pacific Ocean, including Kiritimati (Christmas Island), Tonga and New Zealand.
In Australia, Sydney began 2026 with a spectacular fireworks display, as per tradition. Some 40,000 pyrotechnic effects stretched 7 kilometres across buildings and barges along its harbour and featured a waterfall effect from the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
This year, it was held under an enhanced police presence, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city.

Organisers held a minute’s silence for the victims of the attack at 11pm local time (5pm PKT), with the Harbour Bridge lit up in white and a menorah — a symbol of Judaism — projected onto its pylons.
“After a tragic end to the year for our city, we hope that New Year’s Eve will provide an opportunity to come together and look with hope for a peaceful and happy 2026,” Sydney’s Lord Mayor Clover Moore said ahead of the event.
In Croatia, revels got off to an early start. Since 2000, the town of Fuzine has held its countdown at noon, a tradition that has since spread across the country. Crowds cheered, toasted each other with champagne and danced to music - all in the middle of the day. Some brave souls in Santa hats took a plunge into the icy waters of Lake Bajer.

Elsewhere, preparations got underway for the more traditional midnight toast. In subzero temperatures in New York, organisers began putting up security barriers and stages ahead of the crowds that will flock to Times Square for the annual ball drop.
In Seoul, thousands gathered at the Bosingak bell pavilion, where a bronze bell is struck 33 times at midnight — a tradition rooted in Buddhist cosmology, symbolising the 33 heavens. The chimes are believed to dispel misfortune and welcome peace and prosperity for the year ahead.

During the “very warm and cordial” call, PM Shehbaz conveyed his warm wishes to both Crown Prince Mohammed — also known as MBS — and Saudi King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud.
“[The] prime minister thanked His Royal Highness for his warmth and affection towards Pakistan. Both leaders reaffirmed their shared commitment to further strengthening of the long-standing fraternal bonds between both countries, that had attained new heights during recent months,” the statement read.
The pair also discussed and exchanged views on the regional situation and current developments, where the prime minister “emphasised upon the need to maintain unity and harmony among the ranks of the Ummah, in the midst of various current challenges”.
“While expressing Pakistan’s complete solidarity with the kingdom, the prime minister said that it was imperative to maintain regional peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy,” the statement added.
The statement further said that the Saudi crown prince thanked PM Shehbaz for the telephone call and reiterated Riyadh’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest.
He also expressed his desire to undertake an official visit to Pakistan in the coming year.

The PM also discussed regional and global developments in a meeting with Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Saeed Ahmad Al-Malkiy, another statement from the PMO said.
According to the statement, PM Shehbaz conveyed his warm wishes to the Saudi king and Crown Prince Mohammed, expressing satisfaction with the bilateral relations between Islamabad and Riyadh.
Ambassador Al-Malkiy, in turn, conveyed warm greetings from King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed to PM Shehbaz, reiterating the Kingdom’s desire to expand cooperation with Pakistan in all areas of mutual interest.

“The Prime Minister reaffirmed his strong commitment and resolve to further deepen the long-standing fraternal bonds between both countries,” the PMO said.
“In this regard, he thanked His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, for his patronage and support to Pakistan, that had brought the two countries closer than ever before.”
PM Shehbaz also recalled his meetings with the Saudi crown prince throughout the year, which the PMO called “highly productive”, additionally expressing deep appreciation for Saudi Arabia’s consistent support for Pakistan in times of need.
“Recent regional and global developments were also discussed during the meeting,” the statement read. The Prime Minister emphasised upon the need to maintain peace and stability through dialogue and diplomacy.“</p><small>2025-12-31 16:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311959485cad8c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964295/why-losing-friends-hurts-in-early-adulthood' target='_blank'><strong>Why losing friends hurts in early adulthood</strong></a><br><p>In an age of constant notifications, fleeting conversations, and shrinking attention spans, relationships, too, have begun to mirror the pace of the digital world. Friendships that once relied on time, patience and shared presence now compete with algorithms, busy schedules and the quiet expectation of instant understanding.
As young people move through early adulthood, many find themselves drifting away from friends not through conflict, but through neglect, exhaustion or emotional distance. Today, the slow fading of friendships has become common, often leaving behind feelings of loneliness, guilt and unanswered questions that rarely find space in public conversations about mental health.
Counselling psychologist at Happy Minds, Arpita Subba, offers insights into how ending or drifting away from friendships in early adulthood can affect young people’s emotional well-being.
Why does the loss or distancing of friendships in early adulthood feel painful for young people?
Early adulthood is a period of exploration and self-discovery, during which individuals begin to step beyond the boundaries of family and parental control. During this time—whether in school, college, or new social environments—young people often form friendships with peers who are experiencing similar struggles and transitions. These friendships become a key source of emotional safety, validation and understanding.

When such bonds suddenly fade or end, it can feel unsettling. Young people may begin to question their self-worth, wondering whether they did something wrong or whether they were ‘not enough’. The loss also brings the fear of having no one left to confide in, which can lead to feelings of panic, lowered self-esteem and emotional insecurity. Young people often begin to question themselves emotionally.
Without someone to share experiences with, seek advice from, or celebrate achievements alongside, they can feel lonely and emotionally insecure.
Even decisions that once felt straightforward may now be second-guessed, as the reassurance and support previously offered by close friends are no longer present.
Many people experience guilt, confusion, or self-doubt after a friendship ends. How can such emotions affect one’s mental health if left unaddressed?
Past experiences with friendships can strongly influence how young adults respond to new relationships. When a friendship ends, individuals may begin to doubt themselves and question the effort they have invested in their relationships.

This can lead to hesitation in forming new bonds, as they may fear repeating past disappointments. Such experiences can also contribute to trust issues, making it difficult to share openly or feel safe with others.
If these emotions remain unaddressed, they can create a persistent cycle of self-doubt, confusion and guilt, leading to prolonged stress and negatively affecting overall mental health.
Are there common signs that a friendship breakup is taking a toll on someone’s emotional or psychological well-being?
Friendship breakups can have a profound impact on young people, yet they are often overlooked compared to family loss. Emotional and psychological signs may include self-doubt, confusion, negative self-talk, and the belief that one was ‘not enough’ to maintain the friendship.
Individuals may struggle with decision-making, overthink situations, feel lonely, or experience insecurity about forming or sustaining other relationships.
Social withdrawal is also common—they may avoid existing friends, isolate themselves, or hesitate to build new connections. Communication patterns may change, with a greater need for reassurance and difficulty trusting oneself.
Prolonged self-stress can manifest physically as sleep disturbances, low energy, changes in appetite, headaches, body aches, or a weakened immune system.
Over time, these effects can impact self-confidence, social identity, and the ability to set healthy boundaries, sometimes leading to over-pleasing behaviours in relationships.
What healthy ways can young adults process the grief or loneliness that may follow the end of a close friendship?
It is natural to want to rush through the pain of a friendship ending, but processing it requires patience and self-compassion. Young adults can benefit from accepting the situation, reflecting on what they have learned, and speaking kindly to themselves. Engaging in creative activities, journaling, or revisiting hobbies can also provide constructive ways to cope.

It is important not to overpressure oneself to ‘move on’ too quickly. Instead, individuals should allow themselves time to experience their emotions and use the process as an opportunity for self-discovery.
If the feelings become overwhelming, seeking support from a trusted person or speaking with a professional can help—expressing emotions rather than suppressing them is key to healthy recovery.
How can individuals rebuild a sense of connection and self-worth after losing a meaningful friendship?
Friendships often form a key part of our sense of identity, so when a close bond ends, it can feel as though a part of ourselves has gone too. Rebuilding self-worth involves reconnecting with oneself and with existing relationships.
Young adults can focus on activities they enjoy, such as hobbies, journaling, or volunteering, and reflect on their values and interests beyond the loss of the friendship.
It is helpful to ask questions like, “Who am I beyond this friendship?” and to allow oneself to rediscover meaning and purpose without rushing to recreate the exact type of connection lost.
Re-engaging with existing friendships, maintaining open but healthy boundaries, and learning from past experiences can foster a renewed sense of belonging.

The change in command comes after incumbent IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon relinquished charge today after attaining the age of superannuation.







According to a notification issued by Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah, “Mr. Allah Bux alias Javed Akhtar Odho, an officer of Police Service of Pakistan (BS-21), Additional Inspector General of Police, Karachi Range, is assigned the additional charge of the post of Inspector General of Police, Sindh, in addition to his own duties, until further orders.”

Karachi police chief Odho, who took charge as additional inspector general of Karachi last year, has assumed the additional charge of IGP Sindh on the same day that his predecessor relinquished his position, said a police spokesperson.
Meanwhile, in his farewell message, the outgoing IGP said that he had prioritised ‘technology-driven policing’ and ‘systemic investigation reforms’ as key components of the policing strategy.
Memon, a BS-21 officer, took charge as IGP Sindh in March, 2024. He was serving as State Life Insurance Corporation executive director before his posting.
He also served in the Intelligence Bureau (IB) as a director in Karachi from 2006 to 2008, and later as joint director of IB Sindh twice between 2011 and 2016.
The government awarded him the Sitara-i-Shujahat and Tamgha-i-Imtiaz for his professional achievements.</p><small>2025-12-31 15:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311945346d3679d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964294/pakistan-expresses-complete-solidarity-with-saudi-arabia-reiterates-support-for-territorial-integrity-of-yemen' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan expresses ‘complete solidarity’ with Saudi Arabia, reiterates support for ‘territorial integrity’ of Yemen</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Wednesday expressed “complete solidarity” with Saudi Arabia amid a resurgence of violence in Yemen, according to a statement from the Foreign Office (FO).

The CDF made these remarks during the 18th National Workshop on Balochistan at General Headquarters (GHQ), where he highlighted the continued efforts of Indian sponsored proxies to “propagate violence and disrupt development”, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
The statement added that the field marshal reaffirmed that these groups’ plans would be thwarted through “stern actions” by the security forces to rid the province of terrorism and unrest.
“Reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace and stability, the COAS & CDF also emphasised that any violation of Pakistan’s territorial integrity, whether direct or indirect, will be met with a firm and decisive response,” the statement read. “[The] Pakistan Armed Forces remain committed to protect the lives and well-being of its citizens.”
The ISPR said that today’s workshop focused on exploring Balochistan’s socio-economic development and its strategic importance for Pakistan.
In an address, Field Marshal Munir appreciated the resilience of the people of Balochistan and highlighted their pivotal importance for Pakistan’s prosperity and development.
“He lauded the wide-ranging initiatives being undertaken by the federal and provincial governments, underscoring a people-centric approach that aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of the province and unlock its vast economic potential for the benefit of its people,” the statement added.
According to the ISPR, the CDF also hailed the role of civil society in his address, highlighting their role in countering disinformation and propaganda, as well as their driving sustainable development.
“He stressed the importance of rejecting vested political agendas to ensure that Balochistan’s future is shaped by long-term prosperity for all its residents,” the statement read.
In May and October this year, Pakistan saw violations of its sovereignty by neighbours India and Afghanistan, respectively.
The May conflict between Pakistan and India was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Meanwhile, in October, Pakistan – Afghanistan relations deteriorated amid tensions over the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), with Islamabad pressing Kabul to curb cross-border terrorism.
After border clashes on October 11, a temporary ceasefire followed talks in Doha and later in Istanbul, but successive rounds of negotiations failed to produce a workable solution despite mediation by Turkiye and Qatar.
Pakistan has also witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025, published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years.</p><small>2025-12-31 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311449498de25e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964286/traffic-police-issues-new-years-eve-plan-for-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Traffic police issues New Year’s Eve plan for Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Authorities have finalised a traffic plan for Karachi for New Year‘s Eve while security arrangements have also been made in different cities, including Sindh’s provincial capital, for 2025’s last night.
According to the traffic plan issued by the Karachi Traffic Police, the stretch of Seaview Road between two eateries, McDonald’s and Clock Tower, will be open for only one-way traffic. Vehicles will be barred from moving towards McDonald’s from Clock Tower.
Commuters will be diverted towards Khayaban-i-Ittehad Road or Do Darya instead, according to the traffic plan.
The traffic police also announced that “heavy vehicles, including water tankers, dumpers, trailers and trucks, will only be allowed to enter the city after 2am”.

Moreover, heavy vehicles such as water tankers, dumpers and trucks will only be allowed to enter the city after 2am, a statement issued by the Karachi Traffic Police deputy inspector general said.
It further warned that strict legal action would be taken over vehicles lacking silencers or those with broken silencers. Similarly, action would also be taken over reckless driving.
“Violators will be handed over to the local police for legal action,” the statement said.
Sindh
Separately, Sindh Inspector General of Police (IG) Ghulam Nabi Memon urged citizens in a statement to refrain from aerial firing, hooliganism and one-wheeling on New Year’s Eve.
The official warned of strict legal action against those involved in aerial firing.
He said that “negligence or carelessness during festivities could lead to the loss of precious human lives”, further urging citizens to act responsibly.
The statement quoted the Sindh IG as saying security arrangements had been made for sensitive spots, as well as recreational spots, hotels, parks and places of worship.
Police personnel had been deployed on main arteries, at markets and in other key areas to maintain law and order, he added.
IGP Memon said control rooms and helplines would remain fully functional in all zones and districts on New Year’s Eve to ensure the provision of timely assistance to citizens.
Islamabad
Meanwhile, the Islamabad Traffic Police said in a statement that more than 350 personnel would be deployed across the federal capital on New Year’s Eve.
Moreover, the entry of heavy vehicles in Islamabad will not be allowed from 7pm on December 31 until 3am on January 1.
Authorities warned of potentially excessive traffic on the Express Highway, Zero Point, Jinnah Avenue, Srinagar Highway, PWD Underpass, Club Road, Murree Road and Park Road due to New Year-related activities.
Citizens could use alternative routes from 7pm to 3am, the statement by the Islamabad Traffic Police said.
It further stated that “eight special squads had been constituted to prevent hooliganism, one-wheeling and reckless driving” on New Year’s Eve.
The statement said “strict action” would be taken over car skidding and rash driving.
“Special traffic teams will also be deployed at recreational spots,” the statement said, adding that parking vehicles on roads, too, will not be allowed.
Punjab
Earlier, Punjab Police also unveiled a comprehensive security plan for New Year’s Eve.
According to the plan, 25,000 personnel will be deployed in the province to ensure law and order and avert any untoward happening.
A spokesperson for the Punjab Police said a total of 419 inspectors, 1,267 sub-inspectors, 2,189 assistant sub-inspectors, 1,408 head constables and 16,977 constables and other personnel will perform security duties across the province.
In Lahore alone, more than 5,000 officers and personnel will be deployed for security.
All activities across Lahore and the rest of the province would be monitored with the help of CCTV cameras and the Safe City system.
Punjab IG Dr Usman Anwar has directed police to remain on “high alert and keep a close watch on anti-state elements”.
The IG said there would be “zero tolerance for one-wheeling, aerial firing, display of weapons, and hooliganism” on New Year’s Eve.
Strict action will be taken against miscreants involved in harassing women and citizens, and they will be sent to lock-ups, authorities have warned.
The IG has directed the police to ensure coordinated traffic arrangements on New Year’s Night and instructed that Dolphin Squad, Police Response Unit, Elite Force, and Punjab Highway Patrol teams should further intensify patrolling on roads and highways.
The Lahore chief traffic officer and all district traffic officers have been directed to deploy additional personnel to ensure smooth traffic flow.</p><small>2025-12-31 13:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642507-pakistan-expresses-solidarity-with-saudi-arabia-raises-concern-over-renewed-violence-in-yemen' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan expresses solidarity with Saudi Arabia, raises concern over renewed violence in Yemen</strong></a><br><p>

Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi reached their lowest point this year following an attack in Pahalagam, in Indian-occupied Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, while Islamabad denied any connection and offered — and continues to offer — an independent probe.
A press release from the NA Secretariat stated that during Sadiq’s visit to Dhaka for former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia’s funeral, Jaishankar approached him for a handshake.
“Indian External Minister Dr S Jaishankar approached the Speaker [of the] National Assembly and shaked hands,” the press release read.
“During this interaction, Dr S Jaishankar introduced himself to the speaker and told the speaker that he had recognised him [sic].”







The press release added that since the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation“.
Following the Pahalgam incident, India took a raft of unilateral diplomatic measures against Pakistan.
Among the Indian measures, the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) stood out as the most severe. The 1960 pact, brokered by the World Bank, has endured through wars and decades of hostility. Its suspension, therefore, marked a watershed moment in the already fraught relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
India further lowered diplomatic ties by closing down the main border transit point, framing the attack as a grave provocation that warranted significant diplomatic, economic, and logistical pressure on Pakistan.
Pakistan called for an independent and transparent investigation into the attack, strongly denying India’s accusations.
However, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of a four-day clash between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — issued a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance.
Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt variations in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.
At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also reaffirmed the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.</p><small>2025-12-31 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642508-cdf-pledges-to-thwart-indian-sponsored-proxies-inimical-designs-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>CDF pledges to thwart Indian-sponsored proxies' 'inimical designs' in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

Khaleda, the first woman to serve as prime minister in the South Asian nation of 170 million people, died on Tuesday aged 80.
Flags were flown at half-mast, and thousands of security officers lined the streets as her body was carried through the streets of the capital Dhaka in a vehicle in the colours of the national flag.
Large crowds had gathered outside parliament — many waving national flags or those of Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — where the funeral prayers were held at around 3pm local time, according to Dhaka-based Daily Star.







Khaleda was laid to rest alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981 during his time as president. The burial took place at around 4:30pm local time, Daily Star reported.
Seventy-year-old retired government official Minhaz Uddin, who was attending Khaleda’s funeral, said he had never voted for her, but came to honour the three-time prime minister.
“I came here with my grandson, just to say goodbye to a veteran politician whose contributions will always be remembered,” he said, watching from behind a barbed wire barricade as her body passed by.
“Khaleda Zia has been an inspiration,” mourner Sharmina Siraj told AFP, adding that “it is difficult to imagine women in leadership positions anytime soon”.
The 40-year-old mother of two said stipends introduced by Khaleda to support girls’ education “had a huge impact on the lives of our girls”.
NA speaker meets family, expresses condolences
National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who is in Bangladesh for the funeral, visited the residence of the former Bangladeshi prime minister, where he met her son and daughter.
According to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat, Sadiq expressed his condolences at the passing of their mother.
“In this hour of grief and sorrow, the government and the people of Pakistan stand with you,” he was quoted as saying. The family of the late premier thanked Sadiq for his condolences.







The NA speaker also met the country’s national security adviser, Khalilur Rehman, the statement said.
It said that Sadiq “conveyed a message of sympathy and condolences on behalf of the residents and prime minister of Pakistan”.
The speaker also met the adviser for law, justice and parliamentary affairs of Bangladesh, Asif Nazrul, where the two discussed matters of mutual interest.
Later, a post on the NA‘s X account said Sadiq also had an interaction with Indian Foreign Minister Dr S, Jaishankar at Bangladesh’s parliament.
‘Legacy lives on’
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Khaleda had vowed to campaign in elections set for 12 February — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.
Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party is widely seen as a frontrunner, and her son Tarique Rahman, 60, who returned only last week after 17 years in exile, is seen as a potential prime minister if they win a majority.
“She is no more, but her legacy lives on — and so does the BNP,” said Jenny Parvez, 37, who travelled for several hours with her family to watch the funeral cortege pass her on the street.
The interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, declared three days of national mourning and an elaborate state funeral.
Yunus said Bangladesh had “lost a great guardian”.
‘Unbreakable’
Tarique Rahman said in a statement that “the country mourns the loss of a guiding presence that shaped its democratic aspirations”.
His mother, he added, “endured repeated arrests, denial of medical care, and relentless persecution”, but that “her resilience … was unbreakable.”
Suffering from a raft of health issues, Khaleda was rushed to hospital in late November, where her condition had gradually deteriorated despite treatment.
Nevertheless, hours before her death, party workers had on Monday submitted nomination papers on her behalf for three constituencies for next year’s polls.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Khaleda’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.</p><small>2025-12-31 12:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31123205e8ea303.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964276/double-decker-buses-introduced-in-karachi-to-be-available-to-the-public-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Double-decker buses introduced in Karachi, to be available to the public from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Double-decker buses were introduced in Karachi on Wednesday, with Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon saying that they would be available to the public from January 1 (Thursday).
“Today marks the beginning of double-decker bus [services] in the city. They will be available to the public from tomorrow, and today, they will be tested [on the city’s road],” Memon, who also has the transport portfolio, said while speaking to the media at the inauguration of the bus service in Karachi.
Memon inaugurated the bus service along with Sindh Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah.

The development comes more than a year after the Sindh government announced the initiative in October 2024 for the city of over 23 million that has faced mobility issues for long.
Memon recalled that the Sindh government had promised to introduce double-decker buses in Karachi by December 2025, pointing out that today was December 31.
He further said the Sindh government aimed to provide transport facilities across the province in 2026, adding that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had also instructed to introduce “double-decker buses on every road in Karachi” in the coming year.
Yesterday, while announcing the launch of double-decker buses in the city, Memon said the buses would operate from Malir to Sharea Faisal. He had added that more double-decker buses would be brought to Karachi as these would help solve traffic problems.
His spokesperson, Hussain Mansoor, separately told Dawn that the buses would run between Zainab Market in Saddar and Model Colony. He further said that stops were designated for double-decker buses along this route at/near Malir Halt, airport, Colony Gate, Natha Khan Bridge, Drigh Road, Nursery, Baloch Colony and Finance and Trade Centre.
The spokesperson added that a one-way ticket for commute via the double-decker bus would cost between Rs80 and Rs120.
Meanwhile, a handout issued by Memon’s office said the double-decker bus service was “being introduced again for Karachiites after 65 years”.
Speaking to the media on Wednesday, he said new routes for electronic buses would also be designated in Sindh, including Karachi, from next week, the minister said.
Acknowledging that public transport was a necessity, he expressed the Sindh government’s intention to facilitate the public in this regard. Without specifically mentioning any of the bus services launched by the government, he said these transport facilities were being provided at a subsidised rate.







“The Sindh government pays that subsidy to facilitate passengers,” the minister said, further claiming that over 125,000 commuters were using transport services being provided under the People’s Bus Service project in Karachi daily.
In response to a question about criticism of the poor condition of roads, Memon said the Sindh cabinet had allocated more than Rs9 billion out of the budget just for roads in industrial areas to address complaints. He said work on several other projects was also under way, particularly mentioning the Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway in Karachi.







When asked whether double-decker buses’ routes would also cover tourist spots in Sindh to present a “positive image” of the province, the minister replied, “Yes, definitely. We aim to cover not just tourist spots but every road.”
‘A gift from CM’
A handout from the Sindh CM’s office termed double-decker buses “a gift” from the provincial chief executive.
The statement quoted CM Murad as saying that Karachiites had the right to better transport facilities and that the new bus service would make commuting easier for them.







“The city is now not just running, it’s progressing. Today, a bus has started running, and tomorrow, the city will transform.
“Better transport facilities for Karachi is not a mere promise, it is now becoming a reality,” the CM was quoted as saying.
He further said that better facilities strengthen cities, expressing the ambition to make Karachi join the ranks of modern cities.</p><small>2025-12-31 12:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642477-dpm-dar-to-visit-beijing-for-7th-pakistan-china-strategic-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>DPM Dar to visit Beijing for 7th Pakistan-China Strategic Dialogue</strong></a><br><p>

Uzbekistan has emerged as a compelling alternative for those wanting a mix of alpine adventure and deep Islamic history.
The gateway to Central Asia is more accessible than ever, offering a winter experience that is both culturally familiar and geographically spectacular.
Amirsoy: A new winter standard
The highlight for any winter traveller is the Amirsoy Mountain Resort, the largest ski destination in Uzbekistan.
Nestled on the spurs of the Chatkal Ridge within the western Tian Shan Mountains (a Unesco World Heritage site), it is located just an hour’s drive from Tashkent. It is easy to see why the resort is a draw as the majestic, sprawling peaks create a stunning backdrop, offering a sharp, beautiful contrast between the crisp, sunny air and the endless blankets of white snow.

Amirsoy features high-speed gondolas that take visitors up to 2,290m to ski down the slopes. Even if you aren’t a skier, the “top of the world” views from the peak are worth the trip.
For families, the resort provides designated areas for tubing and sledging, activities that require zero experience but offer plenty of fun in the snow, alongside five-star chalets for housing the whole family. Everything from winter jackets to boots can be rented on-site, making it easy for those coming from the tropics to jump straight into the action.

Tashkent: The urban hub
Tashkent itself is a city of wide boulevards and surprising greenery, even in the colder months. It serves as a base where you can experience the intersection of ancient history and modern life.

The Tashkent Metro is a must-visit; the stations are designed with marble, chandeliers and intricate mosaics, making a simple commute feel like a walk through an underground museum.

In the old part of the city, the Hazrati Imam Complex brings together mausoleums, mosques and libraries, crowned with blue domes. The Uthman Quran, the world’s oldest Quran, once housed here, is now preserved at the Centre for Islamic Civilisation, a modern cultural landmark dedicated to Uzbekistan’s Islamic heritage and its role in world civilisation. Nearby, the Chorsu Bazaar offers a sensory overload of smells and people.

Under its massive blue dome, you can find everything from local spices and dried fruits to the famous Tashkent bread (non), which is stamped with unique patterns and baked fresh in clay ovens. However, come prepared with local cash (Uzbek Som/UZS), as some vendors will only accept local currency.

The golden road: Samarkand and Bukhara
No trip to Uzbekistan is complete without boarding the Afrosiyob high-speed train. In just about two hours, you can reach Samarkand, a city that feels pulled from a history book.


The Registan is the stunning, historic heart of Samarkand, a public square famed for its breathtaking ensemble of three majestic madrasas (Islamic schools) – Ulugh Beg, Sher-Dor and Tilla-Kori – showcasing intricate tilework and grand portals, making it a Unesco World Heritage site and an iconic symbol of Central Asian Islamic architecture. — Via The Star

For Muslims, the true heart of Samarkand lies at the Imam Al-Bukhari Memorial Complex. As the final resting place of the scholar who compiled the most authentic hadith used in religious life, this site is a deeply spiritual pilgrimage destination.
For the best photos, arrive early at opening (7am) or near closing (7pm) to capture the shimmering turquoise domes in soft golden light without the heavy midday tour groups.
Finally, walk through Registan Square, where the three towering madrasas are especially atmospheric and quiet during the winter off-season.
Further west lies Bukhara, the spiritual heart of Uzbekistan and Central Asia. Renowned for its deep Islamic heritage, this “open-air museum” remains a sacred beacon of the Muslim world. Walking through the narrow alleys of the Ark Fortress or standing at the foot of the Kalyan Minaret, a structure so impressive that even invaders in the 12th century refused to destroy it, gives you a profound sense of the scale of the ancient Silk Road.

Bukhara is also the country’s premier destination for artisanal souvenirs. Its historic 16th-century trading domes are still filled with masters practising ancient crafts, from intricate gold embroidery and hand-stitched suzani textiles to the city’s famous bird-shaped hand-forged scissors and high-quality ikat silks. Bukhara offers both a treasure trove of heritage gifts and a deep connection to an Islamic history that has remained remarkably unchanged for centuries.
Halal Comfort and Hospitality
As a majority-Muslim country, travellers are spoilt for choice when it comes to finding halal food. You will find yourself gravitating toward Plov, the national rice dish cooked in massive cauldrons with tender lamb and yellow carrots. Other staples like Samsa (flaky meat pastries), Mastava (soup with spiced meat and rice) and Shurpa (a hearty lamb soup) provide the perfect warmth after a day of sightseeing.

According to the FO, Dar will be visiting Beijing at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
It said that the dialogue was the “highest consultative mechanism between Pakistan and China, providing a structured platform to review the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, as well as regional and international developments of mutual interest”.







It added that during the dialogue, the two foreign ministers will also announce a series of initiatives and commemorative activities to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
“The visit forms an important part of the regular high-level exchanges between the two countries and reflects their shared determination to broaden and deepen the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, while reaffirming their mutual commitment to regional peace, stability, and sustainable development,” the FO statement said.
While the FO did not give the exact dates for Dar’s visit, the Chinese foreign ministry said he would be visiting from January 3 to 6, 2026.
The sixth round of the strategic dialogue was held in Islamabad in August, with Yi visiting the capital and meeting Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari.
At the time, China had affirmed its commitment to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.</p><small>2025-12-31 10:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642446-russian-national-hunts-kashmiri-markhor-in-chitral-for-68000' target='_blank'><strong>Russian national hunts Kashmiri Markhor in Chitral for $68,000</strong></a><br><p>

In statements issued separately by both countries’ foreign ministries and seen on Wednesday by AFP, they said they were imposing “equivalent measures” on US citizens, after US President Donald Trump expanded a travel ban to nearly 40 countries this month, based solely on nationality.







That list included Syrian citizens, as well as Palestinian Authority passport holders, and nationals of some of Africa’s poorest countries, including also Niger, Sierra Leone and South Sudan.
The White House said it was banning foreigners who “intend to threaten” Americans.
Burkina Faso’s foreign ministry said in the statement that it was applying “equivalent visa measures” on Americans, while Mali said it was, “with immediate effect”, applying “the same conditions and requirements on American nationals that the American authorities have imposed on Malian citizens entering the United States”.
It voiced its “regret” that the United States had made “such an important decision without the slightest prior consultation”.
The two sub-Saharan countries, both run by military juntas, are members of a confederation that also includes Niger.
Niger has not officially announced any counter-measures to the US travel ban, but the country’s news agency, citing a diplomatic source, said last week that such measures had been decided.
In his December 17 announcement, Trump also imposed partial travel restrictions on citizens of other African countries including the most populous, Nigeria, as well as Ivory Coast and Senegal, which qualified for the football World Cup to be played next year in the United States as well as Canada and Mexico.</p><small>2025-12-31 09:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3113540664070b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964281/rules-amended-to-legally-recognise-facial-iris-scans-as-biometric-identities' target='_blank'><strong>Rules amended to legally recognise facial, iris scans as biometric identities</strong></a><br><p>The federal government has amended the National Identity Card (NIC) Rules, widening the definition of biometrics to legally recognise facial and iris scans as valid biometric identifiers, besides fingerprints, the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) said on Wednesday.
The amendment, made on the authority’s recommendation, provides a robust legal foundation for the implementation of a multi-biometric verification system in Pakistan.
Based on this legal framework, Nadra has introduced technical innovations enabling contactless fingerprint and facial recognition-based biometric verification.
In a statement, Nadra said this system is currently available both at the authority‘s registration centres and on the Pak ID mobile application for services falling within the authority’s jurisdiction. It is already being utilised for biometric verification in transferring Islamabad-registered vehicles and online passport applications.
In the near future, proof-of-life certificates for federal government pensioners will also be issued under this system, while the scope of these digital services is being expanded in phases.
Effective from Jan 20, 2026, Nadra will start issuing facial recognition-based biometric verification certificates at all its registration centres for those citizens for whom fingerprint-based verification is not possible. Wherever any institution requires such verification, citizens may obtain this certificate from any Nadra registration centre after paying a nominal fee of Rs20.
Under this procedure, if fingerprint-based biometric verification fails at the service provider’s end, the citizen will visit the nearest Nadra registration centre to have a fresh photograph taken.
This photograph will be matched with the image already available in Nadra’s records. Upon successful verification, Nadra will issue a certificate containing the purpose of verification, the citizen’s recent photograph alongside the photograph on record, their computerised national identity card (CNIC) number, name, father’s name, a unique tracking ID and a QR code.
The certificate will be valid for seven days. The citizen will submit it to the relevant institution where biometric verification is required and the concerned institution will incorporate the certificate into its records and verify it online through Nadra.
In the future, facial image-based biometric verification certificates will also be available through Nadra’s e-Sahulat franchises. Following the formal launch of the Digital ID, this facility will be made available for all services through the Pak-ID application.
In a statement, Nadra said it was fully prepared to implement this system. However, for its effective execution, it requested all regulators, relevant public institutions and private sector organisations to progressively upgrade their hardware and software in accordance with approved standards to enable the use of this biometric verification service.
In the first phase, technical upgrades to institutional software applications will be required to allow the integration of facial recognition-based biometric verification certificates issued by Nadra. In the second phase, it will be necessary for institutions to install cameras at service counters or integrate cameras into existing know your customer (KYC) biometric machines, as without these upgrades, the authority cannot provide this facility directly at such locations.
If citizens encounter any issues regarding the availability of this service after Jan 20, 2026, they may lodge complaints with the relevant institution or department, as the service will be available from Nadra’s end.
To ensure the earliest possible operationalisation of this facility, Nadra has also requested the interior ministry to issue appropriate instructions to all institutions concerned. It is envisaged that, following the rollout of this system, the difficulties faced by citizens due to faded fingerprints will be effectively resolved.
Upon full implementation, citizens will be able to avail this facility directly at the relevant institution without the need to visit a Nadra Registration Centre. Following the formal launch of the Digital ID, citizens will also be able to access this facility independently through the Pak-ID application.

 

On the occasion of the new year, Nadra reaffirmed its commitment to further enhance its services through technological innovation while strengthening safeguards against identity fraud and misuse.
Due to age or certain medical conditions, the fingerprints of many citizens gradually fade over time. When such citizens approach banks, SIM card franchises, housing societies or seek services related to property transfer and other transactions where biometric verification through fingerprints is mandatory, they often face significant difficulties.
Moreover, at many service points, biometric verification is also not possible due to the use of substandard or low-quality fingerprint readers. Although the State Bank of Pakistan and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority have prescribed mechanisms to facilitate such citizens, in practice individuals continue to face considerable challenges in availing these services.
To ensure an immediate and effective resolution of this issue, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had issued directives to Nadra and key measures have been taken in compliance.</p><small>2025-12-31 08:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642411-sindh-rolls-out-double-decker-bus-service-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh rolls out double-decker bus service in Karachi — what are routes and fares?</strong></a><br><p>

On Tuesday, it emerged that a case was registered against more than a dozen lawyers after Butt was physically assaulted during a court appearance in Karachi on Monday. The FIR nominated Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah Chandio and “another 15-20 lawyers”.
Subsequently, lawyers stormed the City Courts police station demanding a case against the YouTuber and others. They also staged a protest on M.A. Jinnah Road outside the City Courts against the SHO of the City Courts police station for allegedly failing to register their FIR.
The fresh FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn and which emerged on Wednesday, was registered on the complaint of City Court SHO Jahangir Bhutto.
The FIR was registered under sections 337-A (punishment of shajjah), Section 504 (intentional insult), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 147 (punishment for rioting), and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of their duty) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The complainant said that on December 30 (Tuesday), he received a call while out patrolling that “around 40-50 lawyers“ led by Abdul Fatah Chandio, Advocate Abdul Wahab Rajper, and Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi had forced their way into the Risala police station, which had been temporarily set up at the City Courts police station.
He alleged that they were creating a ruckus and demanding that a FIR be registered against Butt and his lawyer.
“When I reached the police station around 2pm, the lawyers demanded to know why I had allowed a FIR to be registered against them,“ Bhutto said.
“They asked me to register a FIR against Butt and his lawyer,” he added.
“I tried to make them understand that a case had already been registered [..] upon hearing this, they started verbally abusing me and then proceeded to kick and punch me,“ he recalled.
He said that the lawyers left after the police staff came to his rescue. “However, they started chanting slogans and gave me death threats as they marched out of the station,” he said.
The FIR nominated three people — Chandio, Rajper, and Solangi, along with 40-50 others, who were unnamed.
It should be mentioned that Solangi was named in the case registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer. He is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments, for which the YouTuber had appeared in court on Monday.
Bhutto said that the accused had “stopped me from performing my duty, gave me death threats, assaulted me and verbally abused me“.
Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, had registered a case against Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers” under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 337-A (Punishment of shajjah) of the PPC.
Ashfaq stated in the FIR that his client had arrived at City Courts at 9am to seek bail, but when he reached the inner premises near the West building, lawyers Solangi and Fatah, along with 15-20 other lawyers, attacked and started beating the YouTuber, causing him injuries. “The attackers assaulted me as well and other lawyers from my office,” he added.
He alleged that during the attack, Butt was holding a bag containing Rs300,000, which was snatched from him. He said that Solangi later returned the bag, but the cash was missing.
Advocate Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.</p><small>2025-12-31 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/310826141a37715.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964266/first-winter-rain-drenches-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>First winter rain drenches parts of Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Winter’s first spell of rain drenched parts of Karachi late on Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, bringing a dip in temperature.
Light to moderate rain was reported in Old City area, Lyari, Keamari, Mauripur, DHA, Clifton, Saddar, North Nazimabad, Malir, Mehmoodabad and Akhtar Colony.
According to data released by the Pakistan Meteorological Department at 8am on Wednesday, Keamari received the highest level (6mm) of rain.
Masroor Base received 5mm while Orangi Town, DHA and Saddar received 3mm of rainfall. Korangi and Faisal Base received 2mm, and 1mm was recorded across Old Area Airport, Jinnah Terminal, University Road, Gulshan-i-Hadeed and Surjani Town.
Rainfall was also reported in parts of Sindh. PMD data showed that Rohri recorded the highest rainfall at 32mm, followed by Sukkur at 24mm. A total of 19mm was recorded in Hyderabad (13mm in the city and 6mm in the airport area), 11mm in Tando Jam, 10mm in Mohenjo Daro, 8mm in Khairpur, 6mm in Larkana, 5mm in Jacobabad, 4mm in Mirpur Khas and 3mm in Dadu and Padidan. Trace amounts of rainfall were also recorded in Sakrand and Thatta.
Asked if more cool weather and rain were forecast for Karachi, PMD spokesperson Anjum Nazir Zaighum said on Wednesday that westerly winds had been affecting the country since Dec 29, “the effect of which we saw last night in Karachi”.
“There has been light rain in almost all areas of Karachi,” he said, but added that this situation was almost over.
He said that clouds were still present and that some light rain might be seen in some areas, which would be over by this evening.
The spokesperson also said that a drop in temperature would be felt in Karachi from Jan 4 or 5, when this weather event left Pakistan and moved eastward.
He added that when the northern winds, known as Siberian winds, began to impact the country, Karachi would experience increased cold weather.
“In the coming days, Karachi’s temperature could go into the single digits,” he said.
Separately, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana, in a post on X, urged people to “exercise caution when using electrical appliances“ in light of the rain.
“A brief spell of rain was recorded in various areas across Karachi; K-Electric’s power system has remained stable,” he said.
He further advised people to “maintain safe distance from power transmission installation.”
“Obtaining electricity through illegal means and using hooked connections can cause fatal accidents,” he said.







On Sunday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had forecast rain and thunderstorms, with snowfall over the hills, in most parts of the country during this week.
In Sindh, it predicted isolated light rain or drizzle in Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Larkana, Thatta, Badin and adjoining areas on Dec 30 (Tuesday).</p><small>2025-12-31 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642437-pakistans-ambassador-meets-uae-defence-officials-to-boost-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's ambassador meets UAE defence officials to boost cooperation</strong></a><br><p>

Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.
“During the year, six polio vaccination campaigns were conducted, including five nationwide drives. As a result, reported polio cases dropped sharply from 74 in 2024 to 30 in 2025, with no new cases reported anywhere in the country since September,” the statement said.
However a polio expert, wishing to remain anonymous, said that it was the tendency of the virus to remain recessive for some years and then bounce back.
“It is correct that Pakistan reported 74 cases in 2024 and the number of cases declined to 30 during the ongoing year,” he said. “However, only six cases were reported in 2023 while as many as 20 cases were reported in 2022.“
Additionally, he added that although the year was almost complete, there was a possibility that the number of cases may further increase, as it took almost three weeks to confirm that a child was paralysed due to polio or for some other reason.
“In the lab, we get almost 4,000 samples from paralysed children every year for testing. So by the end of January, we will be in a position to confirm the number of cases for 2025,” the expert said.
It is worth mentioning that the target for the last nationwide polio campaign was to vaccinate 45.4 million children under the age of five. However, a total of 44.6m children were vaccinated as refusals were reported from across the country.
The statement issued by the polio programme said that although the number of polio cases continued to decline, Pakistan’s unwavering fight against the disease would persist until complete eradication was achieved. The virus, however, continues to circulate in certain high-risk areas, making sustained vigilance crucial.
Targeted interventions, robust community engagement, and ongoing vaccination efforts remained essential to reach every missed child and prevent any resurgence. Frontline health workers, security personnel, and local authorities continue to work in close coordination to maintain high immunity levels and ensure that Pakistan remains on course toward becoming polio-free, it said.
These gains were further reinforced during the most recent national polio vaccination campaign, conducted from December 15-21. The campaign achieved over 98 per cent coverage at the national level, with strong provincial-level performance across all four provinces, as well as in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), and Islamabad.
Compared to the previous round, an 18pc reduction in missed children was recorded, alongside notable improvements in access and operational performance, particularly in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Nevertheless, efforts will continue until every unreached child is protected,” the statement added. While these efforts have led to significant gains, the fight against polio will continue, it said.
“Ongoing engagement with communities, religious leaders, civil society, and the media remains crucial to strengthen trust, counter misinformation, and ensure that every child is protected from polio,” the statement said.
It added that while localised access challenges persisted, especially in parts of southern KP, these gaps had been clearly identified and were being addressed through “targeted, district-specific interventions”.
Enhanced microplanning, improved team deployment, strengthened community engagement, and close security coordination remains central to these focused efforts, it said.
“Building on the progress achieved in 2025, Pakistan’s polio eradication programme is intensifying targeted efforts in 2026 to interrupt remaining virus transmission and move decisively toward eradication.
“With transmission now limited, population immunity rising, and performance improving in historically challenging areas, the programme remains firmly on track to secure a polio-free future for every child in Pakistan,” the statement said.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic.</p><small>2025-12-31 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642402-ppp-not-consulted-on-potential-govt-pti-talks-says-kp-governor' target='_blank'><strong>PPP not consulted on potential govt-PTI talks, says KP governor</strong></a><br><p>

The organisation, which provided care to nearly half a million people during a two-year Gaza Strip war, says deregistration would cut off life-saving medical assistance for hundreds of thousands in the Palestinian enclave.
COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, said MSF had refused to provide Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Ministry with a list of its employees as required.
The Diaspora Affairs Ministry claims individuals affiliated with MSF have links to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. MSF rejects the accusations as unsubstantiated.
When asked, MSF did not state if it had provided names.
In May, aid agency Oxfam said the requirement to share staff details raised protection concerns, following attacks on humanitarian workers in Gaza.
MSF told Reuters that the impact would be devastating if it is barred from operating, as the humanitarian crisis deepens.
“If MSF is prevented from working in Gaza, it will deprive hundreds of thousands of people from accessing medical care,” the group said, highlighting the stakes for civilians already struggling to access health services.
Dozens of other international aid groups are at risk of deregistration, potentially forcing closures or restrictions on operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, within 60 days, if they did not comply by December 31 with new criteria set by Israeli authorities.
While some international aid groups have been registered under the system that was introduced in March, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Oxfam told Reuters they too are preparing for possible deregistration.
If that happened, the NRC said it would likely be forced to shutter its East Jerusalem office and will not be able to bring foreign aid workers into Gaza. It has around 200 local staff as well as 35 international staff across Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
“At a time when needs in Gaza far exceed the available aid and services, Israel has and will continue to block life-saving aid from entering,” Shaina Low, spokesperson for the NRC, said.

 

Oxfam’s Policy Lead in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Bushra Khalidi told Reuters that its Palestinian staff and partners would continue supporting communities but said forcing aid agencies to rely on obtaining supplies locally — as they will not be permitted to bring in goods from outside — was part of a wider dismantling of the humanitarian aid system.
On Tuesday, the British Foreign Office published a statement alongside France, Canada and others saying Israel should allow NGOs to work in Israel in a sustained and predictable way, and shared concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
COGAT said 4,200 aid trucks will continue to enter every week via the UN, donor countries, the private sector, and more than 20 international organisations that have been reregistered.</p><small>2025-12-31 05:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642381-majority-of-pakistanis-optimistic-about-economic-improvement-in-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Majority of Pakistanis optimistic about economic improvement in 2026</strong></a><br><p>

The Orange Line runs from Orangi Town to North Nazimabad while Green Line connects Surjani Town with Numaish via North Nazimabad.
“Citizens used to complain that they had to pay fare twice by accessing the Green Line. However, now the entire journey will be possible on a single ticket, which will provide travel convenience to 100,000 people daily,” he said while speaking at the inauguration ceremony held at the Orange Line depot.
Talking to the media, Mr Memon said it will now be possible to travel on the Orange Line and the Green Line at the same fare.

Sharjeel says commuters can now travel from Orangi to Numaish in one fare; double-deckers to hit Karachi roads today

During the tenure of the federal government, the ridership of the Green Line was up to 55,000 per day, whereas it has now increased to around 80,000, he said, adding that thousands of citizens benefit from this service every day, and the fares have also been kept very low.
He said that security cameras and other facilities are also available in the buses. Separate buses for women will also be operated on the Green Line and Orange Line.
Double-decker buses from tomorrow
The minister announced that double-decker buses are going to be launched in the city on Wednesday (today).
He said that double-decker buses will operate from Malir to Sharea Faisal, he said, adding that more double-decker buses will be brought to Karachi as these will help solve traffic problems.
The public will be given a New Year gift, and new EV buses have also arrived, he added.
To a question, he said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced 150 buses for Karachi. He requested the PM to fulfil this promise. In response to another question, he said that no one will be allowed to occupy government land.
He said that the Sindh Police and intelligence agencies carried out a major and very important operation in which those operating on foreign funding lured an innocent girl and prepared her to take the lives of ordinary citizens.
People were used on the orders of enemy countries, and parents were instructed to monitor the activities of their children, he said and warned that the nation’s children are being exploited and are being given a false narrative through social media. No objective was achieved by any explosion; rather, the target was the country and its own people.
Transport Secretary Asad Zamin, Sindh Mass Transit Authority Managing Director Kanwal Nizam Bhutto and other officials were also present at the inauguration ceremony.

The returnees from Iran were less likely to have income-generating employment, and more often reported barriers to girls’ education. Those returning from Pakistan after April found more casual income opportunities but struggled to afford rent and maintain sufficient food.
According to the survey, across all groups, returnees continue to settle in areas with fragile conditions marked by deepening poverty and limited access to essential services. Many cannot return to their areas of origin due to lack of shelter, land, or livelihoods. Over half of households surveyed reported missing essential civil documentation, restricting access to education, healthcare, and housing.
Education remains sharply constrained for all women and girls in Afghanistan: returnees from Iran most often cited policies and laws as the key barrier, while returnees from Pakistan pointed to economic obstacles. Access to healthcare is limited by cost, distance, and medicine short ages, with women disproportionately affected due to movement restrictions, survey results show.

Most returnees (88 per cent) reported living in debt, representing a slight decline from the 2024 survey. Indebted households were typically large, averaging six members. Debt was particularly widespread in Nangarhar province, where 96 per cent of returnees reported financial distress.
Returnees from Iran were slightly less likely to hold debt than those from Pakistan, while differences between female-headed (90 per cent) and male-headed (87 per cent) households were minimal. Almost all indebted households stated that their debt exceeded their monthly income, under scoring widespread, unsustainable debt cycles and the financial pressures that undermine economic reintegration.

 

In August 2025, the monitoring expanded to include returnees from Iran for the first time, alongside those from Pakistan.
This round draws on interviews with 1,658 returnee households from Pakistan and Iran. Two new data sets were introduced for returnees from Pakistan: one for those who returned before April 2025 and one for those who returned after when cash assistance was reduced due to funding shortfalls.
The survey also includes undocumented returnees, allowing analysis of possible differences between returnees with refugee documentation in countries of asylum and those without.
The UN refugee agency says these findings highlight the urgency of sustained, multisectoral support to protect returnees and assist their reintegration. Interventions must be tailored to the differing profiles and needs of returnees from Iran and Pakistan, taking into account their distinct vulnerabilities and circumstances behind their return. Continued post-return monitoring remains critical to track evolving challenges, adapt programming, and advance long-term stability and protection.
The changes in data sets reflect the need to understand evolving returnee experiences. In 2025, Afghanistan saw massive return movements, with an estimated 2.7 million returns between January and November. These returns reflect changes in the profiles of those coming back.
Many returns occurred under duress and adverse conditions, driven by policies in neighbouring countries and deteriorating conditions for Afghans abroad, particularly in Pakistan and Iran. These mass returns often resulted in abrupt departures and difficult journeys back to Afghanistan.
Food insecurity remains critical despite modest improvements, with returnees from Pakistan disproportionately affected. Shelter, water, and education access further highlight disparities. Returnees from Pakistan, particularly recent arrivals, are more likely to rent housing and struggle to afford rent, whereas returnees from Iran more often own or inherit their homes. Access to safe water and sanitation is also more limited for returnees from Pakistan.
These findings highlight the urgency of sustained, multisectoral support that addresses both immediate and long-term needs. Assistance must combine short and medium-term cash support with livelihood opportunities, durable housing solutions, water and health infrastructure, and access to civil documentation, among other key needs and challenges faced by returnees.
Targeted interventions are essential for the most vulnerable groups, including female-headed households and people with disabilities. Continued monitoring, disaggregated by country and period of return, is critical to adapting programming based on evidence and ensuring that reintegration translates into lasting improvements in stability and protection.
