It has easily become the most popular analysis presented on the talk shows, so much so that the Urdu phrase, daiyron ka safar, has become rather familiar. For every incident in the present, there is one from the past to suggest that this is how Pakistan rolls.
If the PTI complains about human rights now, the PPP will remember events from the Zia era when it was under fire. When asked about the mess around us now, those in government want to know why they had suffered the brunt of the state’s wrath in 2018 without any support from those who today want to speak up for the PTI.
In Pakistan, it is always the worst of times for those who are in the opposition and the best of times for those in power. It’s a circle, ain’t it?
But in this game of going round and round, the politicos do not just dance around repression but also the notion of negotiations. What is known on television talk shows as muzakaraat and mufahimat.

The ruling elite may be sitting pretty but their biggest worry is the economy.

And this appears to be popular these days. Just on the weekend, it was much mentioned in public speeches by the government as well as the opposition. It came up for discussion during an event held to commemorate the death of Khawaja Rafique, the father of PML-N stalwart Saad Rafique.
And in Islamabad, the two-day event by the opposition alliance, TTAP, also pushed for talks. But neither of the two sides are giving this message unambiguously.
While the exhausted second tier of the PTI, along with the allied parties, are suggesting talks, the message from Imran Khan is hardly conciliatory. He has asked the new and youthful chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to hit the streets. Similarly, though some government ministers may be asking for talks, the treatment meted out to the PTI in recent days suggests otherwise. New sentences have been handed down to Khan and his wife as well as PTI leaders imprisoned in Lahore. Similarly, the use of water cannons on Khan’s sisters outside the jail also reveals a hardening of stance. This is confirmed by the statement of Ayaz Sadiq, the National Assembly speaker, who says he is no longer in a position to facilitate talks.
This ambiguity is unsurprising because each side perhaps has much to lose from softening their stance. The PML-N (and those behind) cannot afford to make peace with PTI right now — for Khan and PTI’s existence means the N continues to be irrelevant in Punjab. They would prefer to ease the pressure on the PTI only and when some political space has been regained and not before. For Khan (more so than the rest) reaching an agreement with the government would mean accepting this government for some time (the best he can hope for is an early election date) and his statements suggest that the imprisonment has not weakened him enough to settle for this.

 

And though the government does not say this explicitly, it would prefer to improve the economy, gain some legitimacy and then ease the repression in society. On the surface this may sound sensible for who is going to point out that a decade of growth under Zia and Musharraf respectively did not secure an electoral win for the parties patronised by the dictators.
But while the ruling coalition can mull over what a better economy will bring them, it might not be out of place to also pull out another nugget from circular history. The PPP and Musharraf reached out to each other for a possible alliance shortly after the 2002 election but the talks were not able to get anywhere till 2007. By this time, not only were the next elections due but Musharraf was far weaker and needed to accept some of Benazir Bhutto’s demands. But it is important to point out that unlike Khan, BB was sitting abroad and safe from cases, persecution and conviction. Perhaps it was easier for her to wait than him.
The point here being that there is little need for those in power to talk to Imran Khan; especially as it is now clear that his party can no longer mount the kind of protest needed to put pressure on the government.
However, this does not mean that the status quo faces no challenge.
The ruling elite may be sitting pretty compared to the PTI but their biggest worry is the economy; unlike Zia and Musharraf, it lacks the kind of legitimacy and goodwill provided by foreign aid and comfortable financial conditions. And this is why there are statements aplenty about the need to move on from stabilisation to growth.
But growth, as we have been told, does not come easily to Pakistan. It leads to a balance of payments crisis and a return to the IMF. Already, experts are pointing out that there are some indications of pressure on the rupee.
In this focus on the economy, there is chatter that the federal government is looking to tinker with the NFC to create some fiscal space for spending at the centre. Apparently, the government in Islamabad thinks this will help it escape the IMF; at the same time, it would be easier than fixing some of the long-standing problems of the economy because the latter would hurt the most powerful far too much.
And this is where the political status quo also comes into the picture. Any effort to tamper with the NFC will shake the power equation between the establishment, PPP and PML-N. Chances are some space will be created for the PTI and the rest of the opposition if a wedge is drawn between these coalition partners. Indeed, it is the economy which has the potential to be the biggest variable in the new year.

After weeks of fire and fury, which seems to have culminated this Saturday in a slate of fresh convictions for the PTI’s senior leadership, Sunday saw leaders from both sides of the political divide regretting where things stand and ruminating on the possibility of talks.
Both sides seemingly agree that a negotiated compromise is the only way out of the socio-legal-political morass they have managed to drag the country into. There is no denying the logic of that suggestion. But there is a strong sense of déjà vu regarding its timing. Last year, too, there had been similar talk about negotiations and the need thereof as the year was about to close. There had even been some hope — more than there is now, for certain — that the ice may finally break and we may see a long-awaited resolution.

 

Instead, the effort had all but collapsed before the first month of 2025 was out. What followed was another round of vindictive, scorched-earth politics that, before the end of the year, had left the country saddled with the 27th Amendment. At no point in this latest bout of skirmishing did either side look like it was winning.
Indeed, their vendetta, ongoing since 2022, has only created losers so far. It would now seem that this fact has never been lost on the stakeholders — otherwise, they would not still be discussing talks as the “only way out”. But one wishes it were that simple. Unfortunately, both factions forgot, at key moments, that even when one is fighting, they must leave room for a retreat. Both sides have, by now, said and done many things which have made it increasingly difficult for them to extricate themselves from the present crisis.
The opposition parties have now floated the idea of a new Charter of Democracy, and senior PML-N leaders are also backing calls for a political dialogue. Now is as good a time as any to give it another go. But with so much baggage on both sides, nothing less than a sweeping revision of the rules of engagement may do. A formal reset is the only possible motivation for both sides to bury the past.
The ruling parties are responsible for making the first move by virtue of holding more power. They must consider easing some of the difficulties faced by the opposition. The opposition parties, too, have a responsibility not to make rapprochement efforts more difficult than they need to be. Their inflexible preconditions in the past have unravelled the negotiation process well before anything substantial could be achieved. Both sides must remain within the bounds of reason and approach this with sincerity. Much depends on it.

After student leader Osman Hadi’s assassination, crises on both the external and internal fronts have deepened in Bangladesh, which has halted all consular and visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi, while the nation grapples with unrest stemming from arrests, journalists’ protests, and threats of a government overthrow.
“Due to unavoidable circumstances, all consular and visa services from the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi are temporarily suspended until further notice,” a notice posted by the Bangladesh mission said. “Any inconvenience caused is sincerely regretted.”
The move came two days after a demonstration by 20 to 25 people outside the diplomatic mission in New Delhi. Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain told reporters on Sunday that Bangladesh High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah received death threats from the protesters.
However, Indian Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Sunday there was no attempt to breach the mission’s security and that police dispersed the small group within minutes.
The protesters were demonstrating against the killing of a garment worker, Dipu Chandra Das, in Bangladesh and demanding protection for minorities, he said.
Tensions have been reciprocal. On Sunday, the Indian Visa Application Centre in the Bangladeshi city of Chattogram suspended its operations, citing security concerns at India’s mission there. High commissioners for both countries have been summoned by their respective host governments.
The developments indicated increasing friction between the two nations, as The Daily Star noted that these developments point to diplomatic tensions escalating towards a crisis and advised that both Delhi and Dhaka should work towards reducing the tensions.
Threats to interim govt
The turmoil stems from the killing of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in a pro-democracy uprising last year that ousted former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has since taken refuge in India. Masked gunmen shot Hadi earlier this month, and he died from his injuries on Thursday.
His death ignited furious protests, with mobs setting fire to several buildings, including the offices of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo, two of the country’s leading newspapers, which some protesters perceive as favourable to India.
In response, the student group Inqilab Moncho on Monday threatened a movement to remove the interim government, holding it responsible for Hadi’s death. The group demanded the immediate resignations of the home adviser, his special assistant and the law adviser for failing to provide security.
“Justice must be ensured before the election; no election will take place before that,” Abdullah Al Jaber, member secretary of the group, said at a press conference.
He warned that activists would not leave the streets until Hadi’s killers are brought to justice and would topple the government if their demands were not met.
The group also called for an international investigation by agencies like the FBI or Scotland Yard. Law Adviser Asif Nazrul responded by announcing the murder case would be tried at a speedy trial tribunal, with a verdict expected within 90 days of the police report being filed.
Journalists’ protest
Meanwhile, journalists in Dhaka held a human chain protest on Monday to condemn the arson attacks and threats against the press. Media leaders said threats have escalated from debates over free expression to concerns for their very survival.
“On social media, we have seen messages saying journalists of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo should be hunted down and killed in their homes,” said Mahfuz Anam, editor and publisher of The Daily Star. “This is no longer about opinions. These are murder threats.”
He made the remarks while delivering a solidarity speech at a joint protest titled “Bangladesh Under the Attack of Mob Viole­nce”, organised by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) at a hotel in Dhaka.
Nahid Islam, convener of the National Citizen Party (NCP), today said they believe the attacks involved a section of the government and had political backing. “The whole incident was planned,” he said.
AK Azad said about 28 journalists were trapped inside The Daily Star’s office during the firebombing and claimed that pleas for help were ignored until after the attack was over. He said security forces were present but did not intervene.
He also announced plans to hold a conference in Dhaka for journalists from across the country in mid-January, vowing to continue protests until those responsible for recent arson attacks on The Daily Star and Prothom Alo are brought to justice.
Nurul Kabir, editor of the New Age daily, said the attackers intended to kill. “They set newspaper offices on fire and blocked the fire service from entering,” he said. “This clearly shows they wanted to burn people alive simply because they disagreed with them.”
Arrests and violence
Separately, Police said they have arrested 17 people in connection with the newspaper attacks. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner SN Nazrul Islam said officers exercised restraint to avoid casualties among the 4,000 to 5,000 protesters.
“The fact that no human life was lost in such a major incident is what we see as our achievement,” he said, adding that social media misinformation had inflamed the situation.
Political figures from across the spectrum have voiced concern over the escalating violence as the country prepares for general elections in February.
“Today, democracy itself has been attacked,” said Mirza Fakh­rul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of the opposition Bangla­desh Nationalist Party. “This is the time for all democratic people to unite.”
The broader unrest was highlighted by a separate incident where Border Guard Bangladesh intensified surveillance along the Benapole border after an NCP leader, Md Motaleb Shikdar, was shot and injured in Khulna.

During a five-hour-long hearing, the prosecution recorded statements of eight witnesses in the case registered against 11 suspects, including Ms Khan.
Aleema Khan appeared before the court along with her counsel while prosecutor Faisal Malik represented the state. The acquittal application was formally taken up by the court, which sought responses from the relevant parties.
The defence side, however, requested that further proceedings be scheduled after the winter vacation. Accepting the request, the court adjourned the hearing till Jan 2.
Earlier, Ms Khan apprised the court during the proceedings that 11 books had been submitted with a request that they be delivered to the PTI founder. The court informed her that the books had been received by the PTI founder and that a confirmation report had been received from the jail authorities. Aleema Khan thanked the court for ensuring the delivery.
The case pertains to the Nov 26 protest, in which a nu­­­mber of PTI leaders face trial before the anti-terrorism co­­urt. The witnesses inc­luded Noor Ahmed of PID, Nader Khan of Pemra, Muh­a­mmad Sabtain of NCCIA, Inspector Yaqub Shah of Ra­­walpindi police, and jail ad­­­ditional superintendent Ali Amir Shah, among others.
On the other hand, Mr Khan could not sign the papers of attorney, enabling his lawyers to file an appeal against his recent conviction in Toshakhana case.
According to Advocate Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry, the jail authorities kept him waiting for three hours and then refused his meeting with Mr Khan for taking his signature on the papers of attorney.

KARACHI: As political parties from the ruling and opposition camps propose talks to end the political confrontation, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Monday demanded fresh elections across the country to do away with the governments allegedly born out of rigging.
Positioning himself as the one political figure courted by both the government and the opposition, Maulana Fazl declared that the 2018 and 2024 polls were “rigged and did not reflect the will of the people”.
Standing alongside the government’s key ally, MQM-P’s appointed Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, Maulana Fazl questioned the legitimacy of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government while also, without naming it, casting doubt on the past record of the country’s largest opposition party, the PTI.
“Fresh elections must be held,” he responded to a question. “Neither the 2018 elections nor the 2024 polls reflected the will of the people. The governments born out of establishment-backed rigging should come to an end. From Sindh to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, these governments should be brought to an end and fresh elections must be held across the country.”
This is not the first time he has demanded snap polls; in fact, less than a week after the Feb 8 elections, his party had rejected its results and demanded fresh polls. The JUI-F chief made a similar call in September last year as his party engaged the PTI as well as the ruling coalition, apparently to make a political comeback. The JUI-F was also instrumental in the passage of the 26th Amendment.

 

Speaking at Governor’s House, where he was conferred an honorary doctorate from Sir Syed University, Maulana Fazl warned that the government’s current actions were “making the Constitution controversial and disputed”. He was referring to the 27th Amendment, which was passed despite opposition from his party.
Responding to a question, Maulana Fazl described the 27th Amendment as legislation passed through a “forced majority,” but at the same time, he defended the 26th Amendment passed last year, in which he had played a key role.
“The 26th Amendment was passed by consensus, so it is not appropriate to make it disputed,” he said. “The 27th Amendment, however, was one-sided. You did not have a majority, meaning the majority was created through force. Then, all those things from which you stepped back in the 26th Amendment were included in the 27th Amendment, which is why the Constitution is now being seen as disputed. We should avoid turning the Constitution into a subject of dispute.”
Tensions with Afghanistan
When asked to comment on recent tensions with Afghanistan, the JUI-F chief questioned the government’s policies and urged the authorities on both sides of the border not to drag people into the internal state matters because of state actions.
“Afghanistan should not be viewed only in today’s context,” he said. “We should discuss 78 years of our Afghan policy. Pakistan has never had a truly friendly government in Afghanistan. Could this be a failure of our own policy? If we build any narrative, we would definitely put the blame on the other side, but we need to take a look at ourselves as well and ask whether our Afghan policy has failed. This should be a matter of debate.”
When asked about his opinion on the proposed deployment of the armed forces in Gaza, he referred to “bitter experiences of the past” and asked the government to “refrain from this and avoid making ourselves controversial”.
“A so-called peacekeeping force is not really about peacekeeping – it becomes a war-fighting force. We should avoid making the mistake of becoming part of an international alliance and then turning our guns on Palestinians. We must refrain from this and avoid making ourselves controversial,” he said in reference to the US-proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF).
Later, addressing a conference of clerics, Maulana Fazl defended the role of seminaries and warned that any government action to undermine them under any regulatory cover would put the educational fate of thousands of students at risk. He also criticised “attempts to force” seminaries to obtain certificates from the education ministry and called for the independence of religious institutions.
“We announced at the all-parties conference in Lahore that the agreements reached by our senior scholars will not be reopened for discussion,” he said.
Addressing curriculum debates, the Maulana said that scholars have long strived to create a cohesive syllabus, but their recommendations were often ignored. He expressed support for modern subjects alongside religious studies.

Lockheed Martin, the US aerospace and defence company that manufactures F-16 fighter aircraft, has been named the principal contractor.—AFP/file

 
• Lockheed Martin picked as main contractor; $686m deal aims to extend fleet service life until 2040• US Congress was earlier notified of the proposed sale, didn’t raise any objections
WASHINGTON: A US military upgrade package for Pakistan’s F-16 fighter fleet, worth $686 million, has been cleared through a statutory congressional notification process.
Lockheed Martin, the US aerospace and defence company that manufactures the F-16 fighter aircraft, and has long been responsible for its design, upgrades, and sustainment programmes for international operators, has been named the principal contractor for the proposed sale.
The sale was processed under existing authorities provided by the Arms Export Control Act and annual appropriations laws.
These provisions allow the executive branch to obligate and disburse funds once Congress has been formally notified and does not object within the required time period.
The Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) approved Pakistan’s request for a $686 million Foreign Military Sale (FMS) covering F-16 hardware, software upgrades and sustainment support, and formally notified the US Congress of this decision.
Under US law, this approval does not mean the sale bypassed congressional oversight. Once the DSCA issues its notification, Congress is provided a mandatory 30-day review period during which lawmakers may object or introduce a resolution to block the transaction.
If no objection is raised within this timeframe — which is the norm — the sale is considered to have received congressional approval. A separate vote is required only if Congress chooses to intervene.
This process is built into the legal framework governing US arms transfers. The DSCA is authorised to manage such transactions through mechanisms like Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and Foreign Military Financing (FMF).
These programmes typically rely on the purchasing country’s own funds, or on US loans or grants that have already been approved at the executive level by the President and the State Department — as is the case with Pakistan’s F-16 package.
Upgrade package
Published on the congressional website last week, the notification states that the proposed sale is intended to extend the service life of Pakistan’s Block-52 and midlife-upgrade F-16 aircraft through 2040, while preserving interoperability with the US and partner forces.
Major defence equipment accounts for $37m of the total value, with the remaining $649m covering sustainment, refurbishment, and modernisation services.
The package includes 92 Link-16 tactical data-link systems and six inert Mk-82 500-pound bomb bodies for integration and testing.
Other elements cover avionics upgrades, secure communications and navigation equipment, cryptographic devices, mission-planning tools, as well as software and hardware modifications.
Training systems, munitions testing and reprogramming equipment, and associated spare parts are also included.
Sensitive components include Mode-5 identification friend-or-foe systems, handheld key loaders, and reprogramming equipment for munitions built-in-test functions. Some items are classified as secret.
Pakistan first submitted its request for F-16 upgrades in 2021-22. While the DSCA consistently supported the proposal, the Biden administration chose not to act at the time, even though the notification mechanism was available. A notification was issued in December 2024, but no further action followed.
A fresh notification was sent to Congress in December 2025 under the Trump administration. Once the statutory notification window closed with no objection raised, the proposed sale was approved in accordance with US law.
US rationale
In its official statement, the DSCA said the sale would support US foreign policy and national security objectives by enabling Pakistan to retain interoperability with Washington and partner forces.
“It will strengthen cooperation in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and help prepare for future contingency operations,” the agency said.
The statement added that refurbishing and upgrading Pakistan’s F-16 fleet would address critical flight-safety concerns and improve integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force during combat operations, exercises, and training.
The DSCA said Pakistan was expected to absorb the articles and services without difficulty and stressed that the proposed sale “will not alter the basic military balance in the region”.
Implementation of the sale will not require additional US government or contractor personnel in Pakistan and will have no adverse impact on American defence readiness.
The US government said it was not aware of any offset agreement linked to the proposed sale; any such arrangement would be determined through negotiations between Pakistan and the contractor.

According to the Reuters news agency, the over $4 billion deal, one of Pakistan’s largest-ever weapons sales, will see arms sold to the Libyan National Army (LNA).
It was finalised after a meeting last week between Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir and Saddam Khalifa Haftar, deputy commander-in-chief of the LNA, in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, officials said.
Although foreign ministry, defence ministry and military did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment, military officials called it “historic in terms of size and financial impact”.

JF-17s, Super Mushak aircraft on LNA’s ‘shopping list’, said to be valued over $4bn

A copy of the deal before it was finalised that was seen by Reuters listed the purchase of several JF-17 fighter jets, jointly developed by Pakistan and China, and a number of Super Mushak trainer aircraft, used for basic pilot training.

 

A Pakistani official told Reuters the deal included the sale of equipment for land, sea and air, spread over 2-1/2 years, adding it could also include the JF-17 fighter jets.
Since 2011, the United Nations has imposed an arms embargo on the fractured North African country, which means transfers of weapons and related material require UN approval.
However, senior Pakistani military officials justified the arms sale, saying that many major western and Middle Eastern states have been supplying weapons and equipment to Libya for many years despite the embargo.
Calling it a “paper embargo” which is virtually “non-existent due to multiple reasons”, the sources said the move was in line with the prime minister and army chief’s vision for “an export driven self sustained economy”.
The internationally-recognised Government of National Unity, led by Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, controls much of western Libya, while Haftar’s LNA controls the east and south, including major oilfields, and does not recognise the Unity government’s authority.
According to Reuters, any arms agreement with the LNA is likely to face scrutiny given Libya’s long-running instability following a 2011 Nato-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and split the country between rival authorities.
The LNA’s official media channel reported on Sunday that the faction had entered a defence cooperation pact with Pakistan, which included weapons sales, joint training and military manufacturing, without providing details.
“We announce the launch of a new phase of strategic military cooperation with Pakistan,” Haftar said in remarks broadcast on Sunday by Al-Hadath television.
Authorities in Benghazi also did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Pakistan has been seeking to expand defence exports, drawing on decades of counterinsurgency experience and a domestic defence industry that spans aircraft production and overhaul, armoured vehicles, munitions and naval construction.
“Our recent war with India demonstrated our advanced capabilities to the world,” CDF Munir was quoted as saying in remarks broadcast by Al-Hadath on Sunday.

Excavators demolish a building in Wadi Qaddum area, near the Silwan neighbourhood of East Jerusalem.—AFP

 
JERUSALEM: Israeli bulldozers tore through a four-storey buil­ding in east Jerusalem on Monday, leaving scores of Palestinian residents unsure where to go after their doors were broken down in the middle of the night by authorities enforcing hasty evictions.
The building was the latest in a series of residential structures to be razed as Israeli officials target what they describe as unauthorised construction in the city’s annexed east — a campaign that local Palestinian officials characterised as a “systematic policy” to displace residents.



 
“The demolition is a tragedy for all residents,” Eid Shawar, who lives in the building, said.
Located in the Silwan neighbourhood near the Old City, the building comprised a dozen apartments housing approximately 100 people, many of them women, children, and elderly residents.

Activists accuse Israeli authorities of designating areas in Silwan to advance settlement interests

“They broke down the door while we were asleep and told us we could only change our clothes and take essential papers and documents,” said Shawar, a father of five.
With nowhere else to go, Shawar, 38, said his seven-member family would have to sleep in his car.
“They are destroying my bedroom,” lamented one woman, as she watched the heavy machines rip through the building.
Three bulldozers began tearing down the structure early on Monday as residents looked on, their clothes and belongings scattered across nearby streets, a journalist saw.
Israeli police cordoned off surrounding roads, with security forces deployed across the area and positioned on the rooftops of neighbouring houses.
By midday, a large part of the building had already been razed to the ground.
Built on privately owned Palestinian land, the structure had been slated for demolition for lacking a permit, activists said.
‘Systematic policy’
Two Israeli NGOs, Ir Amin and Bimkom, said the demolition was the largest carried out in 2025, adding in a statement that “around 100 East Jerusalem families have lost their homes”.
Palestinians face severe obstacles in obtaining building permits due to Israel’s restrictive planning policies, according to activists, an issue that has fuelled tensions in East Jerusalem and across the occupied West Bank for years.
The building’s destruction “is part of a systematic policy aimed at forcibly displacing Palestinian residents and emptying the city of its original inhabitants”, the Jeru­sa­lem governorate, affiliated with the Ramallah-based Palestin­ian Authority, said in a statement.
“Any demolition that expels residents from their homes constitutes a clear occupation plan to replace the land’s owners with settlers.” On Sunday, Israel approved the establishment of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, part of a rapid expansion, but considered illegal under international law.
Activists, however, accuse Israeli authorities of frequently designating areas in East Jerusalem as national parks or open spaces to advance Israeli settlement interests.
Silwan begins at the foot of the Old City, where hundreds of Israeli settlers live among nearly 50,000 Palestinians.
The demolition there was “carried out without prior notice, despite the fact that a meeting was scheduled” on Monday to discuss steps to legalise the structure, Ir Amin and Bimkom said in their statement.

ISLAMABAD: With the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited (PIACL) — the country’s most high-profile transaction of a state-owned entity — scheduled for today (Tuesday), the government is making all-out efforts to prevent a repeat of what happened the last time the airline went under the hammer.
Three parties are currently in the hunt to acquire 75pc shares in the flag carrier — consortiums led by AirBlue, Arif Habib Pvt Ltd and Lucky Cement, following the exit of the Fauji Fertiliser Company (FFC).
But thanks to a unique stipulation, the two unsuccessful bidders will be excluded from any future role in the airline’s management, according to Privatisation Minister Muhammad Ali.
In recent remarks, the minister explained that losing bidders will have no right to join the winning bidder, and only those groups who were not party to the auction would be able to join the new management.
This means that while only one of the three consortiums currently in the running for the flag carrier will become part of its administration upon acquisition of a majority stake, FFC retains the option to join with them subsequently, if it wishes to.
Ahead of Tuesday’s bidding, reports surfaced of a behind-the-scenes deal involving at least two of the parties involved — the Arif Habib and Lucky Cement groups — that reportedly fell through.
In a tweet, journalist Kamran Khan alluded to a meeting where it was proposed to split the controlling stake among three of the four interested parties. However, Mr Khan claimed, this arrangement fell through as one of the parties — i.e. the Muhammad Ali Tabba-led Lucky Cement group — did not agree to it.







Both Mr Tabba and a high-ranking government official privy to developments confirmed this, but clarified that this was not a government-brokered mee­ting, but rather an informal interaction.
Talking to Dawn, Mr Tabba expressed unwavering confidence in the privatisation process, and clarified that the proposal was floated to him after a meeting in Islamabad, which he did not pursue.
On Monday, the Privatisation Commission announced that sealed bids will be submitted around 10:30am on Tuesday by the bidders.
The reference price for the bidding will only be approved by the Privatisation Commission Board and the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation after bids have been received.
The bids will then be opened in a ceremony, scheduled for 3:30pm, in the presence of the bidders.
Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation, Muhammad Ali will also hold a press conference after the conclusion of the bidding process. The whole process would be telecast live and streamed across all TV channels as well as respective social media handles of the government, which will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the last time the airline went under the hammer.
At the time, only one bidder had come forward to participate in the auction, and Blue World City offered a paltry Rs10bn bid for a 60pc stake in the flag carrier, against the reference price of Rs85bn.
The Privatisation Commission said it had asked the bidder to match the minimum bid, but Blue World City declined to do so.

“Meetings with Khan will remain suspended till Feb 8,” the minister said while speaking on Geo News’ show ‘Capital Talk’, in reply to a question by the show’s host about whether meetings with Imran would remain suspended.
As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.
Chaudhry maintained that the prison is “not the headquarters of a political party”, and criticised the PTI for “spreading venom against institutions and leaders of the institutions“.
The PML-N leader said that regular meetings were held between PTI leaders and its founder in Adiala jail in the past, and the government had no issues. However, he stated that the meetings then turned into political press conferences outside the prison, and the opposition party started to create narratives, which were then “run by Indian media”.
Responding to the minister, PTI‘s Barrister Ali Zafar said the the Constitution of the country considers solitary confinement akin to torture, adding the Chaudhry’s statement is against human rights, international and local laws.
“PTI asks party leaders and parliamentarians to gather outside Adiala prison to express solidarity with Khan, but the government uses water canons and violence against peaceful protesters.”
Last week, water cannons were used to disperse Imran‘s sisters, party leaders and PTI workers after they staged sit-ins outside the Adiala prison against the officials’ refusal to let them meet with the ex-premiere.
Zafar maintained that the PTI “will not back down till we meet with Khan”.
He elaborated that if the government considered the possibility of dialogue to break the current political impasse and was sincere about moving forward, then meetings with Imran would be part of the process.
Prison meetings with Imran used to plan PTI protests: Sanaullah
Meanwhile, Prime Minister‘s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said prison meetings with Imran had been suspended because they were being used to plan and coordinate a large protest in Islamabad to mark the anniversary of the PTI’s November 26, 2024, march to the capital.
On November 26, 2024, Islamabad witnessed pitched battles between security forces and PTI supporters as the latter inched towards the heavily barricaded D-Chowk for the party’s ‘final call’ powershow, with intense teargas shelling used to disperse the protesters.
A late-night crackdown by the government ended in a hasty retreat of the PTI’s top leadership and supporters, following which the party abruptly suspended its protest movement.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, Sanaullah said that the party founder and his sister were discussing preparations for a large protest on November 26 this year before the meetings were suspended.
“Before the meetings were stopped four or five weeks ago, they discussed that on November 26, 2025, they would arrange a programme of this sort to mark what happened on that day in 2024,” he stated.
“The preparations, messaging and strategic planning were discussed in these meetings, which is why we stopped them,”
The PM’s aide added that stopping the meetings had led to rumours about Imran’s condition while incarcerated, including reports of poor health, and clarified that the PTI founder had “every facility available to him.”
Sanaullah said that statements by Imran’s sister Aleema Khan were “not her own words” and claimed that the party founder had outlined what she should say during a meeting with another sister, Uzma Khan, several weeks earlier.
Responding to a question about the TTAP’s nationwide strike call on February 8 next year, the PM’s aide said there would be no wheel-jam strike in “any street or neighbourhood” anywhere in Pakistan.
“The PM has tried negotiations four times. I do not know whether he has presented the option again,” he added. “From the other side, based on the response we are getting, do you think they want to resolve this through talks?”
Referring to KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s call for a march to Islamabad, Sanaullah asked, “Why would they be permitted to protest in Islamabad? Does he have a legal basis? He says he is coming to Islamabad armed and that he will either conquer the city or return in a coffin. Is this in the national interest?”
“We’ll see what kind of protests they stage and how different they are,” he added. “Sohail Afridi cannot come down from Peshawar and take over the country.”
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said, “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Earlier this month, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”</p><small>2025-12-23 02:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23074441d1e0d44.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962748/bipartisan-pair-drafts-contempt-resolution-against-pam-bondi-over-epstein-files' target='_blank'><strong>Bipartisan pair drafts contempt resolution against Pam Bondi over Epstein files</strong></a><br><p>• Massie, Khanna plan ‘inherent contempt’ over partial release; measure skips courts, only needs simple House majority vote• Justice Department restores Trump-Epstein photo after backlash; released trove remains heavily redacted• Officials say redactions necessary to protect active investigations, victim privacy
TWO US lawmakers from opposing parties threatened on Sunday to bring inherent inherent contempt proceedings against Attorney General Pam Bondi, accusing the Justice Department of defying a federal mandate to fully release its investigation files on late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, BBC News reported.
Republican Rep Thomas Massie, a leading advocate for the transparency legislation, said the department failed to meet Friday’s statutory deadline.
He argued the agency released heavily redacted material while withholding crucial internal documents regarding prosecutorial decisions, despite a law requiring full disclosure.
“The quickest way, and I think most expeditious way, to get justice for these victims is to bring inherent contempt against Pam Bondi, and that doesn’t require going through the courts,” Massie told CBS.
The congressman said he is drafting the measure alongside Democrat Rep Ro Khanna, signaling a bipartisan collaboration in the dispute over the documents.
Mr Khanna, appearing on the same programme, explained that inherent contempt could allow the House of Representatives to levy fines against Bondi for every day of noncompliance.
Inherent contempt is a seldom-used congressional authority that allows either the House or Senate to try and punish executive branch officials for obstructing the legislative process.
According to the American Bar Association, the power has not been invoked in nearly a century. Unlike impeachment, Massie noted, the move would only require a simple majority vote in the House of Representatives.
“We’re building a bipartisan coalition, and it would fine Pam Bondi for every day that she’s not releasing these documents,” Mr Khanna said.
The confrontation follows the Friday deadline established by a law President Donald Trump signed in November.
The legislation, born from pressure within the Republican Party and from advocates for sex abuse survivors, compelled the Department of Justice (DoJ) to release the full trove of information amassed during its two criminal investigations into Epstein.
While the department released thousands of pages, officials acknowledged withholding certain records.
The agency said it redacted personal information of victims, content showing child or physical abuse, and records endangering ongoing investigations or national security.

 

Mr Massie expressed frustration that the release provided limited new information regarding Epstein’s crimes and omitted internal memos that would explain controversial charging decisions made by prosecutors years ago.
“It’s very troubling the posture that they have taken,” Mr Massie said. “I won’t be satisfied until the survivors are satisfied.”
Ms Bondi has previously defended her agency’s conduct, describing herself as part of “the most transparent administration in American history”. The Justice Department has said more material will be released in the coming weeks.
Photo restored
Tensions flared further over the weekend after the department temporarily removed a specific file from its website: an image showing President Trump with Epstein, first lady Melania Trump and Epstein’s convicted associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
The removal sparked immediate backlash from Democrats on the House Oversight Committee, who asked in a social media post, “What else is being covered up?” Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche rejected accusations that the removal was politically motivated.
DoJ, in a post on X, said the image was taken down “out of an abundance of caution” because it was part of a batch of files containing unredacted images of women that required further review to protect victim privacy.







“It has nothing to do with President Trump,” Blanche told NBC News, calling the suggestion of political favouritism “laughable”. He noted that “there are dozens of photos of President Trump already released to the public seeing him with Mr Epstein”.
The image was reposted without alteration after officials determined no victims were depicted. The photograph captures a collection of framed pictures on a cabinet in one of Epstein’s homes. It also shows an open drawer filled with other photos.
The handling of the digital archive drew scrutiny beyond the single photo. At least 13 files mysteriously disappeared from the website by Saturday without explanation.
Observers noted inconsistencies in the redaction process within those files. While most women pictured on the wall had their faces obscured, one face was redacted in one file but visible in three others. Another face remained unredacted across all files.

In a letter to the prime minister, one of the national representative bodies of trade industry, said year 2025 once again proved to be an extreme challenging year for business and industry.
PBF President Kha­waja Mehboob-ur-Rehman said despite repeated commitments by successive governments, the fundamental demand of the business community for ease of doing business and a reduction in the cost of operations had not been addressed in a meaningful or sustainable manner.
The PBF said that persistently high input costs, soaring energy tariffs, and an increasingly uncompetitive tax regime continued to erode industrial productivity, weaken exports, and discourage both local and foreign investment. “These pressures have significantly reduced Pakistan’s ability to compete with regional economies that actively support their industries through competitive pricing and pro-growth fiscal policies,” Mr Rehman said.

Seeks PM Shehbaz’s intervention amid high input costs, artificial dollar control

The PBF’s letter for revival of business confidence coincided with a statement from Ministry of Finance saying the investor confidence was booming and the stock market had become ‘one of the best-performing markets in the world’. The ministry’s monthly report for November on the other hand, suggested 26pc drop in foreign direct investment in July-October period of current year over same period last year while portfolio investment recorded a 540m outflow and total foreign investment falling by 82.5pc.
Referring to the successful defence of the country by Pakistan’s armed forces in May, PBF said that while the nation demonstrated strength and unity on the security front, the next critical challenge was winning the economic battle. The business community, PBF emphasised, was ready to play its role, provided it was equipped with the necessary competitive tools to operate in regional and global markets.
Among these tools, the forum identified two reforms as absolutely critical — regionally competitive electricity tariffs, and regionally competitive corporate tax rates. “Without alignment on these fronts, Pakistani businesses will remain at a structural disadvantage compared to their counterparts in neighboring countries,” it said.
The PBF expressed serious concern that current economic policymaking, particularly within the Ministry of Finance, remained largely confined to compliance with IMF programme conditions, with insufficient focus on innovative, growth-oriented, and business-friendly solutions. On the other hand, dollar was kept under control artificially on higher side in the whole year despite reserves were on lower side.
PBF argued that sustainable economic recovery could not be achieved without empowering the business community, being the backbone of employment generation, exports, and revenue creation.
PBF also raised alarm over reports suggesting that electricity tariffs may be increased further potentially up to 15 cents a dollar per unit — as a measure to address circular debt. It warned that such an increase would further burden already distressed industries and could result in widespread downsizing or closure of industrial units, deepening unemployment and economic contraction.
Additionally, the forum also expressed disappointment over the recent formation of multiple economic committees and working groups without the inclusion of elected representatives of the business community. PBF emphasised that the absence of industry voices at the policymaking table prevented the government from fully understanding ground realities and crafting effective, implementable solutions.
Looking ahead to 2026, the PBF urged the premier to provide the business community with a clear, credible, and forward-looking economic roadmap. Such clarity was essential to restore confidence, encourage investment, and enable long-term planning. 
It emphasised that if the government provided an initial push through competitive energy pricing, rationalised taxation, and genuine stakeholder engagement, the business community will respond by delivering economic growth, employment generation, and export expansion.

The case was filed on the complaint of a local on July 17, 2024, and was registered at Kameer Police Station under FIR No. 710/24 in Sahiwal district.
The FIR stated that the “alleged incident of blasphemy occurred on July 17, 2024, but was registered four months later, supported by testimonies from two local witnesses“.
The court found the two individuals guilty of violating Sections 295-A and 295-C, Sections 7/9 of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997, and Section 11 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (PECA) 2016 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In his detailed verdict, the judge ruled that the convicts were separately sentenced to death and fined Rs500,000 under Section 295-C, 10 years imprisonment under Section 295-A, seven years under PECA 2016, and five years along with a fine of Rs50,000 under ATA 1997.
A senior police official of Sahiwal district told Dawn that “a total of 22 blasphemy-related cases were registered in Sahiwal district in 2025”.
This verdict marks one of the most severe punishments handed down by the court under blasphemy-related provisions during the current year.
Earlier in March, a Rawalpindi court had sentenced five men accused of blasphemy to death, life imprisonment and a total of 100 years in prison.
The same court had also sentenced four men to death for posting blasphemous content online in February.</p><small>2025-12-22 20:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640953-no-meetings-with-jailed-pti-founder-till-feb-8-says-minister' target='_blank'><strong>No meetings with jailed PTI founder till Feb 8, says minister</strong></a><br><p>

A special court sentenced PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years imprisonment in the Toshakhana-2 case on Saturday. In protest, the PTI announced it would observe a black day on Sunday against the conviction, as per an announcement posted on Imran’s social media account.
Following the protest call, extensive security arrangements had been put in place in Rawalpindi, with over 1,300 police personnel deployed to maintain law and order. Though the day passed peacefully, as not a single activist of PTI appeared on the roads.
Police said that a group of political workers. led by PTI leader Seemabia Tahir and nine others. gathered on Adiala Road on Sunday night at about 9:15pm.
The protesters, nine of whom were identified in the first information report, gathered on Adiala Road near Nasir Bakery and blocked the road, causing traffic congestion and public disorder, despite the enforcement of Section 144, a legal provision prohibiting public gatherings of more than five people.
Constable Rizwan Nazir lodged an FIR with Morgah Police Station, claiming that he was on security duty when some political activists, led by Tahir and carrying PTI flags while riding on motorcycles and in cars, gathered on the road. The protesters, who were chanting slogans, blocked the road and caused traffic congestion.
The FIR stated that the protesters were carrying batons, despite the constable informing them that they were violating Section 144. Instead of responding, they began shouting slogans against the government, incited by the former PTI MPA.
The police registered the FIR on the charges of blocking the road, violating Section 144 and under Section 16 (dissemination of rumours) of the MPO. Those booked were also charged under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.
Over the past several weeks, the PTI founder has been denied meetings in prison with his family, prompting his sisters and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to stage sit-ins near or outside the prison complex. These have sometimes been dispersed by police using water cannons and baton charges.</p><small>2025-12-22 16:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/221917456f89f13.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962637/air-india-aircraft-turns-back-after-drop-in-engine-oil-pressure-regulator-says' target='_blank'><strong>Air India aircraft turns back after drop in engine oil pressure, regulator says</strong></a><br><p>An Air India Boeing 777 aircraft had to turn back after a drop in oil pressure forced the pilots to turn off one of the jet’s engines, India’s aviation regulator said on Monday.
The aircraft, which was headed to India’s financial capital of Mumbai, landed safely back in Delhi and the incident will be investigated, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said in a statement. Modern aircraft are designed to safely fly and land on a single engine, if required.
Air India has been under intense scrutiny this year after the June 12 crash of a Boeing Dreamliner killed 260 people. The DGCA has flagged multiple safety lapses at the airline, which was previously owned by the government till 2022.
An Air India investigation into why one of its planes conducted commercial flights without an airworthiness permit found “systemic failures”, with the airline admitting it needed to do better on compliance, Reuters reported earlier this month.
On Monday, pilots observed a low engine oil pressure on the B777-300ER aircraft’s right-hand engine during flaps retraction after take-off. The pressure dropped to zero shortly thereafter, and the crew shut down the engine and turned back as per procedure, the DGCA said.
“Air India sincerely regrets [the] inconvenience caused due to this unforeseen situation. The aircraft is undergoing the necessary checks,” an Air India spokesperson said in a statement.
The aircraft is 15 years old and has flown to locations such as Vienna, Vancouver and Chicago, according to Flightradar24. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the incident.</p><small>2025-12-22 14:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22190815459ce36.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962635/islamabad-court-awards-rs54bn-compensation-to-families-of-airblue-crash-victims' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court awards Rs5.4bn compensation to families of AirBlue crash victims</strong></a><br><p>An additional district court in Islamabad awarded compensation amounting to Rs5.4 billion to the families of eight victims of the 2010 Airblue plane crash, which killed all 152 people aboard in the Margalla Hills.
The court, headed by Rasool Bashir Mirjat, dismissed an appeal filed by Airblue, upheld the airline’s liability in the case, and imposed a penalty of Rs1 million on the airline for delaying the proceedings.
Airblue Flight 202, which had taken off from Karachi in the morning, crashed into Islamabad’s Margalla Hills, killing all 152 people on board on July 28, 2010.
According to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) investigation report, the crash was classified as a “Controlled Flight into Terrain (CFIT), in which the aircrew failed to display superior judgment and professional skills in a self-created unsafe environment. In their pursuit to land in inclement weather, they committed serious violations of procedures and breaches of flying discipline, which put the aircraft in an unsafe condition over dangerous terrain at low altitude.”
The inquiry cited pilot error, including descent below the prescribed safe altitude and deviation from standard operating procedures during a circling approach in poor visibility. Investigators also highlighted poor cockpit resource management and challenging weather conditions, including rain and low clouds.
Subsequent court observations and reports also noted that errors by air traffic control contributed to the unsafe conditions leading up to the crash.
The court ruling marked a significant development in the long-running legal battle for compensation, which has spanned over 15 years. Families of the victims were repeatedly called for accountability and timely relief, saying prolonged litigation compounded their suffering.
Legal experts said the judgment could set an important precedent for aviation liability and compensation cases in Pakistan.
Most of the families were forced by Airblue to sign the release document and accept the First Tier Liability as their final compensation.
However, a few families adhered to the principle of fair compensation and led the court fight against Airblue, which ultimately resulted in them receiving fair compensation.</p><small>2025-12-22 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22170045b8982b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962630/local-bodies-polls-to-be-held-on-party-basis-punjab-govt-informs-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Local bodies polls to be held on ‘party basis’, Punjab govt informs LHC</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government on Monday told the Lahore High Court (LHC) that the local government (LG) elections in the province would be held on a “party basis”.
An assistant advocate general (AAG) shared this information about LG elections — which have been delayed for long and are not expected to be held before the second quarter of next year — during a hearing of petitions filed by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)-backed lawmaker Sheikh Imtiaz and others, who have challenged the Punjab Local Government Act 2025 (PLGA).
Contrary to the AAG’s claim, the local government law enacted in October states that the elections are to be held on a non-party basis.
But, the AAG submitted a report on behalf of the local government secretary today, which said that any political party wishing to contest the LG polls “may allow its candidates to contest elections for any political office on its ticket”.
“Section 55 of the PLGA does not, in any manner, put any party at a disadvantage compared to others,” he said.
At that, LHC Justice Sultan Tanvir Ahmad asked whether the petitioners’ grievances had been addressed as the government itself was saying that the LG elections would be party-based.
In this regard, the petitioner’s lawyer said that if that was the case, “then our concern to the extent of one point stands resolved”.
He requested that the government’s reply be made part of the record.
Justice Ahmad also heard Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) Director General (Law) Khurram Shahzad, who said the ECP was a constitutional body “ready to fulfil its duties”.
“The commission had written nearly 80 letters to the government over the past four years regarding holding local government elections and will conduct polls under whatever law the government enacted,” he maintained.
“The Punjab government had given a January 10 deadline for election preparations,” the ECP official added.
At one point, Justice Ahmad questioned why the Punjab advocate general’s office had not submitted a formal reply to the petitions challenging the local government law. He directed the advocate general to submit a reply by Tuesday.
“Certain provisions of the impugned act appear to be inconsistent with the Constitution,” the judge further observed.
He also commented that the matter needed to be decided “promptly”.
The PLGA 2025 was steamrolled from the Punjab Assembly in a matter of just five days, only after the ECP’s strong intervention and announcement to hold local government elections under the PLGA 2022 in the last week of December.
LG elections in Punjab have been delayed for long and the matter goes back to 2019. In April that year, the then PTI-led Punjab government had dissolved the local government institutions, which were later restored by the Supreme Court and subsequently completed their term on December 31, 2021.
Under Article 140-A of the Constitution and Section 219(4) of the Elections Act, the ECP is bound to hold elections within 120 days of the expiry of the term of the local government institutions.
This meant that LG elections in Punjab were supposed to be held by the end of April 2022, but it could not be made possible as the provincial government kept on amending the LG law from time to time.
This year, on Oct 8, the ECP ordered LG polls in December and asked Punjab to immediately start the delimitation exercise and complete the same within two months.
This order, however, was reversed in a meeting chaired by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja on Oct 21, in light of the new law, after a request by the Punjab government.
The ECP withdrew its original delimitation schedule for the elections issued under the 2022 local government law, giving the provincial government four weeks to finalise the delimitation and demarcation rules.
On October 31, the ECP said local government elections in Punjab would not be possible before the second quarter of next year as the commission would not have all the prerequisites to hold the electoral exercise during the current year.
The prerequisites are scheduled to be in place by January 10, 2026, following which the ECP would begin the delimitation process.
For its part, the opposition PTI said the new LG law was a sheer violation of Article 140 of the Constitution and decided to challenge the law in the court.
Article 140 says, “Each province shall, by law, establish a local government system and devolve political, administrative and financial responsibility and authority to the elected representatives of the local governments”.</p><small>2025-12-22 14:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2218055829658d5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962634/winter-vacations-to-begin-from-dec-23-in-colleges-across-punjab-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Winter vacations to begin from Dec 23 in colleges across Punjab: minister</strong></a><br><p>Winter vacations in colleges across Punjab will begin from December 23 and run till January 10, according to a revised schedule issued on Monday.
The Punjab Education Minister Rana Sikandar Hayat made the announcement in a post on the social media platform X.







Earlier this month, the Punjab government announced the winter vacation schedule for public and private schools in the province.
According to a notification by the School Education Department, the break will be from Dec 22 to Jan 10.
In Sindh, all schools and colleges will remain closed for winter vacations during the last week of the month, starting from Dec 22 till Dec 31.
Meanwhile, in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, the provincial government last week announced that winter vacation for the educational institutions will start from Jan 1 in the summer zone and run till Jan 15. In the winter zone, educational institutions will remain closed from Dec 23 till February 28.</p><small>2025-12-22 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2217242107fc4d9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962632/bangladeshi-student-leader-shot-in-khulna-report' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladeshi student leader shot in Khulna: report</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladeshi student political leader from the National Citizen Party (NCP) was shot and injured in Khulna on Monday, according to The Daily Star.
The development comes after Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka on December 16 while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He died last Thursday in Singapore after six days on life support.
According to The Daily Star, the injured 42-year-old Mohammad Motaleb Sikder is the NCP’s divisional chief in Khulna.
“Miscreants opened fire targeting his head around 11:45am (10:45am PKT) near Gazi Medical College Hospital in the city,” the paper reported, quoting Rafikul Islam, the officer-in-charge of Sonadanga Model Police Station. “He was rushed to Khulna Medical College Hospital in critical condition.”
Quoting the officer, the publication reported that Sidker was “out of danger”, as the bullet entered through one side of his ear, pierced the skin, and exited through the other side.
Following the attack on Hadi, violent protests broke out and several buildings, including those housing leading newspapers Prothom Alo and The Daily Star, were set on fire and vandalised, according to authorities.
In November, gunmen on motorbikes attacked a Bangladesh political rally, killing one person and wounding two others, including a candidate, as campaigning for February’s landmark elections was underway.
The shooting took place at a rally of the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), attended by hundreds in the port city of Chattogram, police said.</p><small>2025-12-22 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640894-punjab-announces-winter-vacations-for-educational-institutions' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab announces winter vacations for educational institutions</strong></a><br><p>

Jahangiri has found himself mired in a fake degree controversy since last year and has been facing legal proceedings in the SHC and IHC over the matter. While an IHC division bench, led by Chief Justice Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, ruled on December 18 that his degree was “invalid” and his elevation to the high court was “without lawful authority”, the SHC extended today its order under which KU’s August 2024 decision to cancel his degree remains suspended.
The order has been suspended until the next hearing, the date for which will be decided later.
The decision was taken by a two-judge bench, comprising Justices Yousuf Ali Saeed and Abdul Mobeen Lakho, as it heard a contempt plea filed against the KU Vice Chancellor (VC) Professor Khalid Mehmood Iraqi and Registrar Imran Ahmed Siddiqui.
Separately, Jahangiri‘s lawyer Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed said while speaking to the media at the court that “we filed a contempt application against KU as it concealed from the IHC“ the SHC order that suspended the varsity‘s “proceedings” in the case, as well as its decision to cancel Jahangiri’s law degree
During the hearing, KU VC Iraqi and Registrar Siddiqui appeared before the court and submitted affidavits.
The KU registrar argued that “now that the IHC has issued the final verdict, the contempt of court plea should be dismissed as it has become ineffective”.
He told the court that KU had not taken any action in compliance with SHC‘s October 3 order to suspend the cancellation of Jahangiri’s law degree.
“The IHC sought KU’s records via the Higher Education Commission,” he said.
Vice Chancellor Iraqi told the bench that the degree records were presented in court without any “alteration”.
The court directed Barrister Ahmed to receive replies submitted by the parties.
For his part, Barrister Ahmed argued that the case “should be heard soon”, highlighting the “urgency” of the matter.
Justice Saeed observed: “Today is the last day of this bench; the bench will hear the case as per the roster after the winter vacations.”
Following this observation, the bench extended its interim order till the next hearing.
During his media talk, Barrister Ahmed said the bench had observed that it was their last working day today and suggested that an “urgency application” may be filed later by Jahangiri’s side.
The lawyer also contended that while IHC CJ Dogar observed in his ruling on December 18 that the SHC had barred KU from taking any further action, it was not the case. “KU was not just stopped from further action, but their cancellation order had been suspended”.
He further added that “legally, the order remains suspended to date. IHC has taken a decision based on something which does not exist. A judge has been removed from office on [the basis of] an order that was suspended and remains suspended”.</p><small>2025-12-22 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2216122726a3059.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962628/pakistan-played-fearless-not-careless-cricket-to-win-under-19-asia-cup-says-head-coach' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan played ‘fearless, not careless’ cricket to win Under-19 Asia Cup, says head coach</strong></a><br><p>Head coach Shahid Anwer said that Pakistan had achieved their goal of playing “fearless but not careless cricket” after they won the Under-19 Asia Cup with a crushing victory over India on Sunday.
Opener Sameer Minhas led the way for Pakistan at the ICC Academy Ground in Dubai with a breathtaking 172 to set up a massive 191-run victory for his side.
“We began a process on June 17 [this year],” recalled Shahid at a news conference in Islamabad on Monday, following the team’s arrival and a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif where a Rs10million cash award was announced.
“It was an unprecedented step … we called up 70 players, conducted trials and gave each player four matches each and then they participated in a regional One-day tournament,” he added.
“The top performers, 30 of them, then took part in a five-month long camp … that’s how the team was made.
“We wanted to play fearless but not careless cricket. We wanted a united team and the result is in front of us.”
Team mentor and manager Sarfaraz Ahmed, who led Pakistan to the Under-19 World Cup crown in 2006, hailed a “team effort”.







“We had players that had the potential to do something big,” said Sarfaraz.
“The coaches did a lot of hard work and the players responded … our job was to give them the confidence to play to their full potential. My message to them was to play their natural game, and in a way that they remember it for the rest of their lives.”
Captain Farhan Yousaf said the players had the full backing of the team management.
“We spoke about playing fearless cricket and the management backed us to play our natural game,” he said.
“We were told us that any loss will be our [management’s] concern, while any victory will be attributed to your efforts. Our morale never went down.”
Shahid pointed to the fact that the coaching staff was lucky to have been blessed with qualified players.
“In age group cricket, most of the work is on basics,” he said. “We were lucky in the sense that these players had two qualities that we only needed to polish: one that they didn’t give up and second that they were adaptable.”
Sameer’s stunning ton was naturally one of the major talking points at the news conference and the batter said that he stuck to his natural game.
“I was focused on doing well and making runs in the final and that helped me,” said Sameer.
The political rivalry between India and Pakistan, more often than not, spills onto the cricket field and Sarfaraz said he made sure his players did not make any vile gestures in response to their counterparts.
India skipped the customary handshakes; a practice they have been carrying on since the men’s Asia Cup T20 earlier this year while one of their batters, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, made a ‘shoe-pointing’ gesture after his dismissal.
“India’s behavior regarding the game was not good, and their players’ conduct was unethical,” he said. “But we celebrated the victory, displaying sportsman’s spirit.”</p><small>2025-12-22 11:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/221231512594073.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623/bangladesh-rejects-indias-dismissal-of-protest-outside-its-high-commission-in-delhi-as-misleading-propaganda' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh rejects India’s dismissal of protest outside its high commission in Delhi as ‘misleading propaganda’</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh has rejected India’s dismissal of a protest outside its high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”, saying the incident was “highly regrettable“.
According to Bangladeshi media, around 20 to 25 protesters gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Saturday evening. According to mission officials, the protesters raised anti-Bangladesh slogans and issued threats against the Bangladesh high commissioner, Prothom Alo reported.
In response, the Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal issued a statement on Sunday saying India had taken note of “misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident”.
“The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on December 20 and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh,” he said.
According to Prothom Alo, Das — a garment factory worker — was beaten to death on December 18 in Mymensingh, Bangladesh on allegations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire. It reported that 10 people had been arrested in connection with the incident.
“There was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. The police stationed at the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes,” the Indian official said.
“Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions/posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention,” he added.
“India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice,” he said.
In response, the Bangldesh foreign ministry issued a statement, saying that the “unjustifiable incident at the Bangladesh High Commission residence in New Delhi on December 20 is highly regrettable and cannot be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’”.







“The miscreants were allowed to carry out their activities right outside the perimeters of the high commission, creating panic among the personnel inside the complex,” it said, adding that the commission was not made aware of the event beforehand.
The statement, however, took note of the Indian government’s “commitment” towards the safety of Bangladeshi diplomatic posts in India.
Bangladesh also rejected “an attempt of the Indian authorities to depict an isolated attack on a Bangladeshi citizen, who happens to belong to the Hindu community, as attacks on minorities“.
The statement said that the government “promptly apprehended the suspects in this incident“. It noted that “the intercommunal situation in Bangladesh is better than in many other parts in South Asia”.
“Bangladesh believes that it is the duty of all governments in the region to ensure protection of minorities in their respective countries,” the statement added.
Ties between the two countries have been frosty since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising last year.
Dhaka has repeatedly asked for her extradition so that she could stand trial for her alleged crimes, with Delhi responding that it was examining the requests.
On Thursday, protesters, seeking the repatriation of Hasina, were stopped from marching towards an Indian diplomatic mission.
A day earlier, India’s foreign ministry had conveyed its concerns over the “deteriorating” security environment in the country, following protests triggered by the killing of a prominent youth leader.</p><small>2025-12-22 11:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640862-lhc-suspends-implementation-of-punjab-property-ownership-ordinance' target='_blank'><strong>LHC suspends implementation of Punjab Property Ownership Ordinance</strong></a><br><p>

Kyiv has not commented on the incident, but Russian investigators said they were probing whether the blast was “linked” to “Ukrainian special forces”.
The attack was similar to other assassinations of generals and pro-war figures that have either been claimed, or are widely believed to have been orchestrated, by Ukraine.
Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head of the Russian General Staff’s training department, was killed when the bomb, which had been placed under his parked car, detonated in a residential quarter of southern Moscow.
AFP reporters at the scene saw a mangled white Kia SUV, its doors and back window blown out. The frame was twisted and charred from the blast.
The scene had been cordoned off by security forces, and investigators were sifting through the debris. Eyewitnesses reported a loud bang.
“We absolutely didn’t expect it. We thought we were safe, and then this happens right next to us,” local resident, Tatiana, 74, told AFP.
“The windows rattled, you could tell it was an explosion,” said Grigory, 70, who also declined to give his surname.
“We need to treat it more calmly. It’s the cost of war,” he added.
Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it was “working through various lines of enquiry into the murder. One of them involves the possible organisation of the crime by Ukrainian special services“.
Sarvarov fought in the Russian army’s campaigns in the North Caucasus, including Chechnya in the 1990s, according to his official biography on the defence ministry’s website.
He also commanded Russian forces in Syria in 2015-16.
Talks intensify
The Kremlin said Putin had been informed about Monday’s killing, which came after three days of talks in Miami as the United States intensifies its efforts to broker an end to the four-year war.
Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov and US special envoy Steve Witkoff hailed “progress” in the negotiations on Sunday.
Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev also met with the US team, which included Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law.
Witkoff had also called those meetings “productive and constructive.”
An initial 28-point plan to end the war put forward by Trump adhered to Moscow’s core demands, triggering panic in Kyiv and European capitals.
Ukraine and its allies have since been working to refine the plan, though Kyiv says it is still being asked to make massive concessions, such as giving up the entire eastern Donbas region to Russia.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed scepticism over whether Russia really wants to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands and decimated eastern and southern Ukraine.
The Kremlin on Monday also denied that it wanted to recreate the Soviet Union, seize the whole of Ukraine and more land in eastern Europe after Reuters reported that US intelligence had concluded Putin seeks much more than just control over eastern Ukraine.
Since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has been blamed for several attacks targeting Russian military officials and pro-Kremlin personalities in Russia and in Russian-controlled Ukrainian regions.
General Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy of the General Staff, was killed in a car blast near Moscow in April.
In December 2024, Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian radiological, chemical and biological defence forces, was killed when a booby-trapped electric scooter exploded in Moscow, an attack claimed by Ukraine’s SBU security service.
A Russian military blogger, Maxim Fomin, was killed when a statuette exploded in a Saint Petersburg café in April 2023.
And in August 2022, a car bomb killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of ultranationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640846-pakistan-rolls-out-247-digital-monitoring-system-to-speed-up-passport-processing' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rolls out 24/7 digital monitoring system to speed up passport processing</strong></a><br><p>

Justice Neelum issued the ruling during a hearing of petitions by Abida Parveen and others that challenged decisions pertaining to property disputes taken under the ordinance. Through her interim order, she also suspended decisions taken under the new legislation to take away the possession of properties.
Expressing her disapproval of the law, she remarked: “Someone should inform the government that if this law remains in force, even Jati Umra (the Sharif family residence) could be vacated within half an hour.
“It appears that some people want to hold all powers.”
Questioning the purpose of the law, CJ Neelum asked how could a revenue officer hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.
The judge observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights and judicial supremacy.
“If it is up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Constitution,” she added.
Justice Neelum further pointed out that in case of a deputy commissioner handing over the possession of an individual’s house to someone else under the new law, the affected person did not have the right to appeal.
“The new law does not allow the high court to grant a stay in such matters,” she noted.
The Punjab chief secretary and other government officials were present at the hearing today, but the Punjab advocate general did not appear before the court. The court was told that the principal law officer was ill.
On this explanation, Justice Neelum remarked that she, too, was ill and had been advised bed rest, but was in the court presiding over proceedings.
The CJ then said that a full bench would be constituted to further proceed on the matter adjourned the hearing.
Separately, a Punjab law officer explained to Dawn that the Punjab government could challenge the LHC’s interim order before the Supreme Court under its appellate jurisdiction.
The officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the provincial government could approach the Federal Constitutional Court as well, since that case involved a question of law.
“The government may also request the proposed full bench to review the stay order. However, its chances of obtaining relief through that route are relatively slim,” he added.
The ordinance in question was approved by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on October 31 and mandates the resolution of land disputes within 90 days.
It has been challenged before the LHC, and during a previous hearing on the matter, Justice Neelum had questioned the involvement of a newly-created force under the Punjab Enforcement Regulatory Authority (Pera) in such matters.
She had also commented that “patwaris (revenue officials) and ACs (assistant commissioners) seem to have developed a desire to become judges”, and questioned the jurisdiction of a patwari to take cognisance of a matter already pending before the Supreme Court.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/22071815af0e74e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962594/cdf-field-marshal-munir-awarded-king-abdulaziz-medal-for-his-efforts-to-advance-pak-saudi-ties' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir awarded King Abdulaziz medal for his efforts to ‘advance Pak-Saudi ties’</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabia’s Defence Minister Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz has conferred the King Abdulaziz Medal of Excellent Class on Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for his efforts to “advance Pak-Saudi ties”, it emerged on Monday.
According to a report by Saudi Gazette, the medal has five classes; excellent, first, second, third, and fourth. It is usually awarded to those who have rendered outstanding services to Saudi Arabia or one of its institutions.
The official Saudi Press Agency reported late on Sunday that CDF Field Marshal Munir was given the medal in honour of his “distinguished efforts to strengthen the strategic relationship and cooperation between the two nations”.
The report added that the ceremony took place during the Saudi minister’s reception of CDF Field Marshal Munir in Riyadh.
“Prince Khalid congratulated Field Marshal Munir on his appointment as Pakistan’s chief of defence forces, wishing him continued success in his new role,” the report added.
“During the meeting, the two sides reviewed the historical Saudi-Pakistani relations and the strategic cooperation in the defence field, discussing efforts to establish the foundations of international peace and security, as well as issues of common interest,” the publication reported.
Separately, in a post on the social media platform X, the minister said, “Upon the directive of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the title held by the Saudi king], I presented Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir with the King Abdulaziz Medal of Excellent Class for his distinguished efforts to enhance our cooperation and advance the Saudi-Pakistani relations.”







Later on Monday morning, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that during the meeting, the two sides held discussions on matters of mutual interest, including regional security dynamics, defence and military cooperation, strategic collaboration, and evolving geopolitical challenges.
“The interaction reaffirmed the deep-rooted, historic, and brotherly relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it said.







It further said that the medal was the kingdom’s “highest national honour”.
“The honour recognises Field Marshal Munir’s distinguished military service and leadership, as well as his central role in advancing defence cooperation, strategic coordination, and institutional linkages between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” it said.
“It also reflects his contributions toward regional peace and stability, including sustained collaboration in counter-terrorism and security,” it added.
Earlier this year, Islamabad and Riyadh had signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
In November, the Saudi armed forces chief had relayed the kingdom’s desire to elevate its defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.
On December 3, Field Marshal Munir had also expressed satisfaction with the “robust defence collaboration” underway between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-12-22 09:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640825-punjab-lg-polls-to-be-on-party-basis-govt-assures-lhc' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab LG polls to be held on party basis, govt assures LHC</strong></a><br><p>

In the video, the family members could be heard saying that the patient had passed away after doctors refused to give her a blood transfusion. When the video panned to the doctor in question, he raised his arm, showing his middle finger and walking away. A large crowd could also be seen in the video.
The doctor, identified as Qasim Jamal, was suspended from duty on Dec 19, a day after the incident occurred. Meanwhile, an inquiry committee was also formed to probe the incident.
Subsequently, the hospital issued a notification the same day stating that the doctor had been terminated with immediate effect for misconduct, and violating hospital rules and professional ethics.
In the incident report dated Dec 20, the director of the Accident and Emergency Department said that the patient was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition on Thursday. It said she was in the process of being stabilised after being treated at the department and was to be transferred to a different ward for blood transfusions.
However, the patient’s condition deteriorated to a point where transfusions were no longer feasible, leading to agitation among her attendants, it said.
“Attendants misbehaved with [the] doctor as well as staff on duty,” the report said. “After that, [the] doctor also misbehaved and [showed an] inappropriate gesture to the attendants,“ it said.
It added that treatment was given to the patient “properly and accordingly”.
Meanwhile, the doctor in question also issued a detailed statement on Dec 20 in response to the incident, saying that his reaction was merely a “symbol of protest” against what he called continuous attacks and harassment by the patient’s family.
Regarding the treatment of the patient, he said that her condition had been “very critical and active treatment was ongoing” but her condition deteriorated. He said that they attempted to resuscitate her but she was later declared dead.
He said that the patient’s attendants then started misbehaving with doctors and staff, creating chaos in the emergency room. He added that there was “complete negligence on the part of the security staff, who allowed over twelve men with mobile cameras to enter the restricted area of ​​the emergency room”.
He said that while he and the other staff were treating over a dozen other patients, the attendants continued to “shout, abuse, threaten and harass” him, including getting physically violent.
“After repeated humiliation, verbal abuse, physical threats and four consecutive attempted attacks, it was impossible for any human being to remain unaffected,” the doctor said.
“My reaction was the result of continued provocation, not an unprovoked act. I state clearly that I did not abuse, misbehave or physically attack anyone. I did not utter a single word of profanity. My response was calm and disciplined,” he said.
“I admit that I was under severe mental stress and anger at that time. Protesting is a fundamental right of every individual and employee, and I exercised this right peacefully and non-violently,” he said.
He added that the hospital rules did not clearly refer to silent gestures as violations of the law, saying, “If I had used abusive language or physical assault, it would certainly have been a violation of medical ethics, but that was not the case.”
The doctor said that suspension without investigation was unfair and requested that he be reinstated in order to complete his training.</p><small>2025-12-22 07:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/640813-karachi-likely-to-experience-noticeable-drop-in-temperature-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi likely to experience noticeable drop in temperature from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>

Father and son Sajid Akram and Naveed are accused of targeting a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach, killing 15 people in the nation’s deadliest mass shooting in almost three decades.
Sajid, 50, was shot and killed by police during the attack. An Indian national, he entered Australia on a visa in 1998.
His 24-year-old son, Naveed, an Australian-born citizen, was moved from hospital to jail on Monday, police said.

 

Police documents released on Monday said the two had carried out “firearms training” in what was believed to be the New South Wales countryside prior to the shooting.
Pictures were released showing the accused firing shotguns and moving in what authorities described as a “tactical manner”.
The pair also recorded a video in October railing against “Zionists” while sitting in front of a flag of the Islamic State group and detailing their motivations for the attack, police said.
And they made a nighttime “reconnaissance” trip to Bondi Beach just days before the killings, documents showed.
Australia observed a minute’s silence at 6:47pm (12:47pm PKT) on Sunday —exactly a week since the first reports of gunfire.
On Monday, Albanese said he would push for tough new laws creating “an aggravated offence for hate preaching”.
“We’re not going to let the ISIS inspired terrorists win. We won’t let them divide our society, and we’ll get through this together,” Albanese told reporters.
“As prime minister, I feel the weight of responsibility for an atrocity that happened whilst I’m prime minister, and I’m sorry for what the Jewish community and our nation as a whole has experienced,” he said.

 

“The government will work every day to protect Jewish Australians, to protect the fundamental right as Australians that they have to be proud of who they are, to practice their faith, to educate their children and to engage in Australian society in the fullest way possible,” he added.
Crackdown on guns, ‘terrorist symbols’
Australia’s federal government has flagged a suite of reforms to gun ownership and hate speech laws, as well as a review of police and intelligence services.
Albanese also announced last week a sweeping buyback scheme to “get guns off our streets”.
It is the largest gun buyback since 1996, when Australia cracked down on firearms in the wake of a mass shooting that killed 35 people at Port Arthur.
And the government of New South Wales — where the shooting took place — recalled its parliament for two days on Monday to introduce what it called the “toughest firearm reforms in the country”.
“We can’t pretend that the world is the same as it was before that terrorist incident on Sunday,” New South Wales Premier Chris Minns told reporters.
“I’d give anything to go back a week, a month, two years, to ensure that didn’t happen, but we need to make sure that we take steps so that it never happens again.”
The new rules will cap the number of guns an individual can own to four, or ten for exempted individuals like farmers.
There are more than 1.1 million firearms in the state, officials said.
The legislation would also ban the display of “terrorist symbols”, including the flag of the Islamic State, which was found in a car linked to one of the alleged shooters.
Authorities will also be able to prohibit protests for up to three months following a terrorism incident.

 

Minns said on Monday he would also look into stricter hate speech legislation next year, including restrictions on the phrase “globalise the intifada”.
The phrase is a common chant at pro-Palestinian rallies and refers to past uprisings against Israeli forces in the occupied territories.</p><small>2025-12-22 06:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/694870e888038.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962472/agriculture-time-to-focus-on-potatoes-and-garlic' target='_blank'><strong>Agriculture: Time to focus on potatoes and garlic</strong></a><br><p>


Due to the closure of the Afghanistan border over the past two months, potato prices in Pakistan have plunged to rock-bottom levels. In an oversupplied market with weak exports, even marketable-quality potatoes are being diverted to livestock feed. This has dealt another blow to farmers already grappling with high production costs driven by expensive fertilisers, pesticides, diesel, and electricity. As a result, despite a bumper crop, farmers are suffering immense financial losses.
By contrast, Pakistan imported 51,674 tonnes of garlic, valued at $52 million (Rs14.5 billion) in 2024, according to International Trade Centre data, as domestic production of 115,390 tonnes meets only about two-thirds of the country’s demand. These imports were even higher during 2020–2022.
Potatoes and garlic are both Rabi crops planted in October and require similar soil, agro-climatic conditions, and irrigation requirements. Yet, paradoxically, Pakistan has for years been exporting large quantities of potatoes while importing costly garlic — mostly from China — which drains billions in foreign exchange.

 

This trend cannot be explained by the theory of comparative advantage, as Pakistan has clear production potential for both crops. Notably, Pakistan’s garlic yields exceed those of India and Bangladesh, the world’s second- and third-largest producers, respectively. Moreover, farm-gate prices in Pakistan remain well below import-parity levels.

The weak sanitary and phytosanitary standards Pakistan abided by to export agricultural products to Afghanistan have made farmers complacent and incapable of producing quality crops that may be traded elsewhere

All this reflects a directionless agricultural sector: potato acreage has risen steadily over recent years, yet no serious effort has been made to develop new export markets. Resultantly, farmers are now forced to sell at throwaway prices. At the same time, no initiative has been taken to expand garlic cultivation, despite persistent import dependence. This is not an isolated case; each year, the country experiences surpluses in some crops with limited export opportunities, alongside shortages in others that necessitate massive imports.
Notably, another policy failure stems from this lack of vision and planning. Over the years, Afghanistan has effectively become a dumping ground for Pakistan’s surplus agricultural produce. For instance, over 60 per cent of citrus exports, around 50 per cent of banana exports, and roughly 41pc of potato exports are destined solely for Afghanistan — not to mention consignments routed to Central Asian states via Afghan transit. A similar market concentration exists across several other crops as well.
Afghanistan’s low food safety standards, weak sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) regime, and limited quality requirements for agricultural produce have made this nearby market easy to access. Consequently, Pakistan’s agricultural sector became complacent and has neglected efforts to improve produce quality and comply with the SPS standards required by most other export markets. The recent border closure has exposed this vulnerability.
Given the long history of turbulent bilateral relations, Pakistan’s agriculture sector can no longer afford to rely on Afghanistan as its primary export market. Instead, it must now pursue a broader two-pronged strategy aimed at import substitution and export market diversification.

 

As a test case for import substitution, the government should pilot a targeted initiative to shift part of the potato area to garlic cultivation. This would help ease balance-of-payments pressures arising from the large trade deficit while simultaneously improving farmers’ incomes. However, such a transition will not occur organically and requires active government support in the initial years — albeit limited to three critical areas.
First, the government should select a few union councils (UCs) in the Sahiwal division — an area well known for potato cultivation and equally suitable for garlic — and extend interest-free loans to farmers for procuring high-quality seed, ranging from Rs100,000 to 200,000 per acre (varying from year to year), and agricultural inputs; the high upfront cost for seeds remains the largest barrier to adopting garlic cultivation.
Second, robust advisory services must guide farmers throughout the production cycle — from seed selection to harvesting and storage. Farmers need experts with hands-on experience in garlic cultivation. The prime minister has repeatedly stated that around 1,000 government-sponsored agricultural graduates have recently received training in China. Given that China is the world’s largest garlic producer and exporter, with over 20m tonnes of production and yields nearly two and a half times higher than Pakistan’s average, some of these trained graduates (in garlic farming) could be deployed in selected UCs for the first two to three years.
Such advisory support is essential to prevent farmers from making the wrong choices and incurring costly mistakes. In the recent past, hundreds of new farmers — influenced by media hype created by the seed mafia — started cultivating the NARC G-1 garlic variety, which was not commercially proven. The variety bitterly failed to attract both households and industry when it hit the retail market after the two- to three-year seed multiplication phase, during which the mafia sold its seed at exorbitant prices.
Third, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) need to be set up in targeted UCs for garlic value addition. Products such as garlic powder, paste, flakes, and oil require relatively low-capital plants, which can largely meet their energy needs through cost-effective solar-powered systems. This intervention will not only boost the marketability of garlic but also create opportunities for value-added exports.
In conclusion, to realise the full potential of the agriculture sector, the government cannot remain a bystander and leave everything to farmers — especially when most are illiterate or poorly educated. Even if crop support prices and input subsidies are withdrawn, the state cannot abdicate its core responsibilities: setting a clear vision, planning crop acreage in line with national needs, formulating coherent strategies, and fostering a business-enabling environment for farmers and SMEs.
