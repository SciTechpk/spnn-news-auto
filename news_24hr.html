The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge became more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June. Situation worsened when deadly floods swept across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives, with between 10 and 15 tourists still missing.
Addressing a review meeting on the damages caused by the recent monsoon rains, PM Shehbaz termed the destruction caused by cloodbursts in Diamer and other areas as “unfortunate”. He prayed for those who lost their lives and for the speedy recovery of the injured.
“Pakistan’s contribution to global emissions is negligible, but despite this, it is among the top 10 countries that are facing destruction and losses due to global warming,” the premier noted.
 






Recalling the devastating 2022 floods, he said, “After that, each year such destruction comes in less or greater intensity.”
In 2022, the country witnessed the most devastating floods in its history, which killed 1,700 people, affected 33 million people, washed away swathes of agricultural lands, and incurred losses worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.
PM Shehbaz hailed the work of various federal authorities — including the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and the ministries of communication, water, GB, climate change, and international coordination — in assisting with the relief work.
He stressed that he had issued “clear” directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter. He highlighted that Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan.
Highlighting that the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, the premier noted that the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work once a disaster strikes.
He recalled that the communication secretary had spent six days in GB as he oversaw the restoration of roads damaged by the rains.
The prime minister vowed to visit GB once the monsoon rains end to lay the foundation stone of Daanish Schools he had promised. “We will also discuss other development projects with you and decide on them,” he assured the GB government.
He said the solar power project, which he was personally overseeing, had been greenlit by the Central Development Working Party and awaited approval from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.
“I will try to ensure this project’s completion as soon as possible under my own monitoring.”
PM orders weather alert system for tourist spots
During the meeting, PM Shehbaz also emphasised that an advanced weather alert system must be established for tourist destinations based on seasonal forecasts, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
 
 

The prime minister said local populations should be resettled away from natural water passageways to help prevent emergencies in the future.
He also ordered the NDMA and the Climate Change ministry to jointly establish a forecasting and monitoring centre for GB in the coming months.
A comprehensive system must be developed for immediate rescue and assistance in emergency situations, the premier stressed. He instructed the NDMA to ensure close cooperation with provincial governments and relevant institutions to enhance rescue and relief efforts.
“All rehabilitation measures for those affected by the recent monsoon must be completed promptly,” PM Shehbaz asserted, issuing directives for a survey of damage to roads and infrastructure, and the restoration of communication links in all affected areas on a priority basis.
The Ministry of Climate Change informed the meeting about progress on the ongoing installation of an early warning system for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs), with the premier ordering its completion in two months.
On the July 21 heavy rains in GB’s Thak-Babusar, Thor, Kundus, and Ishkoman areas, the meeting was informed that over 600 people were rescued, while damaged roads were repaired and reopened to restore connectivity, APP reported.
 
 

Five tent villages were established for rescue operations, and 10 helicopters, along with 2 C-130 aircraft, were deployed to transport stranded tourists and individuals to safe locations.
Additionally, PM Shehbaz instructed Water Minister Mian Muhammad Mueen Wattoo to remain in GB to complete consultations and planning for a better water management system.
Premier meets with GB CM, governor
During his day trip, PM Shehbaz held separate meetings with the GB governor and chief minister to discuss the region’s flood damages, among other matters.
Governor Shah briefed the prime minister on the flood situation and damages caused by the recent rains, as well as on the progress of development projects underway in Gilgit, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






During the meeting, prayers were offered for those who lost their lives in the recent rains and floods.
The governor also updated the premier on the region’s overall law and order situation. Recently, GB’s Tangir district witnessed two honour killing incidents within a week, taking the lives of four people.
In his meeting, CM Gulbar informed PM Shehbaz about the rescue and relief activities in the wake of the monsoon rains, Radio Pakistan reported.
Gulbar, an estranged member of the PTI who was backed by the PML-N and PPP during his election as chief minister, appreciated the premier’s decision to establish Daanish schools in GB.
They also discussed the law and order situation in GB and progress on development projects.
 






Federal govt cooperation akin to oxygen: GB govt
Upon arrival at Gilgit Airport earlier today for the one-day visit, GB Governor Syed Mehdi Shah, Chief Minister Gulbar Khan and other officials welcomed the premier.
 






The visit comes after PM Shehbaz chaired a high-level meeting last week to review the monsoon damage, where he reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik, Kashmir Affairs and GB Minister Amir Muqam, Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Inter-Provincial Coordination Minister Rana Sanaullah, and PM’s coordinator on GB Shabbir Ahmed Usmani are accompanying the premier.
“The prime minister will meet with the victims of rains and floods in Gilgit and distribute relief funds,” PTV said.
In a statement on the occasion, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said, “The hopes of flood affectees are attached to the prime minister.
“GB has faced losses worth more than Rs20 billion due to the worst destruction caused by the floods,” Faraq highlighted.
As floods and landslides hit GB in late July, CM Gulbar had appe­aled to the federal government for Rs7bn in emergency funds to deal with climate-induced disasters.
 
 

“Cooperation from the federal government plays the role of oxygen for GB,” the official said, stressing that “homeless people with wrecked houses and eroding settlements were looking forward to remedies for their wounds”.
Terming PM Shehbaz’s visit a “good omen”, Faraq welcomed the premier to the region.
The devastating impacts of climate change have become more visible in GB as unprecedented heat­­waves, erratic weat­her patterns and glacial melting have triggered cloudbursts and intense floods across the region.
Five members of a family trapped due to a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer District were rescued today, the region’s Rescue 1122 said.
Last week, more cloudburst-induced floods hit the Ghizer and Hunza districts.
On Friday, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The same day, Rescue 1122 officials said one person was rescued, while three other family members went missing after they had attempted to rescue a man who had jumped into the Ghizer River.
Glof alert issued for GB, KP ahead of likely rains
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) issued an alert for an increased risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The alert noted that a wet spell was likely to affect both regions in the current week as “scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls”, were expected.
 






As per the PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country from today till Thursday.
 






At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, according to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p><small>2025-08-04 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04173607950b0a5.jpg?r=174435' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928693/tekken-goat-arslan-ash-bags-6th-evo-title-at-las-vegas-showdown-against-fellow-pakistani-atif-butt' target='_blank'><strong>Tekken GOAT Arslan Ash bags 6th EVO title at Las Vegas showdown against fellow Pakistani Atif Butt</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan gamer Arslan “Ash” Siddique bagged his sixth Evolution Championship Series (EVO) title after winning the EVO 2025 fighting game tournament in Las Vegas on Monday.
The Lahore-based player won the Tekken 7 tournament in Japan in 2019 as well as the Evolution Championship Series in the US. In August 2022, he finished third in the EVO 2022 Tekken 7 competition. He won the Tekken 7 competition at EVO Japan 2023 in April 2023 and gained his 5th EVO title in July 2024.
EVO 2025 was held at the Las Vegas Convention Centre from Aug 1-3.
Siddique repeated history to win his 6th EVO title against fellow Pakistani and a former member of the team founded by Ash himself, Atif Butt.
EVO posted the winning moment on X with Ash using Nina Williams and Butt using Anna Williams, characters from the Tekken fighting game franchise who are sisters, terming it “greatness on another level”.
 






“I’m feeling so blessed,” EVO quoted Ash as saying after his win and becoming a six-time title holder, adding that he remains “grateful in victory”.
 






“Our player Arslan achieves the Evo World Championship for the sixth time in his career. The right path to achieving the World Cup, God willing,” said his e-sports club, Saudi Arabia’s Twisted Minds, further calling Ash by his moniker as the greatest of all time (GOAT) in the competitive Tekken scene.
“Six-time EVO champion. Undisputed GOAT of Tekken.”
 






“I’m still not able to get over the thought of how I ended up in second place again. Just like last year’s Evo final, runner-up once again. Anyway, I sincerely want to thank everyone for their support,” said runner-up Butt.
 






Yuta “Chikurin” Take rounded out the top three in third position.
 






According to the website for the tournament, EVO is the world’s biggest fighting game tournament with a long history where fighting game players from around the world gather in Las Vegas to compete against each other.</p><small>2025-08-04 13:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041646160eed609.jpg?r=164856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928035/fact-check-viral-video-of-bilawal-saying-our-people-are-sitting-in-indias-parliament-is-fake' target='_blank'><strong>Fact check: Viral video of Bilawal saying ‘our people are sitting in India’s parliament’ is fake</strong></a><br><p>Since July 3, multiple Indian users on the social media platform X have been sharing a video of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, claiming that he said “our people are sitting in India’s parliament”. However, the audio in the clip is doctored.
On July 31, an X user, who seemed to be Indian from previous posts, shared a video that showed a split frame of Bilawal in the National Assembly and Indian politician Gaurav Gogoi in the Lok Sabha.
In the clip, Bilawal could allegedly be heard saying: “Who attacks in the dead of the night? We can easily do propaganda in front of the Indian prime minister. Our people are sitting in their parliament.”
The caption of the post said: “Our people are sitting in India’s parliament — Bilawal Bhutto. Hello Gaurav Gogoi Asm ji, who are those ‘our people’ of Bilawal Bhutto sitting in the Indian Parliament?”
It gathered more than 100,000 views and was shared 5,200 times.
The same video was also shared by other Indian accounts, as can be seen here, here and here.
The video was also shared by Indian accounts on Instagram, as seen here.
Moreover, an image of Bilawal along with the statement “our people are sitting in their parliament” was also shared by Hindutva accounts as can be seen here, here, here and here, racking up 611,378 views collectively.
None of the posts provided any other additional details about the context of the alleged video, such as when it was from or a link to the full address.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as well as current relations between the neighbouring countries.
Observing the video revealed inconsistencies in Bilawal’s audio in the clip, the most prominent among them being issues in lip-syncing, the mispronunciation of “prime minister”, and the use of Hindi words.
Reviewing the alleged clip via reverse image search showed that Bilawal’s video is actually from May 7, 2025, when he spoke in the National Assembly on the four-day India-Pakistan conflict.
In his original speech, the former foreign minister said: “Only thieves and cowards attack at night. If they had even an ounce of courage, they would have announced their attack during the day.”
 


He added: “We do not condone war and never have, but India should brace itself because Pakistan is yet to respond, and it will not do so during the night, or on the basis of lies, but as per international laws and UN Charter.”
The same was also corroborated by a keyword search that yielded reports by credible news outlets Dawn and Express Tribune, both of which did not report anything on Bilawal talking about the Indian parliament.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows Bilawal saying “our people are sitting in India’s parliament” is false. The video is doctored and dubbed over.

England, set 374 to win, were bowled out for 367, with fast bowler Siraj taking 5-104, including a sensational burst of 3-9 on Monday’s final morning.
It is India’s narrowest winning margin in a Test match.
“To be honest, it is so amazing,” Siraj told Sky Sports. “From day one to here, everyone fought so hard, so we are very happy.
 






“I just wanted to make sure I hit the right areas, the wickets would fall, and anything else would be a bonus.
“When I woke up, I believed I could do it.”
After resuming on 339-6, England lost four wickets for 28 runs on the final morning of a dramatic series.
The home side were soon 354-8 after Siraj, the leading bowler on either side this series, struck twice to remove Jamie Smith and Jamie Overton.
When injured England last man Chris Woakes came in to bat with his left arm strapped up owing to an injured shoulder, England still needed 17 more runs for victory.
Gus Atkinson hit a six off Siraj before England got the target down to single figures.
But Siraj set the seal on a superb series by bowling Atkinson (17) as he knocked over the batsman’s off stump to spark delirious scenes among the India team and their supporters in south London.
India were without Jasprit Bumrah at the Oval after deciding to stand by a decision to only play the world’s top-ranked Test bowler in three games of this five-match series.
Siraj, who featured throughout, ended the series with 23 wickets at 32.43.
Smith and Overton had struggled to get the ball off the square on their Surrey home ground on Sunday.
And with play starting Monday beneath grey skies, conditions favoured India’s quicks.
Overton pulled the first ball of the day, from Prasidh Krishna, for four – a shot greeted by huge cheers from England fans in an impressively large Oval crowd — and under-edged the second for another boundary
Siraj took up the attack from the Pavilion End and promptly twice beat Smith on the outside edge.
And with the third ball of his over Siraj had Smith caught behind, without the batsman adding to his score, to leave England 347-7.
The next delivery saw new batsman Atkinson edge the lion-hearted Siraj just short of the slip cordon.
But it was his Surrey county colleague Overton who fell next, lbw for nine to a Siraj ball angling into his pads. Overton reviewed but Kumar Dharmasena’s decision was upheld on umpire’s call.
Tailender Josh Tongue was then given out lbw to Krishna but the batsman’s review saw the decision overturned.
England had been cruising to victory while Harry Brook (111) and Joe Root (105) were sharing a fourth-wicket partnership of 195 on Sunday.
However, Brook’s exit sparked a mini-collapse, with England losing three wickets for 36 runs and Root also among those dismissed.</p><small>2025-08-04 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04172320de84d57.png?r=172353' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928691/pakistan-issues-another-tender-to-buy-01m-tonnes-of-sugar-traders-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan issues another tender to buy 0.1m tonnes of sugar, traders say</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has issued a new international tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar, European traders said on Monday.
The quantity is double the earlier procurement target of 50,000 tonnes. The deadline for submission of price offers is August 11.
The announcement is believed to indicate that Pakistan will make no purchase in its previous tender for 100,000 tonnes of sugar on July 31, traders said.
On July 8, Pakistan’s government had approved plans to import 500,000 tonnes of sugar to help maintain price stability. Market analysts said that retail sugar prices in the country have risen sharply since January.
 
 

Traders said three companies had participated in the July 31 tender, with the lowest price offer assessed at $539.00 a tonne cost and freight included (c&f).
Pakistan reportedly received no offers in a previous tender to buy 50,000 tonnes of sugar on July 22, with traders saying the requirement to load shipments from August 1-15 was too short notice for realistic offers.
The new tender seeks small/fine and medium grade sugar from worldwide origins, excluding India and Israel, packed in bags transported either in ocean shipping containers or breakbulk.
Shipment of breakbulk supplies is sought from September 1-15 for 50,000 tonnes and September 10-25 for 50,000 tonnes. For 50,000 tonnes of sugar in ocean shipping containers, shipment can also be made between September 1 and 20.
Shipments should be organised to achieve the arrival of all the sugar in Pakistan by October 20.
Meanwhile, traders remain puzzled by the government’s sugar trade policy.
 
 

During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.
Despite the export surge earlier this year, domestic consumers are now grappling with rising prices.
Last week, the government decided to enforce strict monitoring of sugar stocks and deploy officials at each sugar mill to oversee inventory levels and ensure uninterrupted supply in line with commitments made by the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA).</p><small>2025-08-04 12:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04165721d96b95e.png?r=165851' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928659/funerals-held-in-absentia-for-missing-tourists-in-gbs-babusar-after-14-days-of-search-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>Funerals held in absentia for missing tourists in GB’s Babusar after 14 days of search efforts</strong></a><br><p>A search operation for tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Babusar area concluded on Monday after 14 days, while their funeral prayers were held in absentia.
Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. These extreme weather events have resulted in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the GB region among the hardest hit.
After deadly floods swept across GB’s Babusar area on July 21, the deaths of seven people had been confirmed but 12 remained missing. Besides the missing, the region’s death toll stands at 10.
In a statement today, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq said, “The funeral prayers of the missing persons were offered in absentia in Babusar.”
He said that the search operation on Babusar Highway, which had continued for 14 days, has now ended. “All vehicles have been removed from the debris, but no trace of the missing persons could be found,” he said.
“[The] hopes of the missing persons being rescued in the flood-hit area have been dashed,” he added.
Last week, the GB government had intensified the search operations on Babusar Highway.
Diamer police, GB Scouts, Pakistan Army personnel, Rescue 1122 and local volunteers took part in the search efforts. Drone camps, modern equipment, sniffer dogs, technical mechanisms, heavy machinery and human resources were used for the operation.
5 family members rescued after 4 days in Ghizer
Separately, five members of a family trapped because of a flood four days ago in GB’s Ghizer district have been rescued and taken to a safe place, Ghizer’s Rescue 1122 said today.

According to Ghizer Rescue 1122’s media coordinator, Shakraiz, a lightning strike washed away the road connecting the flood-hit area on the evening of July 31, causing five members of a family to be stranded on the other side of a river in Gopus Khatam village.
“Today, the team rescued all the members and moved them to a safe place by boat,” Shakraiz told Dawn.com.
“Food was also delivered to other affected families during the operation. Sixty-two houses, water supply and electricity systems, along with health and education centres, were severely affected by the flood in the Ishkoman and Gopus valleys of Ghizer.”
According to local political leader Zafar Muhammad Shadamkhel, lightning struck at eleven places simultaneously, causing severe damage to houses, buildings, schools, roads and power plants. He added that 600 people have been deprived of drinking water.
On Thursday, cloudburst-induced floods in Ghizer and Hunza districts caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in upper Hunza’s Gojal, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.
The next day, a glacier burst in GB’s Bagrot Valley had resulted in the death of one person, while his father was injured, according to the regional government’s spokesperson.</p><small>2025-08-04 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04123958291465c.jpg?r=132737' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928670/police-arrest-3-for-allegedly-gang-raping-woman-in-abbottabad' target='_blank'><strong>Police arrest 3 for allegedly gang-raping woman in Abbottabad</strong></a><br><p>Police on Monday arrested three suspects who allegedly gang-raped a woman last week in the Bakot area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Abbottabad district, springing into action after the incident sparked social media outrage.
Abbottabad police spokesperson Azam Mir Afzal told Dawn.com that the suspects had allegedly gang-raped a woman from Rawalpindi on Wednesday.
“District Police Officer (DPO) Umar Tufail took action and ordered the immediate arrest of the suspects after the incident was highlighted on social media, including Facebook and TikTok,” Spokesperson Afzal said.
He added that the Bakot station house officer (SHO), Arshad Khan, was sent to the village, where he had also found the local community angered over the incident.
 
 

On the SHO’s complaint, a first information report (FIR) was lodged at the Bakot police station yesterday under sections 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention), 375A (rape) and 376 (punishment for rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, police arrested the suspect who owned the house where the woman was allegedly raped by him and his friends.
The FIR added that one of the suspects brought the woman to his friend’s house in his car from Rawalpindi, where he and his friends raped her, one after the other. In his statement, the homeowner confessed to committing the crime while also identifying his two accomplices.
The police stated in the FIR that the accomplices were also arrested, while a search for the victim continued and the investigation was underway.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
In July, a newlywed 19-year-old girl in Karachi’s Lyari, who was admitted to a hospital in critical condition after an alleged marital rape and “brutal sexual violence” at the hands of her husband, succumbed to her injuries. Her spouse was arrested by the police.
Earlier that month, Karachi police arrested the primary suspect allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a girl in Ittehad Town.</p><small>2025-08-04 10:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041314300568515.jpg?r=131556' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928668/shameless-actions-pakistan-condemns-israeli-ministers-storming-al-aqsa-mosque' target='_blank'><strong>‘Shameless actions’: Pakistan condemns Israeli ministers storming Al-Aqsa mosque</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Monday unequivocally condemned the storming of the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem by Israeli ministers, calling Tel Aviv out for its “shameless actions which are inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region”.
Early on Sunday, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, shielded by Israeli police, led a large group of illegal settlers in a provocative march and mass incursion into the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, coinciding with the Jewish commemoration of Tisha B’Av, Anadolu Agency reported.
According to the Jerusalem Islamic Waqf, at least 1,251 illegal Israeli settlers stormed the mosque compound in the morning hours, performing Talmudic rituals, singing, and dancing under heavy police protection.
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in Islam after Makkah and Madina. Under a delicate decades-old “status quo” arrangement with Muslim authorities, the Al-Aqsa compound is administered by a Jordanian religious foundation, and Jews can visit but may not pray there.
“This sacrilege against one of Islam’s holiest sites is not only an affront to the faith of over a billion Muslims but also a direct assault on international law and the collective conscience of humanity,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif posted on X.
 






He said that such systematic provocations by the occupying power, coupled with reckless calls for annexation, imperilled the prospects for peace.
The prime minister said that Israel’s “shameless actions” were deliberately inflaming tensions in Palestine and the wider region, pushing the Middle East closer to further instability and conflict.
“Pakistan reiterates its urgent call for an immediate ceasefire, an end to all acts of aggression, and the revival of a credible peace process leading to an independent and viable State of Palestine, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with international law and relevant UN resolutions,” PM Shehbaz added.
The Foreign Office also issued a separate statement to condemn the Israeli move.
“The presence and statements of senior Israeli officials, and the repugnant declaration that ‘the Temple Mount is ours,’ are a dangerous and deliberate attempt to provoke religious sentiments across the world, escalate tensions, and alter the status of Al‑Aqsa Mosque,” the statement said.
It said that Israel’s expansionist attempts were a deliberate effort to destabilise the region and sabotage any meaningful path to peace.
“These provocations risk igniting a catastrophic spiral of violence across the region.”
The world, it continued, must not remain silent in the face of such systemic, illegal, inhumane, and unlawful aggression. Such actions constitute a blatant violation of international human rights and humanitarian laws, the United Nations Charter, as well as various UN and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Resolutions.
“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations, to take immediate and concrete steps to hold Israel accountable for its illegal actions and to protect the religious sanctity of Al‑Aqsa Mosque and the rights of the Palestinian people, in particular the right to self-determination.
“Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the creation of a sovereign, independent, viable, and contiguous Palestinian State based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”
 
 

Since October 7, 2023, Israeli strikes on Gaza have killed 60,839 and injured nearly 149,000 Palestinians, per the Palestinian health ministry. Bombardments have also destroyed 88 per cent of the Gaza Strip, according to the Gaza Media Office.
Pakistan has consistently raised its voice for the people of Palestine, calling for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.
Last month, Pakistan urged the UNSC not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
On July 29, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar said the Israel-Palestine question was a “test case” for the UN and the world as he addressed a high-level conference on the two-state solution in New York.

The city has lately witnessed a rise in traffic accidents, especially involving heavy vehicles, including dumpers and water tankers, which killed nearly 500 people and injured 4,879 in 2024, according to hospital data.
According to a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Sindh, the trailer was travelling at a high speed when it crashed into a bungalow in DHA Phase 2.
He said that as soon as Rescue 1122’s Central Command and Control team received the information, the urban search and rescue team, along with two ambulances and one disaster response vehicle, rushed to the scene.
“Two people trapped as a result of the collision were rescued safely,” he said, adding that they were transported to the hospital via ambulance with minor injuries. He added that both of the injured victims were trailer staff.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza confirmed that the two people trapped were the driver and cleaner of the trailer, who were rescued and taken to the hospital “after immediate medical assistance”.
“The police of the bungalow have contacted the owners, who are currently in Islamabad,” the DIG said.
He added that according to initial investigations, the accident occurred as a result of slippery conditions on the road due to rain.
Accidents frequently occur in the metropolis due to violations of traffic rules, with speeding and unsafe overtaking being major contributing factors. Speeding increases the risk of crashes and the severity of injuries, while unsafe overtaking often leads to head-on collisions.
Last month, a 59-year-old man was killed when a dumper truck ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad. The incident angered area residents, who damaged the truck and beat the driver before police intervened.
Earlier in the same week, at least four people lost their lives and another six were injured — all from the same family — after their speeding car crashed into a wall on Hawkesbay Road in the city’s Mauripur area, while a separate collision between a trailer and a truck left one dead and three injured near New Sabzi Mandi on the Super Highway.</p><small>2025-08-04 08:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04111541342bb32.jpg?r=111939' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928661/76-dead-dozens-missing-after-migrant-boat-sinks-off-yemen' target='_blank'><strong>76 dead, dozens missing after migrant boat sinks off Yemen</strong></a><br><p>At least 76 people have been killed and dozens are missing after a boat carrying mostly Ethiopian migrants sank off Yemen, in the latest tragedy on the perilous sea route, officials told AFP on Monday.
Yemeni security officials said 76 bodies had been recovered and 32 people rescued from the shipwreck in the Gulf of Aden. The UN’s migration agency said 157 people were on board.
The accident occurred off Abyan governorate in southern Yemen, a frequent destination for boats smuggling African migrants hoping to reach the wealthy Gulf states.
Some of those rescued have been transferred to Yemen’s Aden, near Abyan, a security official said.
UN agency the International Organisation for Migration earlier gave a toll of at least 68 dead.
The IOM’s country chief of mission, Abdusattor Esoev, told AFP that “the fate of the missing is still unknown.”
Despite the civil war that has ravaged Yemen since 2014, the impoverished country has remained a key transit point for irregular migration, in particular from Ethiopia which itself has been roiled by ethnic conflict.
Each year, thousands brave the so-called “Eastern Route” from Djibouti to Yemen across the Red Sea, in the hope of eventually reaching oil-rich Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
The IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the Red Sea route last year, with 462 from boat accidents.
Last month, at least eight people died after smugglers forced migrants to disembark from a boat in the Red Sea, according to the UN’s migration agency.
The vessel that sank off Abyan was carrying mostly Ethiopian migrants, according to the province’s security directorate and an IOM source.
Yemeni security forces were conducting operations to recover a “significant” number of bodies, the Abyan directorate said on Sunday.
On their way to the Gulf, migrants cross the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the narrow waterway at the mouth of the Red Sea that is a major route for international trade, as well as for migration and human trafficking.
Once in war-torn Yemen, the Arabian Peninsula’s poorest country, migrants often face other threats to their safety.
The IOM says tens of thousands of migrants have become stranded in Yemen and suffer abuse and exploitation during their journeys.
In April, more than 60 people were killed in a strike blamed on the United States that hit a migrant detention centre in Yemen, according to the Houthi rebels that control much of the country.

Here’s how it can win the water war</strong></a><br><p>On the morning of May 31, flow gauges on the Chenab River recorded an alarming decrease in the river flow. The development made headlines in the aftermath of the conflict between India and Pakistan, which broke out on May 7. As with a similar episode at the end of April, it led some to wonder anxiously: Can New Delhi shut Pakistan’s water supply just like that?
The bulk of Pakistan’s water supplies originate from three rivers — Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab — which are allocated under the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty (IWT). Two of these western rivers are buffered by large dams on the Pakistani side: Tarbela on the Indus and Mangla on the Jhelum. Each can absorb changes in flow with little effect on irrigation deliveries. The Chenab, however, is different.
Pakistan does not have a Tarbela-sized reservoir here, and upstream on the Chenab River, India operates three modest dams (Baglihar, Salal and Dulhasti). A closure at these structures can therefore look, at first glance, like the country’s tap has been turned off.
 
 

Here, we explain why and how the Chenab River flows can be disrupted (not blocked). Then we discuss what potential disruptions later in the year may look like. And, through this, we illustrate that while Pakistan must press its case against India’s illegal violations of the IWT, it also has room through smarter water management to blunt the impact of any Indian actions.
Pakistan’s vulnerability
Begin with the Indus River, which has an average annual flow of roughly 75 billion cubic metres (BCM) — enough to fill about 30 million Olympic-sized swimming pools. Two Indian run-of-river plants on the Indus River can together hold 0.02 BCM when their gates are closed — that is less than 0.03 per cent of the Indus’ annual flow, or only a few hours of discharge even in the low-water season. Once India’s small reservoirs fill, the water must spill onward, and the brief dent disappears inside normal reservoir operations downstream.
The situation on the Jhelum is similar. Mangla Dam on the Jhelum River sees about 27 BCM in an average year; Indian upstream infrastructure can store around 0.06 BCM, barely 0.2pc of the river’s flow. As things stand, and likely in the future, there is virtually no way India can cause any noticeable disruption to irrigation flows managed through the Indus and Jhelum rivers.
The Chenab, by contrast, reaches Marala with no Pakistani reservoir to cushion it. India’s infrastructure on the Chenab has a combined live storage — referred to as water that can be actively withheld or released — capacity of around 0.1 BCM.
This is where Pakistan’s water system is most vulnerable.
The Indian violations
Earlier in May, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) reported an unusual change in average daily flows of Chenab as it entered Pakistan via Marala Barrage. As illustrated in the figure below, the seemingly normal daily average flows of around 50,000 cusecs recorded on May 27 and 28 abruptly increased over the next two days and then drastically decreased on May 31 and June 1, before returning to expected levels on June 2 and onwards.
The average river flows of Chenab can vary significantly at this time of the year due to a combination of glacial melt, rainfall and water management practices. However, day-to-day changes in flows typically do not exceed 5,000 cusecs, and even if they do, they are typically linked to precipitation or snowmelt upstream in the basin and can therefore be predicted.
 


Here, though, the disruptions in Chenab’s daily average flows reported between May 28 and June 2 were induced via upstream reservoir operations, as confirmed by subsequent reports.
The abrupt rise in flows on May 29 and 30 was due to reservoir flushing (emptying) by India on the same days — a process where accumulated sediments are removed from a reservoir by releasing water at high flow rates, which helps restore the reservoir’s storage capacity and improve water quality. It can also help prevent flooding by managing water levels and mitigating the risk of sediment buildup.
The reported live capacity of India’s reservoirs on Chenab is 0.1 BCM, which equates to around 21,000 cusecs of surplus average daily flow across two days. This aptly explains most of the abrupt rise in the river flow on May 29 and 30.
The reservoir flushing was followed by reservoir filling — when water is gradually filled in the reservoir up to its intended operating level — on May 31 and June 1 (see red bars in the above figure for illustration), coinciding with the sharp fall in flows at Marala. Once India’s facilities reached their capacity, the flow returned to normal from June 2 onwards. The total water that reached Pakistan during these five days (May 28-June 2) did not change or decrease; only the timing of it was affected.
The disruption in the flow of the Chenab River always heavily depends on the time of the year and strategies used by India for the flushing and filling of its reservoirs. The IWT has predefined rules for flushing and filling and its abeyance, which means that India could i) flush or fill its reservoirs at will, and ii) choose any strategy to maximise impact on Pakistan.
The figure below illustrates what a hypothetical worst-case scenario may look like in dry winter months (November to January), when average daily flows in Chenab can reduce to 7000 cusecs or lower.
 


This worst-case scenario in Chenab during this time could feature quick flushing (lasting two days) resulting in a huge relative surge in flows at Marala barrage, followed by slow filling (due to naturally low winter flows) resulting in reduction of flows at Marala to a trickle that could last for around a week (as opposed to the two day disruption observed in May). Again, it is worth reiterating that even in this worst-case scenario, the volume of water in Chenab will not reduce. Only its timing would be altered.
How to blunt Indian actions
Can Pakistan manage this level of disruption in flows in Chenab? Pakistani policy makers see the answer in concrete. Last month, the government confirmed it is studying a Rs220 billion Chenab Dam that would add storage on the Chenab. A reservoir of that size could cushion sudden draw-downs, but building a dam is expensive and will take many years. Pakistan cannot afford to wait that long or spend that much before acting.
Fortunately, the most effective countermeasures do not hinge on new megastructures. Real-time telemetry, flexible canal rotations, and coordinated reservoir operations can be deployed within a single irrigation season at a fraction of the cost.
These quicker fixes are not theoretical. Pakistan’s irrigation system is already highly engineered and interconnected. When Irsa noticed these Indian induced disturbances, it released water from the Mangla Dam to compensate for reduced flows on May 31 and June 1 and meet the demands of farms served by canals linked to both Chenab and Jhelum rivers. However, the reduction in flows was preceded by a surge as well.
 
 

Hence, if flow monitoring, operational allocation decisions at various government levels, for example, Irsa provincial irrigation departments, and canal gate operations are managed with synchrony, time efficiency and adaptiveness, disruptions in Chenab can be handled effectively. Pakistan’s water management and operation authorities need to be swift in determining the start of a disruption event and adapting operations accordingly. As demonstrated by the country’s effective military response to Indian aggression, preparation is half the battle.
India’s recent treaty violations (and those in the future) must be contested through diplomatic channels, but Pakistan’s most effective countermeasures lie in the country’s own hands. First, adaptive and coordinated water management using real-time telemetry can allow irrigation engineers to modify crop rotations and reservoir operations as soon as unusual flow patterns are detected.
Second, the 10-day warabandi schedule can be made elastic. Warabandi is a rotational water distribution system used on both sides of the water to ensure equal water access for farmers. It involves preparing a fixed schedule for allocating water to each farm, ensuring that every landholder receives a predetermined share of water based on their landholding size.
Allowing a “floating start”, in which the entire rotation slides forward when an upstream interruption occurs, preserves each farmer’s share over the full cycle even if one day is lost. The change is administrative, not infrastructural, yet it converts a sudden change into a manageable rescheduling exercise.
None of these steps requires new legislation or massive investment. By adopting them while pressing its treaty case, Pakistan demonstrates that measured, data-driven management is the strongest reply to hydraulic theatre.
Violations purely for show
Annual reservoir flushing is not new. Schedule E of the Indus Waters Treaty explicitly allows India to flush its reservoirs to purge sediment, provided two conditions are met: (i) Pakistan receives advance notice, and (ii) the drawdown is timed for seasons when the water flow is high and the impact downstream is low.
For years, this coordination worked. Indian dams were flushed in the high-flow season, briefly dipping Marala’s gauges. The surge of summer meltwater masked the loss, and canal operations scarcely noticed. This is what has changed since India decided to put the treaty in abeyance unilaterally.
Reservoir flushing in late spring yields India little more than routine silt removal, but doing it without notice and unscheduled turns a maintenance chore into a prime-time spectacle for its domestic audience.
 
 

Several Indian television channels framed May’s drawdown as proof that “Pakistan’s water tap can be shut at will”, echoing the same outlets that aired fabricated claims of the Karachi port being destroyed during the recent skirmish. The pattern is clear: limited hydraulic facts are stretched into psychological warfare for domestic ratings. Such behaviour is unbecoming of a state that seeks regional or global leadership.
Violating the Indus Waters Treaty for a little more sediment flushing undermines New Delhi’s credibility far more than it inconveniences Pakistan’s canals. It advertises a willingness to bend rules for symbolic gain while delivering no tangible advantage in irrigation or power.
The temptation to answer theatre with theatre should be resisted. Pakistani media and officials are on firmer ground when they treat the incident as what it is: a violation that disrupts Chenab’s flow for a few days (while the total volume of water stays the same). Understanding and reporting the full context (rather than the hype) denies the tactic its intended psychological payoff.
India’s unscheduled sediment flushes can disrupt canal timetables for a few days, but it does not and cannot strangle Pakistan’s water supply. That reality should guide every response. Islamabad is right to demand that treaty rules on notice and timing be honoured. Yet the most convincing diplomatic brief is one backed by domestic readiness: gauges that speak in real time and a rotation calendar flexible enough to absorb short shocks. By improving its readiness, Pakistan can undercut the psychological edge of future draw-downs and strengthen its standing in any future negotiations. Proactive planning, not alarmist rhetoric, is the surest way to keep the Chenab flowing.</p><small>2025-08-04 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/04114649d716364.png?r=114713' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928615/cambodia-pays-the-price-for-thai-internal-political-games' target='_blank'><strong>Cambodia pays the price for Thai internal political games</strong></a><br><p>BORDER clashes between Cambodia and Thailand are not new, but recent events highlight a deeper issue rooted not in territorial disputes, but in Thailand’s internal political conflict.
Since the end of the absolute monarchy in 1932, Thailand has experienced frequent military coups. Although not officially recognised, these coups often receive implicit support from the monarchy, especially when a civilian government becomes popular among the Thai public.
Today, tensions are rising again as the Thai military strategically positions itself to challenge the government of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, who was himself removed from power in a 2006 coup. To build domestic support for their political ambitions, the military is utilising a powerful force in Thai society: Nationalism.
To fuel this nationalist agenda, the Thai military started border clashes with Cambodia on May 28, killing Cambodian soldier Suon Rorn. Cambodia immediately expressed her intention to file a lawsuit with the ICJ for a peaceful resolution. However, Thai military leader Lieutenant General Boonsin Padklang reje­cted this approach and chose military confrontation over diplomacy.
The situation worsened when Thai soldiers were injured by landmines while patrolling what they claimed as Thai territory.
The mines were remnants from Cambodia’s civil war on Cambodian land that hadn’t been cleared. Instead of admitting their illegal cross-border activity, the Thai military accused Cambodia of negligence, and the Thai civilian government, competing with the military for popularity among Thai people, expelled Cambodia’s ambassador. They also closed access to key tourist sites, including Khmer temples inside Cambodian territory.
The most dangerous escalation occurred when the Thai military opened fire and crossed into Cambodia, damaging the Preah Vihear Temple, a Unesco World Heritage Site. They also targeted civilian sites in Cambodia, including religious sites and a hospital, which is prohibited by international law.
Civilian lives have been lost. Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet has called on Asean, the UN Security Council, and US President Donald Trump to intervene and force a peaceful resolution.

The additional duties were revised just a day after US President Donald Trump announced on social media that he would help Pakistan develop its ‘vast oil reserves’.
The new trade deal — reached with the US just a day before the extended pause in the implementation of the global reciprocal tariffs was to end on August 1 — gives Pakistan a big duty advantage over India, which is hit with 25pc valorem duties and a slight edge over other competitors like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Vietnam who have been slapped with 20pc import duties.
President Trump had announced his higher ad valorem duties  — in addition to a universal 10pc base tariff — on dozens of countries running a trade surplus with America on April 2. In his executive order, he had stated that the “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States”.
Pakistan ran a trade surplus of $5.2 billion in 2024, with its total goods exports totalling $5.1bn and imports $2.1bn. The trade surplus showed an increase of 5.2pc over the previous year.
The additional tariffs were, however, suspended, initially until July 9 and later until July 31, in less than a week of their announcement to give the affected countries time to renegotiate new trade deals with the US.

Some of the peer countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand, which were at a much higher bracket before, got better treatment by Trump’s tariffs and are almost at par with Pakistan now

Commenting on the conclusion of the trade agreement with the US, Pakistan’s finance ministry said the deal gives the country a major opportunity to expand its footprint in the American market.
“In particular, this tariff level is expected to support Pakistan’s export potential, especially in key sectors such as textiles, which remain the backbone of the country’s export economy,” the ministry highlighted. The statement noted that the decision reflected a “balanced and forward-looking approach by the US authorities, keeping Pakistan competitive relative to other South and Southeast Asian countries”.
The Pakistan government, it went on, “looks forward to further positive engagements and close cooperation with the United States in the areas of investment, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, mines & minerals, energy, and other emerging sectors.”
Trade and investment have to go hand in hand, said the country’s finance minister. He said that the bilateral and strategic partnership has come up prominently, adding, “I think we are in a good place today… in terms of where we have arrived before August 1.”
There is also satisfaction locally that Pakistan’s tariff rate is much lower than arch-rival India’s, CNN noted. Fears in Islamabad that India was trying to isolate Pakistan financially have been somewhat tempered by the 25pc tariff rate that the Trump administration hit New Delhi with after talks bogged down over access to its agriculture sector. On top of that, India also faces an unspecified penalty for its purchases of Russian oil.
Adviser to the finance minister Khurram Schehzad noted that the “deal signals a strategic deepening of economic ties and shared growth. The way Pakistan has been treated compared to different countries in this region, very encouraging and important,” he said, referring to the higher levy imposed on India. He also wrote on X that Pakistan is possibly the only country to which the US has offered its investments, as well as a competitive trade deal.
Nevertheless, some textile exporters like Interloop’s Mus­addiq Zulq­ernain cautioned against attaching too many hopes to the reduced tariff. “It, indeed, is a good development, given the fact that a higher tariff could have hit us. That we got a deal on par with our peers is absolutely an advantage.”
However, he said, “the higher tariff on India will not help us increase our goods exports to the US because Indian industry is way more competitive than ours. If we want to capture India’s market share in the US, we would have to work on enhancing our competitiveness.”
Then, he pointed out, India is still negotiating a new deal with Washington in spite of the initial setback. “What if it succeeds in clinching a better deal than ours, say, in the next few weeks or even a couple of months?” That’s not all.
“We don’t yet know if our agreement is final and aligns with the US on economic and national-security matters (as demanded by President Tru­mp)”. Pakistan falls in the category of countries which, according to the July 31 executive order of President Trump, have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States.
“The order states that the countries failing to reach an agreement on security commitments with the US could face a higher tariff. The situation remains a bit uncertain even if the revised duty structure provides us with some sort of clarity for the next few months,” he argued.
President Trump’s executive order says “… some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently remedy the trade barriers that have contributed to the national emergency declared in (the previous executive order of April 2), and to align with the United States on economic and national security matters.”
It goes on: “other trading partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the US on economic and national-security matters.”
According to the executive order, if a trading partner fails to take “adequate steps” to address the tariffs or retaliates against the US, Washington could take additional action. It says the countries failing to conclude meaningful trade and security commitments with the US could face 10pc and ad valorem duties on top of reciprocal tariffs.
In a note, Topline Security maintains that the trade deal with the US is largely neutral. “Unlike the market vibes and perception after the US president tweeted about the signing of a deal with Pakistan, the pact seems to be less exciting for Pakistan.” It also points out that some of the peer countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand, which were at a much higher bracket before, got a better treatment and are almost at par with Pakistan now.
Vietnam was initially imposed with tariffs of 46pc and Bangladesh was hit with a tariff of 37pc. Others like Sri Lanka and Thailand have also got better terms than previously proposed.
Textile comprises 75-80pc of Pakistan’s exports to the US, the brokerage said. In textiles and clothing, it said, Pakistan largely competes with China, India, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. “The duties imposed on China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh were much higher than those on Pakistan initially. However, the revised duties are more or less equal to Pakistan, thus leaving no competitive edge to Pakistan, in our view, except for cheaper labour.
“This deal will nonetheless help the country to remain competitive with direct competitors, without giving it any significant advantage over its peers.” It further states that China’s talks will further determine the competitiveness of Pakistan and other countries facing a deadline of August 12, since Beijing is the US’s largest supplier.
The US is Pakistan’s single largest export market. Recently, Pakistan’s goods exports to the US have consistently increased. In the first 11 months of FY25, exports to the US rose by 11.06pc to over $5.5bn from nearly $5bn a year earlier. In FY24, Pakistan’s textiles exports to the US reached $5bn, representing 92pc of its overall exports to that country.
Khurram Mukhtar, former chairman of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association, says the country’s exports to the US are already rising. “The American buyers are very bullish on Pakistan at the moment because we have the entire supply chain here. But if we want to take advantage of the lower tariff than our competitors, we will have to improve our competitiveness by reducing our cost of doing business.”

The DPO said that on being informed of the incident, the police acted promptly and arrested the suspect.
 
 

The police, after collecting evidence from the crime scene, moved the bodies to the hospital for autopsy.
According to initial investigation, the double murder was committed over ‘honour’. A case is yet to be registered.
NOSE CHOPPED OFF: Four assailants chopped off the nose of a man in a brutal attack in the limits of Kot Mubarak police station on Sunday.
According to the police, four men attacked Jumma Oghani, a resident of Jumma Chowk, and after overpowering him, chopped off his nose with a sharp object, leaving him seriously injured.
The injured man was shifted to hospital.
Police sources say that the victim was in litigation with the attackers.
Police are conducting raids to apprehend the culprits.

“Around 20 armed men attacked the 132kV grid station in the wee hours, causing massive damage to the grid station,” Qesco officials said on Sunday.
The armed men snatched the 12-bore rifle from the security guards and vandalised the premises while holding the staff at gunpoint. They opened fire inside the grid station, damaging the control room, high-power transformer, current transformers, conservator tank, radiator tubes, AC/DC panels, auxiliary panels, and other essential electrical equipment, according to a Qesco spokesperson.
After holding the staff and guards at gunpoint for some time, the attackers reportedly threatened them to vacate the premises immediately or risk losing their life. Subsequently, the staff and guards fled to safety.
Later, Qesco officials submitted a written complaint to the local police station to lodge an FIR against the attackers.
Separately, some men sabotaged the 132kV Yaro industrial transmission line near Kuchlak Bypass by creating a technical fault using ropes.
 
 

During a joint patrolling operation with local administration and police, nearly 700m of conductors and various electrical components were found stolen.
The electric company later filed a written request with the police to pursue legal action against those behind the transmission line theft.
The spokesperson expressed serious concern over the rising number of sabotage and theft incidents targeting power infrastructure in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Dasht, and Sibi in recent weeks. The attacks not only disrupted power supply but also posed a significant threat to public safety and national assets, he added.
The Qesco appealed to all consumers to assist in protecting national infrastructure by reporting any suspicious activity related to theft or tampering of transmission lines.

• Punjab gears up for sixth spell of heavy rains
ISLAMABAD: At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Sunday.
The NDMA said the deluges, which began on June 26, have left a trail of devastation across the country.  The dead include 102 men, 57 women and 140 children, while the injured include 239 children, 204 women and 272 men.
The severe weather has also caused widespread destruction, damaging a total of 1,676 houses, according to the agency’s data.
Of those, 562 homes were completely destroyed while 1,114 sustained partial damage.
The floods also led to the loss of 428 livestock, compounding the impact on local communities.
In response, the NDMA said it has carried out 223 rescue operations, successfully evacuating 2,880 people from flood-hit regions.
The authority has distributed more than 13,400 relief items to affected communities. These include almost 2,000 tents, 958 blankets, 569 quilts, 613 mattresses, and over 1,100 food packs.
Relief teams have also provided 1,282 kitchen sets, 350 life jackets, 1,122 hygiene kits, 2,170 tarpaulins, and 146 de-watering pumps, among other essential items.
Medical support has been mobilised, with 71 camps set up to treat those affected by the disaster. So far, 577 people have received medical attention.
The NDMA said the crisis has affected multiple regions, with joint relief operations underway in collaboration with provincial and federal agencies.
As per PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country, starting from August 4 till August 7.
Rainfall is expected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Islamabad between these dates, while Gilgit-Baltistan will receive rainfall starting from August 5.
Meanwhile, Balochistan is forecast to experience mainly hot and humid weather, al­t­h­ough rain, wind and thundershowers are expected in the northeastern and southern parts on Aug 6.
Sindh is likely to see hot and humid conditions in most parts, with cloudy weather and light rain expected in coastal areas.
Next spell likely to be heavier
In Punjab, Director General (DG) Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Irfan Ali Kathia warned residents on Sunday to prepare for a sixth round of heavy monsoon rains starting Aug 5.
“The ongoing rains could lead to medium to high-level flooding in the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, with the risk expected to begin from Aug 5,” Mr Kathia said.
According to PDMA, monsoon rains in August are expected to be heavier than those experienced last month. Rain is predicted in dozens of districts, including Lahore, Mur­ree, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Sheikhu­pura, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Mian­wali, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawal­pur, Khanewal, and Rajanpur.
The warning advised of a specific risk of landslides in the tourist destinations of Murree and Galliyat, where weak buildings and mud houses could also be damaged.

• Season comes to a close with climbers returning from K2, Broad Peak ‘empty handed’
FOR mountaineers, the mighty peaks in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Karakoram range became unusually precarious this year due to changing weather patterns, which have brought with them an increase in avalanches, rockfalls and other life-threatening hazards.
The mountains are comparatively dry, having lost much snow cover, and hence prone to avalanches — sometimes several times a day.
Baqir Ali, a mountain guide with four decades of experience, said he had never experienced such conditions on the peaks in his entire career.
A resident of Shigar’s Askole village, Mr Ali was part of Laura Dahlmeier’s team. The German Olympian recently perished after being struck by a rockfall at Laila Peak (6,096m).
“Several days before the incident, a French expedition team had cancelled their plan to attempt to climb Laila Peak due to the unfavourable weather condit­ions at the peak,” the 56-year-old told Dawn.
He said he had asked the German climber to do the same, but she continued her ascent in the alpine style — and at an altitude of 5,700m, she became the victim of falling rocks on July 28.
These precarious conditions made Hungary’s László Csomor abandon his expedition to Broad Peak (8,050 m) after more than a month and return to Skardu on Saturday.
His seven-member team had been at the base camp since June 27, hoping to summit the mountain. They, however, decided to call off the adventure, like more than two hundred climbers who had come to Pakistan to ascend its mighty peaks.
“This year, there was less snow at all mountains; rockfall was unusual; we would hear the sound of rockfall and snow avalanches 10 times in a day while sitting at the base camp,” László said, adding that he climbed to Camp 3 twice, but could not start the summit push due to bad weather. He blamed these conditions on less snow cover, saying that with enough snow, such threats diminish.
He said more than 90 climbers had been waiting at the base camp to summit K-2, while 30 mountaineers had been waiting to begin the Broad Peak adventure for the last month. Both peaks share the same base camp. Most of them have had to return with heavy hearts, as the climbing season for the Karakoram peaks nears its end.
László was also a witness to two accidents during his stay at the base camp – on July 11, Polish climber Waldemar Kowalewski fractured his leg in an avalanche on Broad Peak at 6,500m; while on July 19, porter Iftikhar Sadpara lost his life in a similar incident on K2’s Camp 1, located 500m above the base camp.
At least three people were killed and five were injured in such incidents during this season.
New challenges
“These conditions at the Karakoram range were new, and it was also challenging to climb the peaks because the snow was steep and unstable,” László said, adding that a decrease in snowfall made the slopes and hanging rocks prone to falls and avalanches, while crevasses had become bigger.
High winds also made the climb difficult. The foreign climber believed these changes were linked to climate change.
Mingma G, owner of Imagine Nepal and a renowned climber, also abandoned his Gasherbrum-II summit attempt due to avalanche risks. Traditionally, the climbing season for these peaks spans late June to mid-August. But this year, the risks are unusually high, forcing scores to abandon their summits.
“The weather at the peaks is not normal this year,” said Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator. Mr Qadri told Dawn that K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-II and many other seven-thousanders remained unclimbed in the summer, while a few summits at Gasherbrum-I and Nanga Parbat were recorded.
He said some climbers were still at the K2 base camp, to try their luck. However, the season is over and this summer, none of the climbers could move past Camp 3 on K2.
This year, about 22 climbers, including five Pakistanis, scaled Gasherbrum-I (8,080 m) on July 20 and July 22, whereas at least 24 mountaineers, including foreigners, summited Nanga Parbat (8,126m) in the Himalayas.
Distressing situation
Veteran Russian climber Denis Urubko and his wife Maria Cardell summitted Nanga Parbat in alpine style while also charting a new route for ascent in July. Currently, he is in Skardu and plans to scale K2 via a new route. However, he said the situation in the mountains was distressing.
“Glaciers and snow on mountains are melting fast, crevasses are becoming larger, and rockfall occurrences have become routine in the GB mountains,” Mr Urubko said.
He said the “classical route” to summit Nanga Parbat had also become a dangerous route due to speedy snowmelt, adding that these factors had made risks in the mountains higher than usual.
A senior government expert blamed these conditions on changes in the snowfall patterns induced by global warming. He said the region received snow late in the year, and it could not be converted into ice before the summer and thus remained unstable. In addition to that, the heatwave in June and July exacerbated the situation, leading to an unusual number of avalanches.
Livelihoods in danger
As mountains become precarious for climbers, the livelihoods of those who are linked to the tourism industry have also taken a hit. Out of 400 applications received by the GB tourism department, only over 200 climbers from multiple countries arrived to attempt summits, almost 50 per cent down from the previous year.
Thousands of people, including transporters, shopkeepers, hotel owners, porters, mountain guides, and tour operators, depend on the industry for income. Fida Hussain, a high-altitude porter from Shigar, feared that with the reduction of adventure tourism activities, they would also be left without jobs and income.

The results based on a survey of more than 1,100 leaders from government, industry, civil society and academia across 136 countries, paints a stark picture of mounting vulnerabilities that threaten to overwhelm international institutions and destabilise societies.
Environmental risks, including climate change inaction, large-scale pollution, and biodiversity loss, dominate the list of concerns, with the report warning that these crises are both highly likely and potentially catastrophic.
Yet, the report also highlights a worrying lack of preparedness for emerging threats such as space-based events, pandemics, and the rapid advance of frontier technologies.
The report concludes with a call from UN secretary-general for the immediate creation of a task team to strengthen the organisation’s capacity to address risks in the information ecosystem.

Environmental challenges and disinformation top list of vulnerabilities

The UN Department of Global Communications has already begun work to assess the impact of mis- and disinformation on the delivery of the UN’s mandate. The report’s authors warn that global vulnerabilities are being exacerbated by weak governance, a lack of political consensus, and the erosion of state sovereignty.
“One thing is clear when looking out on this landscape of global risk: ultimate responsibility lies with today’s leaders,” UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming said.
“They face a stark choice: breakdown, or break through to a better tomorrow — one in which we all live in peace, dignity and equality on a healthy planet.”
The survey found that multilateral institutions are least prepared to address five critical risks: outer space, cybersecurity breakdowns, the proliferation of non-state actors, mis- and disinformation, and the erosion of state sovereignty.

• Blames rupee devaluation for hike despite near same fuel prices
ISLAMABAD: The price of electricity is expected to increase by one-fourth over the next eight years, according to a power division forecast, after a 50per cent increase in the past three years due to massive currency devaluation.
The average tariff is projected at Rs29.70 per unit by 2034, up by Rs5.70 from the existing rate of Rs24, said the power division in a working paper shared with stakeholders in the last week of July.
The report said the increase in tariffs over the last three years can largely be attributed to the rupee’s depreciation which led to “second round effects of inflation and a contractionary monetary policy that further escalated overall tariff”.
The average power purchase rates increased by almost 50pc from Rs16.77 per unit to Rs24.88 between FY2022 and 2025.
This included about a 115pc increase in annual capacity charges from Rs971bn to about Rs2.1tr, although energy payments slightly dropped by 11pc from Rs1.43tr to Rs1.27tr.
All in all, power purchase rates increased by almost 250pc to Rs24.88 per unit in FY2025 from Rs7.17 per unit in FY2016 before the induction of mega power projects, mostly under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as capacity charges surged from Rs275bn to Rs2.1tr, an increase of 660pc, according to the power division.
Exchange rate impact
The power division said the average base tariff largely remained unchanged between FY2023 and FY25 in dollar terms ($0.12 per unit).
However, due to exchange rate losses, effective base rate jumped 44pc to Rs35.50 per unit from Rs25 as capacity charges increased by 66pc to Rs18.4 per unit compared to Rs11 per unit.
The energy price was reported at Rs10.94 per unit in FY25 against Rs10.2 in FY23, a nominal change. According to the power division, the capacity costs denominated in US dollars escalated from Rs11 to Rs18.4 mainly due to the depreciation of rupee against dollar from about Rs100 to Rs300.
The fuel costs generally remained flat as lower-cost generation capacities came online.
Therefore, “delinking capacity costs from impact of depreciation, and enhancing reliance on indigenous sources remains critical to ensure sustainability”, the power division advocated.
The overall tariff is further bloated by extraneous taxes and other duties, increasing the costs for the end-consumer.
Despite all efforts and reforms, both the average tariff and capacity charges would “keep growing”.
Going forward, capacity charges are estimated at Rs3.14tr in FY2034, up by 65pc, the power division said.
Deindustrialisation
The power division also confirmed “deindustrialisation” that further contracted demand.
“Increase in electricity prices made industry uncompetitive, resulting in closure of industrial units and accelerating process of deindustrialisation”, it said and reported that industrial power consumption peaked in FY22 at 34 billion units (kWh) and declined to 28bn units in FY24, “largely due to higher prices and transition to off-grid generation”.
The power division said “inefficient pricing” increased the cost of debt servicing, further burdening consumers and contracting demand.
Further compounding the issues was the fact that despite tall claims, aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses remained mostly flat — 18.9pc in FY2013 and 18.3pc in FY2024. ATC losses broadly cover the difference between units produced and recovered.
The power division forecast for slower growth in tariff — 25 to 30pc over the next decade against over 260pc in the past decade — comes on the back of an increase in generation from clean-fuel sources to 66pc by 2034 against 46pc in FY25.

They were addressing a joint press conference in their newly-established district office in Shahmansoor Town here on Sunday flanked by various other leaders of the party.
Mr Qaiser said: “With the August 5 rally, we are launching a movement for the release of our leader, securing the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law in the country.”
Tarakai said: “The central and provincial leaders and the allied partners have decided that this time, there will be various protests. This is a movement and we will continue it till achieving our goals.”

Qaiser, Tarakai ask govt not to allow military operations in merged areas

He said: “We will not allow military operations in the merged districts in any way. The provincial government should implement Imran Khan’s orders in this regard. We want education and business instead of guns, and we also want good trade relations with Afghanistan.”
He said that August 5 would be observed as a black day, marking the two years since the incarceration of Imran Khan.
He claimed that according to the Constitution, if a person’s case was not decided within a year, then he should be released on bail after that period, but regretted that Imran was being kept behind bars ‘unjustifiably’.
“We want an open trial of Imran Khan and other PTI leaders and workers in the presence of the media in the Supreme Court,” he said, adding, ‘when the judge is yours, the witness is yours, and the testimony is yours, then we don’t accept it’.
Tarakai called for the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the incidents of May 9, with a view to identifying those responsible and ensuring accountability under the law of the land. He said that after the 26th Amendment, judiciary no longer remained independent.
He said that the federal government was responsible for the deteriorating security situation in the merged districts.
The two leaders admitted that there were internal differences in PTI but declared it part of the democratic process and beauty of democracy, claiming that PTI’s leaders and workers followed Imran Khan’s directives.
“Despite all the difficulties, obstacles, internal differences and the punishment of our leaders, PTI leaders and workers will reach Minar-i-Pakistan on Tuesday,” said Mr Qaiser.
“We are focused on Tuesday’s gathering, which will prove a milestone in securing the release of the party founder,” he said.
Mr Qaiser and Mr Tarakai said though their arrest warrants had been issued they were not afraid of such tactics by the hybrid government, which had ‘stolen’ the PTI’s mandate.
“We have completed our homework for the Lahore rally and the government should not create any obstacles in the way of peaceful protests,” said Qaiser.

Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the head of the 50-member Bajaur Amn Jirga, didn’t say anything about the details of the third round of talks with TTP leaders that concluded after Maghrib prayers. However, two members of the jirga told Dawn on Sunday that the third round of talks was held in Lowi Mamund tehsil, following conditional agreement of TTP leaders to vacate civilian areas during Saturday’s meeting, which was one of the two key demands of Bajaur Amn Jirga.
Sources said that the Sunday’s talks between both sides, aimed at convincing terrorists to either return to Afghanistan or retreat to mountains if they wanted to fight against security forces, were held after high-ups met with jirga members late on Saturday night to discuss the latest developments.
“Officials expressed satisfaction over the outcome of Saturday’s talks between both sides in a meeting with Bajaur Amn Jirga leaders headed by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and decided to give negotiations another chance to resolve the conflict peacefully, leading to third round of talks,” they said.

Third round of talks between local elders and terrorists continues for several hours

On Saturday night, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid in his Facebook post also stated that the third round of talks between them and terrorists would be held on Sunday to resolve the issue through dialogue.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the sole authorised person to inform local media about the outcome of the meeting, did not share details of talks with journalists till filing of this report as he and some other members of the jirga were busy in a meeting with senior officials to brief them on new developments.
However, in a social media post shared just before meeting with officials, he said: “I’m satisfied with today’s meeting, which lasted for seven hours.”
Meanwhile, the residents of Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday urged authorities not to abandon a security post in their locality, fearing that the move would put their lives in peril.
 
 

Addressing a jirga held at Toot Shah Chowk, local elders said that authorities had planned to abandon the security post, established several years ago in the area.
The participants of the jirga demanded of relevant authorities to reconsider the plan.
ISLAMIC LAW: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl local leaders on Sunday vowed to continue their peaceful struggle for enforcement of Islamic law in the country and for peace and socioeconomic development of the district.
They made the pledge while addressing an event to mark the second anniversary of the July 30, 2023, bombing at a party’s gathering near Khar that left 64 people dead and 122 others wounded, mostly JUI-F workers, according to a statement.
The gathering, meant to pay homage to the martyrs, was held at Madressah Jamia Rashidia in Saroo Wanoo area of Salarzai.
JUI-F local chapter head Maulana Abdur Rashid and other senior party leaders including Maulana Kareemullah, Maulana Fataullah, Mufti Mohammad Naeem, and Maulana Mohammad Imran were among the key speakers at the event.
“Despite the deadly bombing of the party’s rally on July 30, 2023, JUI-F is still standing firm on its narrative and position,” the statement quoted Maulana Rashid as saying.
He said that JUI-F would continue the martyrs’ mission and play an active role in promoting peace and people’s prosperity.
The speakers also expressed great concerns over poor law and order in the district, particularly the launch of a military operation in several areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil.
 
 

Describing the military operations as no solution to the issue of terrorism, they called for negotiated settlement of the matter.
The speakers urged all political figures, social and political activists, elders, religious leaders and locals to play their part in promoting peace and stability in the district.
The ceremony concluded with a joint prayer for the departed souls of the martyrs.
