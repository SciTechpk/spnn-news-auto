On one quiet stretch of Northwest DC, Pakistan’s embassy sits just steps away from the Israeli mission — neighbours by accident of location, but poles apart by history, narrative and ideology.
A few miles away across the Potomac, in Langley, Virginia, the CIA’s headquarters is a reminder of the machinations of a superpower’s deep state. An hour’s drive from the capital on hilly terrain, the timeless rigours of nature around the Shen­andoah valley, got me thinking about the world’s most influential constitutional democracy, and how its new security document “looks like the Janus face of a fraying domestic constitutional order, providing geopolitical cover for domestic authoritarian rule and corporate aggrandizement”, in the words of two former US officials.
The lesson, in fact, is simple: no society is immune when trust collapses and politics turns into a fight not over policy, but legitimacy. Pakistan has lived this saga for decades. Our tragedy is that we often debate democracy as if it were a trophy to be won, not a discipline to be practised. We speak of ‘rule of law’ while rewarding selective accountability.
We invoke constitutionalism while resorting to distorting it. We offer dialogue without first restoring dignity, then wonder why no one trusts the offer. At the heart of this dysfunction is this question: are we governed by law or by rulers who use the law as an instrument? Under the rule of law, the state restrains itself; under the law of the ruler, the state restrains the citizen.

 

Pakistan does not require yet another rhetorical recommitment to democracy. It needs a practical covenant — minimum commitments that bind winners and protect losers; that restrain state institutions and restore consent as the only durable foundation of governance. I therefore propose the following charter of democracy and good governance:


Sovereignty of the people. All authority flows from citizens. Government legitimacy depends on credible elections, not sham outcomes. A state cannot be stable if large segments believe the ballot has been managed rather than respected.


The Constitution is a covenant, not a weapon. Constitutional reform must be rooted in broad consent and transparent reasoning. When constitutions are altered as exercises in partisan engineering, the federation becomes a permanent battleground.



No society is immune when politics turns into a fight not over policy, but legitimacy.



A code of restraint for political actors. In polarised societies, leaders either cool the temperature or burn the house down. Political parties must renounce violence, discipline inflammatory rhetoric, accept peaceful alternation, and stop treating opponents as enemies.


Parliament must reclaim its role. Democracy cannot survive as a series of arbitrary executive orders. Parliamentary committees must scrutinise budgets of all institutions, including the establishment and intelligence agencies.


Dialogue must be real, not political theatre. It must lead to the genuine de-escalation of conflict, an agreed agenda, time-bound deliverables, and public clarity on what has been agreed. Dialogue offered under duress merely becomes propaganda, not reconciliation.


Due process has the state’s moral signature. A state is judged by how independently and fairly it administers justice. Investigation, arrest, prosecution and trial must be lawful, reviewable and reasoned. The appearance of justice matters because it produces the one thing the state cannot manufacture: trust.


The breach of civil liberties must be avoided. Speech, association, assembly and free press are not luxuries; they are feedback mechanisms. When the state narrows these spaces, it loses reality testing and begins to mistake silence for consent. Global democratic backsliding shows how easily ‘stability’ becomes an excuse for repression.


Depoliticise the police. A politicised police force becomes the sharp edge of an authoritarian drift. Merit-based postings, independent complaints mechanisms, lawful crowd management, and insulation from partisan instruction should be non-negotiable in a constitutional state.


Accountability must be even-handed. Selec­tive accountability is a political weapon; genuine accountability reflects a sound governance system. Anti-corruption must have clear thresholds, transparent prosecutorial processes, and protections against vendetta — otherwise it becomes a cycle of retaliation.


Follow the money. Organised crime, illicit finance and elite capture hollow out democracies from within. A serious state builds financial intelligence, asset tracing, inter-agency coordination, and visible disruption of high-value criminal networks.


The economy must be improved. Public procurement, tax fairness, regulation, and SOE refo­­rm must be transparent and competence-driven.


Local government is democracy’s foundation. When citizens cannot solve problems locally — water, sanitation, schooling, health, policing — they lose faith in the system. Empowered, elected LGs with fiscal authority are not administrative decorations; they are the bedrock of legitimacy.


Maintaining the civil-military balance. In stable democracies, national security institutions operate under constitutional direction and civilian oversight. When lines blur, politics becomes securitised and security becomes politicised — and citizens pay the price.


Measure what you promise and deliver. A charter without an implementation mechanism is hollow. An independent parliamentary commission should publish an annual state of democracy and governance scorecard — tracking election integrity markers, case backlogs, police complaints and outcomes, press freedom infringements, LG performance, and financial crimes disruption — and debate it in parliament.


The above charter contains the minimum rules necessary to prevent the strong from rewriting the system whenever power changes hands. The choice is stark. We can continue to treat the law as a tool to discipline rivals and reward allies or ad­­o­pt the rule of law as a means of restraining errant governments, institutions, and political actors.
A state is strongest when citizens trust it, and do not fear it. Trust is created when the law applies equally, when institutions behave predictably, and when power accepts limits. This is the difference between the rule of law and the law of the ruler.

Pakistan–Afghanistan relations have deteriorated amid tensions over the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), with Islamabad pressing Kabul to curb cross-border terrorism. After border clashes on October 11, a temporary ceasefire followed talks in Doha and later in Istanbul, but successive rounds of negotiations failed to produce a workable solution despite mediation by Turkiye and Qatar.
Pakistan declared the talks effectively over on November 7 after big differences persisted, after which Afghanistan suspended trade ties, while Pakistan had already closed its border following the clashes.
Trade data shows that the export losses for Afghanistan have reached around 10 per cent since October 10, 2025, compared with about 0.6pc for Pakistan due to the suspension of bilateral trade, placing Kabul at a clear disadvantage as the prolonged disruption continues to weigh more heavily on the Afghan economy.



Nearly 46pc of Afghanistan’s total exports are destined for Pakistan, including a sizable volume routed onward to India via the Wagah border, whereas Afghanistan accounts for only around 3.46pc of Pakistan’s global exports, according to trade data. This assessment does not include transit trade, which represents about 40pc of Afghanistan’s total imports, a factor that further places Kabul in a disadvantaged position.



India has emerged as Kabul’s second-largest export destination, accounting for around 40pc of Afghanistan’s total exports, despite being a non-bordering country. By contrast, exports to Afghanistan’s other three neighbours remain marginal, standing at 1.94pc for Iran, 3.14pc for Uzbekistan, and just 0.37pc for Tajikistan.
This pattern highlights the heavy concentration of Afghanistan’s export markets in Pakistan and India, and the critical role of the Wagah border for Afghan exports routed onward to the Indian market.
Kabul may divert a portion of its remaining imports to Central Asian states, Iran, and India, but it would struggle to find alternative markets for selling its fruits and vegetables, which accounted for 71pc of total exports in 2024, according to the World Bank estimates.
This raises a critical question as to why the Taliban appear willing to disrupt supply chains that are likely to inflict significant damage on an already struggling Afghan economy. A related question confronts Islamabad as well: how Pakistan plans to manage the loss of a market exceeding $1 billion, even though Afghanistan’s share in Pakistan’s overall exports remains relatively small.
As social media activists trade hostile rhetoric across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, little attention is being paid to the economic fallout of a prolonged trade disruption. Extended border closures risk triggering job losses on both sides, while setbacks to agricultural trade are likely to deepen poverty in Afghanistan, where livelihoods remain heavily dependent on cross-border commerce.
Pakistan’s trade engagement with Afghanistan operates across several channels, comprising bilateral exports and imports, the use of its land routes and seaports for Afghan transit cargo, and the onward movement of Afghan exports to India through the Wagah border.

In contrast, Pakistan has yet to significantly leverage Afghanistan as a transit corridor for its own exports to Central Asian States (CAS), which is very marginal in both volume and value.
An analysis of trade data from Pakistan Customs, the International Trade Centre (ITC), the Pakistan Business Council, and leading exporters in Pakistan and Afghanistan points to a different reality. Regardless of whether the immediate losses are small or large, disruptions in supply chains tend to have lasting consequences, as once market access is lost, regaining a foothold in each other’s markets becomes increasingly difficult.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan
Before the Taliban takeover in August 2021, Pakistan had a strong trade surplus with Afghanistan, exporting $1.019bn vs. $579 million in imports in FY21. However, exports dropped to $762m in FY22, slightly rebounded to $953m in FY23, and rose to $1.390b in FY24. Medicines, rice, and cement consistently remained the top export items.



Since October 10, however, the suspension of trade has begun to translate into measurable losses. Pakistan’s average export losses are estimated at $222.5m, equivalent to about 0.6pc of its total exports, while Afghanistan’s losses are estimated at $173m, amounting to around 10pc of Kabul’s average annual exports to the world, underscoring the sharply unequal economic impact of the disruption.
This situation has placed Pakistan’s exporters at a disadvantage, particularly those dealing in the top three export items, along with allied construction industries that had benefited from the recent surge in construction activity in Afghanistan.
Former president of the Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) Muhammad Ishaq said the suspension of trade has “resulted in losses for both countries, with industries in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) bearing the brunt of the disruption.”
He noted that the formal sector has emerged as the “principal victim of the prolonged border closures.”
The data showed that more than 90pc of Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan are routed through customs stations in KP, with the bulk passing through the Torkham border crossing. By contrast, exports via the Chaman border in Balochistan remain negligible, further concentrating the impact of the trade halt on businesses and industries linked to the KP corridor.
Alternative to Pakistan’s exports
Historically, Afghanistan has managed to find alternatives to Pakistani goods whenever imports were restricted or borders were closed. In recent years, Kabul has increasingly shifted its food and fuel security towards Central Asian States, whereas it had previously relied heavily on Pakistan for food imports, particularly flour, sugar, and other essential items.
Pakistan’s major exports to Afghanistan now include cement, pharmaceutical products, rice, and a limited range of textiles and construction materials. The current suspension of trade is therefore providing Kabul with an opportunity, and a justification, to push Afghan importers towards alternative suppliers, potentially accelerating a shift that could prove difficult to reverse even after borders reopen.
President of the Afghanistan–Pakistan Joint Chamber of Commerce (APJCC), Khan Jan Alokozai, said: “Afghan importers have already begun shifting orders away from Pakistan in response to the prolonged suspension of trade, particularly in key sectors such as cement and pharmaceuticals.”
He added that Afghan traders were now placing cement orders with Iran, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan, noting that Iranian cement was available at lower prices than Pakistani supplies. On pharmaceuticals, Alokozai said, “Importers had started sourcing medicines from Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Iran, while Afghanistan had also begun importing medicines from India via air cargo. At present, Pakistani pharmaceutical products still account for around 60–70pc of Afghanistan’s market, but that share is now under pressure.”
He acknowledged that the trade suspension had resulted in losses on both sides. While prices in Afghanistan had risen in the immediate aftermath of the disruption, he said traders expected the situation to stabilise over time as alternative supply arrangements were put in place. “Business representatives had held several meetings with Afghanistan’s commerce and interior ministers to seek a resolution, but so far no breakthrough had been achieved,” he said.
Afghanistan exports to Pakistan
In the post-Taliban period, Afghanistan’s exports to Pakistan stood at $795n in FY22, increased to $893m in FY23, fell sharply to $539m in FY24, and then recovered to $612m in FY25, keeping Pakistan as Afghanistan’s single largest export market. This trajectory is often overlooked in discussions on bilateral trade, despite its importance in understanding the depth of Afghanistan’s dependence on the Pakistani market.



According to a World Bank report, Pakistan accounted for 45pc of Afghanistan’s total exports in 2024, down from 54pc in 2023, but still far ahead of any other destination. The report notes that food and coal dominated these shipments, together making up 63pc of Afghanistan’s exports to Pakistan.
Afghanistan exports to India via Wagah border
After Pakistan, India has emerged as Afghanistan’s second-largest export destination, with Afghan exporters relying on a mix of routes to access the Indian market. Shipments move through air cargo and via Iran’s Bandar Abbas port, but a sizable portion of Afghan exports to India continues to transit through the Wagah border.
Afghan traders also use Pakistan’s Karachi ports for overseas shipments. In August 2019, Pakistan suspended bilateral trade with India following New Delhi’s decision to revoke the special status of Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Despite the halt in direct trade, Pakistan continued to keep the Wagah border operational to facilitate Afghan exports to the Indian market, allowing Afghanistan to maintain access to a key trade route even amid heightened regional tensions.

Official data shows that between 2021–22 and 2025–26, Afghanistan’s exports with a declared value of Rs156.8b ($611.11m) were transported through Pakistan to India via the Wagah border and Karachi port to external markets, involving a total of 11,355 trucks.
A breakdown of the figures indicates that Wagah handled the bulk of this traffic, accounting for 10,031 trucks carrying exports valued at Rs127.4bn ($507.66m). In comparison, Karachi port facilitated 1,324 trucks with a declared export value of Rs29.36bn ($103.45m) over the same five-year period, underscoring the dominant role of the land route in Afghanistan’s export transit through Pakistan.
Diversion of Afghan transit trade
Afghanistan’s total import bill stood at $10.8b in 2024, of which Pakistan accounted for $3.496bn, or 32.37pc of total imports. The remaining share was sourced from a widening pool of suppliers, reflecting a gradual diversion of Afghan transit and imports towards Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, India, China, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
In recent years, Pakistan has placed several smuggling-prone items on the negative list for transit cargo, tightening controls on Afghan shipments. As a result, the value of Afghan imports transiting through Pakistan declined sharply, falling to $2.432bn in FY24 from $6.701bn in FY23, and dropping further to $1.012bn in FY25. With the current suspension of trade, industry estimates suggest the figure could slip below the $1bn mark in FY26, deepening the shift in Afghanistan’s import routes and suppliers.



Urging both governments to facilitate trade, Alokozai said that businessmen have little choice but to seek alternative routes whenever disruptions or hurdles emerge from either side. “Transit trade through Pakistan has repeatedly faced unprecedented obstacles due to shifting policies, which in turn raised demurrage costs for importers,“ he said.
“As a result,” he added, “Afghan traders are increasingly diverting their imports towards Central Asian states and Iran in search of more stable and predictable supply routes.”
Pakistan transit trade to Central Asia
In recent years, Pakistan has signed transit trade agreements with several Central Asian States, a framework that hinges heavily on stable relations between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan has already begun handling transit cargo linked to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, but the current suspension of trade with Afghanistan is now disrupting these emerging corridors.

According to Alokozai, containers from CASs carrying goods, particularly cotton, for Pakistan are currently stranded on the Afghan side due to the trade halt. He added that Pakistani transit cargo has also piled up within Afghanistan, reflecting how quickly the suspension has begun to affect two-way transit flows beyond bilateral trade.
Ex-Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Ishaq said the disruption has also stalled planned industrial relocation. “The segments of Punjab’s textile industry had begun shifting operations to Uzbekistan, but the current uncertainty has brought that process to a halt,” he noted.
Cotton and coal imports from Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, which were being used by industries in KP and Punjab, have also been affected, he added.
While the government has allowed transit via Iran for access to CASs markets, Ishaq pointed out that the route is significantly longer. The distance from Torkham to CASs is around 850 kilometres, making it far shorter and more cost-effective. Longer routes, he said, sharply increase transportation costs, reducing the competitiveness of both exports and imports.
Pakistan and Afghanistan have remained economically interconnected despite repeated disruptions dating back to 1947. Bilateral trade was suspended on three occasions: first from 1949 to 1950, again in 1955, and later between 1961 and 1963.
Over time, formal trade has contracted, and routes have shifted, particularly during the period from 1979 to 1989, as Afghanistan’s commercial orientation increasingly turned toward northern CASs and western routes through Iran.</p><small>2025-12-31 04:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31031537a47c7d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964257/misgovernance-low-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Misgovernance & low growth</strong></a><br><p>ECONOMISTS agree that cities are the primary engines of economic growth. All our development partners have been telling us that, without addressing Karachi’s infrastructure issues, Pakistan cannot achieve its growth targets.
On Aug 29, 2025, this newspaper published my article on how Karachi has been deprived of its rightful share of more than Rs3 trillion since 2010. Had that amount been spent on Karachi, we would not have reached this chaotic situation.
With Karachi’s consistent neglect, Pakistan has been suffering from a low average growth syndrome since 2010. The Prime Minister’s Economic Transformation Agenda and Implementation Plan (2024-29) sets a growth target of six per cent. In the first year of the plan, we achieved only 2.7pc. Pakistan will continue to remain in a low-growth quagmire unless it improves the infrastructure of its growth engine, Karachi, which contributes 50pc of the country’s exports and handles 76pc of its trade. Let’s check one issue that has become critical to its population and industry: water.
Most of us, including our most vocal political leadership, are under the impression that the completion of the Greater Karachi Water Supply Scheme (K-IV) will resolve the city’s water crisis. They are overlooking the fact that the Sindh government has turned K-IV, a water supply project, into a highly complex and insoluble inter-provincial issue. Given the Sindh government’s reluctance to provide funds for K-IV since 2007, the federal government took up the matter in December 2014, and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif directed that K-IV be completed within three years.

 

In January 2015, the media reported that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari directed the provincial government to resolve Karachi’s water shortage “on an emergency basis” and complete K-IV at the earliest. But even after 11 years, there is no sign of K-IV’s completion. The Sindh government is also moving at a snail’s pace on the augmentation project for water distribution pipelines, which has been pending since 2016. Even if by any chance K-IV is completed and the augmentation of pipelines carried out, Karachi’s water issue won’t be resolved. Why?
Karachi needs 1,200-1,300 MGD (million gallons per day) of water. However, it gets roughly 550 MGD from Keenjhar Lake and 100 MGD from Hub Dam. The fact that most of this water reaches consumers through water tankers is another issue. The shortage is estimated to be 650 MGD or roughly 50pc of Karachi’s needs.
Ironically, the provincial government has also been refusing to provide additional water for Karachi out of Sindh’s share in the Indus Water Accord and has approached the Indus River System Authority for a separate allocation to increase the supply to Karachi from 1,200 cusecs (roughly 775 MGD) to 2,400 cusecs (roughly 1,550 MGD). Irsa reminded Sindh that the IWA signed by the four provinces specifically mentions that Sindh’s allocation includes water for Karachi’s urban and industrial use and that such supplies for the metropolitan city will be given priority. The Sindh government was supposed to abide by the accord’s specific provisions and develop infrastructure to provide water for Karachi from its own allocation rather than seeking it from the share of the other provinces. Has any other province ever asked Irsa for separate water allocation for its cities or the federal government to provide funds?
After failing to convince Irsa on the issue (in 2004, 2011 and 2015), the Sindh government decided to reduce the planned capacity of K-IV by 390 MGD — from 650 MGD to 260 MGD — till such time Irsa separately allocates water for Karachi. For this curtailed project of 260 MGD, the Sindh government will line the K.B. Feeder Canal (a project which has yet to begin), and the water saved from seepage will be provided for K-IV (Phase I). So, the present K-IV project is a curtailed version; even if it is completed, it will only solve one-third of the problem.
Let’s check how much 390 MGD or 600 cusecs being denied to Karachi comes to: just 0.9pc of Sindh’s water resources of 67,000 cusecs. When I served as project director for the National Programme for Improvement of Watercourses, we lined around 13,000 watercourses in Sindh within three years (2004-2007), saving an estimated 13,000 cusecs of water seepage. Such is the negligible volume of 600 cusecs required for Karachi. The city of 25m people (almost 40pc of Sindh) has been made to beg the federal government for funds for K-IV (amounting to only 4pc of Sindh’s annual development programme) and ask other provinces for water (for only 0.9pc of Sindh’s resources).
For 1,000 gallons of water, the agricultural landowners (using 95pc of the water resources of Sindh) pay only 20 paisas compared to a tanker in Karachi which costs Rs1,000 for the same quantity.
In short, whenever the curtailed K-IV and pipeline augmentation are completed (an eternity, it seems), these won’t be sufficient to cater for even one-third of the city’s needs. There seems to be no intention on the part of the Sindh government to even start designing the remaining part of K-IV as it is not ready to give 0.9pc of its water share, and is, instead, waiting for Irsa to allocate water for Karachi. Meanwhile, Irsa says that it deals with provincial shares, not cities’ shares.
Karachi pays 90pc of Sindh’s taxes and 60pc of federal taxes, yet it has not received its rightful share of more than Rs3tr since 2010 from the Sindh government, the NFC beneficiary. The IWA provides for preferential treatment for Karachi’s water needs, but the Sindh government won’t abide by it even if it means only a tiny fraction of the province’s water resources. Then what is the logical solution to these issues that are impeding national growth, while also contributing to the unending misery of Karachi’s residents?

The move is less about New Delhi’s energy ambitions and more about its ulterior motives to deploy a shared water system as an instrument of coercion against Pakistan. The recent approval of the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab, following the revival of environmental clearances for the much larger, decades-old Sawalkote scheme, is a clear signal of a deliberate acceleration of dam-building on the river allocated to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty.
That this push comes in the aftermath of India’s unilateral suspension of the water treaty following this year’s attack in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir lends credence to reports that New Delhi is planning to build water storage on Pakistan’s rivers to control their flows downstream.
The recent disruptions in the Chenab flow show a clear pattern in which India has repeatedly manipulated its upstream position to exert pressure on Pakistan ever since its illegal suspension of the IWT. Before that, India’s failure to share data on water levels and discharge in a timely manner aggravated flood devastation in Punjab.

 

The threat of water weaponisation is why Pakistan has consistently opposed Indian plans to undertake projects on its rivers. Most such schemes violate IWT project designs that allow for more water storage than required for power generation, which can be used to disrupt river flows downstream.
Likewise, Pakistan has raised objections against their gated spillways to prevent the sudden stoppage or release of large volumes of water. Concerns that India can create water shortages by stopping flows in the sowing season and flood land by releasing water during the monsoons have already been confirmed.

 

However, India’s anti-Pakistan agenda is not the only reason why constructing hydropower and storage on Chenab is a bad idea. Experts have warned of the adverse environmental impact of these schemes. The Chenab basin is among the most climate-vulnerable in the region.
Studies show that the glaciers have lost roughly a third of their volume in just a few decades. For a river whose flows are heavily dependent on glacial melt, this foretells a long-term water security crisis in the making for both Pakistan and India. The Narendra Modi government is evidently not concerned by the fact that its actions threaten the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. By destabilising the headwaters through dam construction, India is only accelerating ecological collapse, which will not spare it either.
Former climate minister Sherry Rehman aptly summed up the potential consequences of Indian actions when she tweeted that “this weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the front line of climate change and environmental stress”. It will only worsen bilateral tensions.

The Orange Line runs from Orangi Town to North Nazimabad while Green Line connects Surjani Town with Numaish via North Nazimabad.
“Citizens used to complain that they had to pay fare twice by accessing the Green Line. However, now the entire journey will be possible on a single ticket, which will provide travel convenience to 100,000 people daily,” he said while speaking at the inauguration ceremony held at the Orange Line depot.
Talking to the media, Mr Memon said it will now be possible to travel on the Orange Line and the Green Line at the same fare.

Sharjeel says commuters can now travel from Orangi to Numaish in one fare; double-deckers to hit Karachi roads today

During the tenure of the federal government, the ridership of the Green Line was up to 55,000 per day, whereas it has now increased to around 80,000, he said, adding that thousands of citizens benefit from this service every day, and the fares have also been kept very low.
He said that security cameras and other facilities are also available in the buses. Separate buses for women will also be operated on the Green Line and Orange Line.
Double-decker buses from tomorrow
The minister announced that double-decker buses are going to be launched in the city on Wednesday (today).
He said that double-decker buses will operate from Malir to Sharea Faisal, he said, adding that more double-decker buses will be brought to Karachi as these will help solve traffic problems.
The public will be given a New Year gift, and new EV buses have also arrived, he added.
To a question, he said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced 150 buses for Karachi. He requested the PM to fulfil this promise. In response to another question, he said that no one will be allowed to occupy government land.
He said that the Sindh Police and intelligence agencies carried out a major and very important operation in which those operating on foreign funding lured an innocent girl and prepared her to take the lives of ordinary citizens.
People were used on the orders of enemy countries, and parents were instructed to monitor the activities of their children, he said and warned that the nation’s children are being exploited and are being given a false narrative through social media. No objective was achieved by any explosion; rather, the target was the country and its own people.
Transport Secretary Asad Zamin, Sindh Mass Transit Authority Managing Director Kanwal Nizam Bhutto and other officials were also present at the inauguration ceremony.

On Sunday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had forecast rain and thunderstorms, with snowfall over the hills, in most parts of the country during this week.
In Sindh, it predicted isolated light rain or drizzle in Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Larkana, Thatta, Badin and adjoining areas on Dec 30 (Tuesday).</p><small>2025-12-31 03:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/310818121f5f2ef.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964226/afghans-returning-from-iran-pakistan-face-different-challenges-un-report' target='_blank'><strong>Afghans returning from Iran, Pakistan face different challenges: UN report</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Findings of UNHCR’s “Afghanistan post-return monitoring survey report” released on Tuesday highlighted different challenges for Afghan returnees from Iran versus Pakistan: those from Iran often have more education, better food security, and housing, while returnees from Pakistan face severe economic hardship, relying more on daily wages, and carrying heavier debt burdens.
The returnees from Iran were less likely to have income-generating employment, and more often reported barriers to girls’ education. Those returning from Pakistan after April found more casual income opportunities but struggled to afford rent and maintain sufficient food.
According to the survey, across all groups, returnees continue to settle in areas with fragile conditions marked by deepening poverty and limited access to essential services. Many cannot return to their areas of origin due to lack of shelter, land, or livelihoods. Over half of households surveyed reported missing essential civil documentation, restricting access to education, healthcare, and housing.
Education remains sharply constrained for all women and girls in Afghanistan: returnees from Iran most often cited policies and laws as the key barrier, while returnees from Pakistan pointed to economic obstacles. Access to healthcare is limited by cost, distance, and medicine short ages, with women disproportionately affected due to movement restrictions, survey results show.

UNHCR says Afghans coming from Iran more educated, have better food security than those returning from Pakistan

Most returnees (88 per cent) reported living in debt, representing a slight decline from the 2024 survey. Indebted households were typically large, averaging six members. Debt was particularly widespread in Nangarhar province, where 96 per cent of returnees reported financial distress.
Returnees from Iran were slightly less likely to hold debt than those from Pakistan, while differences between female-headed (90 per cent) and male-headed (87 per cent) households were minimal. Almost all indebted households stated that their debt exceeded their monthly income, under scoring widespread, unsustainable debt cycles and the financial pressures that undermine economic reintegration.

 

In August 2025, the monitoring expanded to include returnees from Iran for the first time, alongside those from Pakistan.
This round draws on interviews with 1,658 returnee households from Pakistan and Iran. Two new data sets were introduced for returnees from Pakistan: one for those who returned before April 2025 and one for those who returned after when cash assistance was reduced due to funding shortfalls.
The survey also includes undocumented returnees, allowing analysis of possible differences between returnees with refugee documentation in countries of asylum and those without.
The UN refugee agency says these findings highlight the urgency of sustained, multisectoral support to protect returnees and assist their reintegration. Interventions must be tailored to the differing profiles and needs of returnees from Iran and Pakistan, taking into account their distinct vulnerabilities and circumstances behind their return. Continued post-return monitoring remains critical to track evolving challenges, adapt programming, and advance long-term stability and protection.
The changes in data sets reflect the need to understand evolving returnee experiences. In 2025, Afghanistan saw massive return movements, with an estimated 2.7 million returns between January and November. These returns reflect changes in the profiles of those coming back.
Many returns occurred under duress and adverse conditions, driven by policies in neighbouring countries and deteriorating conditions for Afghans abroad, particularly in Pakistan and Iran. These mass returns often resulted in abrupt departures and difficult journeys back to Afghanistan.
Food insecurity remains critical despite modest improvements, with returnees from Pakistan disproportionately affected. Shelter, water, and education access further highlight disparities. Returnees from Pakistan, particularly recent arrivals, are more likely to rent housing and struggle to afford rent, whereas returnees from Iran more often own or inherit their homes. Access to safe water and sanitation is also more limited for returnees from Pakistan.
These findings highlight the urgency of sustained, multisectoral support that addresses both immediate and long-term needs. Assistance must combine short and medium-term cash support with livelihood opportunities, durable housing solutions, water and health infrastructure, and access to civil documentation, among other key needs and challenges faced by returnees.
Targeted interventions are essential for the most vulnerable groups, including female-headed households and people with disabilities. Continued monitoring, disaggregated by country and period of return, is critical to adapting programming based on evidence and ensuring that reintegration translates into lasting improvements in stability and protection.

MUZAFFARABAD: The federal government has notified a nine-member committee to deliberate on a contentious clause of an agreement signed nearly three months ago among the Centre, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government and the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC).
A notification to this effect, is­­sued by the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan and dated Dec 29, surfaced on social media on Tuesday. According to it, the committee comprises Mian Abdul Waheed, the senior-most AJK minister, and advocates Sardar Tahir Anwar and Raja Ejaz Ahmad Khan as nominees of the AJK government, while advocates Raja Amjad Ali Khan, Sardar Arbab and Saad Ansari represent the JKJAAC.
The federal government is represented by Muhammad Khashihur Rehman, draftsman/additional secretary; Hassan Mahmood, legislative adviser; and Taim­oor Zareen Khan, consultant research — all from the Ministry of Law and Justice.
Under its terms of reference, the committee will deliberate on the issue of “members of the AJK Legislative Assembly other than the AJK constituencies (sic),” a reference to the 12 legislators ele­cted from constituencies reser­­ved for Pakistan-based refugees from India-held Jammu and Kashmir.
The committee has been auth­orised to meet as frequently as required and submit its recommendations to the Monitoring and Implementation (M&I) Commit­tee constituted under the Muzaf­farabad Agreement. The agreement was signed in the small hours of Oct 4 following prolonged negotiations between an eight-member federal team and the JKJAAC leadership, after a week-long shutdown across AJK which left at least 10 people, including activists and policemen, dead and dozens injured.
At the time of the agreement, an M&I Committee was also constituted, comprising federal ministers Amir Muqam and Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, along with two nominees each from the AJK government and the JKJAAC, “to oversee and implement the accord”.
The committee was also mandated to review and rationalise the perks and privileges of the judiciary, ministers and government officials in view of financial constraints. While the main agreement ad­­d­­ressed several political, econo­mic and administrative demands, it separately provided for the formation of a high-powered legal committee to deliberate on the controversial issue of the 12 refugee seats.
The first meeting of the M&I Committee was held in Islamabad on Oct 21, after which it was decided to convene the next session in Muzaffarabad on Nov 15. However, the meeting eventually took place on Nov 21, a day after the JKJAAC addressed an open letter to AJK Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, alleging that the agreement had remained largely unimplemented beyond agreed timelines.
When contacted on Tuesday, the JKJAAC expressed regret over what it termed an inordinate delay in the formation of the committee, particularly at a time when public warnings of renewed protest had begun to surface.
“This step should have been taken within 15 days of the signing of the Muzaffarabad agreement, but it took almost 90 days,” said Raja Amjad Ali Khan, one of the notified committee members.

The city-state has doubled down on syndicates following record-high scam losses, with the Ministry of Home Affairs saying that “fighting scams is a top national priority”.
Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy lost more than $2.8 billion through scams from 2020 up to the first half of 2025, Sim Ann, Singapore’s senior minister of state for home affairs, told parliament last month as she pushed for the bill to pass.
Around 190,000 cases of scamming had been reported over that time period, she said.
Caning scammers was part of amendments to the penal code passed in parliament in November, and will be imposed on top of other punishments like imprisonment and fines.
“Yes, it comes into effect today, 30 Dec 2025,” the home ministry said.
Scammers and members of scam syndicates or recruiters “will face mandatory caning of at least six strokes, up to a maximum of 24 strokes”, the ministry said in an earlier statement.
Those helping scammers, including so-called “money mules” who offer bank accounts or SIM cards, face “discretionary caning” of up to 12 lashes, it added.
In recent years, Singaporean authorities have intensified public education efforts against scamming, including setting up a national hotline.
In 2020, the government introduced the ScamShield app, which allows users to check suspicious calls, websites, and messages.
Last year, then-premier Lee Hsien Loong told local media he had been scammed as an item he ordered online never arrived, highlighting how the issue affected all sectors of society.

The launch ceremony, which also featured the signing of financing documents including investor and issuer agreements, was attended by senior government officials, development partners, private sector leaders and representatives of international organisations.







The PSIB represents a fundamental restructuring of how Pakistan finances skill development, shifting decisively from input-based public spending to outcome-driven, private-sector-enabled social investment. It was designed to deliver measurable outcomes such as certification, job placement, and at least six-month retention for every trainee.
The model will gradually evolve so that subsequent tranches link repayment to a nominal portion of trainee salaries, embedding long-term sustainability while monetizing Pakistan’s demographic dividend both domestically and through the export of certified talent.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb underscored the transformational importance of the PSIB in Pakistan’s broader economic reform agenda and human capital strategy.
He described the day as “an important moment focused on education and training,” reiterating that Pakistan’s demographic dividend can only be realised if the country succeeds in upskilling and reskilling its youth at scale.
He stressed that NAVTTC’s work sits at the heart of this vision, noting that the global shift toward high-value digital skills such as blockchain offers unprecedented earning potential for Pakistani youth, who already constitute the world’s third-largest freelancer community.
The minister emphasised that the PSIB is part of a wider, government-led strategic shift away from traditional budget-based social spending toward outcomes, evidence and accountability, reflecting a deliberate departure from input-driven systems that rely solely on public financing.

The judges under consideration are Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, Justice Mohammad Asif, and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas. The IHC administration has alre­ady forwarded the service records of the three judges to the JCP along with recommendations of Chief Justice Sardar Moha­mmad Sarfraz Dogar, who will participate in the meeting as a member of the JCP.
Justice Azam and Just­ice Minhas were appoi­nted as additional judges to the IHC, whereas Jus­tice Asif was appointed as a judge in the Balochistan High Court before he was transferred to Islamabad through a presidential order that also brought incumbent CJ Dogar to the IHC.
These transfers and the subsequent elevation of Justice Dogar as chief justice witnessed unprecedented internal discord within the IHC. Several judges appeared as litigants before the Supreme Court, while two judges attended proceedings before the Sindh High Court as private petitioners in the case relating to Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s degree.
In 2025, the IHC decided at least 16,000 cases. Official data shows that Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas recorded the highest number of disposals, deciding 2,039 cases in his single bench and more than 500 cases in division benches. Justice Mohammad Azam Khan decided 1,841 cases in single benches and around 600 in division benches, while Justice Mohammad Asif disposed of 1,338 cases.
It may be noted that Justice Asif is also facing a complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), in which it was alleged that he misused his authority to influence proceedings in a hit-and-run case involving his son.
According to the complaint, dated December 25 and submitted by Advocate Inamul Rahim, the incident occurred on December 2 near the Pakistan National Council of Arts, where a speeding SUV allegedly driven by Justice Asif’s son struck a scooter, killing two girls on the spot. A judicial magistrate later granted bail to the accused on December 6 after the victims’ families pardoned him in court.
JCP meetings
In a series of meetings expected in January, the JCP is also expected to confirm the appointment of additional judges, who were appointed to the Lahore High Court and the Balochistan High Court.
Following the 27th Amendment, the commission comprises Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Yahya Afridi as its head, Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Pakistan Bar Council representative Ahsan Bhoon, two members each from the National Assembly and the Senate, a woman or non-Muslim nominee of the National Assembly speaker, a member of the Islamabad Bar Council, and a federal minister.

The sit-in was staged after Imran’s sisters were again denied a meeting with the former prime minister.
Videos shared by the PTI Punjab account on the social media platform X after 1am showed water cannons spraying what appeared to be protesters.
“In the severe cold, an attack with water cannons was carried out on unarmed, peaceful children, women, and citizens,” it said.







The same video was also shared by the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on X. It said that Punjab police had used water cannons against innocent and unarmed people.
It added that Imran’s sisters, senior TTAP and PTI leaders, and workers were affected by the “chemical-laced water”.







Subsequently, the alliance said that Imran’s sisters — Aleema, Noreen and Uzma — and TTAP Spokesperson Akhunzada Hussain Yousafzai, PTI MNA Shahid Khattak, PTI lawyer Khalid Yousuf and others were arrested by Punjab police. The video accompanying the post showed Aleema raising her fist in the air as she was driven away in a police van.







After 4:30am, the PTI said that Aleema was arrested, without mentioning the other two sisters, adding that police took her towards Chakri, where she was later released.







A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 has mandated that meetings with Imran will be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured. The party has staged sit-ins near the prison to demand a meeting with the party founder, the last two which have been dispersed with water cannons.







Earlier on Tuesday, Aleema Khan, had praised Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s recent visit to Lahore.







“It should be gauged how much the Punjab government was afraid of Sohail Afridi and other supporters of Imran Khan,“ she said. “They blocked all roads, food streets and other areas, but the people of Lahore proved that they really support Imran Khan,” Aleema stated.
She added that it was unfortunate that authorities were not allowing a meeting with the PTI founder.
Replying to a question, she said that the TTAP did not request dialogue with the government, but rather it was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif who extended the invite.
“However, as per the instructions of Imran Khan, who has directed Sohail Afridi to start preparations for a street movement, we are on the roads,” she said.







Aleema added that she and her sisters would continue demanding to arrange a meeting with their brother.
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan expressed his dismay that meetings with Imran were being denied despite court orders, adding that a party having to request a meeting with its own chairman was unfortunate.
Referring to dialogue with the government, Gohar maintained that negotiations can be held, but stressed that preparations for the protest movement will continue simultaneously.
“It is the need of the hour to hold dialogue, but it is not taking place,” he said, adding that being forced to stand outside the jail every week was “unjustified”.
“A ceasefire was declared with the external enemy, but political tension continues within the country,” Gohar lamented.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja argued that it was a basic human right to arrange meetings with family members for prisoners. He further condemned the fact that the government had placed Imran “in solitary confinement”.
Raja said everyone was aware that the meeting would not be arranged, but they would keep going to the prison to protest and deliver their message of support for Imran.
Replying to a question, the PTI secretary general said that in the current situation, talks with the government would be meaningless as they “were not showing any seriousness”.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Earlier this month, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”
Last week, Aleema and PTI workers ended their sit-in at Rawalpindi’s Factory Naka, hours after they were again barred from moving towards Adiala jail in a bid to meet the incarcerated ex-premier.</p><small>2025-12-31 02:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31073050a1fe77f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964235/pakistan-to-enter-2026-as-fifth-most-populous-country' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to enter 2026 as fifth-most populous country</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) says that as Pakistan enters 2026 as the world’s fifth most populous country, with a population exceeding 225 million, high population growth and fertility rates, persistent gender inequality, and rising climate vulnerability, the urgency of addressing population dynamics has intensified.
These realities underscore the need to view population not as a burden but as a strategic driver of sustainable and inclusive development, UNFPA Pakistan said in a statement on Tuesday.

 

Looking ahead to 2026, UNFPA called for a shift in how population is reflected in national planning and financing, particularly in the NFC formula.
Moving beyond population size as the primary det­e­rminant, a forward-loo­k­ing appro­ach should rew­ard provinces for measurable progress in gender equ­ality, climate resilience, bal­anced population outco­mes, and improvements in the quality of health and education services.

 

Such reform would align fiscal incentives with human development res­ults, encourage innovation and accountability, and help translate population policy into tangible gains for people and communities, the statement said.
UNFPA also urged the implementation of the recommendations of the Council of Common Interests with clear accountability mechanisms, defined timelines, and sustained domestic financing, supported by strong population data and evidence-based planning.
Despite gains, challenges remain, the agency said. High maternal mortality, unmet need for family planning, early marriages, gender-based violence, and unequal access to quality reproductive health services, particularly in remote communities, continue to demand attent­ion. These challenges are also closely lin­ked to stalled fertility decline and uneven development outcomes, UNFPA said.

POS machines digitally record transactions, through touchscreen/terminal, barcode scanners, card readers, etc., and includes receipt printers. Due to POS machines all business transactions can be recorded and taxable income is easily traced by the FBR.
The announcement was made during a rally held from Aabpara Chowk to old Embassy Road against mandatory installation of POS. They tried to enter the Red Zone, but they were not allowed.
The traders had announced to hold a protest demonstration in front of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) office at Constitution Avenue, but the authorities stopped them from entering the Red Zone.

Hold rally from Aabpara Chowk to old Embassy Road against mandatory installation of POS

The rally was stopped by a heavy police contingent near Serena Hotel, following which traders staged a strong protest at the same spot and held a protest gathering.
The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran and Traders Action gathering (TAC). A large number of trader representatives and shopkeepers from Islamabad and Rawalpindi participated in the rally.
Leaders of various traders’ associations from Islamabad and Rawalpindi addressed the gathering, including representatives of market associations and chambers of small traders.
Addressing the rally, President TAC, Islamabad, Ajmal Baloch said that the government should immediately withdraw what he termed the “black law” of installing POS devices. In a fiery speech he called for the passage of legislation awarding the death penalty for corruption.
Citing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, he claimed that corruption worth Rs53 trillion occurs annually across the country, and FBR had the largest share. “These corrupt elements had now turned towards traders, and that the installation of POS machines at small shops will only create new options to fleece the traders for bribery,” Mr Baloch added.
He informed about some incidents involving FBR, that legally imported tyres worth millions of rupees were seized, with only half returned while the remainder were allegedly distributed among corrupt officials.
Ajmal Baloch also alleged that children of thousands of FBR employees were studying abroad.
“We have  a simple demand why there should not be any inquiry into their assets, claiming that even low-ranking staff own luxury vehicles worth millions of rupees,” he said. He further alleged that customs authorities had seized 26,000 non-custom-paid vehicles that were being used by bureaucrats and their relatives.
He warned that if the FBR attempted to install POS machines by force or seal any small shop in Islamabad, traders would resist strongly. The leaders of the protest announced that in the next phase of protests they plan to block Kashmir Highway and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on Jan 16.
The speakers said that if FBR continued its oppressive policies, traders would call a nationwide shutter-down strike and stage a protest at D-Chowk. They demanded the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to protect traders from corruption and high-handedness by the tax authorities.

“In light of recent developments and their potential implications for the safety and effectiveness of counterterrorism missions, the Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism personnel in Yemen of its own volition, in a manner that ensures the safety of its personnel and in coordination with the concerned partners,” said the UAE’s Ministry of Defence on X.
The statement added that UAE’s presence in Yemen was limited to specialised personnel “as part of counterterrorism efforts, in coordination with relevant international partners”.







The Gulf monarchy also rejected Saudi Arabia’s accusations that it supplied weapons to a Yemeni separatist faction amid rising tensions between the two Gulf monarchies.
“The shipment in question did not contain any weapons, and the vehicles unloaded were not intended for any Yemeni party,” said the UAE.







Saudi Arabia declared a UAE-backed separatist advance in Yemen a threat to the kingdom’s national security and called Abu Dhabi’s actions “highly dangerous”, as the rivalry between the Gulf monarchies boiled over into an open dispute.
The strongly worded foreign ministry statement came hours after the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it had struck a United Arab Emirates weapons shipment destined for separatist forces.

“The steps taken by the UAE are considered highly dangerous,” it said, adding “the Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat”.
In recent weeks, separatists seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen, have made sweeping territorial gains in a lightning offensive.
“Given the danger and escalation posed by these weapons… the coalition air forces carried out a limited military operation this morning targeting weapons and combat vehicles that had been unloaded from the two ships at the port of Al-Mukalla,” the alliance said, according to the Saudi state news agency.
AFP footage of the port showed dozens of parked military vehicles and pick-ups, several of which were burnt out and smouldering as workers hosed them down.
After the strikes, the leader of Yemen’s presidential council, which sits atop the Aden-based government, declared a state of emergency and cancelled a security pact with Abu Dhabi after the forces of the Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized swaths of territory.
The STC is also a key member of the government - a fractious patchwork of groups held together by its opposition to the Houthi rebels who control swaths of northern and western Yemen including the capital Sanaa.
Oil prices steady amid rising tensions in Gulf
Despite growing tensions between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, oil prices saw little change as investors took stock of the situation in the Middle East.
Brent crude futures for February delivery, which expire on Tuesday, were up by 24 cents, or 0.39 per cent, at $62.18 a barrel at 1315 GMT (6:15pm PKT). The more active March contract was up by 26 cents, or 0.42pc, at $61.75.
US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 26 cents, or 0.45pc, to $58.34.
The Brent and WTI benchmarks settled more than 2pc higher in the previous session as Saudi Arabia launched today’s airstrikes.

Despite renewed fears of potential supply disruptions, perceptions of an oversupplied global market remain and could cap prices, analysts say.
Prices are likely to trend downwards in the first quarter of 2026 because of a “growing oil glut”, said Marex analyst Ed Meir.
Meanwhile, Gulf equity indexes mostly ended lower on Tuesday as tension flared between regional oil powers and neighbours Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Dubai’s main share index retreated 2pc, LSEG data showed, while Abu Dhabi’s main index and Saudi Arabia both dropped 1pc each.
The Dubai index saw its biggest daily decline since June. Blue-chip developer Emaar Properties fell 2.8pc and Sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank lost 2.3pc.
Among Saudi shares, Saudi Arabian Mining Co slipped 2.6pc and Al Rajhi Bank eased 0.3pc. Oil giant Saudi Aramco was down 0.3pc.
‘A red line’
Saudi Arabia and the UAE - traditionally close allies who joined forces against the Houthis - have increasingly been at odds over the conflict as well as the war in Sudan.
“The Kingdom expresses its disappointment by the actions taken by the brotherly United Arab Emirates, pressuring the Southern Transitional Council’s forces to conduct military operations on the southern border of the Kingdom,” the Saudi foreign ministry statement said.







It called them “a threat to the Kingdom’s national security, as well as to security and stability in the Republic of Yemen and the region,” it said.
Abu Dhabi denied that it was behind the separatist offensive, saying it “condemns the claims made regarding the exertion of pressure or direction on any Yemeni party to carry out military operations that affect the security of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”.
A source close to the Saudi military coalition told AFP on Tuesday after the strikes that a diplomatic solution remained on the table.
“The coalition was forced to do that. All diplomacy efforts met deaf ears,” said the source.
“Diplomacy is still an option to stop any further escalation.”
24-hour deadline
Riyadh also backed a demand from Yemen’s presidential council for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country within 24 hours, and urged Abu Dhabi to cut off military and financial support for Yemeni groups.
Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, issued decrees on Tuesday announcing a 90-day state of emergency and annulling a security pact with the UAE over the separatists’ advance.
The STC members of the council later rejected the decision, saying the move threatened to “drag Yemen into new confrontations”.
Following the strikes, broadcasters in Saudi Arabia aired segments showing surveillance footage of the alleged Emirati ships delivering the combat equipment to the port of Mukalla in southern Yemen.
The Saudi-led coalition said the ships had arrived from the UAE port of Fujairah, adding that the operation was conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law and without causing collateral damage.An official at the port said they had received an evacuation warning.
‘Unacceptable to God’
Abdullah Bazuhair, whose home overlooks the port, showed AFP the damage to his property, with windows blasted clear out of the walls and glass strewn across the floor.
The strikes were “unacceptable to God” he said, adding “the children were terrified and the women frightened”.
The Saudi-led coalition had warned that it would back Yemen’s government in any military confrontation with separatist forces and urged them to withdraw from recently seized territories in Hadramawt and Mahra governorates.
Tuesday’s strike came days after reported Saudi air raids on separatist positions in resource-rich Hadramawt last week.
A Yemeni military official said on Friday that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were massed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory.</p><small>2025-12-30 19:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642332-in-meeting-with-uae-president-pm-stresses-elevating-ties-into-strategic-partnership' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with UAE president, PM stresses elevating ties into strategic partnership</strong></a><br><p>

The projects include the $180.5 million Sindh Coastal Resilience Sector Project (SCRP) and the $124 million Punjab Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Agriculture Mechanisation Project.
Economic Secretary Muhammad Humair Karim “expressed his sincere appreciation for ADB’s role as a trusted development partner and its continued support to Pakistan in advancing climate resilience, sustainable agriculture, and inclusive growth”, the statement read.
Karim highlighted that the SCRP will promote integrated water resource and flood risk management and restore nature-based coastal defences. It is also expected to strengthen the institutional and community capacity for strategic action planning.
“The project, financed through $140.5m from [the] ADB (including [a] $140m loan and [a] $500,000 technical assistance grant), $40m from the Green Climate Fund and $20m as counterpart funding from the Government of Sindh, will directly benefit over 3.8 million people in Thatta, Sujawal and Badin districts,” the statement read.
It added that according to the secretary, the Punjab Climate Resilient and Low Carbon Agriculture Mechanisation Project will enhance agricultural productivity and climate resilience in 30 districts of the province.
“The project amounting to $129m, financed [by a] $120m ADB loan, [a] $4m ADB grant and [a] $5m as counterpart funding from the Government of Punjab, will improve [the] access of small farmers to climate-smart machinery, introduce circular agriculture practices to reduce residue burning, establish testing and training facilities and empower 15,000 women through skills development and livelihood diversification,” the Economic Division stated.
The statement added that the secretary hailed both initiatives as “transformative in nature”, adding that the SCRP would safeguard livelihoods, food security and biodiversity along the province’s coastal belt, while the Punjab mechanisation project would drive sustainable, low-carbon agriculture and inclusive development.
ADB Country Director Emma Fan appreciated the federal government’s strong commitment to these initiatives and emphasised the significance of the SCRP in addressing climate risks and protecting coastal communities, the Economic Division said.
She further highlighted the Punjab mechanisation project as “a critical step in modernising agriculture and reducing emissions”.
Pakistan and the ADB “expressed their commitment to effectively utilise the financing for [the] successful and timely completion of the two initiatives”, the statement added.
On December 25, Pakistan and the lender signed two major initiatives totalling $730m — a power transmission strengthening project and an accelerating state-owned enterprise (SOE) transformation programme — which would relieve overloading of existing transmission lines and improve operational efficiency.
At the beginning of this year, Pakistan and ADB signed an agreement to provide $200 million in support to the country’s ailing power distribution system through network improvement.
In the recent agreement, the second power transmission strengthening project amounts to $330m, while the accelerating SOE transformation programme is worth $400m, according to a statement.
Ministry of Economic Affairs Secretary Muhammad Humair Karim appreciated the Manila-based lending agency’s role and its continued support in advancing critical infrastructure and governance reforms, the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-30 17:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/302037349a82ea5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964127/pm-shehbaz-meets-uae-president-in-rahim-yar-khan-pledges-to-elevate-bilateral-ties' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz meets UAE president in Rahim Yar Khan, pledges to ‘elevate’ bilateral ties</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday reiterated his resolve to “elevate” the country’s longstanding ties with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) into a strategic and mutually beneficial economic partnership as he met President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Rahim Yar Khan, a press release from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) stated.
Al-Nahyan undertook his first official visit to Pakistan last Friday, where “substantive talks” took place, focused on further strengthening the longstanding fraternal relations between the two countries.
According to the PMO’s statement, PM Shehbaz, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and other officials, met the Emirati president at Sheikh Zayed Palace in Rahim Yar Khan.
It added that the two leaders “carried forward discussions” from Al-Nahyan’s December 26 visit.







PM Shehbaz stressed the need for both sides to actively pursue an enhancement in bilateral trade “through a quantum jump which will bring it to the desired level”, the statement added.
The PM and the Emirati president also discussed ways to enhance cooperation in a wide range of sectors, such as IT, energy, minerals and defence cooperation.
“While expressing his great admiration for the UAE’s remarkable progress under His Highness’s (Al-Nahyan) dynamic and visionary leadership, the prime minister thanked the UAE president for his patronage and commitment to foster stronger ties between the two countries,” the statement read.
“He (PM Shehbaz) also appreciated the UAE for hosting 2.1 million Pakistanis, who were playing an important role in strengthening ties between both countries,” it added. “The meeting capped off a year of extensive leadership-level engagements between Pakistan and the UAE.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties, strengthened by historical connections and a large Pakistani expatriate community in the Emirates.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners and a key source of remittances, with thousands of Pakistanis working in various sectors. Both countries collaborate on defence, energy, and investment projects, with the UAE frequently providing financial aid and humanitarian assistance to Pakistan.
In April this year, Pakistan and the UAE signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen bonds between the people of both nations.
Two of the MoUs were for cooperation in the field of culture and the establishment of a joint committee for consular affairs, according to the report.
The third MoU was signed between the Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry for the establishment of the UAE-Pakistan Joint Business Council.</p><small>2025-12-30 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642322-open-manhole-issue-should-not-be-viewed-through-political-lens-karachi-mayor' target='_blank'><strong>'Open manhole' issue should not be viewed through ‘political lens': Karachi mayor</strong></a><br><p>

The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had predicted rain and snowfall in the hilly areas of the country on Sunday.
According to local sources, light to moderate snowfall occurred in high-altitude regions, including Angoor Adda, Shakai, Khamrang, Raghzai, Kaniguram, Badar, Laddha and surrounding hilly localities, while intermittent rainfall was reported in lower areas.
The precipitation transformed the mountainous landscape, with hill ranges blanketed in snow, significantly enhancing the natural beauty of the region.
Residents welcomed the change in weather, describing the snowfall and rain as “positive and refreshing” after a prolonged dry spell.
Many locals were seen enjoying the scenic views, while others expressed optimism about the environmental and economic benefits associated with the winter precipitation.
“The first snowfall and rainfall of the season are highly beneficial from an agricultural perspective,” said local farmers.

They noted that the moisture from rain would improve soil fertility and boost crop productivity in the coming months. Farmers particularly expected a positive impact on wheat cultivation, currently at a critical stage, as well as on orchard crops such as pine nuts, apples, peaches, and plums.
“Rain and snow act as natural irrigation,” said a local farmer in Kaniguram.
“They improve soil moisture, strengthen seed germination, and increase the effectiveness of fertilizers. This will ultimately lead to better yields and improved livelihoods for farmers.”
Officials from the Irrigation Department and the Agriculture Department also termed the precipitation encouraging, especially in light of the steadily declining groundwater levels observed over recent years.
“Underground water reserves in South Waziristan had been decreasing at an alarming rate due to prolonged dry conditions, limited rainfall, and overdependence on tube wells,” said the officials.
“Recent snowfall and rainfall are expected to halt the continuous decline in the groundwater table,” an official from the Irrigation Department said. “As snow melts gradually, it will recharge streams, springs, underground aquifers, and natural water reservoirs, which will help stabilize and eventually raise the water level.”
Agriculture Department officials added that seasonal rainfall is essential not only for staple crops but also for vegetables, orchards, and grazing lands.
“Improved moisture levels are expected to support livestock farming, another major source of income for the region’s rural population.”
However, snowfall in remote and high-altitude areas has also resulted in a noticeable drop in temperatures, intensifying the cold weather.
In some mountainous localities, residents also reported partial disruption to movement due to slippery roads and reduced visibility.
The local administration has advised residents to take precautionary measures, particularly in snow-prone areas, and urged people to avoid unnecessary travel during adverse weather conditions. Authorities have also directed relevant departments to remain alert to address any potential emergencies arising from harsh winter conditions.
A day earlier, the National Disaster Management Authority had issued a weather advisory, asking authorities to ensure all necessary preparations and response measures ahead of an expected cold wave in the country.
Residents expressed hope that continued rainfall and snowfall during the winter season would not only strengthen agricultural productivity but also significantly ease the ongoing water crisis in South Waziristan — a region historically affected by water scarcity and climate variability.</p><small>2025-12-30 15:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/301647078f86924.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964120/soaring-prices-spark-australia-gold-rush-for-new-generation-of-fortune-hunters' target='_blank'><strong>Soaring prices spark Australia gold rush for new generation of fortune hunters</strong></a><br><p>In the hinterlands of Australia’s historic goldfields, Vicki Plumridge jumps for joy when she digs a small golden nugget out of the earth.
The retired retail worker was learning how to use her new metal detector when it started bleeping by the moss-covered ruins of a building. After Plumridge dug the nugget out of the shallow dirt with a plastic trowel, a guide estimated it was around 0.2 of a gram of gold, worth about $40 Australian Dollar ($26.58).
“But to me, it’s worth a million dollars,” said the 63-year-old, who had bought the detector only a few days before. “My heart is singing.”

Plumridge’s story is becoming more common, as hobbyists flock to Australia’s 9,600 sq km “golden triangle” in the heart of Victoria state, known as one of the world’s most prospective regions for gold nuggets.
Prospectors have been spurred on by record gold prices, social media, the success of TV show Aussie Gold Hunters, and a love for the outdoors, according to Reuters interviews with a dozen gold hunters.
Plumridge’s detector, Minelab’s Gold Monster 2000, which she bought for Australian Dollar $2,999, sold out across the country within weeks of its October 20 launch, according to Leanne Kamp, joint owner of Lucky Strike Gold, a prospecting shop in Geelong.

“It’s a great price point, and we have seen a big jump in sales this year, partly because the gold price has got everyone’s interest,” said Kamp, who has led prospecting tours since 2007.
“We get a lot of internationals. Next week we have some Germans coming. Germans love the gold. The Swiss seem to love the gold too. And we have some coming over from the US,” she said.
The chance of finding nuggets on historic sites improves with each iteration of detectors, which is why there is a rush for new models as soon as they are released, she added.
World’s biggest nuggets
Hobbyists have flocked to 19th-century gold rush towns like Ballarat, which laid the foundation for Melbourne’s early wealth and helped make Australia one of the world’s top three gold producers.

The region has yielded the world’s biggest nugget, the Welcome Stranger at 72kg, found in the 1860s, as well as the Hand of Faith, the largest nugget found with a metal detector at 27.2kg in 1980. As recently as February 2023, an amateur prospector unearthed a 4.6kg nugget in the region with a detector, according to the state government.
The lure of large nuggets is one of the draws for Damian Duke, 39, who works in construction. Duke used to go prospecting with his father, who died three years ago. Now he takes his own son, Ethan.

The 11-year-old inherited his grandfather’s detector, and Duke has recently upgraded his machine, he told Reuters.
“Where prices are now, you do have the chance of striking a life-changing piece of gold,“ he said.
Gold has chalked up successive records this year, surging above $4,500 a troy ounce on Friday. Goldman Sachs expects prices to reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, with further gains likely if private investors continue diversifying their portfolios amid geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty.
Global Phenomenon
In Victoria, fossickers must buy a permit from the state government. The permit allows them to fossick using only hand tools and to keep any gold they find.
Demand for the miner’s right permits, which cost Australian Dollar $28.60 each and last for a decade, has hit all-time highs, at almost 16,000 by November, from nearly 11,000 last year, according to figures from Victoria’s Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action, supplied exclusively to Reuters.
In total, there are more than 100,000 active miners’ right permits in Victoria.

A dream of riches may drive people to get out, but they stay out because of the psychological benefits that come from the focus on the hunt, being outside in nature, and connecting with others, prospectors said.
“It’s really good for your mental health, being out here. You take it all in, you can’t think about anything else - I love looking at all the wildflowers,” said Kelly Smith, a 50-year-old from the country town of Koondrook, who was prospecting with her partner on a training session organised by The Gold Centre in Maryborough.
“You’re not guaranteed to find anything. But you’re not going to find anything at all if you don’t look.”
Victoria’s latest gold rush is part of a broader phenomenon, said Ben Harvey, executive general manager of Minelab at Adelaide-headquartered Codan, which is the world’s largest maker of hand-held metal detectors.

Alongside Codan’s communications division, strong detector sales in its home market of Australia, as well as in Africa and the Americas, have helped double the firm’s share price this year.
In Africa, demand may be led by artisanal miners working in cooperatives to improve their standard of living, Harvey said. In Latin America, there is also recreational interest from hobbyists searching for coins and other treasures, he told Reuters in an interview.
Behind the success is a push by Codan’s team of engineers to improve technology to cut down on background noise so detectorists can focus on the gold, he said.
“What a prospector is looking for is, when they go out, they want to find gold, and they want to find more gold than they found last time,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-30 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642295-pa-speaker-proposes-legal-action-over-scuffle-during-kp-cms-arrival' target='_blank'><strong>PA speaker proposes legal action over scuffle during KP CM's arrival</strong></a><br><p>

Relations between Washington and New Delhi have become strained over the course of the year, due to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between the two South Asian rivals.
In a post on X, the US Embassy posted a message reading, “If you break US law, you will be punished with significant criminal penalties. The Trump Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration to the United States and protecting our nation’s borders and our citizens.”







Neither the US State Department nor US missions in Pakistan or other nations, including Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar or China, have issued similar warnings.
Since taking office in January this year, Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration in the US, rolling out policies and enacting mass deportations through 2025.
In February, a US military aircraft carried 104 deported Indians and landed in Amritsar. Although illegal Indian immigrants have been deported home by previous US administrations, it was the first time Washington used a military aircraft for the purpose.
In addition to deportations, Washington has made it harder for immigrants to obtain visas. In September, Trump ordered a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled worker visas.
H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.
India’s foreign ministry said that the Trump administration’s move to increase H1-B visa fees was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy.
Similarly, India’s leading trade body Nasscom said the timeline for implementing the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas for high-tech workers in the United States was a “concern”.
Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump’s administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft.
Around 16,000 of the visa revocations were tied to cases of driving under the influence, while about 12,000 were for assault and another 8,000 for theft.
“These three crimes accounted for almost half of revocations this year,” said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In August, a State Department spokesperson said Washington had revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small number for “support for terrorism”.</p><small>2025-12-30 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/301740189ea799e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964123/karachi-mayor-urges-people-to-avoid-politicisation-after-child-drowns-in-open-manhole' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi mayor urges people to avoid politicisation after child drowns in open manhole</strong></a><br><p>A day after an eight-year-old boy drowned in an uncovered manhole in Karachi’s Mehran town, Mayor Murtaza Wahab urged people not to politicise the issue, saying that the child fell because the manhole cover “had been removed and put on the side”.
According to the Edhi Foundation, the number of people who died after falling into open manholes and drains across the metropolis rose to 27 in the outgoing year of 2025. Eight of them are children, the data says.
The child, identified as Dilbar, was playing outside his residence with other area children when the tragedy occurred, Korangi Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari told Dawn.
Speaking to the media today, Mayor Wahab, in response to a fiery question about the issue of missing manhole covers, particularly the death of a child a day earlier and reports of missing covers on II Chundrigar Road, said: “The reports I have so far received from locals, I am in touch with the child’s family, indicate that it was not that there was no cover at all, but that it had been removed and placed on the side.”
Noting the tone of the question, he remarked, “Now that this question has been recorded, it will go viral, and that, unfortunately, is the real issue”.
He maintained that the issue could not be looked at through a “political lens”.
“The first thing I checked was if the Union Council […] was given the additional Rs100,000 I had announced? Yes, the money was disbursed.“
“The point being that we did whatever was in our capacity, but if someone removed the cover and put it on the side, then it is a problem that can not be seen through a political lens,” Mayor Wahab maintained.
He stressed that it was vital to “look at what the real issue is“.
In reference to PTI‘s Alamgir Khan, who is known for his ‘Fix It’ campaign, the mayor said, “Yesterday, a person from a certain party went to II Chundrigar and said that his team had installed missing covers; however, later they went missing”.
“So did I remove the covers?” he asked.
“It means someone stole them,“ he said, urging people to address the issue “based on merits, rather than politicising it”.
Earlier this month, the body of a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal was recovered on December 1, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.
Following the tragedy, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials.
The incident also prompted the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to increase the budget of 246 union committees (UCs) to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights.</p><small>2025-12-30 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30154605df33cce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964113/a-timeline-of-key-moments-in-saudi-uae-relations' target='_blank'><strong>A timeline of key moments in Saudi-UAE relations</strong></a><br><p>A Saudi airstrike on what it said was a weapons shipment in Yemen on Tuesday marked the most significant escalation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to date. Once the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.
Here is a timeline of how the relationship has evolved:
2011:
As the Arab Spring spreads, the two form a unified front against extremist movements, deploying joint forces to Bahrain to quell an uprising and coordinating support for Egypts 2013 military overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood government.
March, 2015:
They launch a military intervention in Yemen to restore the government ousted by the Houthis rebels. UAE troops lead ground operations, while Saudi air power controls the skies.
June, 2017:
The allies lead a boycott of Qatar, accusing Doha of supporting terrorism, charges it denies. The move cements the alignment between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ).
2019:
The UAE draws down troops in Yemen, shifting strategy but retaining influence through the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), leaving Riyadh to shoulder the war against the Houthis.
September, 2020:
The UAE normalizes ties with Israel under the US-brokered Abraham Accords. Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islam’s two holiest sites, declines to follow suit, insisting on Palestinian statehood first, giving Abu Dhabi a unique diplomatic channel to Washington.
January, 2021:
Saudi Arabia leads the Al-Ula summit to end the Qatar dispute. The UAE signs reluctantly, maintaining a cooler stance toward Doha.
February, 2021:
Riyadh challenges Dubai’s commercial dominance, telling foreign firms to move regional HQs to the kingdom by 2024 or lose state contracts.
July, 2021:
Economic rivalry spikes. Riyadh removes tariff concessions for goods from free zones, undercutting the UAE’s trade model. Simultaneously, a rare dispute erupts at OPEC as the UAE blocks a Saudi-led deal, demanding a higher crude oil production baseline.
April, 2023:
In Sudan’s war, Riyadh hosts ceasefire talks supporting the army, while UN experts accuse the UAE of arming the rival Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which Abu Dhabi denies.
December 8, 2025:
Tensions peak in Yemen as the UAE-backed STC seizes oilfields in Hadramout, crossing a Saudi “red line.”

The left-armer suffered a cartilage injury while fielding during Heat’s last-over victory against Adelaide Strikers at the Gabba on Saturday night.
Following consultations between Brisbane Heat and the Pakistan Cricket Board’s medical staff, it was decided that Shaheen would return home for further treatment ahead of the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup, the club said in a statement on Tuesday.
A PCB spokesperson confirmed to Dawn that Shaheen will return to Pakistan on Wednesday, adding that the seriousness of the injury and the potential recovery timeline will be determined after meetings with the board’s doctors upon his return.
Shaheen expressed disappointment at leaving the tournament prematurely but thanked the franchise and its supporters for their hospitality.
“I have enjoyed myself a lot playing for Brisbane and I am sad that I will not be able to finish the season with the team,” Shaheen said in a statement released by the club.
“The BBL was everything I had heard it would be — lots of good, skilful cricket. I have enjoyed the challenge.”
In a post on X, the pacer reiterated his gratitude to the Heat, stating that he had been called back by the PCB to begin rehabilitation. “Hopefully, I will be back in the fields soon,” he wrote.
Shaheen featured in four matches for Brisbane Heat, claiming two wickets at an average of 76.50.
Brisbane Heat chief executive Terry Svenson praised Shaheen’s professionalism and impact on the squad despite his brief stay.
“Despite his season not finishing the way he would have liked, he has been a thorough professional,” Svenson said. “Our young bowlers have benefitted greatly from his advice and suggestions.”
Acting Heat captain Xavier Bartlett also lauded Shaheen’s contribution, describing his presence as “great value” for the bowling group.
The Heat are now exploring options to replace Shaheen for the remainder of the competition, while the 24-year-old will focus on recovery as Pakistan prepare for the T20 World Cup, set to be held in February-March.
The pacer, however, was not named in the Pakistan squad for the upcoming three-match T20I series against Sri Lanka — which is to be played in the second week of January.
His and Babar Azam’s exclusion from the roster came reportedly due to an arrangement between Cricket Australia and its Pakistan counterpart that required some national players to feature in the entirety of the competition.
The BBL final will be played on January 25.</p><small>2025-12-30 12:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642286-yasmin-rashids-plea-against-nawaz-sharifs-na-130-win-dismissed' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid's plea against Nawaz Sharif's NA-130 win dismissed</strong></a><br><p>

Both nations have a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also signed a landmark mutual defence agreement in September this year, which outlined that an attack on one party would be treated as an attack on both.
In a post on social media, the FO said that Dar expressed satisfaction with the positive trajectory of bilateral relations between Islamabad and Riyadh during the exchange, while Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan “reaffirmed his commitment to further strengthening and enhancing bilateral ties”.
Dar also conveyed season’s greetings and best wishes for the New Year, which were “warmly reciprocated” by Prince Faisal, the FO added.







Earlier today, the Saudi-led coalition struck what it described as foreign military support to southern separatists at Yemen’s Mukalla port.
Last Saturday, Pakistan expressed its full support for Saudi Arabia’s efforts to ensure peace and stability in Yemen.
“Pakistan expresses its full support for the diplomatic efforts being undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for ensuring peace and stability in the Republic of Yemen. We also commend the efforts of the United Arab Emirates in this regard,” a statement from the FO read.
In November, the military leadership of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia vowed to enhance bilateral defence cooperation and reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen ties between the two countries.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional environment and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” the ISPR said. “The military leadership reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the strong brotherly ties and enduring defence partnership between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.”

During his three-day visit to Lahore over the weekend, the KP chief minister had given an address at the Punjab Assembly to opposition MPAs last week. However, the visit was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
Speaking during the session today, Bokhari staged a walkout to show solidarity with journalists from the Punjab Assembly’s press gallery, who she said were “beaten and pushed around” by people accompanying the KP CM.
During yesterday’s assembly session, a statement by opposition member Col. (retd) Shoaib Amir about the press gallery, calling them “sellouts”, also sparked outrage.
“The whole world witnessed the spectacle in the assembly on the arrival of the KP CM,” she said, adding that preparations had been made for the chief minister’s arrival.
However, she claimed that the KP CM “brought unauthorised persons with him, who claimed to be journalists”.
She alleged that they beat up journalists from the press gallery and misbehaved with them.
“The footage is available in the assembly’s records,” she added.
She further said that rather than apologising, the opposition doubled down on their conduct.
“I was accused of planting journalists during the KP CM’s visit,” she said, questioning if it was wrong to ask the KP CM “how he was finding his Lahore visit”.
“I was told that I had paid my employees to pose as journalists,” she said, vowing that she intended to send a defamation notice.
“In solidarity with what happened with Punjab‘s journalists and with the members of the press gallery, I’m staging a walkout,” the minister said.
On Monday, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan had announced that an inquiry conducted into the chaos that marred the arrival of KP CM to the provincial legislature’s building would be sent to the law enforcement agencies.
Same day, chief minister Afridi, in a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, expressed “deep concern” at the treatment meted out to him during his Lahore visit, stating it was marked by “discourtesy and unnecessary hostility”.</p><small>2025-12-30 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30160743fc5d5e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964114/election-tribunal-dismisses-yasmin-rashids-challenge-to-nawazs-na-130-win-in-2024-polls' target='_blank'><strong>Election tribunal dismisses Yasmin Rashid’s challenge to Nawaz’s NA-130 win in 2024 polls</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: An election tribunal dismissed on Tuesday incarcerated PTI leader Yasmin Rashid’s petition that challenged PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s victory from Lahore’s NA-130 in the 2024 general elections.
The tribunal, comprising retired Justice Rana Zahid Mahmood, dismissed Rashid’s plea on technical grounds.
It said in its decision that the petitioner had failed to comply with the requirements under the Election Act, 2017 for filing an election petition.
A written order of the tribunal is yet to be issued.
Rashid had filed the petition challenging Nawaz’s victory notification on April 16, 2024.
The petition argued that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had issued Sharif’s victory notification in violation of the law. Rashid requested in her plea to set aside the victory of the former prime minister and to declare her a returned candidate. She alleged that the ECP manipulated the election results to ensure her defeat.
The ECP had issued the notification of Nawaz’s victory from NA-130 on February 13 last year.
According to the ECP, Nawaz won the general election in the NA-130 constituency with 179,310 votes, while Rashid came second with 104,485 votes.</p><small>2025-12-30 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642258-peshawar-police-issue-performance-report-of-k9-units-sniffer-dogs' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar Police issue performance report of K9 Unit's sniffer dogs</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement released on the social media platform X, the interior ministry said that Kundi called on the interior minister in Islamabad. It added that the two discussed security measures in KP’s border areas and ongoing operations against khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).







According to the statement, the interior minister gave assurances of the government’s full cooperation for peace and security in KP.
“Establishing peace in KP is the top priority,” he was quoted as saying. He said that the federal government was “prepared to provide support in this regard in every possible way”.
“We appreciate the sacrifices made by the people of KP in the war against terrorism,” Naqvi said.
“Fitna al Khawarij and their facilitators are being eliminated through joint efforts,” he added. “No leniency of any kind will be shown toward the khawariji,“ he said.
Meanwhile, Kundi said that the Centre’s cooperation was essential for establishing peace and security in the province.
“Joint and coordinated action is needed to eliminate terrorism,” he said.
On Sunday, Kundi had asked the KP government to support the military operations in the province as the security situation had significantly deteriorated due to militancy.
Speaking at the National Press Club, he said the KP government should support security operations, as “without stability, development projects could not move forward”.
Insecurity has a negative impact on the social and economic conditions of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, adding that “sustained peace was essential for businesses and investment in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa”.
According to statistics released by the Islamabad-based Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS), Pakis­tan’s counterterrorism scenario saw a marked escalation in 2025 — combat-related deaths rising by 73 per cent against the previous one — with violence intensifying and pushing several indicators to their highest levels in over a decade.
The year not only witnessed a steep rise in overall combat-related deaths, but also became the deadliest one for militants since 2015, the most lethal for security forces since 2011, and the worst for civilian casualties since 2015.</p><small>2025-12-30 09:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3013595413ecc70.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964109/pia-to-resume-flights-to-london-from-march-after-6-year-hiatus' target='_blank'><strong>PIA to resume flights to London from March after 6-year hiatus</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced on Tuesday that it was resuming direct flights to London in March 2026 after a six-year hiatus.
In a statement, the PIA spokesperson said the national flag carrier was increasing its flights to the United Kingdom. He said the airline would operate four weekly flights from Islamabad to London from March 29, 2026.
He said that the flights would be operated from Heathrow Airport’s Terminal 4. “The flights are being resumed after a long gap of six years,“ he added.
The spokesperson further said that London was the airline’s “first-ever” international destination and remained one of its most important routes.
He maintained that the national carrier was already operating three weekly flights to Manchester.
In June 2020, the European Union Air Safety Agency had barred PIA from operating in EU countries over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then-aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament, where he termed pilots’ licences “dubious”.
The European agency lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28, 2024. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
In September, PIA received the go-ahead to resume direct flights to the UK after a gap of nearly five years. Subsequently, the airline resumed flights to the UK, with flight operations to Manchester resuming in the first phase.
At the time, the airline had said it planned to extend operations to Birmingham and London as well.</p><small>2025-12-30 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642238-students-of-punjab-private-institutions-to-get-free-laptops-under-govt-scheme' target='_blank'><strong>Students of Punjab private institutions to get free laptops under govt scheme</strong></a><br><p>

An Arif Habib group-led consortium had won the auction for the airline with a bid of Rs135 billion last week after a competitive process, marking the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.



The investment firm‘s chairman spoke about the development on DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’ — televised on Monday night — where he was asked about PIA employees’ concerns, reservations and protests regarding their jobs against the backdrop of the airline’s privatisaion.
In response, Habib said the “number of staff [in the airline] was reasonable”, adding that the privatisation would in fact increase employment on the whole as an expansion was planned and, therefore, more team members would be required.
But, he continued, a major issue would be that of “quality and performance”.
“And we have come to know that most of these people are very competent,“ he said, adding that Pakistanis were generally capable people.
Moreover, Habib said PIA had an “excellent track record” and that at one time, it was the world’s second-best airline. “These are the same people who made it the second-best airline.”
Similarly, he added, PIA had also played “a very important role“ in the establishment of Emirates, Singapore and Malta airlines.
“This means Pakistanis have the skill, and if they are given confidence, a proper platform and support, then I think these people can run PIA well.
“We hope that they will play their role in bringing its (PIA’s) past glory back,” he added.
A day after PIA’s privatisation, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali had also told Reuters during an interview that the buyer must retain all employees for 12 months after the transaction, with contracts unchanged.
Habib was also asked about Fauji Fertiliser Company during the interview.
Fauji Fertliser was initially in the race to acquire PIA shares but it later opted out of the bidding process. After the PIA auction, it joined the consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited.
Confirming the development, Arif Habib had earlier told Dawn that the company had joined his consortium and discussions were under way to finalise the terms and conditions of the partnership.
Speaking about it on ‘Doosra Rukh’, he said Fauji Foundation Company was part of the consortium as a shareholder of PIA.
He also said he had met Chief of Defence Forces and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on two occasions before PIA’s privatisation — first in Karachi and then in Rawalpindi. On both occasions, he said, other businessmen and industrialists were also present, and the Field Marshal had emphasised that local businesses should show interest and invest in the airline.</p><small>2025-12-30 08:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30071624cb42cd7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-dies-at-80-after-prolonged-illness' target='_blank'><strong>Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, dies at 80 after prolonged illness</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.
Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.
“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the Fajr prayer,” the party said in a statement.







“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.
Interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Bangladesh “has lost a great guardian”.
“Through her uncompromising leadership, the nation was repeatedly freed from undemocratic conditions and inspired to regain liberty,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in a statement.
“I pray for the eternal peace and forgiveness of Begum Khaleda Zia’s soul,” ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina said, in a statement on social media by her now banned Awami League party.







Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Hasina last year.
Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.
But in late November, she was rushed to hospital, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.
Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.
She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.

There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.
Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.
Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.
Bangladesh declares three-day state mourning
Bangladesh declared three days of state mourning, with Khaleda’s funeral to be held on Wednesday.
Interim leader Yunus, in a television broadcast to the nation, appealed for calm.
“I humbly appeal to everyone to maintain discipline while observing all forms of mourning, including the funeral prayers. I know you are all deeply emotional at this time,” Yunus said.
“I hope that during this difficult period, you will show utmost patience and support one another in carrying out her last rites, including the funeral.”
Asif Nazrul, who holds the law portfolio in the interim government, said the funeral prayers would be held in front of parliament after midday prayers, and that Zia would then be buried alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman.
‘Committed friend to Pakistan’
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by Khaleda’s passing. “Her lifelong service to Bangladesh and its growth and development leaves a lasting legacy,” he said.
“Begum Zia was a committed friend of Pakistan. My government and the people of Pakistan stand with the people of Bangladesh in this moment of sorrow,” he said.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and the people of Bangladesh during this difficult time,” he said.







President Asif Ali Zardari said Khaleda’s “leadership and services will be remembered with respect”.







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also expressed his condolences at Khaleda’s passing.







Separately, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Zia’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.







‘Battling begums’
Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.
Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”.
She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.
But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”.
Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.
Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.
In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami.
In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier.
Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.
Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption.
In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded.
Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed.
In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.
Detention and freedom
Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.
The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.
Khaleda never regained power.
With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.
Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.
In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.
She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.
Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster.
In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.</p><small>2025-12-30 07:00</small></div><hr>
