According to PMD, the earthquake was recorded 7 kilometres north west of Malir at 9:34am, with a depth of 10km.
In June, the metropolitan city recorded a series of low-intensity tremors — starting from June 1 and ending on June 22  — mostly near Malir. Their intensity ranged from 1.5-magnitude to 3.8-magnitude on the Richter scale.
According to experts, the fault lines passing along the areas of Landhi, Quaidabad, Gadap and Malir had become active after several decades and were releasing accumulated energy in the form of low intensity earthquakes in areas close to them.
Previously, experts have often warned that a powerful seismic hazard can put the lives of thousands at risk and damage critical infrastructure.
The city’s close proximity to several seismic faults, including the Allahbund fault, which runs parallel to Sindh’s coast, and the junction of the Indian, Arabian and Eurasian plates, makes it susceptible to natural seismic activity.</p><small>2025-10-01 06:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/30140905edff38f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1944970/crushing-injustice-the-lawyer-who-took-on-the-mining-giants-and-won' target='_blank'><strong>‘Crushing’ injustice — The lawyer who took on the mining giants and won</strong></a><br><p>A quick Google search for Ghumawan, a quiet village tucked along Thandiani Road in Abbottabad, yields little more than a map pin and a handful of Facebook posts. No Wikipedia entry, no history, no headlines. Yet a Shutterstock result labelled “serene” shows photos with a backdrop of half-eaten mountainsides and a disappearing landscape.
The culprit? Mining.
In this forgotten village, a small storm has been brewing. Not of weather, but of will. A young man named Hashim Jadoon, just shy of 30, had returned home after studying law at the University of London in 2022. He had done his time in Islamabad’s legal circuit, working the grunt roles young lawyers are usually handed, and received his high court licence. “I wanted to do something more,” he said. He left Islamabad, unaware that what he was wishing to pursue was waiting for him at home, in humble Ghumawan.
 
 

The stage
For decades, the residents of Ghumawan valley have lived under the shadow of machines. Stone crushers roar throughout the day and detonate through the night at 180 decibels (comparable to the sound of a rocket launching). They spew dust, fracture homes, poison waterways, choke lungs, and shatter the peace and silence that once defined the village.
The land in question is Shamlat, a community grazing ground designated under the category of ‘Wajib ul Arz’. Though Wajib ul Arz is steeped in history and cultural tradition, Shamlat is also backed by law. As communal land, no one person or group can lay claim to it — certainly not without compensation.
Yet in 1984, the land was quietly leased out, without the community fully grasping what this meant. Over time, a dangerous myth took root: the leaseholder was now considered the “owner.” Few remembered the Shamlat. Fewer dared to challenge the ownership. No one spoke up, no one questioned. Perhaps it was inertia, perhaps a paralysing mix of fear and confusion. Unfortunately in Pakistan, all too often, the thinking goes: why take on a losing battle?
Adnan, a local resident who supported Jadoon and even filed one of the cases under his own name, blames complacency. “People are as much to blame as local governance. They are afraid of being isolated by the community. Afraid they won’t be invited to weddings and funerals. As a small community, some of the mines were even run by relatives.”
The issue ran deeper than law; it was about confronting and breaking a silence that had become suffocating. Jadoon’s journey began with truth-seeking. He called a jirga at the village hujra [a traditional multi-purpose space, exclusively for men], where landowners, villagers, leaseholders, and even the mining operators sat together to discuss the nuisance of the stone crushing operations.
He listened. Then he argued. The law, he reminded them, isn’t just a theoretical concept; it lives in justice, in the air we breathe, and in the future we are mortgaging away. The stone crushers, drunk with power, dared him to challenge them. “This is Pakistan,” they scoffed, “here, the law only lives in books,” and walked out.
Emboldened, Jadoon retorted after them: “If you can’t see how this is wrong, why not sell drugs? Both kill society. One just does it with more noise!”
The challenge was accepted.
The backdrop
According to a pre-feasibility study conducted by Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority (SMEDA) in 2016, demand for stone crushing increased as the construction sector grew at a sizeable rate, providing budding businessmen at the time with investment insight, and promising a return of 29 per cent in three years.
Since then, Pakistan’s construction sector has contributed approximately 2.5pc to the GDP in the fiscal year 2024, employing almost 8pc of the total labour force and stimulating over 40 industries, according to the Board of Investment (BoI). GlobalData has further prophesied that the industry is expected to grow at an average annual growth rate of 4.6pc from 2026 to 2029.
“There was a time there was nothing but the jungle in Dhodial and beyond,” recalls Adnan, “There were wild hares and partridges that frequented our orchards. Google satellite imagery of 1990 can show you the devastation.”
 
 

Stone crushers produce 20mm, 16mm, 13mm, 10mm, or 5mm stone chips to supply the ever-expanding construction industry. The material primarily consists of hard limestone and granite, though no exact geological mapping exists. According to SMEDA, “tens of billions of tonnes” are available across the country. These can be extracted either through powered mining — blasting mountainsides — or through riverbed mining, which involves fishing out large stones from rivers.
Regulatory standards dictate environmental protection measures, such as ensuring stone-crushing units maintain a 500-metre distance from residential areas, avoid blocking traffic, and do not pose safety hazards. These concerns are largely tied to byproducts such as effluent (liquid waste discharged into waterways) and asbestos, a naturally occurring toxic fibre with carcinogenic silicate minerals that is present in dust particles.
Further guidelines recommend the use of coagulation solvents, sedimentation tanks, and measures to prevent effluent from mixing with waterways. They also call for dust containment enclosures and tarpaulins to limit aerosol loading, along with the enforcement of proper safety standards and provision of protective equipment for miners.
However, according to a study conducted by Syed Yawar Ali in 2012 at the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), stone crushing largely makes use of manual labour (usually rural to urban migrants, and unskilled labour). Ali posited that the industry remained largely unorganised and undocumented, giving high leeway to bypass environmental and social welfare regulations.
Conducting interviews and questionnaires with local residents, he uncovered that most stone crushing units in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) were within residential or commercial areas. One in 10 had an official licence, most labourers did not have personnel safety gear and suffered numerous diseases including cancer, asthma and other respiratory issues.
Cancer incidence in the KP region accounted for about 20.2pc of cases in a 1994–2021 study by Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital.
“I have only recently been operated on for kidney stones, and someone else I know just came out of surgery,” says Adnan. Research suggests exposure to heavy metals, such as those found in mining environments, can be a risk factor for developing kidney stones.
 
 

The case
The environmental and health costs were undeniable. The crush plants operated up to 18 hours a day. Aerosol loading was blatantly apparent, waterways were poisoned, and forests were disappearing. Noise pollution was loud enough to cause permanent hearing damage.
A girls’ high school stood right behind a mine; its foundations cracking. Roads were destroyed by 40-tonne trucks, denying locals their ability to work and live comfortably. The illegalities of the law were evident. The case wrote itself.
“They consistently dump in our natural water channels, which not only pollutes our fresh water, but raises the river beds, to flood surrounding fields,” claims Adnan.
In June 2022, Jadoon filed his case before the Environmental Protection Tribunal. The process, predictably, was anything but smooth. Hearings were delayed, and the case before the Tribunal was adjourned indefinitely. A writ petition had to be filed before the high court just to resume the case. Since the court was proving to be a very slow process, the villagers and other local affectees sought the assistance of the district administration. More than 60 affectees petitioned before the deputy commissioner and asked him to seal the crush plants. The district administration took swift action, sealing the plants and halting the sale and transport of their material on March 10, 2023. The first win.
This led to a new round of litigation between the crush plant owners, the district administration, and the people. Jadoon, who was formerly the litigator, became the people’s lawyer.
Stone crushers fight back
The crush plant owners were aggrieved by the court’s order and filed a review petition. This legal battle led to a series of purposeful delays. The crush plant owners preyed on the weakness of the judicial system and filed another writ petition.
One of the petitioners who opposed the sealing order, had filed a case against the AC/DC (assistant and deputy commissioners). In a cruel twist of fate, he suffered a fatal heart attack while walking up the very road his own activities had helped destroy. The incline, carved by heavy trucks and rendered impassable, had left his vehicle behind. He passed before reaching his destination.
The miners, unphased, still opposed the district administration’s sealing order.
Misinterpretation of the law, change of judges, playing victim, blatant violations and misinterpretation of court orders, led to a year-long cat-and-mouse game between the crush plant owners and Jadoon. When they failed in one court room, they would file writ petitions in different names and argue the same case in another court room. The stone crushers walked away with interim relief.
Ultimately, the case found its way to the court of the Chief Justice (CJ) of the Peshawar High Court (PHC). Jadoon had informed the CJ of the various inexplicable delays and the CJ directed the crush plant owners and their counsel to conclude the matter at the next date of hearing. Despite the CJ’s order, the crush plant owners failed to appear on the next date and the review petition was dismissed for being baseless and without merit.
As of March 11 2025, the PHC, Abbottabad Bench, dismissed multiple constitutional petitions filed by various stone crushing plants challenging an Environmental Protection Tribunal. This restrained their operations for lacking the mandatory Environmental Approvals (EAs) under Section 13 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Environmental Protection Act, 2014 (KPEPA).
The crush plant owners once again challenged the stay order of the Tribunal before the PHC. Here things took a sensational turn.
The twist
On May 19 2025, Justice Syed Mudasser Ameer passed a landmark 31 page judgment (Writ Petition (WP) number (no.) 316-A/2025) — the judgment that ultimately destroyed all crush plants.
The verdict declared that Pakistan’s pride — its mountains — were being destroyed at an unprecedented speed, while holding the Environment Protection Department (EPD) and the government for not accounting for the disappearing landscape. The court opined that until and unless the government could strategise to preserve the mountains, no crush plant owner should be granted environmental approval to operate.
In open court, Justice Mudasser stated that crush plant owners need to look to other lines of business. He urged them to look toward global innovations such as building roads out of plastic and recycled products.
As the miners continued to oppose and play various games, a similar case unfurled in Haripur (also represented by Jadoon), which made it to the Supreme Court (SC).
 
 

A parallel ruling
On July 11, 2024, the Supreme Court, led by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, delivered a precedent-setting ruling, directing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue Environmental Protection Orders (EPOs) against more than 900 illegal crush plants operating across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In this landmark victory, Justice Shah — a staunch advocate for environmental justice — championed a bold shift in how courts approach environmental litigation. He called for a proactive, inquisitorial, and sustainability-driven model of judicial intervention.
He asserted that the environment itself, not just the litigants, must stand at the heart of every decision, to be treated as a third party in the courtroom. In his words and actions, he made clear: in every environmental dispute, the ultimate winner must be the planet.
As of July 17, 2025, all mining leases have been suspended. The court held that none of the plants in question possessed a valid Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), rendering their operations illegal from the outset. It further ruled that procedural objections could not legitimise activities explicitly prohibited by law.
The role of EPD
All these developments raise the pertinent question of the purpose of the EPD which previously did little more than draft reports. Why has it lacked the power to shut down illegal or harmful activity without a court order? How could it issue licences without proper environmental assessments? Should the agency’s role and jurisdiction be fundamentally rethought? The case also revealed that the National Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) have not been updated since 2010.
Emphasising the constitutional right to a clean environment (Articles 9 and 9-A), the “precautionary principle,” and prior SC jurisprudence, the SC ruled that environmental protection overrides business rights under Article 18. It affirmed that the EPD has both the authority and the duty to halt unlawful operations in order to prevent irreversible ecological harm. The Court further directed the department to strictly enforce the KPEPA, act against all violators without discrimination, and ensure that no environmentally harmful activity proceeds without lawful approval.
The spark of a movement
Jadoon’s crusade has grown into a movement. His name now echoes in legal circles — not merely as a litigator, but as a defender of the commons. He has taken on cases against illegal hotels in Nathia Gali, unapproved mining in Haripur, environmental degradation in Sooraj Gali, unlawful taxes on small hotel owners, and even property taxes unlawfully collected by the Cantonment Board.
Yet, he laments: “I represent one village, one municipality. What of the others? The law should be the deterrent, not me.”
Undeterred, Jadoon has filed two new writ petitions, arguing that crush plants have long operated illegally, flouting repeated court orders and violating explicit SC directions that no stone crushing may take place without environmental clearance.
Through sheer persistence, he has shed light on systemic blind spots in environmental governance that demand urgent reform.
“The crux of the issue is a lack of awareness. It takes millions to invest in mining, but it takes trillions to repair the damage. Hashim bhai [Jadoon] was truly a one man army, and for that I am eternally grateful,” Adnan reflected.
It all began with one village. One jirga. One young man willing to ask: “If we don’t fight for our land, who will?”

The annual report, released in Washington, reviews efforts by governments worldwide to combat human trafficking, which the State Department defines as modern-day slavery involving forced labour, sexual exploitation, and other forms of coercion.
The report identifies Pakistan as a destination for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour, particularly migrants from Afg­hanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Traffickers also exploit women and girls — and to a lesser extent, boys — from Afghanistan, Iran, and other Asian countries in sex trafficking within Pakistan.
The report notes that individuals who identify as lesbian, gay, or bisexual remain highly vulnerable to exploitation. Since Pakistani law criminalises same-sex conduct, these groups face systemic discrimination and violence, further heightening their risk of being trafficked.
Civil society organisations told US officials that large-scale violence against women and girls, including so-called “honour killings,” leaves women especially susceptible to trafficking networks. The report highlights that refugees and stateless persons are among the most vulnerable. This includes Afghans without proper documentation, sta­teless people of Bengali, Bihari, and Rohingya origin, as well as religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians, Hindu Dalits, and Haz­aras. Many of these groups are trapped in bonded labor schemes.
Afghans — both undocumented migrants and registered refugees — face additional risks due to frequent harassment by authorities and the threat of deportation. Lacking legal protections, many turn to the informal economy for work, where they are easily exploited.
The report also criticises Pakistan for not having a clear definition of “statelessness”. International orga­nisations estimate that hundreds of thousands of stateless people in the country lack access to basic identity documents and essential services, leaving them particularly vulnerable to traffickers.
“Traffickers exploit Rohingya ethnicity stateless persons and Afghans in forced labour in Pak­istan,” the report warns.
The report also keeps India in Tier 2 — countries making efforts but falling short of minimum sta­ndards. India, it says, demonstrated “overall increasing efforts” compared to the previous reporting period. Positive steps included greater funding for specialised courts handling child-related cri­mes (including trafficking), preve­ntion campaigns, and the repatriation of Indian nationals exploited in online scam operations in Sou­th­east Asia.
The Indian government also expanded awareness pro­gr­ams on safe overseas employment and improved victim identification procedures through the Railway Protection Force. Advisories were issued to state governments to curb trafficking and ensure foreign victims were not wrongly punished for immigration violations stemm­ing directly from being trafficked.
New Delhi failed to provide comprehensive national data on investigations, pro­s­ecutions, and convictions of traffickers. Victim services remained insufficient and varied widely from state to state, while courts rarely awarded restitution to victims, leaving many waiting years for compensation.
The absence of an inter-ministerial committee to coordinate anti-trafficking policies further undermined efforts. Moreover, law enforcement often misclassified cases, particularly those involving bonded labour, and corruption among some government officials fueled a perception of impunity for traffickers.

“Additionally, it noted a shutdown of cellular services on election night, which reduced the transparency of the process and impacted the efficiency of receiving results,” a COG press release said.
The report had been the subject of some controversy after media reports suggested the Commonwealth had buried the report after finding the elections to be riddled with problems.
The COG noted areas for improvement and provided recommendations for strengthening the independence of the country’s democratic institutions, the press release said.
It further stated: “The group highlighted, among others, the conditions which appeared to limit fundamental political rights and impacted one party’s ability to fairly contest the election. Additionally, it noted a shutdown of cellular services on election night, which reduced the transparency of the process and impacted the efficiency of receiving results.”
The report concluded that these developments may have “impinged on the credibility, transparency and inclusiveness of the electoral process”.
The 161-page report also mentioned the Forms-45 controversy that has been at the heart of rigging allegations levelled by the PTI during those elections.
 
 

“In several constituencies, the Group reviewed documentation that suggested that Form 45s may have been altered to change the total number of votes received by candidates, and that these altered forms were used to compile the tabulated results on Forms 47, resulting in some candidates being illegally returned as elected,” the COG report read.
It said the COG was informed that, in many cases, the Forms-45 submitted to the Returning Officer (RO) differed from the copies of Forms-45 “received at the polling station by agents of independent candidates and other party agents”.The COG also “reviewed documentation that appeared to show that a significant number of Forms 46 had been altered”.
Providing its assessment of the English-language media coverage, the COG noted that the mainstream media “broadly followed the principles of fair and accurate election reporting”.
“However, some sections of the media covered some candidates and political parties more favourably than they did others, with PTI-affiliated independent candidates receiving less positive coverage in national mainstream media.”
 
 

The report pointed out that state-owned PTV News “lacked balance, with the majority of its coverage concentrated on PML-N and the PPP — especially the former” — while PTI-affiliated independent candidates were not given as much coverage.
Reduction in voter registration gender gap
In its report, the COG also “commended the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) efforts to ensure inclusive elections”.
“It noted the ECP’s expansion of its Gender and Social Inclusion Wing as a worthwhile endeavour, which contributed to a reduction in the voter registration gender gap from 12 per cent in 2013 to 7.7pc in the 2024 election.
“The group further noted the establishment of the ECP’s gender hotline for reporting election-related harassment and intimidation. There was also an improvement in youth voter turnout.”
The press release, citing the report, added that despite challenges, the “potential for improving future polls was encouraging”.
“The potential of Pakistan’s democracy is enormous. Pakistan has a vibrant and diverse media; women and the youth are more engaged than ever; and Pakistan’s CSOs play a critical role in the democratic life of the country, continually pushing for reform and improvement.”
The report proposed reforms to various aspects of the electoral process, including the legal framework and its interpretation, election administration, and laws impacting political rights, women’s participation, pre-election campaigns, and the role of the media,  the press release said.
‘Delayed’ report
According to the letter of transmittal appended to the report, it was submitted by the COG to the Commonwealth Secretary General on Nov 20, 2024. A press statement issued alongside the report did not explain the inordinate delay in its publication.
In September, the PTI had called on the COG to release this report, claiming that it laid bare “systemic rigging, institutional bias, and deliberate targeting of PTI and its founder, Imran Khan”.
However, in a statement issued on Sept 14, the COG said it was aware that a version of its report on the 2024 Pakistan general elections was circulating online, but that they did not comment on leaked documents as a matter of policy.
“The government and the Election Commission of Pakis­tan have already received the report. The full report, as we had communicated earlier, will be released later this month, along with a number of COG reports currently in the publication pipeline,” the COG statement said.
The PTI’s demand came after a recent report by the independent news outlet Drop Site News claimed that the COG had “buried their report” after finding the Feb 8 general elections to be riddled with problems.
Although the group’s report on Pakistan was yet to be officially released back then, media outlets claimed to have obtained leaked copies of the report.</p><small>2025-10-01 05:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626416-earthquake-of-32-magnitude-shakes-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Earthquake of 3.2 magnitude shakes Karachi's Malir</strong></a><br><p>

The Dublin-based out-of-court dispute settlement body, Appeals Centre Europe, was created as part of the Digital Services Act (DSA), the European Union’s landmark content moderation law that has come under fierce US scrutiny.
The DSA demands companies protect EU citizens against illegal content, but also requires platforms to allow users to challenge any content decisions — such as account or post removals — via an out-of-court mechanism.
The centre, however, found that platforms including Meta’s Facebook and Instagram as well as TikTok often dragged their feet, refusing to engage with the body sufficiently — and singled out YouTube as the worst culprit.
When disputes arise, the panel seeks information from the platforms about deleted content or suspended accounts to adjudicate. In cases where no details were provided, it often ruled in the users’ favour.
“In some cases, we’ve succeeded despite platforms, not because of them,” said Thomas Hughes, leading the panel.
For example, the centre said it received no content from YouTube — meaning it was only able to make decisions on 29 of the 343 eligible disputes submitted.
“As such, we are concerned that YouTube’s EU users are being denied meaningful access to out-of-court settlement,” Appeals Centre Europe said.
Covering the period between November 2024 to August 2025, it is the first transparency report since the body’s creation last year.
The panel said dispute-settlement bodies were currently “Europe’s best-kept-secret” — but that it was working for that to change.
The centre said it received nearly 10,000 disputes and has already issued around 1,500 decisions in more than 3,300 cases that were within its scope.
Other platforms under the centre’s scrutiny include Pinterest and Meta-owned Threads.
The DSA is currently in Washington’s crosshairs.
US President Donald Trump’s allies accuse the DSA of being a tool of “foreign censorship”, but the EU rejects such accusations.
There are currently multiple EU probes ongoing under the DSA into platforms including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s X.</p><small>2025-10-01 05:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/010955025483093.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945820/philippines-quake-death-toll-rises-to-69-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>Philippines quake death toll rises to 69 , official says</strong></a><br><p>The death toll from a 6.9-magnitude earthquake that hit the central Philippines has risen to 69, a disaster official said on Wednesday as the government mobilised agencies to search for survivors and restore power and water supplies.
In Bogo city in the north of Cebu province, which was near the epicentre of the shallow quake that struck off the coast just before 10 p.m. on Tuesday, the hospital has been “overwhelmed,” Civil Defence official Raffy Alejandro told reporters.
The death toll of 69 was based on data from the Cebu provincial disaster office and was subject to validation, said Jane Abapo, an information officer at the regional Civil Defence office. Another official said more than 150 people were injured.
President Ferdinand Marcos Jr assured survivors of swift assistance, saying cabinet secretaries were on the ground directing relief operations, as he expressed his condolences to those who lost loved ones.
Cebu, one of the Philippines’ most popular tourist destinations, is home to 3.4 million people. Despite the damage, Mactan-Cebu International Airport, the country’s second busiest gateway, remained operational.
Another hard-hit town, San Remigio was placed under a state of calamity to help the response and relief efforts. Vice Mayor Alfie Reynes appealed for food and water for evacuees, as well as heavy equipment to aid search and rescue workers.
“It is raining heavily and there is no electricity, so we really need help, especially in the northern part because there’s a scarcity of water after supply lines were damaged by the earthquake,” Reynes told DZMM radio.
In the nearby town of Pilar, resident Archel Coraza said most of his family were asleep when their house began to shake violently.
“I woke them up and we all rushed outside into the street,” he told DZMM. Coraza, who lives close to the shoreline, said he saw seawater recede after the tremor.
Local media posted videos of people rushing out of their homes as the ground shook and buildings collapsed, including a church that was more than 100 years old.
Reynes said among the deceased were some people who had been playing basketball in a sports complex in San Remigio when it partially collapsed due to the quake.
Earthquake monitoring agencies put the quake’s depth at around 10 km (6.2 miles) and recorded multiple aftershocks, the strongest having a magnitude of 6. There was no tsunami threat following the quake.
The Philippines lies in the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” where volcanic activity and earthquakes are common. The country had two major earthquakes in January, with no casualties reported. In 2023, a 6.7 magnitude offshore earthquake killed eight people.</p><small>2025-10-01 04:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/0110193783c9b98.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945807/the-philanthropy-gap' target='_blank'><strong>The philanthropy gap</strong></a><br><p>WITH one in four Pakistanis suffering and over Rs250 billion lost annually, the refusal to fund mental health is philanthropy’s costliest neglect.
Despite mental health disorders being among the leading causes of disability worldwide, philanthropy continues to look the other way. While billions are poured into visible projects, the silent epidemic of depression, anxiety and suicide remains neglected. This neglect is not only unjust; it is economically reckless.
Less than one per cent of global charitable donations are directed towards mental health, even though the burden rivals — and often surpasses — that of heart disease, cancer, or diabetes. In Pakistan, where over 50 million people suffer from mental health conditions, this is not a marginal issue. With one in four Pakistanis affected, almost every household has someone struggling with mental health concerns. Yet it remains largely invisible in our daily discourse

The lack of philanthropy in mental health is both myopic and shameful.

The economic burden is staggering. The annual cost of mental illness in Pakistan in 2005-2006 was estimated at Rs250bn, mostly through lost productivity. It is estimated that by 2020, that figure had doubled to nearly Rs617bn. It has only grown since. Each student kept from realising his/her full potential, each employee unable to work effectively, each life lost to suicide is not just a personal tragedy — it is a direct hit to the economy. For a country already struggling with growth and employment, investment in mental health is not a soft choice but a smart one.
It is also important, even urgent, to understand that untreated mental illness magnifies the burden of other diseases. Stress is a strong risk factor for heart disease; depression worsens outcomes in cancer and accelerates diabetes complications; anxiety exacerbates every acute and chronic illness. Families whose resources are already stretched by medical bills see their health costs multiply when mental illness is ignored. Communities lose their stability and societies lose their resilience.
The crisis is also concentrated in the very group we most depend on: the young. With 64 per cent of the population under 30, Pakistan should be reaping the dividends of its youth bulge. Instead, many students and early-career professionals are confronting what has globally been described as a mental health time bomb. Depression, anxiety and substance abuse are disproportionately common among the young, fuelled by unemployment, inflation, climate change and political instability.
Young employees are voicing these concerns. Across industries, Gen Z and millennials are consistently calling for employers to prioritise wellness. They want mental health literacy in workplaces, access to quality helplines, stress management programmes, and healthier environments. For multinationals and local organisations alike, ignoring these demands would be a mistake. Companies that fail to invest in mental health lose their best talent to those that do.
Yet despite these costs, mental health remains at the margins of philanthropy. One of the main reasons remains stigma — many donors are hesitant to associate publicly with a cause still shrouded in discomfort and misunderstanding. In Pakistan, where large-scale giving is dominated by men, many philanthropists shy away from supporting mental health initiatives perhaps because they fear it undermines an image of strength. Donating to a school or a hospital wing reflects power and legacy; funding a mental health literacy programme or a suicide helpline may be viewed as undermining the donor’s image.
Mental health philanthropy also lags behind because its needs are complex, its outcomes harder to measure and the issues themselves often invisible. Unlike a hospital wing or vaccination drive, mental healthcare rarely offers quick, tangible wins or legacy projects. Progress is incremental, long-term and difficult to quantify, making it less appealing to donors seeking visible impact. At the same time, other health and social causes benefit from clearer metrics, stronger advocacy and established global campaigns, while cultural attitudes still frame mental illness as a private or moral issue rather than a public health priority.
The evidence for investment, however, could not be more robust: investing in mental health offers one of the highest returns in global health. The WHO and World Bank estimate that every dollar spent on mental health yields four dollars in improved health and productivity. Beyond this measurable return, the ripple effects are even greater: healthier workforces, better educational outcomes, reduced healthcare costs from untreated physical conditions and fewer burdens on social services and systems. Cru­cially, supporting mental health also has intergenerational benefits, improving child development and breaking cycles of disadvantage.
If we are to disrupt this pattern, mental health giving must be reframed as compelling, urgent and aspirational. That means creating national visibility campaigns with powerful symbols, high-profile events and respected ambassadors so that giving towards mental health feels impactful and worthy.
It also means channelling funds into evidence-based interventions — such as task-shifting programmes that enable front-line health workers to deliver basic care, mental health literacy initiatives that raise awareness and quality suicide helplines that provide immediate support. Businesses, too, must become partners in this effort by investing in wellness programmes not only as a matter of corporate responsibility but as a sound economic strategy that directly boosts productivity and talent retention. And finally, philanthropy must be made collective: pooled funds and endowments can offer visibility, scale and sustainability, reassuring donors that they are contributing to a larger national movement.
Philanthropy has always had the power to change narratives. It did so for education, for healthcare, for poverty alleviation. It can do the same for mental health, but only if donors are willing to overcome stigma and embrace the truth, that investing in minds is urgent and imperative. Each individual who speaks up matters, and each rupee raised helps: it brings hope, momentum and courage to the space.
With one in four Pakistanis suffering from a mental health disorder, this is not a hidden issue. It touches every family, every workplace and every community. Continuing to ignore is not only myopic. It is shameful.

• Four terrorists ‘in FC uniforms’ gunned down while trying to breach security installation
QUETTA: At least 10 people, including four security personnel, were martyred and over 30 others sustained injuries in a suicide car blast near the headquarters of the Frontier Corps, while five terrorists were killed while trying to breach the heavily guarded facility.
Police officials said a suicide bomber driving an explosive-laden van  attempted to enter the well-guarded Hali Road from the Khojak Road area of Modal Town on Tuesday. At the entrance to Hali Road, the vehicle hit spikes and a barrier installed near the picket and exploded.
The blast claimed the lives of six civilians, while four personnel were martyred, they added.
Ten people lost their lives in the blast and 33 were injured, six of them seriously, Minister Health Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Dawn. There were at least two women among the seriously injured, he added.
Shortly after the blast, four alleged terrorists in FC uniforms entered Hali Road attempted to breach the FC headquarters amid heavy firing.
But security personnel foiled the atte­mpt. A gun battle with the terrorists ens­u­ed, who were armed with modern wea­pons and hand grenades, but they were gunned down by security personnel.
“In all, five terrorists have been killed. One in an explosive-laden vehicle and four were eliminated by the FC personnel in the gun battle,” said a senior official of the home department while talking to Dawn.
He disclosed that the attackers were wearing FC uniforms to dodge security.
“No terrorist could reach up to the gates of the FC headquarters,” security officials said.
They said that four AK-47 rifles, three grenade launchers, 15 grenades, hundreds of bullets and other items were recovered from the terrorists.
An eyewitness said that all the attackers were very young. “The FC snipers sitting on a nearby building targeted the attacks from the roof,” he told Dawn, adding that the attackers also lobbed hand grenades at the security men.
Security posts on both sides of Hali Road were destroyed in the huge explosion, and a large portion of a protective concrete wall was also damaged, while windowpanes and doors of nearby buildings, including the PTV Quetta Centre, MPAs’ hostel, bureau offices of private TV channels and newspapers were also shattered.
The security guard of a TV channel also sustained injuries in the blast, witnesses said.
They said the many of the victims were pedestrians and those travelling on the road at the time of the blast.
Following the incident, police and rescue workers rushed to the site and shifted the injured and the bodies to civil hospital, where the health minister had declared a state of emergency.
“Six seriously injured people were shifted to ICU,” hospital sources said, describing the condition of others “mostly stable”.
No one has claimed responsibility of the suicide attack so far.
But interestingly, the president and PM attributed differing identities to the terrorists who carried out the attack in Quetta.
A  statement issued by the President’s Secretariat said President Asif Ali  Zardari “strongly condemned the suicide attack in Quetta carried out by the Fitna-al-Khawarij, the misguided extremists acting on  India’s agenda”.
However, the federal government posted on X that Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif had commended the security forces for killing the “terrorists of Fitna al Hindustan” who carried out the attack.
 






Fitna al Khwarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned  Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Fitna al Hindustan refers to the  allegedly India-backed Baloch separatist groups.
Balochistan Inspector General Mohammad Tahir visited the blast site along with senior police officers and was briefed on the initial evidence, the nature of the blast, the situation at the scene, and the progress of the investigation.
Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the “terrorist attack”. A Balochistan government post on X, formerly Twitter, quoted him as saying that security forces gave a swift and effective response, eliminating four terrorists.
“The terrorists cannot weaken the nation’s resolve through cowardly acts. The sacrifices of the people and security forces will not go in vain. We remain committed to making Balochistan peaceful and secure. I express solidarity with the families of the martyrs, pray for the elevation of their ranks, and for the speedy recovery of the injured,” the CM stated.

According to provisional figures released on Tuesday, the FBR collected Rs2.884tr in the first quarter against a target of Rs3.083tr. However, the collection marked a 13 per cent increase from Rs2.558tr collected during the same period last year. The shortfall was most pronounced in September, when revenue collection reached Rs1.228tr-Rs155bn below the target of Rs1.384tr. Despite this, the September figure represented an 11pc increase from Rs1.105tr collected in September FY25.
The decline in domestic sales tax is attributed to multiple factors, including a slowdown in business activity following widespread flooding and a drop in taxable utility consumption. The shift toward solar energy and ongoing power outages have also impacted tax collected through electricity and gas bills.
In the income tax segment, FBR collected Rs1.363tr in the July-September quarter, missing the Rs1.459tr target by Rs96bn. This was 11pc higher than Rs1.225tr collected in the same quarter last year.

Slower sales tax growth, power outages and solar uptake contributed to shortfall despite year-on-year gains

Sales tax collection stood at Rs1.019tr, falling short of its Rs1.141tr target by Rs122bn, though it registered a 13pc year-on-year increase from Rs905bn. Customs duty rose to Rs312bn, surpassing the Rs295bn target by Rs17bn, up 13pc from Rs276bn last year. Federal Excise Duty (FED) reached Rs190bn, exceeding the Rs188bn target and showing a 26pc increase from Rs151bn last year.
Refunds and rebates issued during the first quarter amounted to Rs157bn, compared to Rs147bn a year ago. The FBR has so far received around 4m income tax returns by the end of September.
In the previous fiscal year (FY25), the FBR missed its revised target by Rs163bn, collecting Rs11.737tr against the target of Rs11.9tr. Nonetheless, the collection showed a 26.2pc rise from Rs9.301tr in FY24.
To meet commitments under the IMF programme, the government introduced revenue measures worth Rs1.05tr in the FY26 budget. These include Rs655bn in new taxes and Rs400bn through stricter enforcement. The overall collection target for FY26 has been set at Rs14.131tr.
The budget aims to broaden the tax base, ensure fair burden-sharing, and enforce compliance. Initiatives include digital taxation, carbon levies, and expanded coverage of e-commerce and digital transactions to align with global standards.
FBR expects an additional Rs200bn in super tax next month, which could partially offset the current shortfall.

The move came just as the initial Sept 30 deadline given by the board was set to expire at midnight.
The move marks a clear departure from the FBR’s previously stated position that no extension would be granted, signalling that the tax authority has yielded to pressure from various quarters and walked back on its firm commitment.
 
 

An official announcement said this decision has been made under Section 214A of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001.
“The extension in the deadline has been granted in response to requests made by various trade bodies, tax bar associations and the general public,” the FBR said.
 






Just a day earlier, the board had urged taxpayers to file their returns before the Sept 30 deadline, reaffirming that the due date for filing would not be extended. An official statement from the FBR had ruled out any extension in the deadline for filing tax returns, dismissing all social media reports suggesting otherwise.
It had also said that some elements had attempted to link an extension to the recent floods in the country, calling such claims “false, baseless, and misleading”. It had also termed reports suggesting that the Integrated Risk Information System (Iris) had slowed as “unfounded”.</p><small>2025-10-01 03:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/30235709b3c2eed.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945671/govt-raises-petrol-diesel-prices-by-rs4' target='_blank'><strong>Govt raises petrol, diesel prices by Rs4</strong></a><br><p>The federal government on Tuesday increased the price of petrol by Rs4.07 per litre and that of high-speed diesel (HSD) by Rs4.04 per litre for the next fortnight.
According to the press release issued by the Finance Division, the petrol price now stands at Rs268.68 per litre from Rs264.61 per litre. Meanwhile, the price of diesel has jumped to Rs276.81 per litre from Rs272.77 per litre.
It added that it decided on these new rates upon the recommendations from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and the relevant ministries.
Widely used in motorcycles, rickshaws, and private vehicles, petrol has a direct impact on the budgets of middle- and lower-income households. HSD fuels heavy transport, agricultural machinery, and trains. Its price is considered highly inflationary, influencing the cost of food and other essential goods.
The government currently imposes no GST on petroleum products, but char­ges significant levies. These include Rs79.50 per litre on diesel and Rs80.52 per litre on petrol and high-octane products, which also cover Rs2.50 per litre under the CSL.
In addition, customs duties of around Rs16-17 per litre apply to both petrol and diesel, regardless of whether the products are imported or locally produced.
Meanwhile, Ogra on Tuesday also notified a decrease in the price of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by Rs.6.70 per kilogramme for the month of October. After the reduction, a 11.8kg cylinder of LPG, which cost Rs2,527.47 in September, will now be sold for Rs2,448.33, down by Rs.79.14 or 3.13 per cent.
In a statement, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Ogra said: “The LPG producer price is linked with Saudi Aramco-CP and US dollar exchange rate. As compared to previous month Saudi Aramco-CP has decreased by 3.78pc. The average dollar exchange rate has slightly increased by 0.23pc.“</p><small>2025-10-01 03:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/68dc6aaf5aef8.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945806/a-farce-called-peace-plan' target='_blank'><strong>A farce called ‘peace plan’</strong></a><br><p>PRESIDENT Donald Trump has finally unveiled his much-touted 20-point plan for a ceasefire in Gaza, which he describes as a landmark deal to end two years of a devastating war.
But in reality, it’s a document of surrender for the Palestinian resistance against a brutal occupation. It has sanctified the genocide, carried out by the Zionist forces, which has killed tens of thousands of people, mostly women and children, and has uprooted the entire population of the occupied land.
In fact, it’s a declaration of victory for a state accused of war crimes. Former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner have played a key role in preparing the so-called peace plan. Kushner was also the driving force behind the Abraham Accords during Trump’s first term as president.
 
 

For his part, Blair, as prime minister, had actively supported the American-led invasion and occupation of Iraq based on false claims of the regime possessing weapons of mass destruction. Many in the Arab world and also in Britain regard him as a war criminal, too.
Unsurprisingly, Israel immediately accepted the latest American plan. Standing, alongside Trump at a press conference, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who has been accused of committing crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court, had nothing but praise for the US leader who said, “Israel would have my full backing to finish the job of destroying the threat of Hamas”. The plan has justifiably been termed as the ‘Trump-Netanyahu plan’ to ensure Israel’s military dominance in the region.

The Gaza peace plan has further emboldened Israel.

Hamas has been given a 72-hour ultimatum to accept the plan, which the group was never consulted on, and release the remaining hostages and return the bodies of the ones who died in its custody. Ironically, the Palestinians, who are the aggrieved party, were not consulted on the so-called peace plan, which is meant to decide their fate. The leaders of major Arab and Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, have already given their approval to the plan which, many analysts contend, would place Gaza under colonial rule.
 
 

There is only a vague mention of the possibility of an independent Palestinian entity in the unforeseeable future. Israel has already rejected the idea of a separate Palestinian state. Though Israel has been stopped from annexing the West Bank, some hard-line Israeli ministers have threatened to do so.
According to the Gaza plan, the war would immediately end after the exchange of prisoners. Israeli forces are only supposed to withdraw to the agreed-upon line to prepare for hostage release. During this time, “all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal”.
Also, “Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries”. This is more or less a call for a complete surrender of the group, which heads the Pales­tinian resistance against the Zionist occupation.
There would be no role for Hamas in the post-war administrative set-up in the occupied territory. Even the Palestinian Authority, which controls the occupied West Bank, has not been assigned any role in the post war set-up. That practically brings to an end the concept of a Palestinian state. Palestinian groups have been kept out of the post war set-up altogether.
However, the complete implementation even of the “staged withdrawal” of the occupying forces remains uncertain given Israel’s bellicosity. In fact, the plan has further emboldened Israel, which is being ruled by extreme right groups that openly advocate for the establishment of a ‘Greater Israel’, with no place for a separate Palestinian state.
According to the American plan, “Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Pale­stinian committee” under the supervision of a new international transitional body, the ‘Board of Peace’, to be headed by Trump and others including Blair. That would practically give America control of the occupied territory for an indefinite period. Some analysts believe the proposal is not very different from Trump’s suggestion in February to put Gaza under US control so that the enclave could be turned into a Riviera.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary ‘International Stabilisation Force’ to be deployed in Gaza. Besides, its main job of maintaining law and order, the ISF will also train and provide support to newly formed Palestinian police forces in Gaza.
The ISF would comprise troops from various Muslim countries. According to some reports, the main bulk of the troops would come from Indonesia and Pakistan, the two largest Muslim-majority nations. It may be the reason for Trump’s adulation of Pakistan’s prime minister and army chief. It is evident that Pakistan was taken into confidence on the plan by Trump.
The Israeli security forces will stay in the enclave till the ISF has taken control, but would still have “a security perimeter presence … until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.
Surely the ceasefire will end the relentless killing and destruction perpetrated by the Israeli forces and allow in much-needed humanitarian aid. But the main question is whether the American plan can establish long-term peace in the region without formally recognising the right of the Palestinian people to an independent state.
Hamas might be disarmed but what about those in Gaza who lost family members to the genocide that has been raging for two years now? The anger of a whole generation of Palestinians, who have only seen death and hunger, will not be contained. The controversial plan will lead to greater discontent and uncertainty. Palestinians have rightly rejected the American plan as a farce.

It is a biased document, protecting Israel and putting all the onus for creating the conditions of peace on the Palestinian factions. The only two positives the plan contains are the prospects of the cessation of war and the resumption of aid to the battered Gaza Strip. These faint hopes, too, are premised on the assumption that Hamas will surrender before Washington and Tel Aviv. Mr Trump on Tuesday gave the Palestinian group between three and four days to consider the proposal.
As per the plan, Hamas has been ordered to surrender its weapons, while it has been decided that the group will have no future role in Gaza. Opinions may be divided on Hamas. However, it should be left to the Palestinian people to decide which groups should or should not participate in their national politics; no outside power has a right to dictate the terms.
Moreover, the ‘Board of Peace’ the plan wants to put in place to manage Gaza after the ceasefire has a distinctly colonial whiff to it, not unlike the Mandate System of the League of Nations.
Luminaries including Mr Trump and former British prime minister Tony Blair will oversee Gaza and guide the Palestinian natives until they are fit to rule themselves.
 
 

The Trumpian plan makes no mention of accountability for Israel, particularly for the genocide it has unleashed upon Gaza. There is no guarantee that in case of future conflict, Tel Aviv will not target Palestinian civilians yet again. In fact, Mr Trump has assured Tel Aviv that should Hamas reject this grand bargain, Israel can “do what you have to do”, which means taking the Gaza genocide to its ‘logical’ conclusion. Additionally, there is no guarantee that Israel will stop building illegal settlements in the West Bank.
Regarding Pakistan’s role, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was part of the group of Muslim nations that discussed the plan with Mr Trump and has offered fulsome praise for it. But there is a need to reflect.
The initial reaction in the country, from parties on the left and right, as well as ordinary citizens, has been overwhelmingly negative.
 
 

People view the document as an instrument of surrender designed to protect Israel and give the Palestinians a raw deal, once again. There was also talk of this country, along with other states, deploying a ‘peacekeeping force’ in Gaza. Before any such endeavour, parliament must be taken on board, and no step should be taken that goes against Pakistan’s principled stand in support of the Palestinian people.

India says the proposed new structure could counteract rival China’s building of a likely record-breaking dam upstream in Tibet by stockpiling water and guarding against releases of weaponised torrents.
But for those at one of the possible sites for what would be India’s largest dam, the project feels like a death sentence.
“We will fight till the end of time,” said Tapir Jamoh, a resident of the thatch-hut village of Riew, raising a bow loaded with a poison-tipped arrow in a gesture of defiance against authorities. “We will not let a dam be built.”
Jamoh’s homelands of the Adi people are in the far-flung northeastern corner of India, divided from Tibet and Myanmar by soaring snowy peaks.

Beijing, which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, says its project will have no ‘negative impact’ downstream

Proposed blueprints show India considering the site in Arunachal Pradesh for a massive storage reservoir, equal to four million Olympic-size swimming pools, behind a 280-metre (918-foot) high dam.
The project comes as China presses ahead with the $167 billion Yaxia project upstream of Riew on the river known in India as the Siang, and in Tibet as the Yarlung Tsangpo.
China’s plan includes five hydropower stations, that could produce three times more electricity than its vast Three Gorges dam — the world’s largest power station —though other details remain scant.
Beijing — which lays claim to Arunachal Pradesh, rejected by India — says it will have no “negative impact” downstream.
“China has never had, and will never have, any intention to use cross-border hydropower projects on rivers to harm the interests of downstream countries or coerce them,” Beijing’s foreign ministry said.
Chinese reports hint at a tunnel-diversion project, while India eyes Riew for its mega-dam. Locals like 69-year-old Jamoh say damming the Siang would erase their culture and identity.
Despite a thaw between New Delhi and Beijing, the two most populous nations have multiple areas of disputed border manned by tens of thousands of troops, and India has made no secret of its concerns.
The river is a tributary of the mighty Brahmaputra, and Indian officials fear China could use its dam as a control tap — to create deadly droughts or release a “water bomb” downstream.
China rejects that, saying that the “hype surrounding the Yaxia Hydropower Project as a ‘water bomb’ is groundless and malicious”.
But Arunachal Pradesh state Chief Minister Pema Khandu said protective action against China’s dam is a “national security necessity”, and sees India’s dam as a safety valve to control the water.
“China’s aggressive water resource development policy leaves little room for downstream riparian nations to ignore it,” said Maharaj K. Pandit, a Himalayan ecology specialist at the National University of Singapore.
India’s dam could generate up to 11,600 MW, becoming its most powerful and cutting reliance on coal.

FRESH breaches have inundated villages to the east of Lodhran, Jalalpur Pirwala and Uch Sharif.—Dawn

• Irrigation dept says water levels receding after four of seven cracks fixed
• Flood survey teams collect data of 27,500 affected people in three days
LAHORE: Flood devastation continues to grip southern Punjab as three breaches at the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the Sutlej River have inundated 28 mouzas across Multan, Bahawalpur and Lodhran districts, displacing thousands and causing extensive damage to infrastructure.
Meanwhile, the flood survey teams collected the data of 27,500 affected people in Punjab in the first three days since the launch.
The Noraja Bhutta embankment, which initially broke at seven locations 20 days ago due to heavy water flow, has left several villages submerged under six to eight feet of floodwater.
These villages include Noraja Bhutta, Bahadurpur, Jhangra, Kotla Chakar, Tarut Basharat, Basti Lang, Basti Kanu, Depalpur, Khairpur Dha, Kandeer, Jhaiyu, Deepal, Daily Rajanpur, Belaywala, Dunyapur, Muradpur, Soiwala and Sabra. The persistent pressure has led to widespread destruction of homes and property.
The breaches have severely impacted the M5 motorway and Gilani Road, with floodwater crossing the motorway and forming a lake between the two routes. Damage has been reported at five to six points along the motorway, prompting authorities to execute a controlled breach at Gilani Road to divert water toward the Chenab River and prevent further deterioration.
As a result, the M5 motorway has remained closed from Uch Sharif interchange to Jalalpur Pirwala for the past 15 days, disrupting traffic between southern and central Punjab, stranding thousands of vehicles and forcing commuters onto hazardous alternate routes.
A district administration official told Dawn on condition of anonymity that floodwater continues to flow from the three breaches, although the water level has begun to recede slightly due to a drop in Sutlej River flow from 80,000 to 20,000 cusecs.
He said that many affected residents remain in relief camps near Lodhran, Ahmadpur and other areas, awaiting the complete closure of the breaches.
He said that the floodwater is currently crossing the M5 motorway through culverts and moving towards the Chenab River.
Multan Irrigation Department Chief Engineer Nawaz Bajwa said that four of the seven cracks at the Noraja Bhutta Flood Bank in Jalalpur Pirwala have been repaired, with work on the remaining three progressing rapidly.
Punjab Minister for Irrig­ation Kazim Ali Pirzada also noted that the restoration of the flood bank is underway and that water levels are gradually receding in the affected areas.
He said that a loss assessment survey is being conducted and that relief packages will be distributed accordingly.
Flood survey
The Punjab government on Sunday kicked off a survey to assess the losses suffered by people in the province due to recent floods but refrained from giving any timeline for completing the exercise or for the start of compensation payments to the more than four million affected residents.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was informed at a meeting on Tuesday that flood survey teams have collected data of 27,500 people. The teams have also completed the survey of 48,071 acres of flood-affected land, besides obtaining data of 8,305 houses destroyed by the flood.
The teams also obtained records of 1,712 livestock killed during the flood. She was also briefed that 1,429 flood survey teams had been mobilised in flood-affected areas in 26 districts of Punjab.
She directed the commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners to support and monitor the survey teams.
The Punjab government said that 2,200 survey teams comprising 10,000 members of the Pakistan Army, revenue, agriculture, and livestock departments, and district administration would carry out the survey.
Full compensation to the affected families — Rs1 million for a destroyed house, Rs500,000 for a partially damaged house, Rs500,000 for loss of livestock, and Rs20,000 per acre (up to 12 acres) for farmers — will be provided based on the survey report, it said.

• Finance ministry says economic activity remains ‘broadly stable’
• Insists economy maintains trajectory of stabilisation, growth
ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday warned that the supply chain disruptions caused by ongoing floods could temporarily increase inflation despite improved fiscal and industrial performance.
“Due to ongoing floods in 2025, the agriculture sector is expected to suffer,” said the Ministry of Finance in its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for September 2025. “Flood-related disruptions may exert pressure on food supply chains, leading to an uptick in prices. As a result, inflation is expected to rise temporarily but remain contained within the 3.5-4.5 per cent range in September 2025,” it added.
 
 

The finance ministry, however, expressed satisfaction that despite these disruptions, economic activity remained broadly stable. “The rebound in large-scale manufacturing, supported by encouraging trends in cement dispatches, automobile production, and allied industries, indicates strengthening industrial momentum in the months ahead,” it said.
The ministry expected the external sector to remain stable, with the current account deficit projected to stay manageable despite higher import demand. Remittances continued to provide strong support while exports showed early signs of recovery. The declining global commodity prices may help ease the import bill, it said.
Overall, the report said the economy maintained its trajectory of stabilisation and growth during the first two months of the current fiscal year, with moderating inflation, strengthening large-scale manufacturing, and contained fiscal imbalances despite the severe floods since July 2025.
It said the assessment of Kharif crops and livestock damages was currently in progress while the government had declared climate and agriculture emergencies nationwide to tackle escalating climatic challenges and support farmers impacted by the severe floods.
 
 

The report noted that large-scale manufacturing registered a significant year-on-year growth of 9pc in July 2025 and 2.6pc on a month on-month basis. Overall, 16 out of 22 sectors recorded positive growth, including textiles, wearing apparel, coke and petroleum products, non-metallic mineral products and pharmaceuticals.
Inflation measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI) moderated to 3pc in August 2025 and stood at 3.5pc during July-August FY26 as compared to 10.4pc last year.
The Ministry of Finance said the government would further improve fiscal performance in FY26, building on the strengthened fiscal accounts that delivered “an eight-year low fiscal deficit and a 24-year high primary surplus”.
The government also promised effective resource mobilisation and a prudent expenditure management strategy. Yet, it said the net federal revenues increased by only 7.7pc in July, supported by 23.9pc growth in non-tax revenues and 14.8pc in tax revenues.
Non-tax revenues in July were largely attributed to higher receipts from petroleum levy, dividends and defence.
During July-August FY26, FBR’s net collection expanded by 14.1pc while expenditures grew by 28.8pc. “Consequently, the fiscal deficit was contained at 0.2pc of GDP, while the primary surplus improved to Rs228.9 billion (0.2pc of GDP) compared to Rs107.1bn (0.1pc of GDP) last year.”
The current account posted a deficit of $624 million during July-August FY26, increasing from $430 million recorded last year.
Goods exports rose 10.2pc to $5.3bn, while imports increased 8.8pc to $10.4bn, resulting in a trade deficit of $5.1bn compared to $4.8bn. Remittances were up 7pc to $6.4bn, led by inflows from Saudi Arabia (24.6pc share) and UAE (20.6pc).
Net FDI inflows were recorded at $364.3 million, down 22pc. However, private and public portfolio investment recorded net outflows of $74.8 million and $11.8 million, respectively. As of Sept 19, foreign exchange reserves stood at $19.8bn, including $14.4bn with the State Bank, compared to $9.5bn total reserves as of the same period last year.
The finance ministry said that monetary conditions remained stable, and the stock market sustained its bullish momentum, reflecting investor confidence.
Although flood-induced disruptions pose temporary risks to inflation, the overall outlook signals a stable macroeconomic environment, with supportive trends in industry, external inflows and fiscal management expected to underpin sustainable growth going forward, it concluded.

Irrigation Minister Aqi­b­­ullah Khan and Educ­ation Minister Faisal Khan Tarakai, whose removal was reportedly approved by Imran Khan in the meeting with the CM, shared their ide­n­t­ical resignation letters on social media.
“With utmost res­p­ect, I, Faisal Khan Ta­r­­akai, hereby tender my resignation from the office of mi­­n­i­ster for elementary and secondary ed­u­c­a­t­ion, gov­e­rnm­ent of Khyber Pak­h­t­u­nk­h­wa,” Mr Tarakai said.
He said it had been an honour to serve in this capacity, entru­sted to him by Imran Khan and he “remai­ned highly indebted to him for confidence as well as for the opp­o­rtunity to contribute to the transforma­tion and uplift of the education department and system in KP”.
Mr Tarakai said that he performed to the best of his abilities to ensure and implement Imran Khan’s vision of transparency, efficiency and merit during his tenure as the minister. He said he would remain committed to the cause and vision of Imran Khan, while reiterating  his commitment to the PTI as a worker.
Both former ministers were not available for comment when appr­oached by Dawn.
A PTI source told Dawn that there were rumours of the reshuffling of at least five ministers, including the two who stepped down. These rumours had been circulating for quite some time, but the resignation was still unexpected.
“The chief minister had informed both Qaiser and Shahram about the de-notification of their younger siblings; however, both said the ministers would resign ins­tead,” another source said.
Both ministers, hailing from Swabi district, are siblings of two senior party leaders. Aqibullah Khan is Asad Qaiser’s brother, while Faisal Khan Taraki is the younger brother of MNA Shahram Khan Tarakai, who had served as the provincial health minister in the Mahmood Khan government.
Sources told Dawn that Imran Khan green-lig­hted the removal of both ministers. Mr Gandapur had initially bristled at the prospect, saying it would further aggravate his problems. They alleged Mr Tarakai was “ineffective, irresponsive and not fully in control of his department”.
A Tarakai House spokesperson told Dawn that Mr Tarakai resigned because he was “not all­owed to work”. “The truth is that Mr Tarakai is a hard-working person, and when he was not allowed to work, he had no other option (but to step down),” the spokesperson added.
About Aqibullah Khan, sources claimed that his ministry was being run by his brother Asad Qaiser.
Asad Qaiser, however, denied meddling in his brother’s ministry. He said that he had been to his brother’s office only once for a briefing along with other party lawmakers. “This was my only visit to my brother’s office and there is no question of influencing or interfering with his ministry aff­airs,” Mr Qaiser added.
A senior PTI leader alleged that CM Gan­dapur had developed a ‘grudge’ against the ministers for their successful Swabi power show in February this year. The source claimed that the chief minister was unh­appy with the minister for supporting the public meeting arranged by PTI KP President Junaid Akbar Khan.
In a video message, CM Gandapur said he and Imran Khan had discussed reforms in the government almost six mon­ths ago and he had also spoken to Asad Qaiser and Shahram Tarakai about cabinet changes. He said in the Monday meeting, the cabinet reshuffle was discussed again and he later met Mr Faisal and Mr Aqib to inform them about the decision. He said more changes were in the pipeline, terming them a routine affair.

• US president gives Hamas ‘three to four days’ to agree to deal; insiders say group will ‘likely reject’ proposal
ISLAMABAD / WASHI­N­GTON: A day after US President Donald Trump unveiled his ambitious plan to end the war in Ga­za, signs have began to emerge that not everyone is happy with the draft made public by White House.
This was evident from Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar’s presser on Tuesday, where he made it clear in so many words that the US peace plan for Gaza would not be acceptable if the am­e­ndments — jointly pro­posed by eight Muslim co­u­n­tries — were not included.
The “document has been issued by the US”, he said, seemingly distancing Pakistani decision-makers from the plan, even though Trump has previously claimed that both PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir are behind it ‘100pc’.
“This is not our document, which we sent to them. There are some key areas that we want covered… If they are not covered, they will be covered,” he said.
Consider Trump’s anno­u­ncement of the 20-point plan as “an announcement from their side”, he said.
Mr Dar, who is also the deputy prime minister, added that Pakistan owned the joint statement given on behalf of eight Muslim countries. “If there is a difference, we will go by this,” he said.
In response to a question, the foreign minister said the plan put forward by Trump envisions an independent technocrat government of Pales­tinians, to be overseen by an international body — mostly comprised of Palestinians.
He was also guarded about the possibility of sending troops to become part of the International Stabilisation Force (ISF).
“On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies… there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan’s leadership will also be making a decision on this,” he said.
Mr Dar maintained that this would be a special force for Gaza alone, and the arrangement for its deployment would be documented at the UN Security Council.
Road to deal
During the presser, Mr Dar expounded on the diplomatic process that led to the finalisation of the pea­ce plan, saying that one of the main purposes of attending the UN General Assembly was to work with some “like-minded countries” on trying to end the misery in Gaza as a “member of the Muslim ummah”.
Eight countries, including Pakistan, agreed to take up this matter very proactively with President Trump during the US visit, he said.
Dar said a preparatory meeting was held before the Muslim leaders’ huddle with Trump.
The meeting with Trump was meant to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid to the strip without any hurdles, stop the forced displacement of Pales­tinians and make arrangements for the return of those displaced from the Gaza, plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and stop Israel’s attempts to annex the West Bank, he said.
“These objectives were conveyed to him (Trump), and he was asked to work with us on achieving them,” Dar said, adding that the US president then proposed that his team would devise a “workable solution” with the foreign ministers of the eight Muslim countries that participated in the meeting.
He said it was decided that the details of meetings held in this regard would be “secret” and “classified”.
After sharing further details of how the proposal for ending the Isr­aeli onslaught in Gaza was finalised, Dar said he had received messages from the Saudi foreign minister.
“He told me that five countries had reached a consensus on joint statem­ent [regarding the Gaza plan] and that our agreement was needed on this matter as well, and that they had also reached out to Indonesia and the UAE.
“I then consulted the foreign secretary and proposed some changes. I spoke to the Saudi foreign minister again … as I had some objections … He then send me a revised version … and the joint statement was released.”
When asked to assure that “you still believe in the two-state solution”, he said there was no change in Pakistan’s policy on Palestine. “And I rather would say the seven other countries are also with us on this.”
The repeated reference to the Mus­lim bloc’s joint statement is being seen as a ‘mild protestation’ over cha­nges to the terms of the deal, which were ostensibly carried out at Israeli PM Benjamin Netan­yahu’s request.
Changes to the draft
According to US news outlet Axios, the deal now before Hamas is significantly different than the one the US and a group of Arab and Muslim countries had previously agreed on, due to Netanyahu’s intervention.
The main stumbling block, it seems, were the last-minute edits secured by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu when he held a six-hour meeting with White House envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner.
These included the conditions and timetable for Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, and the proposal ties Israel’s withdrawal to the progress of disarming Hamas, and gives Israel a veto over the process.
Even if all conditions are met and three phases of withdrawal are completed, Axios reported that Israeli forces would still remain within a security perimeter “until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.
Although there was no push-back publicly, officials from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and Turkiye were furious over the changes behind the scenes, Axios reported.
According to the report, the Qat­a­ris even tried to convince the Trump administration not to release the det­ailed plan on Monday due to those objections. The White House relea­s­­ed it anyway, and pushed the Arab and Muslim countries to support the plan. The eight Muslim countries then issued a joint statement welcoming Trump’s announcement, but without expressing full support for it. The Qataris told the other countries that after the generally positive statement, they would have further discussions with the US over the details, sources told Axios.
Quoting a senior Arab official involved in the negotiations, the Axios report said that while Netanyahu had managed to change the text, it still has a lot of very positive elements for the Palestinians.
Deadline for Hamas
After Qatar and Egypt shared the 20-point plan with Hamas on Monday, President Trump gave the group “three to four days” to accept the proposal, or meet “a very sad end”.
Speaking to reporters in Washington, Trump said Israeli and Arab leaders had already endorsed the plan and that “were just waiting for Hamas” to make its decision.
“Hamas is either going to be doing it or not, and if it’s not, it’s going to be a very sad end,” Trump said as he left the White House. Asked whether there was scope for further talks on the proposal, he replied: “Not much.”
A source close to Hamas told Reu­t­ers the plan was “completely biased to Israel” and imposed “impossible conditions” that aimed to eliminate the group.
Qatar’s foreign ministry has said Hamas is studying the White House proposal “responsibly”.
However, a senior Hamas figure told the BBC that the group is likely to reject Donald Trump’s peace plan for Gaza, saying it “serves Israel’s interests” and “ignores those of the Palestinian people”.
The source said the group is unlikely to agree to disarming and handing over their weapons.

In a video statement, Gandapur said: “Imran Khan is my leader, I am loyal to him. It is my right to convey the truth to him … I made him aware of all that has been happening [during my meeting with him yesterday].”
He said that initially he was not being given the permission to meet Imran in jail and his messages were conveyed to the public only through his sisters.
“So there is a big divide in the party now,” he continued.
Gandapur said his provincial government had presented KP’s budget as otherwise the PTI government would have been “disqualified”. And since there were no instructions from Imran to the effect of not presenting the budget, it was presented, he added.
 
 

“But after that, campaigns that were launched declaring me and parliament traitors were highly inappropriate. And we repeatedly asked [Imran’s] sisters to bring some clarity on it but to no avail. So an impression was created that we were going against you (Imran). But it was not the case.
“And when the time came to pass the budget, the situation was same. They were not allowing us to meet (Imran). Mirza Saif was eventually able to meet him after great difficulty in which Khan sahib was informed of the situation …  We eventually passed the budget after making it clear to Khan sahib that he could make any changes he wanted.”
Gandapur also claimed that he had told Imran that he had the authority to stop them from passing the budget and they would comply.
“But my MPAs and party members were accused that we committed treachery passing this budget … They are running these campaigns.”
He said he had also been accused of applying the “minus Imran Khan” formula. “But I [told Imran] that nobody could think or have the courage to do so.”
The KP CM added that he had conveyed to the party founder that “Aleema Khan had a big role in dividing the party. Because some party members are being discredited. And the party is losing hope. That steps were not being taken for your release. Instead there is groupism in party which some people are using to serve their own interests”.
He further alleged that Aleema was in contact with “vloggers” working to create divide in the party. “And instead of stopping them … she is provoking them. And Hafeezullah Niazi sahib refers to Aleema Khan as the prime minister in his articles. He writes that she should become the party chairperson,” he alleged.
He alleged that campaigns were being carried out to declare Aleema the chairperson of the party. Gandapur said he told Imran that the party was being harmed by these campaigns and agendas.
“If you (Imran) want to elect a chairperson then go ahead … whoever you nominate will be acceptable but do it,” he said, referring to his conversation with Imran.
Gandapur said that petty issues were being created within the party and no work was being done on getting Imran out of jail. He alleged that instead of standing united, “our trajectory is such that complies with the objectives of the institutions and establishment, and Aleema is playing a direct role in this”.
“I clearly told him that institutions are working to weaken us … I told him that the MI was facilitating Aleema Khan in this process, according to my knowledge … It is supporting Aleema Khan in weakening us.”
Gandapur’s statement came after Aleema spoke to the media outside the Adiala Jail, where Imran is incarcerated, earlier in the day.
During the interaction, Aleema was asked about Gandapur’s meeting with Imran. To that, she said the KP CM had alleged during the meeting that she was working with the MI, was behind “all” the attacks directed towards Gandapur on social media and that she wanted to become the PTI chairperson.
According to Aleema Imran shared with us. “He was laughing while telling us.”
“Remember that Imran Khan is PTI’s chairman. Only he is the chairman and no one else,” she asserted. “We will do everything for Imran Khan, we will tolerate everything for him. But we will not leave him [alone] no matter what they do.”
She maintained that Imran conveyed his messages to the outside world through his family only when a party member was not available. “He also specifies what has to be told publicly and what privately.”</p><small>2025-09-30 20:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626377-gandapur-warns-imran-of-factions-projecting-aleema-khan-as-party-chairperson' target='_blank'><strong>Gandapur warns Imran of factions 'projecting Aleema Khan as party chairperson'</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement issued by the JUI-F media cell, addressing a press conference in Lahore today, Fazl said: “Today is the day of Trump and (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu.”
A day earlier, Trump, alongside Netanyahu, unveiled a 20-point plan for Gaza, seeking to broker a ceasefire, a hostage exchange, demilitarisation, and a transitional governance structure.
The two leaders have warned that Israel would “finish the job” against Hamas if the Palestinian group rejects the deal.
Key Muslim nations have thrown their weight behind the plan while Washington’s European allies have urged Hamas to accept it.
Trump said that “Hamas and other terror organisations will play no role in the governance of Gaza, at all”.
The JUI-F chief noted that Hamas is an elected party of the people. “So ignoring Hamas means that you are trying to force a decision on them.”
He said that at present, the US has made Hamas indifferent in all its talks and narratives, “while the real side is Hamas”.
“The Palestinian issue can never be resolved without recognising Hamas as the real party,” he added.
“It’s surprising that the US is brazenly backing this criminal (Netanyahu),” he said.
Fazl declared that no decision can be forced on the Palestinian people until they decide for themselves.
“Israel does not recognise the existence of Palestine and Palestine does not recognise the existence of Israel.”
He added that in such a situation, the two-state solution may be anyone’s suggestion or wish, but no one has the right to force their wish on Palestine.
During his press conference, Trump had said: “The prime minister and the field marshal of Pakistan … they were with us right from the beginning. In fact, they just put out a statement that they fully believe in this pact,” Trump said, referring to a statement issued on Monday by PM Shehbaz Sharif. “They back this 100 per cent,” he said.
Earlier, in a post on X, PM Shehbaz Sharif welcomed the US president’s “20-point” plan to bring the Israeli invasion of Gaza to an end.
 






The JUI-F chief took a dig at PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir.
“They (PM and COAS) should look at their previous and recent statements themselves to see how much they contradict.”
PTI expresses reservations over plan
The PTI has also expressed its “deep concern” over Trump’s peace plan for Gaza as it “seeks to determine the future of Palestine without ensuring the free will and consent of the Palestinian people”.
A statement shared by PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram on X read: “The recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and the acceptance of the occupied Syrian Golan Heights as Israeli territory are in clear violation of international law and UN resolutions, and they undermine global efforts for a just and lasting peace.”
 






It added that former prime minister Imran Khan has “consistently reaffirmed Pakistan’s principled position that peace in the Middle East can only be achieved through a fair two-state solution, one that fully reflects the aspirations of the Palestinian people themselves”.</p><small>2025-09-30 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/30172848ec269d8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945658/this-is-not-our-document-dar-on-us-president-donald-trumps-20-point-plan-for-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>This is not our document: Dar on US President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan for Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar asserted on Tuesday that US President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan on Gaza was “not our document”.
The “document has been issued by the US”, he said during a press conference in Islamabad, seemingly distancing the Pakistan’s decision-makers from the plan.
“This is not our document, which we sent to them. There are some key areas that we want covered … If they are not covered, they will be covered” he said, adding that the immediate objectives of the plan were to ensure a ceasefire, “stop the blood, let the humanitarian aid flow and end forced displacement”.
 


Consider Trump’s announcement of the 20-point plan as “an announcement from their side”, he added.
“We have issued a joint statement on behalf of eight countries [that held a meeting with Trump in New York last week]. We own this. If there is any difference anywhere, we would go by — we are committed to this (joint statement).” he emphasised.
Later, speaking on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’, he reiterated that the plan’s draft released by the White House did “not include all of our proposals”.
The Muslim leaders’ meeting with Trump was held on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session, where the US president discussed his plan for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza. The moot included leaders from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Turkiye and Indonesia.
Later, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had expressed optimism about the meeting’s outcomes and welcomed Trump’s plan as the US president met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House yesterday. In a joint press conference following that, Trump had announced Netanyahu’s agreement to the 20-point plan and particularly thanked PM Shehbaz and army chief Asim Munir for their support.
‘Yet to decide on sending troops’
Earlier in the press conference, Dar outlined PM Shehbaz’s and his own engagements on the sidelines of the UNGA session.
He said the visit of Pakistan’s delegation to the US had two main purposes —  one pertaining to activities at the UNGA and the other to work with some “like-minded countries” on trying to end the misery in Gaza as a “member of the Muslim ummah”.
“The prime minister was very clear [about it]. We had had consultations before leaving [for the US] as well. And eight countries, including Pakistan, agreed to take up this matter very proactively with President Trump during the US visit,” he said.
Dar said a preparatory meeting was held before Muslim leaders’ moot with Trump.
He added that the meeting with Trump was held with the objectives to try for a ceasefire in Gaza, make arrangements for sending humanitarian aid to the strip without any hurdles, stop the forced displacement of Palestinians and make arrangements for the return of those displaced from the Gaza, plan for Gaza’s reconstruction and stop Israel’s attempts to annex the West Bank.
“When these objectives were conveyed to him (Trump) and he was asked to work with us on achieving them,” Dar said, adding that the US president then proposed that his team would devise a “workable solution” with the foreign ministers of the eight Muslim countries that participated in the meeting.
He said it was decided that the details of meetings held in this regard would be “secret” and “classified”.
After sharing further details of how the proposal for ending the Israeli onslaught in Gaza was finalised, Dar said he had received messages from the Saudi foreign minister yesterday.
“He told me that five countries had reached a consensus on joint statement [regarding the Gaza plan] and that our agreement was needed on this matter as well, and that they had also reached out to Indonesia and the UAE.
“I then consulted the foreign secretary and proposed some changes. I spoke to the Saudi foreign minister again … as I had some objections … He then send me a revised version … and the joint statement was released.”
Dar highlighted that the Palestinian Authority had also welcomed the statement.
 
 

“On the one hand, the Palestinian Authority is welcoming this and on the other, [some over here] are criticising it,” he continued, apparently referring to strong reactions from some quarters to Trump’s peace plan.
Asked whether Pakistan would be deploying any troops in Gaza under the 20-point plan, he replied: “The idea is to have an independent Palestinian government of technocrats there. Then there will be an international oversight body, which, too, will mostly comprise Palestinians. Or, as you know, Tony Blair has been making efforts in this regard. He hasn’t been successful till now, but he might get an opportunity now.
 
 

“The force [here] is [a] peace-keeping force. On the ground, there will be Palestinian law-enforcement agencies … there will be [separate] forces supporting them. Indonesia has offered 20,000 troops for that. I am sure Pakistan’s leadership will also be making a decision on this.
“And we have asked them to document the arrangement, whatever it is, at the [UN] Security Council … This will be a special force only for Gaza.”
When asked to assure that “you still believe in the two-state solution”, he said Pakistan’s policy was clear and unchanged on Gaza. “And I rather would say the seven other countries are also with us on this.”
To another question, he asserted that there would be no compromise on stopping the annexation of the West Bank.
To query about whether Israel would “own” the Trump plan, he said the sole reason the US had been involved in the matter was to ensure this.
He was later asked about Hamas’ agreement to the proposal as well on Geo News programme ‘Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Saath’. In his reply, Dar said two Arab countries “deeply involved” with Hamas had assured that it was on board regarding the Gaza plan.
Asked which two countries were these and whether they included Qatar, the foreign minister refused to reveal much but did consent that one of them was Qatar.</p><small>2025-09-30 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/30215734aba7e89.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945664/moderate-to-heavy-rainfall-lashes-different-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Moderate to heavy rainfall lashes different parts of Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Moderate to heavy rainfall lashed different parts of Karachi on Tuesday afternoon and late evening with gusty winds.
The areas that experienced downpours include Saddar, Hassan Square, Sharea Faisal, Korangi, Quaidabad, Malir, Shah Latif Town, Landhi, and Gulistan-i-Jauhar.
According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), till 8pm, Airport Old Area had received 33.7 millimetres of rain, followed by Sharea Faisal with 29mm.
 


Meanwhile, Karachi traffic police issued multiple traffic updates.
Separately, a press release issued by the office of Karachi Additional Inspector General Javed Alam Odho said police teams were in the field to assist with ensuring the flow of traffic, guiding the public where water had accumulated and dealing with any untoward situation.
“People are urged to avoid unnecessary travel and stay at a distance from electricity poles and wires,” the press release said.
 


Pakistan International Airlines spokesperson Abdullah Khan told Dawn.com that the flag carrier’s flight PK305 coming to Karachi to Sukkur had been diverted back to the latter.
Earlier, the Met department had said the city might see light to moderate rain / thunderstorm at a few places as weather conditions were expected to be largely cloudy and humid today.
“A well-marked low pressure area lay over Gulf of Cambay and adjoining Gujarat (India). It’s likely to move west northwestwards and emerge over the north Arabian Sea near Saurashtra, India, around October 1.
“Under its influence, wind / thunderstorm / rain of light to moderate intensity is expected in Tharparkar [Mithi, Islamkot, Nagarparkar, Chachro, Dhali, Diplo, Kaloi], Umerkot, Mirpurkhas and Badin districts till Oct 1,“ the forecast said.
Similar weather conditions are expected in Shaheed Benazirabad, Naushahro Feroze, Sanghar, Matiari, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Karachi, Thatta, and Sujawal from Sept 30 till Oct 1, it added.</p><small>2025-09-30 17:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/301839206e93d7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945663/pentagon-chief-slams-fat-generals-says-us-officers-should-resign-if-they-dont-support-his-agenda' target='_blank'><strong>Pentagon chief slams ‘fat generals,’ says US officers should resign if they don’t support his agenda</strong></a><br><p>US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth slammed “fat generals” and diversity initiatives that he said led to decades of decay in the military and told a rare gathering of commanders on Tuesday they should resign if they don’t support his agenda.
“Foolish and reckless political leaders set the wrong compass heading and we lost our way. We became the ‘Woke Department,’” Hegseth said as he kicked off the event in Quantico, Virginia. “But not anymore,” he said.
Addressing a room full of America’s top generals and admirals, summoned from around the world without explanation last week, Hegseth defended his firings of flag officers, which include the top US general, who is Black, and the Navy’s top admiral, who is a woman. He said the officers he relieved were part of a broken culture.
He promised sweeping changes to how discrimination complaints are handled and how accusations of wrongdoing are investigated at the Pentagon, saying the current system has top brass walking on “egg shells.”
“If the words I’m speaking today are making your hearts sink, then you should do the honorable thing and resign,” Hegseth said.
“I know the overwhelming majority of you feel the opposite. These words make your hearts full.”
Hegseth criticised the look of overweight troops, saying: “It’s completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon.”
He said all fitness tests would be set to male benchmarks only and emphasised the importance of grooming standards.
“The era of unprofessional appearance is over. No more beardos,” Hegseth told the audience, which sat in silence.
Trump tells commanders: I have your backs
US President Donald Trump, as he departed for the event, told reporters on Tuesday that he would fire military leaders on the spot if he did not like them.
Trump then opened with a joke as he took the stage for a speech that lasted more than an hour, saying: “If you don’t like what I’m saying, you can leave the room, of course, there goes your rank, there goes your future.” But he then spoke warmly of the military, in sometimes-wandering remarks that touched on issues like the prowess of US nuclear submarines but also included fierce criticism of the media, former President Joe Biden and Venezuela.
He echoed Hegseth when he turned his attention to his opposition to diversity initiatives.
“Merit. Everything’s based on merit. You’re all based on merit. We’re not going to have somebody taking your place for political reasons, because they are politically correct and you’re not,” Trump said.
“I am with you. I support you, and as president, I have your backs 100 per cent,” Trump said.
The auditorium was filled with senior uniformed officials, seated in front of a stage with a large American flag, a lectern and boards that read: “Strength. Service. America.” As Trump spoke, several officers sat looking expressionless, and the room was far quieter than the crowds at Trump’s usual gatherings. A naval officer took notes.
The US military is meant to be apolitical, loyal to the US Constitution and independent of any party or political movement. That creates pressure on the commanders to avoid reacting to overtly political comments, by Trump or Hegseth.
Revamp of Defence priorities
The Pentagon has undergone eight months of blistering changes since Trump took office, including firings, banning books from academy libraries and ordering lethal strikes on suspected drug boats off Venezuela.
“If you try to poison our people, we will blow you out of existence,” Trump told the audience. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order to rename the Department of Defence the “Department of War,” reverting to a title it held until after World War Two when officials sought to emphasise the Pentagon’s role in preventing conflict. The name change will require congressional approval.
The administration has announced a plan to send National Guard deployments to Chicago, the latest US city where Trump aims to deploy US troops despite objections from local authorities.
Trump announced plans to send National Guard troops to Portland, Oregon, over the weekend and sent Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles earlier this year, despite protests from local officials. He acknowledged discomfort among his opponents for deploying the military on US streets, but said America was in the grips of what he described as a war from within waged by illegal immigrants who his administration is seeking to deport.
“America is under invasion from within. We’re under invasion from within, no different than a foreign enemy, but more difficult in many ways, because they don’t wear uniforms,” Trump said.
Trump speaks about COAS Munir
During his address, Trump also mentioned Pakistan army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, saying he was in the US along with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
“He is a very important guy in Pakistan … and I didn’t even realise it, as beautiful as he said it to a group of people who were with it … he said this man (Trump) saved millions of lives.
“I was very honoured, I loved the way he said it” the US president said.
He also maintained that Pakistan downed seven Indian jets during the May escalation between the two countries.
 






Shakeups at Pentagon
Amid speculation over reasons for gathering all the top brass in one place, Vice President JD Vance insisted it was “actually not unusual at all,” and told reporters “it’s odd that you guys have made it into such a big story”.
The Pentagon only said last week that Hegseth “will be addressing his senior military leaders,” and the lack of clarity over what would occur fed speculation that a major announcement.
In May, Hegseth ordered major cuts to the number of general and flag officers in the US military, including at least a 20 per cent reduction in the number of active-duty four-star generals and admirals.
That came after the Pentagon announced in February that it aimed to reduce the number of its civilian employees by at least five per cent.
Since beginning his second term in January, Trump has also purged top officers, including chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff general Charles “CQ” Brown, whom he fired without explanation in February.
Other senior officers dismissed this year include the heads of the Navy and Coast Guard, the leaders of the National Security Agency and the Defence Intelligence Agency, the vice chief of staff of the Air Force, a Navy admiral assigned to Nato, and three top military lawyers.
Hegseth defended the firings on Tuesday, saying: “it’s nearly impossible to change a culture with the same people who helped create — or even benefited from — that culture.”
US forces carried out a nearly two month-long campaign of strikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels earlier this year and also hit three nuclear sites that were a key part of Tehran’s nuclear programme.
And US troops have also been deployed in Los Angeles and Washington — allegedly to combat civil unrest and crime — while similar moves are planned for Portland, Memphis and potentially other cities.</p><small>2025-09-30 16:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626323-ppp-walks-out-of-senate-session-as-cm-maryam-resurrects-canals-project' target='_blank'><strong>PPP-PML-N rift deepens over flood relief after Punjab CM criticism of Sindh</strong></a><br><p>

Speaking to Dawn.com, Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar confirmed the death and injury toll. He said, “Ten people have been killed while 32 were injured in the blast. The injured have been taken to the Civil Hospital and Trauma Centre.”
Separately, he told Reuters that those martyred in the blast also included paramilitary personnel.
 
  @dawn.today At least 10 people, including soldiers, were martyred and 32 were injured on Tuesday after a bomb blast ripped through a busy street near Quetta’s Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters, officials said. “The death toll so far is 10 people who have been martyred, five are critically injured and 26 injured are admitted here at the Civil Hospital. We are also checking with other hospitals whether any injured have been admitted there," Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Reuters. "It was certainly a cowardly act and the target was the headquarters of the Frontier Corps." Several gunmen stormed the headquarters after the bombing, triggering a gun battle with the paramilitary, provincial Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said in televised remarks, adding the suicide bomber was driving a pickup truck and security forces killed four further attackers. Via Reuters.  DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com   

In a Reuters video, where he was speaking to the media, Kakar said the attack “definitely targeted the FC headquarters”.
Meanwhile, Civil Lines Police Station House Officer (SHO) Ameen Jaffar told Dawn.com that “eight bodies were brought to the Civil Hospital after the blast”.
According to the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Special Operations Quetta Muhammad Baloch, the “blast took place when a vehicle turned from Model Town towards Hali Road, close to the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters”.
Television and social media footage captured the moment when the powerful explosion ripped through the street.
 
  @dawn.today At least 10 people were killed and 32 were injured on Tuesday after a bomb blast ripped through a busy street in Quetta, Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar told Dawn.com. “Thirty-two injured have been taken to the Civil Hospital and Trauma Centre,” Kakar said. Following the explosion, the Balochistan Health Department imposed an emergency in hospitals across the capital, according to Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman. “An emergency has been declared at the Quetta Civil Hospital, Balochistan Medical College (BMC) Hospital Quetta, and the Trauma Centre,” a statement from Rehman said. DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com - Dawn.com   

Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the incident, calling it a “terrorist attack”.
“Following the incident, security forces gave a swift and effective response, eliminating four terrorists,” a post from the Balochistan government’s X account quoted him as saying.
“The terrorists cannot weaken the nation’s resolve through cowardly acts. The sacrifices of the people and security forces will not go in vain. We remain committed to making Balochistan peaceful and secure. I express solidarity with the families of the martyrs, pray for the elevation of their ranks, and for the speedy recovery of the injured.”
 






Later, speaking during an event in Quetta, he said that “an operation against the terrorists is underway”.
President Asif Ali Zardari termed the incident a “suicide attack”.
“The president has strongly condemned the suicide attack in Quetta carried out by the Fitna-al-Khawarij, the misguided extremists acting on India’s agenda,” a statement from the President’s Secretariat said.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“The president said that the elements serving the interests of Fitna-al-Khawarij and India cannot undermine Pakistan’s peace and stability. He commended the security forces for their timely and effective response, which foiled the malicious designs of the terrorists.”
According to the statement, the president “prayed for the swift recovery of the injured FC personnel and lauded the courage and resolve of the country’s security forces in defending the motherland”.
Later, an X post by the Pakistan government said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had commended the security forces for killing the “terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan” who carried out the attack.
The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The government statement said the PM also prayed for the quick recovery of the injured citizens and security personnel.
He expressed the resolve to defeat the nefarious designs of elements causing harm to citizens and their properties. “We will mete out exemplary punishment to elements trying to harm the security of the country,” the statement quoted him as saying.
 






Six injured in critical condition, emergency declared in hospitals
Following the explosion, the Balochistan Health Department imposed an emergency in hospitals across the capital, according to Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman.
“An emergency has been declared at the Quetta Civil Hospital, Balochistan Medical College (BMC) Hospital Quetta, and the Trauma Centre,” a statement from Rehman said.
“All consultants, doctors, pharmacists, staff nurses, and paramedical staff have been directed to remain present in the hospitals.”
Speaking to the media later during a visit to the Civil Hospital, Health Minister Kakar said that the condition of six injured people was critical.
“A major terrorist plot was planned. I strongly condemn the blast near FC headquarters,” he said, adding that most of the injured were civilians.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as terrorists, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The banned so-called Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.

The war of words, which began over flood compensation through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), had expanded to water rights on the Indus River a day earlier as the Punjab’s chief minister told the PPP leadership to keep its advice to itself.
At a Faisalabad event on Monday, Maryam defended a controversial canal project on the Indus, rejecting Sindh’s objections and warning the PPP against criticising Punjab’s development — comments that triggered a PPP walkout from the National Assembly today.
Taking the floor of the lower house of Parliament, PPP’s Naveed Qamar said: “Right now, our country is going through a severe flood situation. As we speak, there is a medium-level flood ongoing in my constituency. The onsluaght that came from Punjab has more or less subsided but many rural areas are still submerged. Standing crops were also submerged.”
He added that people were looking toward the country’s leadership during this time, highlighting that a recent report released by the Food and Agric­u­lture Organisation (FAO) stated that the floods would also affect upcoming Rabi cultivation.
“Unfortunately, people have not seen rescue efforts following the floods but have seen a lot of politics,” he lamented.
“When it comes to it, we can also make fiery speeches. We can also make something an inter-provincial issue but we have mercy on the people of whose responsibility rests on ours shoulders.
“We cannot absolve ourselves by saying ’it was because of nature’ and leave people to fend for themselves.”
He continued: “In the past few days, there have been statements — and I accept some were from our side — but the escalation that followed and the level to which things went is in no way appropriate.”
Qamar maintained that when PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited flood-hit areas, the first thing he did was to praise the Punjab government. “He said that in Punjab, the chief minister and the Punjab government did good work in dealing with the flood situation.”
He added that some people from their camp did not like this but then the “escalation” went in another direction.
“In Punjab, a flood of this size has occurred for the first time. But Sindh has suffered this repeatedly […]. We have gone through this experience, and we have learnt from our mistakes,” he said.
“We learnt that instead of sending flour or sacks, give people cash directly so that they can rebuild their lives,” Qamar said.
“We are your allies, we can give you suggestions. The government is yours, you have to make decisions […] but if we give you advice based on our experiences from the past then why do you turn it into criticism? Why make it a Sindh versus Punjab issue?” he asked.
“‘Our water, our money, our will’ — what does that mean? What does that imply? This is our country and it belongs to all of us […]. Consider our suggestions; if you don’t like them, don’t accept them, but the response should not be what it has been,” he said, mentioning Maryam’s words.
He said he was very “saddened” by the remarks made by her a day prior.
“The Indus is the lifeline of Pakistan. If the Indus exists, Pakistan exists; if the Indus does not exist, Pakistan will not exist. It connects the whole country […] it is neither Sindh’s water nor Punjab’s nor any other province’s. It passes through all and benefits everyone,” he added.
“In such a situation, it is becoming very difficult for us to sit on the treasury benches,” he said. “This is not a partnership. We are not getting a fee to sit with you. If you give us respect, we are with you in national interest. We don’t want ministries or anything else,” he said as other members of the House pounded on their desks.
“Think of the people and look at how partnerships work. We cannot take part in House proceedings until things improve. We are walking out,” he said.
Meanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said he was apologetic if the PPP was distressed over the comments made by Maryam and called for a dialogue between the two sides.
The NA session was subsequently adjourned till 11am on Friday.
‘Better for provinces to share issues’
Meanwhile, PPP leader Sherry Rehman, in a video posted on the PPP’s X account, said that this matter should be taken up in both Houses of Parliament.
“Whether it is the floods, the canals issue or regarding water reservoirs, we have never adopted an attitude towards Punjab where anyone could point fingers,” she said.
“We have always spoken within the bounds of decency and acted with responsibility. So it is better that both the provinces share their issues with each other,” she said.
 






She further said that the BISP was globally acknowledged and there was “no comparison”. “It has been recognised at an international level among social protection programmes,” she said, adding that if it was employed effectively then four million people would not currently be in distress.
She questioned how the PPP could be part of such an alliance under the current circumstances and said that the war of words was not the way forward.
“The people are watching all of us and they are looking toward us. Chairman Bilawal has also made it clear that the people should be given effective and complete relief. There is nothing here for anyone to be offended about,” she emphasised, adding that in such an environment it had become difficult to continue supporting the government with consistency.</p><small>2025-09-30 15:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626325-pakistan-yet-to-decide-on-sending-army-to-palestine-as-part-of-peace-troops-fm-dar' target='_blank'><strong>Trump peace plan not inclusive of Pakistan's full proposals: DPM Dar</strong></a><br><p>

According to the report, PCB Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmad Syed issued a notice to the players and their agents, making the announcement.
The notification, seen by ESPNcricinfo, read: “With the approval of chairman PCB, all NOCs for players with respect to participation in leagues and other out of country tournaments are hereby put on hold until further orders.”
According to the publication, the reason behind the move is currently unknown.
“Reports have suggested the PCB aims to tie NOCs to a performance based system, the criteria for which has not been made public. The goal, from the board’s perspective, is for players to incentivise national and domestic performances. However, there is no information on how long such an evaluation will take before the current suspension on NOCs is lifted,” the report said.
According to ESPNcricinfo, seven Pakistani players, including Babar Azam, Muhammad Rizwan, and Shaheen Afridi, are expected to take part in  Australia’s Big Bash League (BBL) which will be held in December.
Additionally, 16 Pakistani players, including Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub and Fakhar Zaman, are in the shortlist to participate in the International League T20 auction which will be held on October 1 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it said.
Meanwhile, Pakistan’s own domestic first-class tournament, the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, will begin on October 6, with 18 regional teams, divided into three groups, vying for a win.
The development comes two days after the Green Shirts lost the Asia Cup 2025 final against arch-rivals India, after also having lost twice to the Indian team in previous matches during the tournament. The tournament had come on the heels of Pakistan winning the T20 International tri-series which included Afghanistan and the UAE.</p><small>2025-09-30 13:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/30171027583d0ab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1945656/pakistan-army-successfully-conducts-training-launch-of-fatah-4-cruise-missile' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army successfully conducts training launch of Fatah-4 cruise missile</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Army on Tuesday successfully conducted a training launch of a newly inducted cruise missile Fatah-4 at a range of 750 kilometres, the military’s media wing said.
“Equipped with advanced avionics and state of the art navigational aids, this weapon system is capable of evading enemy’s missile defence system due to terrain hugging features and engaging targets with high precision,”  the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
 






“As part of Army Rocket Force Command, Fatah-4 will further enhance the reach, lethality and survivability of Pakistan Army’s conventional missile systems,” it added.
According to the ISPR, the launch was witnessed by the chief of general staff, senior officers from Pakistan’s armed forces, scientists and engineers.

Moreover, the president, prime minister, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, and services chiefs have congratulated the participating troops, scientists and engineers on the successful conduct of Fatah-4’s training fire.
“[The] successful test of Fatah-4 missile is a milestone in Pakistan’s defense system,” read a statement issued by President Asif Ali Zardari’s Secretariat.
 






“Indigenously developed modern missile is proof of Pakistan’s scientific self-reliance,” it quoted the president as saying. “Fatah-4 missile will further strengthen Pakistan’s defense capabilities.”
The president further said that the nation is “proud of the hard work and determination of its scientists and engineers”, adding that Pakistan’s defence “is and will remain impregnable”.
Last month, it was reported that Pakis­tan has added a new arm to its military — the Army Rocket Force Command — tasked with building a long-range conventional strike capability to give the army a sharper edge over arch-rival India.

The benchmark KSE-100 index surged to an intraday peak of 166,556.29, marking a gain of 2,708.61 points or 1.65 per cent, while its lowest level of the day was 164,208.33, up 360.65 points or 0.22pc from the previous day’s close.
The index finally closed at 165,493.58 points, recording a gain of 1,645.90 points (1pc).
The continued upward trend in the stock exchange reflects the trade and business community’s increasing confidence in the government’s economic policies, analysts said.
“Strong corporate results and additional liquidity in the market, with a preference for equities, are pushing the market higher,” Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, told Dawn.com.
This was the third consecutive record-setting day, with the benchmark KSE 100 index soaring to an all-time high of 163,847 points, up 1,590 points or 0.98pc on Monday. The rally, which pushed the index closer to the 164,000 mark, was primarily driven by aggressive local mutual fund buying and institutional inflows.
Earlier, the stock market index crossed the 162,000-point threshold for the first time, buoyed by a series of geopolitical and economic developments. These included the signing of a Rs1.275tr financing facility with 18 commercial banks to address the power sector’s circular debt, and a strategic defence agreement with Saudi Arabia that raised hopes of enhanced bilateral trade and financial support.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, said, “The market is firmly in its optimism phase, supported by signs of an economic recovery and a steadily improving geopolitical news flow.
“The rally is being powered by fresh retail participation alongside sustained mutual fund inflows, lifting breadth and turnover. With positioning constructive, all eyes are now on the ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) review, which most participants expect to conclude smoothly — keeping risk appetite intact unless any surprises emerge.”
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, added that investors were “optimistic” about a successful review and potential foreign direct investment, given improved relations with the United States and Saudi Arabia.
As the government ent­ers the crucial stage of neg­otiations with the IMF, market participants remain hopeful that any progress on the review will streng­then investor confidence. However, concerns linger regarding the ongoing review and its impact on Pakistan’s fiscal stability, with some analysts noting that achieving targets set by the IMF remains a challenging task.</p><small>2025-09-30 12:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/626311-pakistan-army-conducts-successful-training-launch-of-fatah-4-cruise-missle' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Army conducts successful training launch of Fatah-4 cruise missle</strong></a><br><p>

Yesterday, the court adjourned the hearing to September 30 (today) and issued notices to all the respondents, as well as the Attorney General of Pakistan  (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan, to appear before the court.
On September 16, the IHC had restrained Justice Jahangiri from exercising his judicial powers as a two-judge bench issued the interim order while hearing a writ petition filed under Article 199 of the Constitution. Justice Jahangiri then challenged the decision in the SC, pleading for the restraining order to be set aside.
The matter centres on a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s controller of examinations, regarding the judge’s law degree.
Resuming the hearing today, the five-member Constitutional Bench — headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Hassan Azhar Rizvi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan — took up Justice Jahangiri’s petition.
AGP Awan appeared before the court and said, “A judge cannot be barred from judicial work through an interim order.“
At this, Justice Aminuddin asked respondent Mian Daud, who had filed the original petition against Justice Jahangiri, for his opinion. In response, Daud said: “I hold the same opinion — a judge cannot be stopped from judicial work.”
He added that “an order barring a judge from their duties can not be defended.”
Noting the AGP’s statement and that of other relevant parties, Justice Aminuddin set aside the IHC order, ruling that a judge can not be stopped from carrying out judicial duties.
The CB, while referring to the SC registrar’s office objections regarding the petition against Justice Jahangiri in the IHC, directed the court to “first decide on the objections in the writ petition.”
During the hearing, the matter of the maintainability of the writ petition came under discussion as Justice Jahangiri’s legal counsel, Munir Malik, addressed the court and said, “according to yesterday’s court order, it was written that the writ is maintainable, but in my opinion, only the SJC can take action against a judge.”
At yesterday’s hearing, the CB had made it clear that it would only examine the Sept 16 restraining order and not the main petition questioning Justice Jahangiri’s degree.
“No one should be under the impression that we have accepted the high court’s jurisdiction to hear the writ petition,” he added, referring to the Malik Asad Ali case.
To this, Justice Aminuddin responded: “We have written in the order only the language that is present in the Malik Asad Ali case.”
In his remarks, Justice Mandokhel said, “We have only maintained that a judge may only be removed by the SJC.”
Justice Mazhar asserted that, “We are not touching on the question of the maintainability of the writ of quo warranto. Whether it merited a hearing in a high court is up to the relevant high court to decide.
“The only question before us is whether a judge can be prevented from working through an interim order,” he said, stressing that the CB at the moment “will not address the question of whether a writ petition can be filed against a judge.”
“Both the Supreme Court and High Court judges are not office holders, Justice Mandokhel observed, but then went on to say that “all of these things can be discussed when the case is heard on merit.”
“We do not want to go on merit in the present case,” he said.
On Monday, the SC suspended the order issued by the IHC barring Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial duties in a case pertaining to his law degree allegedly being fake.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the bench ruled that the “operation of the impugned order is suspended”.
Meanwhile, the Sindh High Court (SHC) is set to hear a petition filed by Justice Jahangiri today, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.
Justice Jahangiri has impugned the decisions of University of Karachi’s Unfair Means Committee (UMC) and Syndicate, which cancelled his degree in August last year.
The IHC judge recently approached the SHC, but at the time of filing, the court’s additional registrar (writ) raised several objections, including questions about the maintainability of the petition and the delay in filing it.
Fake degree controversy
The controversy began with a letter that was circulated on social media last year, purportedly from the KU’s examinations, regarding the validity of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree, leading to the subsequent filing of a reference with the SJC.
The letter was reportedly a response from KU to an application seeking information under the Sindh Transparency Right to Information Act, 2016.
It stated that candidate Tariq Mehmood obtained his LLB degree in 1991 under enrolment number 5968. However, Imtiaz Ahmed enrolled in 1987 under the same enrolment number, while the transcript for LLB Part I was issued under the name Tariq Jahangiri.
Moreover, Tariq Mehmood enrolled for LLB Part I under enrolment number 7124. The letter did not declare the degree bogus but termed it invalid, explaining that the university issues one enrolment number for the entire degree programme, making it impossible for a student to have two enrolment numbers for one programme.
On July 10, 2024, IHC ruled that the “scurrilous campaign” aimed to malign the judge amounted to an attempt to bring the “Court into hatred, ridicule and disrespect and, prima facie, qualifies as contempt of Court.”
As the degree accusations came to light, Daud filed a writ petition, requesting the court to stop Justice Jahangiri from ex­­­ercising judicial powers till the verification of his LLB degree. The then-IHC CJ Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by the lawyer.
At the time, the SC registrar’s office also had raised objections to the petition on grounds that Daud was not an aggrieved per­­son and the matter was alr­eady pending before the SJC.
On September 1, 2024, the syndicate of KU cancelled Justice Jahangiri’s degree and enrollment, on the recommendation of its UFM Committee, varsity officials said.
The decision came a few hours after the detention of academic and syndicate member Riaz Ahmed, who was picked up by police in what appeared to be an attempt to stop him from attending the key meeting. He was released in the evening only after the syndicate decided to cancel the degree.
Then, on Sept 5 2024, the SHC suspended KU’s decision to revoke the law degree of Justice Jahangiri, after a petition against KU’s cancellation was filed. The court found that the university’s syndicate had taken the action in Justice Jahangiri’s absence, depriving him of the opportunity to defend himself.
To this, KU responded that the unfair means committee and the syndicate were of the opinion that there was enough evidence against the judge, and deemed it appropriate not to hear him in person.
On Sept 16, the IHC took up the matter and a two-member bench led by IHC CJ  Dogar and comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, barred Justice Jahangiri from carrying out judicial work until the SJC decision on the matter of his allegedly fake degree, which Justice Jahangiri appealed against in the SC.
Separately, on Sept 25, a two-judge SHC bench dec­lined to entertain the plea of Justice Jahangiri to become a party in proceedings on petitions, challenging the cancellation of his law degree.</p><small>2025-09-30 09:06</small></div><hr>
