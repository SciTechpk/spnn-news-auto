“The UN Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against other states’ territorial integrity or political independence, or interference in matters essentially within the domestic jurisdiction of states,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told an emergency meeting of the 15-member Council on Thursday evening.
The United States convened the Security Council meeting to discuss the situation in Iran, with the country’s Ambassador Mike Waltz criticising the actions taken against Iranian protesters and assuring them of President Donald Trump’s support.







In his remarks, the Pakistani envoy said, “We have been carefully observing developments in Iran and the region in recent days,” pointing out that new threats to regional peace and stability remain a serious cause of concern.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad described Iran as a “brotherly country”, saying that the people of the two nations share deep-rooted historical, friendly, cultural and religious bonds.
A stable and peaceful Iran is in the interests of Pakistan, the region and beyond, he said, adding that his country has full confidence in the wisdom of the Iranian people and leadership, rooted in the country’s culture, history and resilience.
Ambassador Asim Ahmad highlighted that the fundamental principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct, noting that the Charter prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.
Any external interference in the internal affairs of states, he added, is inconsistent with international law and the principles of the UN Charter.
“We strongly believe that all disputes must be resolved through peaceful means and in accordance with international law,” the Pakistani envoy affirmed, warning that continued hostilities, use of force and unilateral actions would only deepen crises and cause unnecessary suffering.







“We sincerely hope that the situation in Iran will soon return to calm and normalcy, free from any internal turmoil or external pressure, and that all relevant parties will return to the negotiating table to find a lasting solution to their differences, based on mutual respect and understanding,” Ambassador Asim Ahmad said in conclusion.
Opening the debate, UN Assistant Secretary-General Martha Pobee, briefing the Security Council members, called for restraint by all parties to prevent further escalation.
Pobee described the situation in Iran as fluid and deeply concerning, noting that protests continue, albeit reportedly at a smaller scale than last week.
She voiced alarm, however, over public statements suggesting possible military strikes on the country.
“This external dimension adds volatility to an already combustible situation. All efforts must be undertaken to prevent any further deterioration,” she said.
Moreover, UN Secretary-General António Guterres remains convinced that all concerns regarding Iran, including those related to the nuclear issue and ongoing protests, are best addressed through diplomacy and dialogue.
He also urged maximum restraint at this sensitive moment and called on all actors to refrain from any actions that could lead to further loss of life or ignite a wider regional escalation.
The protests erupted on December 28 after shopkeepers in the Iranian capital, Tehran, took to the streets to rail against the collapse of the national currency, soaring inflation and worsening living conditions.
Ambassador Waltz, the US envoy, accused the Iranian government of actions against its own citizens that have repercussions for international peace and security.
“President Donald J. Trump and the United States of America stand by the brave people of Iran,” he said. “Regardless of its excuses, the regime is solely responsible for the economic misery of the Iranian people and will be held accountable.”
Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia hit back, saying the world has been watching as the United States continues to escalate tensions and fuel hysteria around Iran.
He said that the current Security Council meeting, requested by the United States, is nothing more than yet another attempt to justify blatant aggression and interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.
“And if, as Washington puts it, Iran’s authorities do not come to their senses, then Washington will solve the Iranian problem in its favourite way: through strikes aimed at overthrowing an undesirable regime in order to lend credibility to and justify its actions,” the Russian envoy said.
China’s Ambassador, Sun Lei, said the United States has openly issued threats of the use of force against Iran.
Stressing that China has always advocated adherence to UN Charter principles and international law, he said sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs are the most fundamental norms of international affairs.
“The use of force can never solve problems,” the Chinese envoy said, noting that military adventurism would push the region towards an abyss.
“No action that defies international law can be tolerated,” he added.
Ambassador Gholamhossein Darzi, Deputy Permanent Representative of Iran, said he was speaking on behalf of a nation in mourning.
“It is deeply regrettable that the representative of the United States, which requested this meeting, has today resorted to lies, distortions of facts and deliberate disinformation to conceal his country’s direct involvement in steering unrest in Iran towards violence,” he said.
He added that the United States requested the meeting in order to conceal its direct complicity in the crimes its mercenaries have committed against Iran.
“The United States is attempting to portray itself as a friend of the Iranian people, while simultaneously laying the groundwork for political destabilisation and military intervention under a so-called humanitarian narrative,” he said.
He described these claims as particularly cynical in light of what he called the United States’ long and well-documented record of unlawful military interventions, regime-change operations and systematic violations of international law and the Charter of the United Nations.</p><small>2026-01-16 06:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/161043503ec89c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967300/netanyahu-urged-trump-not-to-attack-iran-report' target='_blank'><strong>Netanyahu urged Trump not to attack Iran: report</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged United States President Donald Trump to delay any American military strike on Iran, according to a report by The New York Times, a development that highlights growing regional unease over the risk of a wider conflict.
Netanyahu spoke to President Trump on Thursday, the same day the US president publicly suggested that Tehran had eased its internal crackdown and halted executions, citing information from “very important sources on the other side”, remarks that were widely read in Washington as a signal of hesitation about imminent military action, the report said.
The Israeli leader’s intervention comes as several key Arab partners of the US have also pressed the Trump administration to avoid an attack on Iran, warning that such a move could trigger a broader regional war, according to a senior official from a Gulf Arab country cited by the newspaper.
Officials from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Egypt have contacted senior US officials over the past two days to convey concerns that a US strike could destabilise the region, disrupt energy flows and provoke Iranian retaliation beyond US targets, the official told NYT.
At the same time, the four Arab states have been urging Iranian officials to refrain from attacking regional countries should the United States decide to strike Iran, reflecting a coordinated effort to contain escalation on both sides, the Gulf official said.

 

Two diplomats based in the region also confirmed that multiple Arab governments have privately warned Washington against military action, reinforcing a rare convergence between Israeli caution and Arab anxiety over the potential consequences of open conflict with Iran, the report added.
Saudi Arabia has articulated its position publicly in measured terms, with Minister of State Adel al-Jubeir saying in Riyadh that the kingdom believes disagreements should be resolved through dialogue and negotiations rather than military confrontation.
Netanyahu also spoke with Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday, the same day senior Trump administration officials met at the White House to review military options against Iran, underscoring how diplomatic engagement and military planning have been unfolding simultaneously, US officials told the newspaper.
The White House has offered few details about the discussions, with Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirming that President Trump spoke with Netanyahu but declining to elaborate, while the Israeli prime minister’s office did not respond to requests for comment, according to the report.
For the Trump administration, the episode reflects a familiar tension between projecting military resolve and avoiding another open-ended conflict in the Middle East, particularly as US allies in the region signal concern about the fallout of escalation rather than confidence in its outcomes.
The alignment of Israeli and Arab appeals for restraint suggests that, despite deep divisions over Iran’s policies, regional actors see greater danger in a rushed military confrontation than in a temporary pause that keeps diplomatic channels open, the report concluded.</p><small>2026-01-16 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/16100822b675de4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967289/trump-accepts-nobel-medal-from-venezuelan-opposition-leader-machado' target='_blank'><strong>Trump accepts Nobel medal from Venezuelan opposition leader Machado</strong></a><br><p>Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gave her Nobel Peace Prize medal to US President Donald Trump on Thursday during a White House meeting, as she tries to gain some influence over how the president shapes the South American country’s political future.
A White House official confirmed that Trump intends to keep the medal.
In a social media post on Thursday evening, Trump wrote: “Maria presented me with her Nobel Peace Prize for the work I have done. Such a wonderful gesture of mutual respect. Thank you Maria!”







Machado, who described the meeting as “excellent,” said the gift was in recognition of what she called his commitment to the freedom of the Venezuelan people.
Machado’s attempt to sway Trump came after he dismissed the idea of installing her as Venezuela’s leader to replace the deposed Nicolas Maduro. Trump openly campaigned for the prize before Machado was awarded it last month and complained bitterly when he was snubbed.
Though Machado gave Trump the gold medal that honorees receive with the prize, the honour remains hers; the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.







Asked on Wednesday if he wanted Machado to give him the prize, Trump told Reuters: “No, I didn’t say that. She won the Nobel Peace Prize.”
The Republican president long expressed interest in winning the prize and has at times linked it to diplomatic achievements.

 

The lunch meeting, which appeared to last slightly over an hour, marked the first time the two have met in person. Machado then met with more than a dozen senators, both Republican and Democratic, on Capitol Hill, where she has generally found more enthusiastic allies.
While the visit was ongoing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump had been looking forward to meeting Machado, but that he stood by his “realistic” assessment that she did not currently have the support needed to lead the country in the short term.
Machado, who fled Venezuela in a daring seaborne escape in December, is competing for Trump’s ear with members of Venezuela’s government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.







After the US captured Maduro in a snatch-and-grab operation this month, various opposition figures, members of Venezuela’s diaspora and politicians throughout the US and Latin America have expressed hope that Venezuela will begin the process of democratisation.
Hopes of a move to democracy
Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, one of the senators who met with Machado, said the opposition leader had told senators that repression in Venezuela was no different now than under Maduro. Venezuela’s interim President Delcy Rodriguez is a “smooth operator” who was growing more entrenched by the day thanks to Trump’s support, he said.
“I hope elections happen, but I’m sceptical,” said Murphy, of Connecticut.
Trump has said he is focused on securing US access to the country’s oil and economically rebuilding Venezuela.
Trump has on several occasions praised Rodriguez, Maduro’s second-in-command, who became Venezuela’s leader upon his capture. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said, “She’s been very good to deal with.”
Machado was banned from running in Venezuela’s 2024 presidential election by a top court stacked with Maduro allies. Outside observers widely believe Edmundo Gonzalez, an opposition figure backed by Machado, won by a substantial margin, but Maduro claimed victory and retained power.
While the current government has freed dozens of political prisoners in recent days, outside groups and advocates have said the scale of the releases has been exaggerated by Caracas.
In an annual address to lawmakers, Rodriguez called for diplomacy with the US and said that should she need to travel to Washington, she would do so “walking on her feet, not dragged there.”
She also said she would propose reforms to her country’s oil industry aimed at increasing access for foreign investors.</p><small>2026-01-16 05:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/6969aed57280e.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967275/oil-rock-crypto' target='_blank'><strong>Oil, rock, crypto</strong></a><br><p>“The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters” — Antonio Gramsci
THE more things change, the more they stay the same. China may have emerged as a power of global import, but America is still the world’s sheriff, and the Trump ad­­ministration wants everyone to know that.
The dust had barely settled on the audacious kidnapping of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro that the Yankee propaganda machinery started fanning the flames of war on Iran. Imperialism abroad has been accompanied by Trump’s unleashing of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) goons on American streets with orders to literally shoot ‘suspects’ at sight.

 

The combination of bravado and terror portends more darkness ahead. But what is the end game?
There isn’t one. At a base level, Washington still just wants the oil, the lifeblood of the global capitalist order over which it has presided since the end of World War II. This order is creaking at the seams, but a better world system is not visible yet. Venezuela sits atop the biggest reserves of black gold in the world. Iran is number three on the list. US imperialism wants it all.
Then there is the other bedrock of the military-industrial complex — making war. In the face of China’s inexorable economic rise and partial erosion of dollar hegemony, US power is not what it was. But Washington possesses 10 times the means of destruction of any other single country. It still bombs and invades other countries at will, kidnaps heads of state in broad daylight.

The combination of bravado and terror portends more darkness.

Will military might and oil stave off America’s terminal economic decline? The answer depends on who monopolises the new global commodity on the block — critical minerals. Or maybe you prefer the term ‘rare earth’. Whatever your fancy, control over the rock equates to monopolies of renewable energy, electric vehicles, everyday smart technology, high-grade weapons systems and so much more.
And this is where China calls out the Empire’s bluff. Beijing’s announcement of unprecedented export controls on rare earth elements a few months ago confirmed its willingness to play hard ball after Trump’s dramatic tariff announcements earlier in 2025. Oil, gas, plastic and coal still matter, but critical minerals are starting to matter more. Capitalism is greening itself and the Empire is being forced to play catch up.

 

What does the tortured withering away of the old order mean for us in this country? Mostly business as usual, at least for now. The current hybrid plus regime is ingratiating itself with as many external patrons as possible to generate those coveted geostrategic rents. You want military personnel to serve in Gaza? Happy to consider it. A port in Pasni to rival the Chinese in Gwadar? Why not? Access to copper, gold and other mineral exploration projects in already conflict-ravaged Baloch­istan and KP? Ayub Khan spun it by claiming: friends, not masters.
All of this while Chinese solar panels flood Pakistani markets at breakneck speed, Chinese electric SUVs become the new status symbol of our hedonistic chattering classes, and all manner of defence deals are signed with Gulf kingdoms and whatnot. No one seems to be concerned with the geopolitical wars that will surely intensify.
Which brings us to crypto. Earlier this week, the CEO of the shady Trump-owned crypto company World Liberty Finance was in town to ink a deal with the go­­vernment. The big guns were all present to oversee the ‘historic’ agreem­ent. What exactly does it mean to ‘ex­­­-plore innovation in digital finance’? No one really knows, just as no one is privy to what the newly created Pakistan Virtual Asset Regulatory Autho­rity is actually doing, on whose watch and to what end.
The crypto game is arguably even more opaque than any other money-making enterprise in the country, and that is saying a lot. More than $600 million was lost to crypto transactions in 2025. The one thing that can be said for certain is that World Liberty Finance has brought in a lot of cash for the Trump family, especially since he became president, and that there is more on the horizon for a select few in both Pakistan and the US in the wake of this deal.
And herein lies the rub. For all the geopolitical change taking place around the world, the logic of the system at large remains the accumulation of power and profit. As bloody games around oil, minerals and crypto intensify, brutalised masses in Pakistan and beyond are in line for even more of the brunt of a rapid race to the bottom.

However, the balance of power steadily shifted in India’s favour in the first quarter of the 21st century. Islamabad’s internal security and economic fragility, a pro-India regime in Dhaka, Delhi’s rising economic profile, Beijing’s hesitation to proactively engage in South Asia’s security and strategic affairs and Washington’s decision to embolden India as a bulwark against China led to the emergence of a belligerent India in the region.
Change is the only constant in international affairs. This also applies to South Asia, where the region is witnessing profound geopolitical shifts. Today, Pakistan wants to reclaim its political space in South Asia. Beijing is eager to expand its footprint in the region, while Dhaka is showing defiance against Delhi’s assertive policies and domestic interference.
Islamabad considers it a conducive environment for promoting the idea of a ‘multipolar’ South Asia. Islamabad believes that a resurgent Pakistan, assertive Bangladesh and proactive China can effectively limit Indian influence and reclaim its strategic space in the region.
In the South Asian context, multipolarity does not imply the emergence of several equal great powers, but rather the dilution of India’s structural dominance through the rise of alternative and consequential regional pillars. Multipolarity, as envisaged by Islamabad, signifies a regional order in which China, Bangladesh and Pakistan emerge as equally important strategic, economic and political poles alongside India, rather than remaining peripheral or subordinate actors.
South Asian states have already welcomed Chinese economic activities under the Belt & Road Initiative. Now, Islamabad envisages a proactive approach by Beijing in establishing sub-regional forums sans India, and deeper technological and security cooperation with smaller South Asian states. Similarly, Islamabad is trying to embolden Dhaka as an assertive power within the South Asian region.
Islamabad has calculated that a politically independent, economically stable and militarily assertive Dhaka will challenge India’s assertive policies. A stronger Bangladesh with advanced air and naval power will challenge Delhi’s uncontested influence in the Bay of Bengal. Hence, an emboldened Dhaka will indirectly complement Islamabad’s strategic overtures in South Asia. This is why Islamabad is strengthening Dhaka’s defence through deepening cooperation in the naval, air and military domain.

A multipolar South Asia will limit Delhi’s ability to unilaterally shape the norms of regional forums.

Multipolarity in South Asian affairs will introduce several strategic and political opportunities for the regional states. First, the significance of smaller South Asian states such as the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan will increase in a multipolar South Asia as the competing powers will likely try to persuade them to join their respective blocs.
Similarly, a multipolar South Asia will also increase strategic and political options for smaller South Asian states. Historically, the smaller South Asian states did not enjoy abundant strategic options; rather, they had to rely only on India. In a multipolar South Asia, smaller states will have the diplomatic flexibility to adopt an issue-based cooperation strategy on trade, energy, climate, security, etc, rather than entering into rigid bloc politics.
Second, a multipolar South Asia will limit Delhi’s ability to unilaterally shape the norms of regional forums. For instance, Delhi’s unilateral decision to boycott Saarc in 2016 paralysed the only regional forum in South Asia. However, a multipolar South Asia will create space for alternative sub-regional frameworks.
Third, attempts for the establishment of a multipolar South Asia will enhance Pakistan’s regional and global political profile as a facilitator of multi-vector regional alignment rather than simply being a bilateral rival of India.
However, there are significant risks involved in promoting the idea of a multipolar South Asia. First, Islamabad’s attempts towards the establishment of a multipolar South Asia will lead to another episode of intense geopolitical competition within the region. This intensified geopolitical competition will adversely affect efforts for regional connectivity. In this intense competitive environment, South Asian states will prioritise sub-regional forums over regional frameworks as consensus-building in a regional forum is perhaps near impossible. One practical manifestation is the growing emphasis on mini-lateral frameworks that operate outside India-centric regional institutions. The establishment of the Bangladesh-China-Pakistan strategic forum reflects this evolving trend.
Second, Delhi will resist a multipolar South Asia through economic resources, diplomatic campaigns and establishing strategic partnerships with its neighbouring countries to reassert its primacy in the region. These strategies will add pressure on the foreign policy of smaller South Asian states.
Third, the uncertain domestic political environment of Bangladesh with its inconsistent foreign policy approaches, and long-standing Pakistan-Bangladesh issues such as Dhaka’s demands for an apology for the 1971 events and repayment of assets in undivided Pakistan, may hinder efforts towards a strengthened and effective multipolar South Asia in the long term.
Since the beginning, Islamabad has been concerned about the South Asian region becoming hostage to a single dominating power. While smaller South Asian states, too, had inherent insecurities on account of India, they tried to address them through engagement with New Delhi — on the latter’s terms. Islamabad, on the contrary, tried to challenge Indian dominance with a two-pronged strategy. Externally, it formed an alliance with the West to militarily enable itself against India, while within the region, it made efforts to establish a regional organisation (Saarc) in 1985 with the help of smaller South Asian states to defy the single country’s dominance.
Islamabad considers it another ‘1985 moment’, when it successfully aligned with smaller South Asian states and persuaded New Delhi to operate as one stakeholder among many, rather than as the region’s sole arbiter. The critical question is whether Islamabad’s push for a multipolar South Asia will replicate its 1985 success or reinforce regional polarisation.

A STARK message from the Taliban supreme leader, warning of internal threats to the Islamic Emirate, has seemingly laid bare the long-speculated divide bet­ween Kandahar and Kabul, BBC News reported.
An audio recording of a speech — delivered by Hibat­ullah Akhundzada at a seminary in Kandahar aro­und a year ago — contains what some are interpreting as confirmation of differences among top Taliban leaders.
In the leaked clip, obtained by the BBC, Akhundzada can be heard saying that internal disagreements could eventually bring them all down.
According to the investigation by BBC Afghan, two distinct groups have eme­rged within the Afghan Tali­ban, each presenting competing visions for how Afgh­anistan should be governed.
One is entirely loyal to the Akhundzada-led Kandahar faction, who is driving the country towards his vision of a strict Islamic Emirate — isolated from the modern world, where religious figures loyal to him control every aspect of society.
The second faction is made up of powerful Taliban members largely based in the capital Kabul, advocating for an Afghanistan which — while still following a strict interpretation of Islam — engages with the outside world, builds the country’s economy, and even allows girls and women access to an education they are currently denied beyond primary school.
The question was always whether the Kabul group — made up of Taliban cabinet ministers, powerful militants and influential religious scholars commanding the support of thousands of Taliban loyalists — would ever challenge Akhundzada in any meaningful way, as his speech suggested.
Then came a decision which would see the delicate tug of war between the most powerful men in the country escalate into a clash of wills.
In late September, Akhun­dzada ordered the internet and phones to be shut off, severing Afghanistan from the rest of the world. But just three days later the internet was back, with no explanation of why.
What had happened behind the scenes was seismic, insiders said. It was thought that the Kabul group had acted against Akhundzada’s order and switched the internet back on. According to one expert, this was nothing short of rebellion for a group that doesn’t brook dissent amongst its echelons.
Consolidation in Kandahar
Although Akhundzada was the lone power centre by the time the Taliban recaptured Kabul in 2021, his earlier lack of battlefield experience meant that his deputies — Sirajuddin Haqqani and Mullah Omar’s son Yaqoob — shepherded him through the period when the group was still consolidating its power.
But once they came into power, the two powerful men were designated as mere ministers, and even a figure like Mullah Baradar — the co-founder of the Taliban movement — found himself handed the title of deputy PM.
Akhundzada — having shunned the capital in favour of remaining in Kandahar, a base of power for the Taliban — began surrounding himself with trusted ideologues and hardliners, the BBC noted.
The supreme leader, who had started out as a judge in the Taliban’s Sharia courts of the 1990s, quickly began announcing edicts without consultation with Kabul, and with little regard for public promises made before they took power, on issues like allowing girls access to education.
Getting a meeting with him has also become increasingly difficult, as Akhundzada is said to be extremely reclusive. Photographing or filming him is forbidden and only two photos of him are known to exist. Reports suggest Akhundzada issues direct orders all the way down to local police units — bypassing ministers in Kabul.
An observer argued that the “real authority has been transferred to Kandahar” but Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied this impression.
“All the ministers have their power in their ministerial framework, undertaking daily works and making decisions — all the powers are delegated to them and they carry out their duties,” he told the BBC.
In a subsequent tweet, he termed the BBC report “unfounded”. He did, however, implicitly confirm the existence of the audio recording cited as the basis for the report, only taking issue with its interpretation.
“Statements by the leadership emphasising the importance of unity and cohesion, or minor matters in which opinions may differ, should never be interpreted as disagreement… there is no fear of discord,” Mujahid wrote on his X account.
Kabul left fretting
On the other side, the Kabul group — unofficially led by Mullah Baradar — wants to see an Afghanistan which moves towards the model of a Gulf state.
They are concerned about the concentration of power in Kandahar, the nature and enforcement of virtue laws, how the Taliban should engage with the international community and women’s education and employment.
But rather than being ‘moderate’, this faction is seen as being more pragmatic. Mullah Yaqoob is becoming increasingly popular with young Taliban members and some ordinary Afghans, while Sirajuddin Haqqani has managed to rebrand himself to near-mythical status among supporters.
But despite all this, analysts and insiders repeatedly told the BBC that openly moving against supreme leader Akhundzada was unlikely.

The rocket was fired from an unknown direction, resulting in a several-feet-deep crater and the collapse of the house’s ceiling.
Fortunately, no casualties were reported.
Earlier, on the night of December 31, 2025, Bannu Cantonment was also targeted in a rocket attack when a rocket landed in vacant houses near the CMH. While no loss of life occurred in that incident, property damage was reported.
According to initial information, the same type of rocket was used in both attacks, which militants have named the “Al-Farooq 2”. Following the December 31 attack, the model of the fired rocket was also widely circulated on social media.
Security agencies have launched a comprehensive investigation into the incident, while evidence is being collected from the site to determine the motives behind the attack and identify those responsible.
In another incident, militants launched an attack on the Fateh Khel police check post in Bannu.
According to Bannu Police spokesman Asif Hassan, an intense exchange of fire continued for quite some time.
The police successfully repulsed the attack, forcing the attackers to flee.

The move raises questions about proportionality, legality and intent. Applicants can still submit forms and attend interviews, but with no visas being issued, the policy ends up targeting legal immigration rather than illegal border crossings. The administration says the pause is meant to ensure immigrants are financially self-sufficient and do not rely on public welfare.
But the visas affected — family-based, employment-based and diversity visas — already involve lengthy screening, background checks and financial requirements. If the real concern is illegal immigration, freezing lawful pathways makes little sense. The policy’s selective nature adds to the confusion.
Student, tourist and business visas are unaffected, meaning Pakistanis may study or visit the US but cannot settle permanently or reunite with family members. India is reportedly not among the affected countries, though no official list has been released. Without clear criteria or timelines, the step appears arbitrary rather than rules-based. The use of the public-charge rule further weakens the policy’s credibility.

 

Reports that applicants may be required to post bonds as high as $15,000 turn immigration into a wealth test. For families from lower-income countries, this creates an almost insurmountable barrier, regardless of skills or sponsorship. The latest guidance from officials gives little reassurance. Interviews will continue, but even visas already approved — if not yet printed — must be refused.
Dual nationals applying on passports from unaffected countries are exempt, and vague “national interest” exceptions may be granted, though no standards have been explained.
For Pakistanis, the consequences are immediate. Families waiting for reunification face indefinite delays, professionals with approved petitions are left in limbo, and long-term plans put on hold. Pakistani diplomatic missions are still awaiting detailed instructions, adding to the uncertainty.
Visa suspensions are not new in US history, especially during security reviews. But the scale of this pause — covering over 75 countries — is unprecedented. By focusing on legal immigrants while leaving temporary visas untouched, the policy appears to be less about reform and more about exclusion by design. A fair immigration system must be transparent, consistent and focused on individual assessment.

In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Rela­tions (ISPR) said 13 members of the “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij” — the state’s term for the banned Teh­reek-i-Taliban Pakistan — were killed in two separate engagements on January 13 and 14.
In Bannu, the security forces effectively engaged the militants’ location and gunned down eight militants following an intense exchange of fire.
The stat­e­ment read that an­other intelligence-based operation was conducted by the troops in Kurram, adding that five terrorists were killed in that operation.
Meanwhile, two armed militants were killed and a policeman was injured in a shootout between the pol­ice and the militants in Dera Ismail Khan on Thursday.
According to a police spok­esperson, the clash took place when the militants attacked the Khutti police check-post located within the limits of Dera Town police station on Wed­nesday night, triggering a fierce exchange of fire that left two attackers dead and a police constable injured.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
In a press conference last week, ISPR Director General Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025.
Breaking it down, he said 14,658 operations were conducted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 58,778 in Balochistan, and 1,739 in other regions of Pakistan. He added that 5,397 terror incidents took place in Pakistan in 2025, of which 3,811 were reported from KP (71pc), 1,557 from Balochistan (29pc), and 29 from other areas.

Machado, who fled Venezuela in a daring seaborne escape last month, is competing for Trump’s ear with members of Venezuela’s government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.
The lunch meeting marks the first time the two have met in person.
“I know the president was looking forward to this meeting, and he was expecting it to be a good and positive discussion with Miss Machado, who is really a remarkable and brave voice for many of the people of Venezuela,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters during a briefing.
She said Trump’s earlier assessment of Machado, in which he said she did not command the respect in Venezuela to govern it, stands.
After the US captured Venezuela’s longtime leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a snatch-and-grab operation this month, various opposition figures, members of Venezuela’s diaspora and politicians throughout the US and Latin America have expressed hope that Venezuela will begin the process of democratisation.
But for now, Trump has said he is focused on economically rebuilding Venezuela and securing US access to the country’s oil.
The day after the Jan 3 operation, he expressed doubts that Machado had the backing needed to return to the country and govern, telling reporters: “She doesn’t have the support within or the respect within the country.” Trump has on several occasions praised Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela’s interim president, saying in an interview on Wednesday: “She’s been very good to deal with.”
A Nobel for Trump?
One potential topic of conversation for Thursday’s White House meeting was the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to Machado last month, a snub to Trump, who has long sought the award.
Machado has suggested she would give the prize to the US president for having deposed Maduro, though the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.
Asked if he wanted Machado to give him the prize, Trump said: “No, I didn’t say that. She won the Nobel Peace Prize.” Pressed on what he would do if she brought the prize nonetheless, he responded: “Well, that’s what I’m hearing. I don’t know, but I shouldn’t be the one to say. “I think we’re just going to talk.”

Ali Shaath

• Ex-deputy planning minister vows to clear debris in three years; Belfast-educated civil engineer will chair 15-member body• Prioritises urgent temporary shelter over rebuilding; defies UN estimates with seven-year restoration timeline• Secures dual endorsement from Hamas, Mah­moud Abbas
JERUSALEM: Ali Shaath, the Palestinian former government official chosen to administer Gaza under a US-backed deal, has an ambitious plan that includes pushing war debris into the Mediterranean Sea and rebuilding destroyed infrastructure within three years.
The appointment of the civil engineer and former deputy planning minister on Thursday marked the start of the next phase of US President Donald Trump’s plan to end Israel’s war in Gaza.
Shaath will chair a group of 15 Palestinian technocrats tasked with governing the Palestinian enclave after years of occupation by Israel.
Under Trump’s plan, Israel has withdrawn from nearly half of Gaza but its troops remain in control of the other half, a wasteland where nearly all buildings have been destroyed. Trump has floated turning Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East”.
Shaath will face the uncertain task of rebuilding the territory’s shattered infrastructure and clearing an estimated 68 million tonnes of rubble and unexploded ordnance even as Israel and Hamas continue to trade fire.
After past rounds of fighting with Israel, Palestinians in Gaza used war rubble as foundational material for the historic marina in Gaza City and for other projects. In an interview with a Palestinian radio station on Thursday, Shaath suggested a similar approach.
“If I brought bulldozers and pushed the rubble into the sea, and made new islands, new land, I can win new land for Gaza and at the same time clear the rubble,” he said, suggesting the debris could be removed in three years.
He said his immediate priority was the provision of urgent relief, including forging temporary housing for displaced Palestinians. His second priority would be rehabilitating “essential and vital infrastructure,” he said, followed by reconstruction of homes and buildings. “Gaza will return and be better than it used to be within seven years,” he said.
According to a 2024 UN report, rebuilding Gaza’s shattered homes will take until at least 2040, but could drag on for many decades.
Rebuilding Gaza
Ali Shaath, born in 1958, is originally from Khan Younis in southern Gaza. He previously served as the deputy minister of planning in the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, where he currently resides.
In that role and others, he oversaw the development of several industrial zones in the West Bank and Gaza. He holds a PhD in Civil Engineering from Queen’s University Belfast.
Shaath’s upbeat assessment of the timeline for rebuilding Gaza is almost certain to face challenges as mediators struggle to agree terms on disarming Hamas, which refuses to give up its weapons, and deploying peacekeepers in the enclave.
It was unclear how Shaath’s committee would proceed with rebuilding and gaining permissions for the import and use of heavy machinery and equipment — generally banned by Israel.

 

Israel, which cites security concerns for restricting the entry of such equipment into Gaza, did not respond to requ­ests for comment on Shaath’s appointment and plans.
Shaath said the Palestin­ian committee’s area of jurisdiction would begin with Hamas-controlled territory and gradually increase as Israel’s military withdraws further, as called for in Trump’s plan.
“Ultimately, the (committee’s) authority will encompass the entire Gaza Strip 365 square kilometres from the sea to the eastern border,” he said in the radio interview.
Support from Hamas, Abbas
The formation of Shaath’s committee has won support from Hamas, which is holding talks on Gaza’s future with other Palestinian factions in Cairo.
Senior Hamas official Bas­sem Naim said the “ball is now in the court of the mediators, the American guarantor and the international community to empower the committee”.
Palestinian President Mah­moud Abbas also voiced support for the committee, which he said would run Gaza through a “transitional phase”.
“We reaffirm the importance of linking the institutions of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Gaza, and avoiding the establishment of administrative, legal and security systems that entrench duality and division,” Abbas said.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitu­tional Court (FCC) was told on Thursday that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s having its own narcotics law, in addition to the Control of Narcotics Substances Act (CNSA) 1997, would only undermine the federal government’s anti-drug efforts and might add to legal complications.
The arguments were advanced by the federal government before a two-judge FCC bench comprising Justices Ali Baqar Najafi and Muhammad Karim Khan Agha.
The bench was hearing a petition jointly moved by the federal government and the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) seeking to set aside the KP Control of Narcotics Substances Act 2019.
The controversy revolves around whether a province can enact a parallel narcotics law in the presence of Section 71 of the CNSA 1997 — a move that the petitioners argue “undermine the federal government’s authority to legislate”.
Filed against the backdrop of KP’s parallel legislation, despite the CNSA 1997 already being in effect, the petition asked the FCC to interpret the executive powers of both the federal and provincial governments under the Constitution.
The petition argued that the federal government played a vital role in controlling and eliminating the narcotics threat in the country, particularly in the processing and trafficking of heroin and charas.
It stated that the federal government had already taken effective measures to combat all aspects of the multifaceted drug problem since long.
‘Not a dispute’
During the hearing, Barrister Syed Ali Zafar, representing the KP government, argued that the matter did not represent a dispute between the federal and provincial governments, as the law was duly enacted by the KP Assembly.
In response, Additional Attorney General (AAG) Chaudhry Aamir Rehman questioned how a provincial law could repeal a federal legislation.
He added that once a province established its own force or agency to implement such a law, a dispute between the federal and provincial governments was bound to erupt.
The FCC adjourned further proceedings until next week.
‘Comprehensive law’
The petition expressed the concern that the provincial law repealed the CNSA 1997 within KP to the extent of cultivation, possession, sale, purchase, delivery, and transportation of narcotics.
It termed the KP law a “mala fide” and “colourable” exercise of power, seeking its declaration as illegal.

 

It stated that licensing authority for import, export, internal transport, manufacturing, and transshipment of narcotic drugs fell within the purview of the federal government under the CNSA 1997.
The provincial law, the petition contended, would create grave legal and constitutional chaos, including duplication of special courts, overlapping jurisdiction, and conflict of authority with other law enforcement agencies. This, the plea added, could lead to a legal and constitutional crisis.
The petition argued that the CNSA 1997 was a comprehensive law applicable across Pakistan to curb the menace of narcotics as airports, dry ports, seaports, and land borders fell under the exclusive control of the federal government, which exercised its jurisdiction through the ANF.
It contended that as narcotics trafficking was not only a cross-border offence but one with regional and international implications, only a federal agency could effectively deal with the menace, as the jurisdiction of provincial force extended only within its frontiers.
The petition further argued that in the presence of a federal law enacted by parliament within its legislative competence under Articles 90 and 142 and Entries 3, 26, 27, 32, and 58 of the Federal Legislative List, any provincial law would be contradictory and thus void.

The exchange companies are the third-largest component of foreign exchange inflows to Pakistan, accounting for up to $4.5 billion annually.
The foreign direct investment (FDI) has been declining, and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb admitted that international companies are leaving the country due to the high cost of production, but urged multinationals to review their business models.
At the same time, exports have not performed well, even though the government has set an ambitious target of $60 billion. This is the reason the SBP has been looking for higher inflows from overseas, for which the government is facilitating Pakistanis to go abroad and seek jobs.
The government and the State Bank are taking every measure to improve inflows and minimise outflows of dollars from the country, which is why the exchange companies were stopped from providing cash dollars to customers. Instead, they either directly transfer dollars into the customer’s foreign currency accounts or issue a cheque to get the dollars from a bank.

Move expected to boost remittances and take country towards a cashless economy

“The SBP has now allowed exchange companies (ECs) to utilise Raast, a state-of-the-art payment system launched by the SBP in 2021, to facilitate remitters and beneficiaries of home remittances,” said a circular of the central bank on Thursday.
“Through this enablement, the beneficiaries receiving remittances through ECs can receive their funds in their accounts and wallets maintained with banks, MFBs, or EMIs, in a safe and efficient manner,” said the circular.
The SBP has launched a series of measures to bring the payment system up to international standards and replace paper-based transactions with cashless ones. Globally, the digital payment system has already captured a major share of transactions. Now, the latest Chinese payment system makes it even easier, as international payments take just 5 seconds compared to the old dollar-based system, which usually takes 5 to 6 days.
“This facilitation (Raast) is a step forward in achieving the overall national objective of a cashless economy,” said the SBP.
The circular said that the digital enablement of exchange companies and the building of an innovative and inclusive digital financial services ecosystem are key objectives of the State Bank under its Strategic Plan 2023-2028. “To achieve this objective, SBP continues to strengthen digital payments infrastructure, promote innovation and redesign regulatory frameworks to facilitate cross-border transfers using secure, interoperable and customer-centric solutions,” said the circular.
“This facilitation is a step forward in achieving the overall national objective of cashless economy,” it added.
SBP reserves up $16m
The central bank’s foreign exchange reserves increased by $16m to $16.071bn during the week ending Jan 9.
According to SBP, the country’s overall liquid foreign reserves stood at $21.248bn, including $5.176bn held by the commercial banks, during the week under review.

RIYADH: Saudi Arabia has announced a sweeping $500 million development package for southern Yemen following a government offensive against allied separatists, while Pakistan has urged the UN Security Council to push for an inclusive political settlement to the protracted conflict.
The development initiative, spanning 10 provinces, signals an increasingly assertive posture by the Kingdom after recent volatility in the region. Last year, the separatist South­ern Transitional Council swept through parts of the south, advancing near the Saudi border.
Riyadh declared the manoeuvre a threat to its national security and backed a military offensive earlier this month that routed the STC from power.
Saudi Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman met on Wednesday with the head of Yemen’s internationally recognised government and members of the Presidential Leadership Council to affirm the kingdom’s backing.

Pakistan urges UN to push for inclusive political deal

According to a statement on his account on the social platform X, the new projects include the construction of hospitals, schools and roads, as well as fuel donations to boost power production.







The kingdom also announced the construction of a mosque on the island of Socotra named “The Cus­todian of the Two Holy Mosques,” a reference to the Saudi king.
“This support embodies the kingdom’s keenness to enhance security and stability, and to contribute to building a better future for Yemen and its brotherly people,” the statement read.

 

Separately, Pakistan called on international powers to address the deepening crisis. Speaking to the UN Security Council, Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Asim Ahmad warned that millions are suffering due to the collapse of basic services.
“We encourage all Yemeni stakeholders and regional partners to engage constructively towards an inclusive and durable political settlement that reflects the aspiration of all the Yemeni people and safeguards regional peace and stability,” Mr Ahmad said.
The Pakistani envoy welcomed a call by the Aden-based Presidential Leadership Council to convene comprehensive talks in Riyadh.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to Yemen’s territorial integrity and opposed unilateral actions that risk deepening divisions.
Furthermore, Ahmad condemned the detention of UN and relief personnel and the seizure of UN premises in areas controlled by the Houthis, terming it a “blatant disregard for international law”.
Only two-thirds of Yemen’s children are fully immunised, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly diseases such as measles, diphtheria, cholera and polio. Ahmad urged the Security Council to act with unity to support a credible pathway toward peace.
“We hope that these efforts will result in concrete steps towards achieving lasting peace and an end to the suffering of the Yemeni people,” Ahmad said.
Meanwhile, UN Special Envoy Hans Grundberg noted that in response to STC’s expansion in Hadramout and Al Mahra, Saudi-backed government for­ces moved in early January to reassert contr­­ol, emphasising that Ye­­men’s future cannot be determined by force.
Political uncertainty has devastated Yemen’s economy, eroding household resilience through rising prices and unpaid salaries. Ramesh Rajasingham, director of the humanitarian sector for the UN aid coordination office, told the Council that needs are rising while access becomes restricted.
Rajasingham warned that over 18 million people will face acute food insecurity next month.

The ministry on Wednesday issued an SRO 61(I)/2006, which said that used cars would be imported only under the “transfer of residence and gift schemes.”
Vehicles imported under the gift and transfer of residence schemes shall remain non-transferable for a period of one year from the date of importation, the SRO said.
Vehicles imported under the transfer of residence scheme shall be from the same country in which the overseas Pakistani resides. The time frame for importing the vehicles has also been extended to 850 days from the previous 700 days from the date on which the Goods Declaration for the last import under this order was filed.

Commerce ministry restricts import of second-hand vehicles to ‘gift’ and ‘transfer-of-residence’ schemes

The SRO further stated that minimum safety and environmental standards and regulatory measures, as applicable to the commercial importation of used vehicles, duly notified by the Ministry of Industries and Production or the Engineering Development Board (EDB), shall apply mutatis mutandis to vehicles imported under the gift and transfer of residence schemes.
Earlier in January, the Federal Cabinet ratified the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) decision of December 9, 2025, allowing overseas Pakistanis to import used vehicles up to three years old under two schemes.
All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association (APMDA) Chairman H.M. Shahzad painted a gloomy picture of the arrival of used cars in 2026, following an influx of 40,000 used cars in FY25 and 18,000 units in 6MFY26 (first six months of FY26).
He said on Dec 9, 2025, the personal baggage scheme, which had long facilitated overseas Pakistanis, had been abolished, while the gift and transfer of residence schemes were further tightened with additional restrictions. The decision has created anxiety among overseas Pakistanis and stakeholders in the motor import business.
The government, he said, would lose millions of dollars in duties and taxes, as the import of 40,000 vehicles had contributed $500 million to the exchequer in FY25. The commercial import of vehicles has also been subjected to highly unreasonable terms, he added.
Mr Shahzad said that out of the total imports of used cars, the share of small cars (660cc) was 90 per cent, while 99pc of small cars were finding their way into Pakistan from Japan.
He said that previously, out of the total imports of used cars, 99 per cent arrived under the “personal baggage scheme.”
Regarding commercial imports of used cars, he said standard operating procedures are being formulated, but the government has already imposed a 40 per cent regulatory duty on used cars (under five years old) until June 30, 2026, on top of existing duties. He said the regulatory duty would be reduced by 10 per cent annually from FY27, reaching zero by FY30.
On Jan 12, Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts and Accessories Manufacturers Chairman Usman Aslam Malik and Senior Vice Chairman Shehyar Qadir said that the government’s decision to regularise used car import schemes is a major step towards restoring their original intent for genuine overseas Pakistanis while safeguarding the country’s local automotive and auto parts industry.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to formally launch the project within the next couple of days.
This was one of the five health sector projects worth Rs79.35bn cleared by the Central Development Working Party (CDWP) at a meeting presided over by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal.

 

The Sehat Sahulat Programme was originally launched on Feb 7, 2018, and gradually expanded across the country and extended from the initial three years to seven years, ending June 2025 and was devolved to provinces.
Presiding over a meeting on Jan 2, 2026, PM Shehbaz approved the continuity of the programme beyond June 30, 2025, until June 30, 2027, for AJK, GB and ICT only.

Rs79bn health projects approved; Polyclinic-II plan revised

Under his directives, a modified project with a revised capital cost of Rs40.188bn was cleared by the CDWP and referred to the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) for formal approval under universal health coverage (UHC) scope.
The project is a key component of the Uraan Pakistan social sector Initiative and seeks to ensure equitable access to quality healthcare services for all citizens, particularly the poor, vulnerable and underserved segments of society.
Under the revised framework, the Sehat Sahulat Programme is being implemented through the development budget on a universal basis in the three federal territories for improving overall public health outcomes by expanding coverage of secondary and priority inpatient treatments.
The programme would provide health insurance coverage for indoor healthcare services to all permanent resident families in the covered districts as per Nadra records to reduce out-of-pocket expenses and catastrophic health expenditures related to hospitalisation by up to 60 per cent.
The minister told the meeting that the programme was initially launched in 2015 by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif with the core objective of providing 100pc health coverage exclusively to poor and deserving families.
He alleged that the subsequent renaming and expansion of the programme to affluent segments in certain regions led to the misuse of resources and restricted access for genuinely deserving households.
He directed that the programme be renamed its original title, i.e. the Prime Minister’s National Health Programme, and that public resources remain focused on protecting vulnerable groups and strengthening the social safety net.
All in all, the CDWP approved three smaller development projects with a combined estimated cost of Rs12.5bn under its financial powers and referred two larger (Rs56.8bn) projects,
including the Rs40.188bn Sehat Sahulat and Rs15.95bn Jinnah Hospital (Polyclinic-II), Islamabad, to Ecnec for formal approval.

Citing a significant increase in demand for Pakistani labour in GCC countries and other regions, he said Pakistan was launching soft-skills training programmes in collaboration with Korea and Japan. He also announced that the minimum age for women seeking overseas employment had been reduced from 35 to 25 years. A Pakistani worker employed in Korea is currently remitting an average of $1,800 per month to Pakistan, he said while speaking at a meeting with members of the Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (Kati). 
The minister said the government was undertaking comprehensive reforms to address issues faced by overseas Pakistanis, promote skills development and create better employment opportunities. 
He advised the Korangi office of the Employees Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI) to coordinate with Kati before issuing recovery notices, stressing that matters should be resolved through dialogue and facilitation. 
He said EOBI’s fund size had increased from Rs500 billion to Rs650bn within one-and-a-half years due to improved governance and transparency. He added that EOBI was focusing on enhancing investment returns, resolving property-related litigation through mediation, activating idle assets, overhauling IT systems and digitising statutory notices. 
The minister said EOBI’s Complaint Management System was being integrated with the Prime Minister’s Portal, Wafaqi Mohtasib and other relevant departments, while help desks had been established in Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi to facilitate employers, employees and pensioners. 
He said key institutions such as EOBI were being digitalised to facilitate industrialists rather than harass them, and to create a more business-friendly environment for taxpayers. He said EOBI had the potential to become self-sustaining due to the availability of substantial funds.

According to a press release issued by the Petroleum Division, the price of petrol will remain at Rs253.17 per litre and that of HSD at Rs257.08 for the upcoming fortnight starting January 16. 
The petroleum levy was increased by Rs4.65 on petrol and by 80 paise on diesel. Together, the petroleum and carbon levies now total Rs87 on petrol and Rs79 on diesel. 
Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers, directly affecting the budgets of the middle and lower-middle classes. 
Most of the transport sector runs on HSD. Its price is considered inflationary as it is used in heavy transport vehicles, trains, and agricultural engines, particularly contributing to rising prices of vegetables and other food items.

The US Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions on the secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security as well as Islamic Revolutionary Guard corps and law enforcement forces commanders, accusing them of being architects of the crackdown.
The US also imposed sanctions on Fardis Prison, where the State Department said women had “endured cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment.”
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a video on Thursday said Washington’s message to Iran’s leaders was clear: “US Treasury knows, that like rats on a sinking ship, you are frantically wiring funds stolen from Iranian families to banks and financial institutions around the world. Rest assured, we will track them and you.
“But there’s still time, if you choose to join us. As President Trump has said, stop the violence and stand with the people of Iran.”
‘No death sentence for arrested protester’
Earlier today, Trump said he had been told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on protests were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions, adopting a wait-and-see posture after previously threatening intervention.
Meanwhile, after Iran’s foreign minister said Iran had “no plan” to hang people, Iranian state media on Thursday reported that a 26-year-old man arrested during protests in the city of Karaj would not be given the death sentence.
Rights organisation Hengaw, which reported earlier this week that Erfan Soltani was due to be executed on Wednesday, said a previously communicated order for his execution had been postponed, citing his relatives.







In a social media post on Thursday, Trump responded to a news report that an Iranian protester was no longer being sentenced to death, writing: “This is good news. Hopefully, it will continue!”
Iranian state media said that while Soltani was being charged with colluding against “internal security and propaganda activities against the regime”, the death penalty does not apply to such charges.
Araghchi also said the Iranian government was “in full control” and reported an atmosphere of “calm” after what he called three days of “terrorist operation”.
The British government said its embassy in Tehran had been “temporarily closed”, while the US embassy in Saudi Arabia urged staff to exercise caution and avoid military installations.
Iran’s judiciary chief vowed to fast-track trials for those arrested, stoking fears authorities will use capital punishment as a tool of repression.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene on behalf of protesters in Iran, where the Iranian leadership has cracked down hard on nationwide unrest since December 28.
Reuters quoted a Gulf official as saying that four Arab states conducted intense diplomacy with the United States and Iran this week to prevent a threatened US attack on Iran.
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt were involved in the diplomacy over 48 hours before Trump signalled on Thursday that he had ultimately decided against an attack for now, saying the killings in Iran were easing.
The four countries had conveyed to Washington that any attack would have consequences for the wider region in terms of both security and economics that would ultimately impact the United States itself, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.
They told Iran that any retaliatory attack it launched on US facilities in the Gulf would have consequences for Tehran’s relations with other countries in the region, the official added.
Saudi Arabia’s international media office, Qatar’s Foreign Ministry, Oman’s Information Ministry and Egypt’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Foreign Ministry of the United Arab Emirates, which was not involved in the diplomacy described by the official, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had engaged in any diplomacy on the issue.
Protests appear to abate
People inside the country, reached by Reuters on Wednesday and Thursday, said the protests appear to have abated since Monday.
Information flows have been hampered by an internet blackout for a week.
Tensions had escalated on Wednesday, with Iran saying it had warned neighbours it would hit American bases in the region in the event of US strikes, and a US official saying the United States was withdrawing some personnel from bases in the region.
Trump, speaking at the White House, said he has been told that killings in the crackdown were subsiding.
Asked who told him that the killings had stopped, Trump described them as “very important sources on the other side”.







The president did not rule out potential US military action, saying “we are going to watch what the process is” before noting that his administration had received a “very good statement” from Iran.
In separate comments to Reuters, Trump expressed uncertainty over whether Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran and a prominent figure in Iran’s fractured opposition, would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.
Trump told Reuters it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth “any regime can fail”.

 

Turkiye, one of several states in the region where the US has forces, expressed opposition to the use of violence against Iran, with Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan saying at a press conference in Istanbul that the priority is to avoid destabilisation.
Saudi FM Prince Faisal bin Farhan held a phone call with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Thursday and discussed ways to support security and stability in the region, the Saudi foreign ministry said.







Qatar said on Wednesday that drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base, the biggest US base in the Middle East, were “being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions”.
Iran launched missiles at Al Udeid last year in response to US airstrikes on its nuclear installations during the 12-day war between Tehran and Israel.
Ali Shamkhani, a senior advisor to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, warned Trump that the strike showed “Iran’s will and capability to respond to any attack”.
Iran reopens airspace
Iran reopened its airspace after a nearly five-hour closure amid concerns about possible military action between the US and Iran that forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay some flights.
Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international ones to and from Iran with official permission at 10:15pmGMT (3:15amPKT) on Wednesday, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website.







The notice was removed shortly before 3amGMT (8am PKT), according to tracking service Flightradar24, which showed five flights from Iranian carriers Mahan Air, Yazd Airways and AVA Airlines were among the first to resume over the country.
Missile and drone barrages in a growing number of conflict zones represent a high risk to airline traffic.
Indian airlines among those affected
India’s largest airline IndiGo said some of its international flights would be impacted by Iran’s sudden airspace closure.
Air India said its flights were using alternative routes that could result in delays or cancellations.







A flight by Russia’s Aeroflot bound for Tehran returned to Moscow after the closure, according to Flightradar24 data.
Earlier on Wednesday, Germany issued a new directive cautioning the country’s airlines from entering Iranian airspace, shortly after Lufthansa rejigged its flight operations across the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region.
The United States already prohibits all US commercial flights from overflying Iran and there are no direct flights between the countries.

Airline operators like flydubai and Turkish Airlines have canceled multiple flights to Iran in the past week.
“Several airlines have already reduced or suspended services, and most carriers are avoiding Iranian airspace,” said Safe Airspace, a website run by OPSGROUP, a membership-based organisation that shares flight risk information.
“The situation may signal further security or military activity, including the risk of missile launches or heightened air defence, increasing the risk of misidentification of civil traffic.”
Lufthansa said on Wednesday that it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice, while it would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman from Wednesday until Monday next week so that crew would not have to stay overnight.
Some flights could also be cancelled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement.
Italian carrier ITA Airways, in which Lufthansa Group is now a major shareholder, said that it would similarly suspend night flights to Tel Aviv until Tuesday next week.
‘Unprecedented level of brutality’
Separately, G7 nations said on Wednesday they were “deeply alarmed at the high level of reported deaths and injuries” and warned of further sanctions if the crackdown continued.
Monitor NetBlocks said Iran’s internet blackout had lasted 156 hours.







Amnesty International accused authorities of committing mass unlawful killings “on an unprecedented scale,” citing verified videos and eyewitness accounts.
The US-based Institute for the Study of War said authorities were using “an unprecedented level of brutality to suppress protests,” noting reports of protest activity had sharply declined.
A senior Iranian official told journalists there had been no new “riots” since Monday, distinguishing them from earlier cost-of-living protests. “Every society can expect protests, but we will not tolerate violence,” he said.
Prosecutors have said some detainees will face capital charges of “waging war against God”. State media reported hundreds of arrests and the detention of a foreign national for espionage, without giving details.
India tells citizens to leave Iran
India’s foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Iran, where rights groups say a crackdown on mass protests has killed and arrested thousands of people.
India’s foreign ministry estimates there are usually around 10,000 citizens in Iran.







“Indian nationals who are currently in Iran (students, pilgrims, business persons and tourists) are advised to leave Iran by available means of transport,” the Indian Embassy in Tehran said, in a post on social media late Wednesday.
AI-created Iran protest videos gain traction
AI-generated videos purportedly depicting protests in Iran have flooded the web, researchers said Wednesday, as social media users push hyper-realistic deepfakes to fill an information void amid the country’s internet restrictions.
US disinformation watchdog NewsGuard said it identified seven AI-generated videos depicting the Iranian protests — created by both pro- and anti-government actors — that have collectively amassed some 3.5 million views across online platforms.
Among them was a video shared on the Elon Musk-owned platform X showing women protesters smashing a vehicle belonging to the Basij, the Iranian paramilitary force deployed to suppress the protests.
One X post featuring the AI clip, shared by what NewsGuard described as anti-regime users, garnered nearly 720,000 views.
Anti-regime X and TikTok users in the United States also posted AI videos depicting Iranian protesters symbolically renaming local streets after President Donald Trump.
One such clip shows a protester changing a street sign to “Trump St” while other demonstrators cheer, with an overlaid caption reading: “Iranian protestors are renaming the streets after Trump.”
Pro-regime social media users also shared AI videos purportedly showing large-scale pro-government counterprotests throughout the Islamic republic.
The AI creations highlight the growing prevalence of what experts call “hallucinated” visual content on social media during major news events, often overshadowing authentic images and videos.
In this case, AI creators were filling an information void caused by the internet blackout imposed by the Iranian regime as it sought to suppress demonstrations, experts said.
“There’s a lot of news — but no way to get it because of the internet blackout,” said NewsGuard analyst Ines Chomnalez.
“Foreign social media users are turning to AI video generators to advance their own narratives about the unfolding chaos.”
The fabricated videos were the latest example of AI tools being deployed to distort fast-developing breaking news.
AI fabrications, often amplified by partisan actors, have fueled alternate realities around recent news events, including the US capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and a deadly shooting by immigration agents in Minneapolis.
AFP fact-checkers also uncovered misrepresented images that created misleading narratives about the Iranian protests, the largest since the Islamic Republic was proclaimed in 1979.
One months-old video purportedly showing demonstrations in Iran was actually filmed in Greece in November 2025, while another claiming to depict a protester tearing down an Iranian flag was filmed in Nepal during last year’s protests that toppled the Himalayan nation’s government.</p><small>2026-01-15 18:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/152238446c1ffdf.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967129/pakistan-born-asad-ayaz-named-disneys-first-ever-chief-marketing-and-brand-officer' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-born Asad Ayaz named Disney’s first-ever chief marketing and brand officer</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: The Walt Disney Company has announced the creation of a new enterprise-wide marketing and brand organisation and named Pakistan-born executive Asad Ayaz as its first chief marketing and brand officer, a role that will place him among the most senior leaders at the global entertainment giant.
Ayaz, who was born in Pakistan in 1978, is the son of a senior officer of the Pakistan Air Force. He spent part of his childhood in the Middle East when his father served as Pakistan’s ambassador to Syria and Lebanon, before immigrating with his family to the United States as a teenager.
Disney said the new organisation is aimed at aligning marketing teams across its businesses more closely and strengthening how the company connects with consumers worldwide.
In his new role, Ayaz will lead marketing and brand strategy across Disney’s studios, streaming platforms, theme parks and consumer products.
Announcing the appointment, Disney Chief Executive Officer Bob Iger said the new role was critical at a time when the company’s businesses and consumer touchpoints had expanded rapidly.
“Over more than two decades at the company — and as Disney’s first-ever chief brand officer — Asad has helped bring the magic of Disney to life for millions through his exceptional leadership,” Iger said.
“As our businesses have evolved, it’s clear that we need a company-wide role that ensures brand consistency and allows consumers to seamlessly interact with our products and experiences.”
Ayaz joined Disney more than 20 years ago and most recently served as president of marketing for The Walt Disney Studios, while also leading global marketing for Disney+. He was appointed chief brand officer in 2023, overseeing company-wide brand strategy, partnerships and major events.
In interviews, Ayaz has spoken about his early fascination with popular culture after moving to the United States. He told the advertising-industry group World Federation of Advertisers in 2024 that his teenage bedroom walls featured posters of Batman Returns, The Simpsons and Thelma & Louise.
After graduating from Bennington College in Vermont, Ayaz worked in consulting before moving to Los Angeles to pursue a master’s degree in economics at the University of Southern California, where he gained his first exposure to the entertainment industry.
Disney’s senior leadership, including Disney Entertainment Co-Chairs Alan Bergman and Dana Walden, Disney Experiences Chairman Josh D’Amaro and ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro, described Ayaz as “an exceptional creative leader with strong strategic and operational prowess”.
As the chief marketing and brand officer, Ayaz will report directly to Iger, while also working with the heads of Disney’s business segments.
The company said the unified marketing structure would improve agility, strengthen brand consistency and enhance how Disney engages audiences globally.
Ayaz’s appointment adds him to a small but growing list of senior executives of Pakistani origin holding top leadership positions at major US corporations.</p><small>2026-01-15 17:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645357-back-from-iran-pakistani-students-say-they-heard-gunshots-while-confined-to-campus' target='_blank'><strong>Back from Iran, Pakistani students say they heard gunshots while confined to campus</strong></a><br><p>

However, no immigrant visas will be issued during the newly announced pause that takes effect on January 21.
In a question-and-answer guidance released alongside the new policy, the department said that the suspension does not revoke any immigrant visas already issued, nor does it apply to tourist or other non-immigrant visas.
Questions related to admission into the United States, it added, fell under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security.
The guidance also states that dual nationals applying with a valid passport from a country not included on the affected list are exempt from the pause.
Pakistan is among more the 75 countries whose nationals will be affected under the new measure, which the State Department said is part of a comprehensive review ordered by President Donald Trump to ensure that immigrants are “financially self-sufficient and not a financial burden to Americans.”
“President Trump has made clear that immigrants must be financially self-sufficient,” the department said, adding that all policies, regulations and guidance are being reviewed to prevent immigrants from becoming a public charge.

 

The sweeping list spans Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and eastern Europe, and includes countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Russia and Brazil.
According to internal guidance cited by officials, exceptions may be granted if an applicant can demonstrate that their travel would serve an “America First” national interest, though the criteria for such exemptions have not been publicly defined.
The guidance also instructs consular officers that if an immigrant visa has already been approved but has not yet been printed, the case must be refused.
The department said US embassies and consulates will continue to schedule immigrant visa appointments for affected nationals during the pause, but issuance will remain suspended while the review is underway.</p><small>2026-01-15 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645346-ci-med-appoints-adil-haider-to-lead-ai-initiatives' target='_blank'><strong>CI MED appoints Adil Haider to lead AI initiatives</strong></a><br><p>

His confirmation follows a statement by the Turkish foreign minister about the potential deal earlier today.
Harraj told Reuters the potential deal between the three countries was separate from a bilateral Saudi-Pakistani accord announced last year.
A final consensus between the three states is needed to complete the deal, he said.
“The Pakistan-Saudi Arabia-Turkey trilateral agreement is something that is already in pipeline,” Harraj said in an interview.
“The draft agreement is already available with us. The draft agreement is already with Saudi Arabia. The draft agreement is already available with Turkey. And all three countries are deliberating. And this agreement has been there for the last 10 months.”
Asked at a press conference in Istanbul earlier today about media reports on negotiations between the three sides, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said talks had been held but that no agreement had been signed.
Fidan pointed to a need for broader regional cooperation and trust to overcome distrust, which he said created “cracks and problems” that led to the emergence of external hegemonies or wars and instability stemming from terrorism, in the region.
“At the end of all of these, we have a proposal like this: all regional nations must come together to create a cooperation platform on the issue of security,” Fidan said.
Regional issues could be resolved if relevant countries would “be sure of each other,” he added.
“At the moment, there are meetings, talks, but we have not signed any agreement. Our President (Tayyip Erdogan)’s vision is for an inclusive platform that creates wider, bigger cooperation and stability,” Fidan said, without naming Pakistan or Saudi Arabia directly.
Bloomberg, citing people familiar with the matter, reported last week that Turkiye was seeking to join the Pak-Saudi defence pact signed in September 2025.
The report said Turkiye viewed the pact “as a way of strengthening security and deterrents when there are questions over the reliability of the US, which has strong military ties with all three countries, and President Donald Trump’s commitment” to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato).

 

Saudi Arabia brings financial clout, Pakistan has nuclear capability, ballistic missiles and manpower, while Turkiye has the military experience and has developed a defence industry, Bloomberg quoted Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with Ankara-based think tank TEPAV, as saying.
Asked about reports of Istanbul eyeing such a pact, Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj told BBC Urdu: “From a strategic point of view, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan are close friendly countries of Pakistan, and there is a close relationship with them in terms of strategic policy.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.</p><small>2026-01-15 15:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1517260357efa93.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967118/dont-know-whether-his-country-will-accept-his-leadership-trump-questions-support-for-reza-pahlavi-in-iran' target='_blank'><strong>‘Don’t know whether his country will accept his leadership’: Trump questions support for Reza Pahlavi in Iran</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi “seems very nice” but expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.
In an exclusive Reuters interview in the Oval Office, Trump said there was a chance Iran’s government could collapse and blamed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the stalemate in negotiations with Russia over the war in Ukraine.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran. But he was reluctant on Wednesday to lend his full support to Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran, who was ousted from power in 1979.
“He seems very nice, but I don’t know how he’d play within his own country,” Trump said. “And we really aren’t up to that point yet. I don’t know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me.”
Trump’s comments went further in questioning Pahlavi’s ability to lead Iran, after he said last week that he had no plans to meet with him.
Opposition Fragmented
The US-based Pahlavi, 65, has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution and has become a prominent voice in the protests. Iran’s opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions — including the monarchists who back Pahlavi — and appears to have little organised presence inside the Islamic Republic.
Echoing Trump’s caution, Sanam Vakil, deputy director of Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, said Pahlavi had gained prominence among some protesters and had helped mobilise them to some extent. “But I wouldn’t overstate it. It’s very hard to see how much support he has or how much support any figure has in Iran,” she said.
Trump said it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth “any regime can fail”.
“Whether or not it falls or not, it’s going to be an interesting period of time,” he said.
Trump, who is closing out the first year of his second term in office, sat behind his massive Resolute Desk and sipped a Diet Coke during the 30-minute interview. At one point, he held up a thick binder of papers, which he said contained his achievements since being sworn into office on January 20, 2025.
But he sought to manage expectations for Republicans in November’s congressional midterm elections, noting that the party in power frequently loses seats two years after a presidential election.
“When you win the presidency, you don’t win the midterms,” he said. “But we’re going to try very hard to win the midterms.”
‘Zelensky’ main impediment to reaching a deal
Trump, who has struggled throughout his presidency to end Russia’s war in Ukraine despite campaign boasts that he could end it in a day, said Zelensky is the main impediment to resolving the four-year-old war.
Trump has frequently criticised both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky but seemed more downbeat once again on the Ukrainian president.
Trump said Putin was “ready to make a deal.” Asked what the holdup is, Trump said simply: “Zelensky.”
“We have to get President Zelensky to go along with it,“ he said.
Trump calls Venezuelan opposition leader ‘very nice woman’
Trump is to meet on Thursday with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado at the White House, their first in-person meeting since Trump directed the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and seized control of the country earlier this month.
“She’s a very nice woman,” Trump said of Machado. “I’ve seen her on television. I think we’re just going to talk basics.”
Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year and dedicated it to Trump. She has offered to give him her prize, but the Nobel Committee said the peace prize cannot be transferred.
He praised the acting president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodriguez, who was vice president to Maduro when he was ousted. Trump said he had a “fascinating talk” with Rodriguez earlier on Wednesday and “she’s been very good to deal with.”
Trump frequently extolled the strength of the US economy during the interview despite lingering worries among Americans about prices. He said he will carry that message with him next week to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he will stress “how great our economy is, how strong our job numbers are, how good we’re doing.”</p><small>2026-01-15 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/15190425ecb3525.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967122/rustam-bazaar-in-kps-wana-temporarily-closed-due-to-security-threats-police' target='_blank'><strong>Rustam Bazaar in KP’s Wana temporarily closed due to security threats: police</strong></a><br><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: The district administration and police on Thursday temporarily closed and evacuated Wana’s Rustam Bazaar in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan, suspending commercial activities in the area as a precautionary measure after receiving credible information related to security threats.
According to police officials, all shopkeepers and civilians present in the market were instructed to immediately leave the area, while business activities were completely halted as soon as information related to the potential threats was received.
District Police Officer (DPO) South Waziristan Lower, Muhammad Tahir Shah, said that the law enforcement agencies had acted promptly upon receiving threat alerts.
“Based on intelligence inputs regarding possible security risks, it was decided to temporarily shut down Wana Rustam Bazaar,” he stated, adding that adjoining areas were also cleared as part of the security plan.
The DPO further said that additional contingents of police and security forces had been deployed in the area to maintain strict control over the situation.
All forms of movement within the bazaar were temporarily restricted, and checkpoints were placed on entry and exit routes to prevent unauthorised access.
“Traders and residents cooperated fully with the administration and law enforcement agencies by vacating the market without resistance,” the DPO added.
He appealed to citizens and the trader community to continue following police and administrative directives and to avoid visiting sensitive areas unnecessarily until the situation was declared safe.
Following the closure of the market, police launched a comprehensive search operation in the area. Officials said that bomb disposal squads were engaged in checking suspected locations, while surveillance was tightened at all internal and external access points, and the area remained under close monitoring.
Police said the security situation was being reviewed continuously and that the decision to reopen the bazaar would be taken only after “complete clearance and elimination of potential threats”.
“Public safety is our top priority, and no compromise will be made in this regard,” a police official said.
The country has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks. Islamabad says that the group has since been using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan. Kabul denies the allegations.
The law and order situation in both North and South Waziristan has particularly deteriorated, with police reporting a noticeable increase in terrorist attacks, such as bomb blasts, targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom, and attacks on police and security forces’ checkposts.
These incidents have posed serious challenges to law enforcement agencies and created an atmosphere of fear and uncertainty among the local population. Residents say that recurring incidents have severely disrupted daily life and heightened concerns about personal safety.
Traders and residents have expressed concern over the frequent suspension of business activities due to security alerts. They say repeated closures of markets have resulted in financial losses and added to economic hardships.
Other social activities have also been adversely affected, further compounding difficulties for the local population.
Residents have urged the government and security agencies to adopt effective and sustainable measures to restore lasting peace in the region. They stressed that improved security was essential not only for public safety but also for economic stability and normalcy in daily life.
Meanwhile, police and district administration officials reiterated their commitment to ensuring the protection of citizens. They emphasised that all available resources were being utilised to counter potential threats and maintain peace.
Authorities also appealed to the public to report any suspicious activity immediately to law enforcement agencies and to refrain from spreading rumours, which could create unnecessary panic.
Police officials maintained that public cooperation remained vital for improving the security situation and restoring confidence in the region.
According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), comparative data for 2024 and 2025 reveal a sharp escalation in terrorism and counter-terrorism-linked violence nationwide, with fatalities rising from 2,555 in 2024 to 3,417 in 2025, marking an increase of 862 deaths, or a roughly 34 per cent year-on-year surge in violence.
Per the report, “the most significant surge in violence was recorded in KP, where the fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025, an absolute increase of 711 deaths, accounting for over 82pc of the net national rise and marking almost a 44pc year-on-year surge in violence in the province.”</p><small>2026-01-15 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645341-13-india-backed-terrorists-killed-in-two-separate-kp-ibos-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>13 India-backed terrorists killed in two separate KP IBOs: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

He expressed these views while addressing a reception at the headquarters of Bahrain’s Economic Development Board (EDB), which is an investment promotion agency, a statement by the President’s Office said.
In his address, the president underscored Pakistan’s commitment to expanding economic cooperation, investment partnerships and institutional linkages with Bahrain, the statement said.
He “noted that the Economic Development Board plays a central role in shaping Bahrain’s economic strategy, attracting foreign investment and supporting diversification across key sectors”.
The president further observed that the board’s close coordination with government institutions and the private sector had helped Bahrain strengthen competitiveness, promote innovation and create a predictable and enabling environment for investors.
“President Zardari said the EDB’s model of policy coherence and investor facilitation offers a useful reference point for countries pursuing sustainable and inclusive growth,” the statement said.
It added that he also noted that Pakistan followed Bahrain’s development journey with “admiration and sees strong complementarities between the two economies”.
Highlighting Pakistan’s ongoing economic reforms, the president said the country was pursuing stability, digital modernisation and investment-led growth. He pointed to the Special Investment Facilitation Council as a “streamlined platform to facilitate investors”, with priority sectors including agriculture, information technology, energy, minerals, logistics and tourism.
Moreover, the president identified agriculture and food security, information technology and digital services, renewable energy and logistics as promising areas for Pakistan-Bahrain collaboration, the statement detailed.
It said the president also “emphasised Pakistan’s strategic geographic connectivity linking South Asia, Central Asia, China and the Middle East, which complements Bahrain’s financial expertise and regulatory framework”.
While outlining economic opportunities, the president also referred to regional security challenges and their impact on development, reaffirming Pakistan’s resolve to counter extremism, strengthen internal security and pursue peaceful relations with its neighbours, while safeguarding national interests, according to the statement.
“The president reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to protecting investment and fostering mutually beneficial partnerships, and thanked the leadership of Bahrain and the Economic Development Board for their role in advancing bilateral economic cooperation.”
He further commended the EDB for its “clear strategic vision and institutional strength”, observing that Bahrain’s success in positioning itself as an open and investor-friendly economy offers valuable lessons in a rapidly evolving global environment.
The statement also said the president appreciated Bahrain’s King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa and Crown Prince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa — who is also the Gulf country’s prime minister — “for the warm hospitality” extended during the visit.
It said the president conveyed his gratitude to King Hamad for the conferment of the Sheikh Issa Award, describing it as a gesture that reflected the depth of bilateral ties and mutual respect between the two countries.
“The president noted that the reception reflected the close and enduring friendship between Pakistan and Bahrain.”
The statement also mentioned that when Bahrain’s finance minister began briefing on economic development, the president interjected with a light remark, gesturing towards the Manama skyline and saying that the progress was visible before him and needed no explanation.
Separately, a post on the Presidency’s X account said President also met Bahrain’s Interior Minister Lt Gen Shaikh Rashid bin Abdullah Al Khalifa in capital Manama today.
“Both leaders pledged closer cooperation on security, counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism and reaffirmed strong bilateral ties,” the post said.







The president had arrived in Bahrain’s capital on Tuesday and met with Bahrain’s King at the royal residence, Al-Qudaibiya Palace.
According to the Foreign Office (FO), President Zardari will also hold a meeting with Crown Prince Salman during the trip.
“The visit seeks to reinforce Pakistan’s longstanding cooperation with the brotherly Gulf nation while expanding opportunities for collaboration in trade and economic partnership, defence and security, and people-to-people ties,” the FO said earlier this week.
Last year in November, Prime Mini­ster Shehbaz Sharif, during a two-day visit to Bahrain, had reiterated Pakis­tan’s commitment to deepening ties with the kingdom.
Discussing economic relations, the prime minister had unde­r­lined Pakistan’s desire to expand trade and investment and said bilateral trade was set to grow with the Pak­istan-GCC Free Trade Agree­ment.
Bahrain’s interior minister also visited Pakistan in September, with the two countries agreeing to enhance cooperation in the fields of counter-terrorism, anti-narcotics and immigration.</p><small>2026-01-15 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1515441883bdec6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967110/northern-areas-expected-to-get-snow-rain-from-tomorrow-showers-likely-in-parts-of-sindh-and-balochistan-from-jan-21' target='_blank'><strong>Northern areas expected to get snow, rain from tomorrow; showers likely in parts of Sindh and Balochistan from Jan 21</strong></a><br><p>The Met Office has forecast snowfall and rain in the country’s northern areas from Friday (tomorrow) and has also predicted showers in parts of Sindh, including Karachi, and Balochistan from January 21 to 23.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department’s (PMD) forecast issued on Thursday said: “A shallow westerly wave is likely to approach upper parts of the country from January 16 and may persist till January 19.”
It added that the weather system was expected to strengthen from January 20 and grip most parts of the country from January 21.
The PMD said that rain and thunderstorm was expected in various parts of Sindh, including Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Jacobabad, Naushahro Feroze, Kashmore, Larkana, Shaheed Benazirabad, Mirpurkhas and Ghotki on January 22 and 23 with “occasional gaps”.







It also predicted the same for multiple areas of Balochistan, including Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noushki, Harnai, Zhob, Kalat, Barkhan, Sibi, Loralai, Musakhel, Turbat, Gwadar, Jiwani, Lasbella, Kech, Awaran, Chaghi, Panjgur, Khuzdar, Washuk and Kharan on January 21 and 22.
Furthermore, the Met Office forecast “moderate to heavy snowfall” in Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noshki, Harnai and Zhob during that period.
In the northern areas of the country, the PMD said “widespread rain-wind/thunderstorm” was predicted from January 20 to 23 in Gilgit Baltistan’s Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche and Shigar districts; Azad Kashmir’s (AJK) Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, and Haveli districts; as well as in Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, and the Potohar region.
“Light rain/snowfall” was also expected in Murree, Galliyat and surroundings from January 18 to 20.
Punjab’s Sargodha, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sahiwal, Multan, Faisalabad, Dera Ghazi Khan, and Bahawalpur divisions and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Peshawar, Hazara, Malakand, Mardan, Kohat, Bannu, and Dera Ismail Khan divisions would also likely experience “widespread rain-wind/thunderstorm” from January 20 to 23.
The Met Office also predicted “heavy snowfall” in KP’s Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Shangla, Kohistan, Battagram, Mansehra and Abbottabad; AJK’s Neelum Valley, Bagh, Haveli and Rawalakot; along with Murree and Galliyat from January 20 (night) to 23 with occasional gaps.
The Met Office warned that “heavy snowfall may cause road closure and slippery conditions“ in Naran, Kaghan, Dir, Swat, Kalam, Chitral, Kohistan, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Astore, Hunza, Skardu, Murree, Galliyat, Neelum Valley, Bagh, Poonch, Haveli, Quetta, Ziarat, Chaman, Pishin, Qila Abdullah, Qila Saifullah, Noshki, Harnai and Zhob from January 21 to 23.
It further said there was a possibility of “landslides and avalanches” in hilly areas of upper KP, GB and AJK during the period.
“Tourists are advised to remain extra cautious and avoid unnecessary travelling during the forecast period,” the press release said.
It added that fog condition was likely to diminish in Punjab, KP and upper Sindh during the wet spell.
“Daytime temperatures are likely to drop significantly during the period,” the PMD advisory said.
According to the Met Office, the country received 34 per cent less rainfall in December 2025 than it normally does.
Cold wave alert for northern regions
Separately, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) also issued a cold wave alert for the upper and northern regions of the country.
The NDMA, in a statement issued by the National Emergencies Operations Centre (NEOC), forecast a strong cold wave expected to affect GB, upper KP and AJK over the coming days, resulting in heavy snowfall over high-altitude and hilly areas.
“Very cold to extremely cold conditions are likely to prevail, particularly during nighttime and early morning hours, while daytime temperatures are expected to remain below normal,” the statement read.
Earlier this month, the PMD had dismissed reports claiming that an “extreme cold wave” was expected from January 16 to 25.
The forecast indicated “moderate to heavy snowfall over high-altitude and hilly areas”, which may lead to disruptions in road connectivity, transportation, and power supply in mountainous regions.
“Adjoining plains are expected to experience cold and dry weather, with frost formation in isolated pockets,” the forecast added.
The prevailing conditions may “increase the risk of snow slides and avalanches at vulnerable locations” in hilly areas, posing threats to human safety, infrastructure, and livestock.
“Prolonged exposure to extreme cold and snowfall may also heighten health risks, especially for children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing medical conditions, while frost may cause damage to standing crops and orchards in nearby plain areas,” the statement said further.
In view of the expected weather conditions, the NDMA advised the public to “avoid non-essential travel to high-altitude and snowfall-prone areas and to ensure the use of snow chains where travel is unavoidable”.
It also urged citizens to “make adequate arrangements for heating, warm clothing, and shelter”, with particular attention to protecting vulnerable populations, with advice for local communities to “remain vigilant and strictly follow advisories” issued by relevant local authorities.
The NDMA directed all provincial and district authorities concerned to remain on high alert and ensure preparedness for snow clearance operations, emergency response, and timely restoration of essential services, including electricity and communications.
The statement further said the NDMA, through its NEOC, would continue to monitor the situation closely and issue further updates as required.
It also advised the public to “obtain authentic and official information through television and radio broadcasts, verified social media platforms, and the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert mobile application, to stay informed and take necessary precautionary measures.</p><small>2026-01-15 13:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1513112278b3752.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1967097/pakistan-hopes-routine-processing-of-us-immigrant-visas-will-resume-soon-after-internal-review-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan hopes routine processing of US immigrant visas will resume ‘soon’ after internal review: FO</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Thursday expressed hope that the United States would “soon” resume immigrant visa processing, adding that it viewed the recent suspension as part of an internal review.
The US on Wednesday announced the suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan and 74 other countries, effective January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations often rely on public welfare programmes.
In its statement, the State Department had said the “freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people”.
Responding to a query about the move despite Pakistan’s improved relations with Washington in recent months, Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi acknowledged coming across the “reports”.
“Basically, it was a brief statement by the US State Department on their social media account about the internal review of processing immigrant visas that they are in the process of,” he said.

 

“We are in touch with the US authorities to ascertain further details. This is an evolving news that we are following.
“We understand that this is an internal ongoing process of review of US immigration policies and system, and hope that the routine processing of immigrant visas will resume soon,” the FO spokesperson added.
The visa processing suspension could delay travel, study, and work plans for thousands of Pakistanis who annually seek US visas. Pakistani consulates in the US are expected to provide guidance to affected applicants in the coming days.
The freeze is linked to the US public-charge rule, which evaluates whether immigrants are likely to rely on government assistance. While suspensions of visa services have occurred in the past, officials have termed the scope of this action unprecedented.
No timeline has been given for resuming visa services, but the State Department assured that countries would be notified once the review is complete.
‘Full confidence in Iranian people and their leadership’
On the ongoing unrest in Iran and Tehran’s heightened tensions with the US, the FO spokesperson said Pakistan was “closely following the developments”.
Andrabi stressed: “We attach great importance to Iran, both as a neighbouring country and as an important player of the international community and an important member of the global fraternity.”
“Pakistan hopes that peace and stability will prevail, and we reaffirm our support for all efforts aimed at a peaceful resolution of the situation.”



He highlighted that the protests in Iran were “triggered by economic difficulties faced by the ordinary citizens, which have been further exacerbated and compounded by international sanctions”.
“So, we sincerely hope that the livelihood and financial support measures announced by the Iranian government for traders and the general public will help alleviate the hardship faced by the people, and we offer our best wishes towards that endeavour,” Andrabi said.
The FO spokesperson asserted that Pakistan remained “confident that the Iranian nation will overcome these challenges and emerge stronger”.
“A stable and peaceful Iran, free from domestic unrest, is in Pakistan’s interest.”
“We have full confidence in the wisdom of the Iranian people and their leadership — a wisdom rooted in their rich culture, ancient civilisation, history and resilience to address all the challenges confronting them.”

 

Andrabi urged Pakistanis to reconsider their travel plans for Iran, keeping in mind the FO’s recent travel advisory and exercising “extreme caution to ensure their safety and security”.
He stated that Pakistan’s Ambassador to Iran Mudassir Tipu and his team were “working diligently to ensure that Pakistanis in Iran are well-looked-after”.
Pakistan strongly rejects Indian army chief’s ‘baseless allegations’
On Tuesday, Indian Army Chief Gen Upendra Dwivedi alleged that there were “at least six terror camps still active across the LoC (Line of Control) and two across the international border” after India’s May 2025 strikes under what it called ‘Operation Sindoor’.
“Will act, if any [nefarious] attempts are carried out,” Times of India quoted Gen Dwivedi as saying.
Asked to comment on those remarks today, the FO spokesperson said, “Pakistan, of course, strongly rejects the baseless allegations by the Indian army chief regarding the presence of so-called terrorist camps.”
The FO spokesperson termed the allegations “cliched, habitual and somewhat delusional”.
“Our unparalleled sacrifices and blood and […] for combatting terrorism are internationally acknowledged and recognised,” he highlighted.
“We continue to contribute to peace not only in the region, but beyond,” he stressed.</p><small>2026-01-15 12:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645265-rain-expected-in-karachi-as-westerly-wave-likely-to-enter-country' target='_blank'><strong>Rain expected in Karachi as westerly wave approaches country</strong></a><br><p>

In the case, registered under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), the two have been accused of inciting divisions on linguistic grounds through social media posts and creating the impression that the armed forces were engaged in terrorism within the country.
The hearing on Thursday was conducted by Additional District and Sessions Judge Mohammed Afzal Majoka, with Prosecutor Rana Usman representing the state.
At the outset, neither Mazari nor Chattha appeared before the court. An assistant counsel sought an exemption from appearance for Mazari, submitting that Chattha was engaged in proceedings relating to a contempt case before the high court.
The court expressed displeasure over the absence of the accused and observed that the request for exemption would be considered later.
Judge Majoka warned that if the accused failed to appear, their right to cross-examination would be revoked. The hearing was initially adjourned until 12 noon.
When proceedings resumed, Chattha appeared in court and informed the judge that Mazari wished to cross-examine the prosecution witness Shahroz personally, reiterating that she intended to ask questions herself.
Majoka directed the defence to complete the cross-examination, warning that failure to do so would result in termination of that right.
During the hearing, Islamabad District Bar Association President Chaudhry Naeem Gujjar appeared in court and requested that the matter be fixed for Monday, assuring the court that no adjournment would be sought thereafter. He informed the court that Mazari was unwell but still wished to conduct the cross-examination herself.
The prosecution opposed any adjournment, and the prosecutor urged the court to administer an oath to the witness and commence cross-examination immediately.
The courtroom atmosphere turned tense when a heated exchange erupted between Gujjar and Usman. Harsh remarks were traded, leading to chaos in the courtroom. As tempers flared, Judge Majoka rose from the bench and retired to his chamber, ordering a break in the proceedings.

 

After the break, once again, neither Mazari nor Chattha appeared before the court. The prosecutor alleged misconduct in the courtroom and questioned the conduct of the bar president.
In view of the circumstances, the court cancelled the bail granted to the lawyers, ordered their arrest and production before the court, and formally revoked their right to cross-examination.
The court further directed that statements of the accused under Section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code be recorded.
The hearing of the case was adjourned till tomorrow.</p><small>2026-01-15 08:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/645228-social-media-users-urged-to-remove-illegal-hateful-content-immediately' target='_blank'><strong>Social media users urged to remove 'illegal, hateful' content immediately</strong></a><br><p>
