Delhi suspended its participation in the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960, which governs the usage of the Indus river system, shortly after 26 civilians in India-held Kashmir were killed in what India called an act of terror.
Pakistan has denied involvement in the incident, but accord remains “in abeyance” by India despite the two nuclear-armed neighbours agreeing to a ceasefire this month following the worst fighting between them in decades.
 
 

After the April 22 attack, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered officials to expedite planning and execution of projects on the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers, three bodies of water in the Indus system that are designated primarily for Pakistan’s use, six people told Reuters.
The three-day International Conference on Glaciers’ Preservation is being held in Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe from May 29-31.
It is being attended by over 2,500 delegates from 80 UN member states and 70 international organisations, including prime ministers, vice presidents, ministers, and UN assistant secretaries-general.
The event is being hosted by the Tajikistan government in collaboration with the United Nations, UNESCO, WMO, the Asian Development Bank, and other key partners as a historic moment for climate ambition, glacier preservation, and international cooperation.
“India’s unilateral and illegal decision to hold in abeyance the Indus Waters Treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus Basin’s water, is deeply regrettable,” PM Shehbaz said while addressing the conference.
“Millions of lives must not be held hostage to narrow political gains, and Pakistan will not allow this. We will never allow the red line to be crossed,” he said.
During his address, PM Shehbaz touched upon all relevant issues, including glacial preservation, Pakistan’s climate vulnerability, the 2022 floods in Pakistan, global climate action and responsibility, scientific projections on glacial melt, weaponisation of water and call to protect nature and humanity’s shared destiny.
“The world today bears fresh scars from the use of conventional weapons in Gaza that have left deep wounds. As if that were not enough, we are now witnessing an alarming new low—the weaponisation of water,” PM Shehbaz observed.
He added that Pakistan, being home to over 13,000 glaciers, was the most concerning as glaciers contributed nearly half of the annual flows in the Indus river system — “the lifeline of our civilisation, culture and economy”.
 






“The five great rivers that shape our geographical landscape—Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej—all depend on the stability of glacial systems. This makes Pakistan one of the most vulnerable countries to any climatic changes that impact glaciers,” he continued.
He told the gathering that Pakistan had faced the peril of glacial melt in the form of devastating floods in 2022 that destroyed millions of acres of standing crops, thousands of houses as well as infrastructure — despite the country contributing only less than half a per cent of the total world’s emissions and yet being one of the 10 most vulnerable countries.
He prayed that no other country faced such devastation, which necessitated a comprehensive plan and immediate implementation.
Referring to the “sobering” scientific projections, he highlighted that glacial melt in the country’s region was expected to accelerate flooding in the coming decades, followed by a drastic decline in river flows as glaciers recede further.
“These changes threaten our fragile ecosystem. As we inch closer to these grim new realities, we must heed the alarm bells, deflection signs of haunting consequences—lost livelihoods, displaced families, and deep chaos,” he warned.
Highlighting Pakistan’s commitment to shared responsibility and collective action, he called for enhanced global climate action to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.
“The developed countries must meet their climate financial commitments without any delay and with a balanced focus on adaptation and mitigation as well as loss and damage.
“Adequate funding for climate resilience, infrastructure, and overcoming financing gaps remains critical for climate-vulnerable countries,” the prime minister emphasised.
“Investment must be made in early warning systems and disaster preparedness and management.”
PM Shehbaz reflected on his childhood memories of swimming in the Ravi river, underscoring how rivers like Ravi and Tajikistan’s Vakhsh river, fed by glaciers, sustained life across regions, and that the shared water sources symbolised a common ecological destiny, requiring collective efforts for their preservation.
“Let us protect and preserve nature’s precious bounties for our planet and our peoples,” he urged.
The prime minister is currently returning to Pakistan after capping off his four-nation tour of friendly countries, state-run PTV News reported.
 






Earlier this week, the PM and his delegation, including Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, visited Turkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan, expressing gratitude for their support during a recent military escalation with India.
On Wednesday, the PM took part in a trilateral summit with Turkiye and Azerbaijan. He reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to hold talks with India on the Kashmir dispute and counterterrorism, stressing New Delhi wanted the same “in all sincerity”.</p><small>2025-05-30 12:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/30132420f4caaef.jpg?r=134326' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914277/pakistan-becomes-co-signatory-to-chinas-global-mediation-body' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan becomes co-signatory to China’s global mediation body</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan became a co-signatory to China’s newly set up Hong Kong-based International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) on Friday, a statement by the Foreign Office said.
China signed a convention setting up an international organisation for mediation in Hong Kong that Beijing hopes will be on par with the International Court of Justice and bolster the city’s international credentials, Reuters reported.
Pakistan, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia and Serbia were among the countries attending the signing ceremony, while representatives from 20 international bodies, including the United Nations, were also expected to join, public broadcaster RTHK said.
 






“Deputy Prime Minister [and] Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, today signed, on behalf of Pakistan, the convention on the establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong,” the statement by the FO read.
Speaking on the occasion, Dar appreciated the Chinese leadership for its wisdom in developing and consistently leading efforts in establishing the IOMed and fostering a global community with a shared future, the statement added.
He added that the creation of IOMed underscores the indispensability and significance of multilateralism as the centrepiece for international peace, stability, and development.
“IOMeD also offers new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world. As one of the founding members of IOMed, Pakistan would continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The deputy PM underlined Pakistan’s strong commitment to the promotion of peace and security as well as development. He elaborated on the critical importance of advancing and preserving multilateralism through faithful adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as international law.
He also drew attention to India’s violation of international law through its acts of aggression against Pakistan and its unlawful holding in abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty. He also highlighted the occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and the occupied Palestinian Territories as drivers of conflict to regional peace and security.
Dar called for the resolution of the longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute under the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
The idea for the establishment of the IOMed was one of the key outcomes of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing in April 2019. China initiated discussions for the establishment of IOMed in 2021, and invited Pakistan to join negotiations as one of its founding members, the statement added.
The organisation is open to all countries; is based on respect for the sovereignty, core interests and legitimate concerns of every country; aims to promote dialogue and trust between parties concerned based on equality; and desires inclusion of various legal systems, and their mediators, the FO said.
FM Dar visits Hong Kong’s chief executive
Separately, FM Dar, in a meeting with the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, John Lee, congratulated him on the establishment of IOMed, according to a separate statement by FO.
Noting Hong Kong’s growing significance in international mediation efforts, FM Dar highlighted the region’s role as a “global hub, linking east and west”.
The pair discussed measures to “deepen economic investment and trade cooperation” between Pakistan and the administrative region of Hong Kong.
“Hailing the launch of IOMed as a milestone inspired by President Xi Jinping’s vision, the DPM/FM noted its alignment with Pakistan’s commitment to dialogue-driven diplomacy and UN Charter’s principles,” the statement read.
The foreign minister acknowledged the chief executive and SAR government for their “impressive economic and social development strides under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ framework” while recalling Pakistan and Hong Kong’s “long-standing friendship.”
FM Dar also commended the Pakistani community in Hong Kong for strengthening bilateral ties and contributing to the city’s diversity and economy.
He also took to X to announce the meeting, describing it as “cordial and productive”.
 






Welcoming FM Dar’s visit, the chief executive expressed eagerness to enhance collaboration between Hong Kong and Pakistan further.
Says IOMed reafirms international peace, stability, development
Separately, Dar, while speaking at a ceremony in Hong Kong, said the creation of IOMed reaffirmed Pakistan and China’s shared a view of multilateralism that is the centerpiece of international peace, stability and development.
He said that IOMed offered “new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world”.
“Pakistan will continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,” Dar said.
He said that Pakistan would bring IOMed “not just a rich diplomatic experience, but also unflinching commitment to dialog, justice and fair play, excellencies”.
“Let me commit to empower this organisation, allowing it to fulfill its potential in the service of these equity and justice I thank you all,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-30 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3015522157b9033.png?r=155445' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914287/pakistan-india-close-to-completing-border-troop-reduction-cjcsc-gen-mirza' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India close to completing border troop reduction: CJCSC Gen Mirza</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and India are close to reducing the troop build-up along their border to levels before conflict erupted between the nuclear-armed neighbours this month, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee told Reuters on Friday, although he warned the crisis had increased the risk of escalation in the future.
The developments follow a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam. New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad retaliated by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Gen Mirza said the two militaries had started the process of drawing down troop levels.
“We have almost come back to the pre-22nd April situation… we are approaching that, or we must have approached that by now,” said Mirza, the most senior Pakistani military official to speak publicly since the conflict.
India’s ministry of defence and the office of the Indian chief of defence staff did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment on the remarks by Mirza.
Mirza, who is in Singapore to attend the Shangri-La Dialogue forum, said while there was no move towards nuclear weapons during this conflict, it was a dangerous situation.
“Nothing happened this time,” he said. “But you can’t rule out any strategic miscalculation at any time, because when the crisis is on, the responses are different.”
He also said the risk of escalation in the future had increased since the fighting this time was not limited to the Indian-occupied Kashmir.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan this month that New Delhi would target “terrorist hideouts” across the border again if there were new attacks on India.
“This (conflict) lowers the threshold between two countries who are contiguous nuclear powers…in the future, it will not be restricted to the disputed territory. It would come down to (the) whole of India and (the) whole of Pakistan,” Mirza said. “This is a very dangerous trend.”
Mirza warned that international mediation might be difficult in the future because of a lack of crisis management mechanisms between the countries.
“The time window for the international community to intervene would now be very less, and I would say that damage and destruction may take place even before that time window is exploited by the international community,” he said.
Pakistan was open to dialogue, he added, but beyond a crisis hotline between the directors general of military operations and some hotlines at the tactical level on the border, there was no other communication between the two countries.
India’s foreign ministry spokesperson said on Thursday “Talks and terror don’t go together” in response to a question on the possibility of dialogue with Pakistan.
Mirza said there were no backchannel discussions, or informal talks, to ease tensions. He also said he had no plans to meet General Anil Chauhan, India’s chief of defence staff, who is also in Singapore for the Shangri-La forum.
“These issues can only be resolved by dialogue and consultations, on the table. They cannot be resolved on the battlefield,” Mirza said.
India threatens to use navy against Pakistan in future
India will use the firepower of its “navy in response to any future aggression by Pakistan,” India’s defence minister said on Friday.
“If Pakistan resorts to anything evil or unethical, it will, this time, face the firepower and ire of the Indian Navy,” Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said on the aircraft carrier INS Vikrant off the coast of the western Indian state of Goa.
A spokesperson for Pakistan’s military referred Reuters to a May 12 statement, which said there would be a “comprehensive and decisive” response whenever Pakistan’s sovereignty was “threatened and territorial integrity violated”.
Singh said ‘Operation Sindoor’, under which India launched the strikes on Pakistan, was paused, but not yet over.
“We stopped our military actions on our own terms. Our forces had not even started showing their might,” he said.

The country’s once-thriving wetlands, long a sanctuary for millions of migratory birds fleeing Siberia’s brutal winters, are witnessing a disturbing decline in avian visitors.
Experts warn that a mix of prolonged drought, receding water levels, and growing habitat degradation is driving away these seasonal guests — some possibly for good.
According to the Sindh Wildlife Department’s 2024-25 waterfowl count, the number of migratory birds fell sharply from 1.2 million in 2023 to 603,900 in 2024 and just 545,000 this year, a staggering drop of over 50pc in two years.
In 2023, the region experienced an exceptional influx of birds, buoyed by the lingering effects of the catastrophic 2022 floods that, while devastating for communities, temporarily revived Pakistan’s lakes, streams, and lagoons.
The excessive rainfall had replenished many wetlands, making them ideal resting spots for birds making the 4,500-kilometre journey from Siberia to India via the Indus flyway, with stopovers at various lakes and water reservoirs in Pakistan.
However, this year tells a different story.
“Sindh has long been a refuge for migratory birds because of its unique biodiversity and its many lakes, lagoons and other waterways,” Mumtaz Soomro, an official from the Sindh Wildlife Department, told Anadolu Agency.
“But those numbers have seen a gradual decline since 2023 due to receding water levels and droughts.”
Soomro explained that the latest survey — covering 40pc of Sindh’s territory — found notable shortages at key bird habitats, including Manchar, Keenjhar, Hamal and Haleji lakes, Nareri lagoon, and the Rann of Kutch wildlife sanctuary.
These sites, some of which are Ramsar-certified wetlands of international importance, have been pivotal stopovers for migratory birds for decades.
According to Britannica, the Ramsar Convention is an intergovernmental treaty signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971 to guide national and international wetland-conservation measures.
“During the survey, our teams reported water shortages at most of the sites, including the marshy Rann of Kutch wildlife sanctuary,” he said.
Shadow of past flocks
The migration is seasonal, with birds arriving by late August and departing by February. Among the over 50 recorded species were gulls, mallards, plovers, snipes, cormorants, cranes, and storks.
The highest number of birds — 112,000 — was spotted at Nareri lagoon, followed by 91,000 at Rann of Kutch.
But even these numbers are a shadow of past flocks.
Zohaib Ahmed, a Karachi-based ornithologist, said climate change is not the only factor pushing migratory birds away from Pakistan, as man-made habitat degradation, pollution, and illegal hunting also play a significant role.
“Human-induced changes and rampant human interference, often in the name of development, has exposed these fragile ecosystems of wetlands to a string of threats,” Ahmed told Anadolu.
He emphasised that if the current trends of environmental neglect persist, Pakistan could lose its status as a preferred stopover for these avian travelers.
While the situation is particularly dire in Sindh, other provinces are also feeling the effects.
In Punjab, although the latest survey is still underway, officials estimate a similar downward trend.
“The decline is not sudden. It’s gradual, and the outcome of climate change, mainly water shortages, seasonal disturbances, and lingering heat spells,” said Mudasser Hasan, deputy chief at the Wildlife Rangers Punjab.
Hasan confirmed that the health of Pakistan’s wetlands has deteriorated in recent years, largely due to climate-related shifts.
“The arrival of these birds in Pakistan is a seasonal migration, and it has understandably been disturbed because of seasonal disturbances,” he noted.
Pakistan ranks among the top 10 countries globally most vulnerable to climate change, with experts warning that erratic monsoon patterns, glacial melt, and rising temperatures are placing unprecedented pressure on natural ecosystems, including those vital to bird migration.
Despite the alarming trends, some officials argue that threats like poaching and trapping have been brought under control.
“Hunters and poachers are there but they do not pose a major threat to migratory birds. It’s climate change that really haunts them,” said Hasan, adding that provincial authorities have tightened anti-wildlife hunting laws in recent years.
But not everyone agrees.
Ahmed, the ornithologist, contests this assessment, particularly in Sindh: “At least for Sindh, I can say with surety that there is no drop in hunting and trapping of migratory birds, especially in the Kirthar mountain range and Karachi’s coastal belt.”
He added that several migratory species are still being openly sold at illegal bird markets, undermining conservation efforts and contributing further to the birds’ decline.</p><small>2025-05-30 10:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606921-indias-strategic-miscalculation-cannot-be-ruled-out-says-cjcsc-gen-mirza' target='_blank'><strong>India's 'strategic miscalculation' cannot be ruled out, says CJCSC Gen Mirza</strong></a><br><p>

The duo had met a month earlier, where Zaman’s 3-2 win over El Torkey saw him being crowned U23 World Champion on home turf in a thrilling comeback.
Yesterday, 44th ranked Zaman defeated the Egyptian 11-5, 11-8, 3-11, 11-7 in a 46-minute game at the Solihull Arden Club in Birmingham.
“Alhamdulillah, after a 20-year gap, I have qualified for the Main Round of the British Open. I am the first Pakistani to achieve this milestone,” Zaman said in a post on X.
 






“Zaman found his range at the front and back of the court early in the fixture and looked focused as he took a commanding 2-0 lead,” according to a press release by the British Open.
“The Egyptian responded by taking the third game 11-3, firing the ball in short and capitalising on Zaman errors. In a competitive fourth, there was noting to separate the two as the score reached 5-5, Zaman established a two-point lead to pull ahead and secured the game 11-7 to win in 46 minutes.”
The main draw begins on May 31, and Zaman will face England’s Curtis Malik on June 1. The other men to qualify during Thursday’s matches were Emyr Evans of Wales, Moustafa Elsirty of Egypt, and South Africa’s Dewald van Niekerk.
The Diamond level event carries a prize draw of $348,500	each for the men and women’s categories.
As of May 1, Zaman is ranked number three in Pakistan in the men’s senior rankings.</p><small>2025-05-30 09:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3013581228ede2e.jpg?r=135821' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914283/us-treasury-secretary-says-trade-talks-with-china-stalled' target='_blank'><strong>US treasury secretary says trade talks with China ‘stalled’</strong></a><br><p>US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Thursday that trade negotiations with China were “a bit stalled” and suggested President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping could get involved.
“I would say that they are a bit stalled,” Bessent told broadcaster Fox News when asked about trade talks with Beijing.
“I believe that we will be having more talks with them in the next few weeks, and I believe we may, at some point, have a call between the president and party chair Xi,” he said.
The world’s two biggest economies agreed this month to pause reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, a surprise de-escalation in their bitter trade war following talks between top officials in Geneva.
Under the May 12 truce, Washington agreed to temporarily reduce the tariff on Chinese imports to 30 per cent from 145pc, while China said it would lower its import duty on American goods to 10pc from 125pc.
“I think that given the magnitude of the talks, given the complexity, that this is going to require both leaders to weigh in with each other,” Bessent said.
“They have a very good relationship, and I am confident that the Chinese will come to the table when President Trump makes his preferences known.”
Asked about the comments at a regular news conference on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Beijing had “stated its position on the tariffs issue many times”.
China has blasted Trump’s tariffs and sought to cast itself as the defender of the multilateral order in light of the US president’s sweeping levies that have upended international commerce.
“On specifics, I suggest you refer to competent authorities,” Lin said.</p><small>2025-05-30 09:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/301313513891254.png?r=131408' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914278/half-the-world-faced-an-extra-month-of-extreme-heat-due-to-climate-change-study' target='_blank'><strong>Half the world faced an extra month of extreme heat due to climate change: study</strong></a><br><p>Half the global population endured an additional month of extreme heat over the past year because of manmade climate change, a new study found on Friday.
The findings underscore how the continued burning of fossil fuels is harming health and well-being on every continent, with the effects especially under-recognised in developing countries, the authors said.
“With every barrel of oil burned, every tonne of carbon dioxide released, and every fraction of a degree of warming, heat waves will affect more people,” said Friederike Otto, a climate scientist at Imperial College London and co-author of the report.
The analysis — conducted by scientists at World Weather Attribution, Climate Central, and the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre — was released ahead of global Heat Action Day on June 2, which this year spotlights the dangers of heat exhaustion and heat stroke.
To assess the influence of global warming, researchers analysed the period from May 1, 2024 to May 1, 2025.
They defined “extreme heat days” as those hotter than 90 per cent of temperatures recorded at a given location between 1991 and 2020.
 
 

Using a peer-reviewed modelling approach, they then compared the number of such days to a simulated world without human-caused warming.
The results were stark: roughly four billion people — 49pc of the global population — experienced at least 30 more days of extreme heat than they would have otherwise.
The team identified 67 extreme heat events during the year and found the fingerprint of climate change on all of them.
The Caribbean island of Aruba was the worst affected, recording 187 extreme heat days — 45 more than expected in a world without climate change.
 
 

The study follows a year of unprecedented global temperatures. 2024 was the hottest year on record, surpassing 2023, while January 2025 marked the hottest January ever.
On a five-year average, global temperatures are now 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels — and in 2024 alone, they exceeded 1.5C, the symbolic ceiling set by the Paris climate accord.
The report also highlights a critical lack of data on heat-related health impacts in lower-income regions.
While Europe recorded more than 61,000 heat-related deaths in the summer of 2022, comparable figures are sparse elsewhere, with many heat-related fatalities misattributed to underlying conditions such as heart or lung disease.
The authors emphasised the need for early warning systems, public education, and heat action plans tailored to cities.
Better building design — including shading and ventilation — and behavioural adjustments like avoiding strenuous activity during peak heat are also essential.

What was once a vibrant, tightly knit area where neighbours knew each other by name and children played freely in open streets, now feels suffocated.
“Water barely reaches our taps, and the streets that once bustled with life are too cramped to even walk properly,” he shared. Over the last two decades, rapid urban densification has quietly chipped away at the liveability of many such neighbourhoods of the port city, forcing families like Arif’s to consider relocating in search of the basics: clean water, reliable electricity, and access to open spaces and parks.
As Karachi’s population grows, so does the pressure on those already struggling to find a place within it. With no coherent policy or planning framework in place, the city’s increasing demand for affordable housing — especially among low- and middle-income groups — is colliding with a harsh urban reality. An overwhelming 68 per cent of Karachi’s population falls into the low-income bracket, with another 22pc in the middle-income tier, yet rising property prices are pushing these groups into increasingly cramped and compromised living conditions.
 

Narrow alleyways reveal the spatial constraints of housing densification in tightly packed urban neighbourhoods

Unsustainable reality
Discussions with real estate agents, builders, and local residents — conducted as part of a research project at NED University — have uncovered the complex web of interactions driving housing trends in Karachi’s lower-middle-income areas. The study explores the mechanisms of urban densification and its impact on low-income communities, focusing on areas such as Delhi Colony, Punjab Colony, Paposh Nagar, Lyari, Paharganj, and Taiser Town.
According to the latest census, the average household size in Pakistan stands at 6.4 members, and 55pc of households are multi-generational, per a 2019 United Nations (UN) report. While the joint family system remains the cultural norm, urban centres have seen a shift toward nuclear living arrangements. However, among middle- to low-income groups, this trend is reversing — families that once lived separately are now merging back into joint households, as children or younger siblings get married but cannot afford independent housing due to financial constraints and rising property prices.
To cope with the growing demand for space, families in urban neighbourhoods are adding floors or extending their homes — often informally and without regulatory oversight. These unplanned expansions may be a practical response to pressing needs, but they also contribute to overcrowding, overstretched resources, and a steady decline in living conditions.
This brings us to critical questions: What housing options are truly available to these families and what quality of life do they offer? Are residents simply adapting to an unsustainable reality, or is there still a path forward — one that leads to more inclusive and well-planned housing solutions?
Our research has revealed various forms of rising densification, particularly in older neighbourhoods near economic hubs. Plot sizes in these areas typically range from 40 to 133 square yards, with some larger plots of 240 and 400 sq-yds. As space tightens and families grow, residents are finding creative yet often improvised ways to meet their housing needs. The study identified several common strategies:


Adding lightweight floors to existing structures to make room for expanding households.


Financing these expansions through personal savings or loans,
especially among families unable to afford relocation.


Selling plots to builders — often as a way to resolve inheritance disputes — who then construct multi-storey buildings and sell off individual floors to nuclear families.


Subdividing plots among family members. For example, in Delhi Colony, plots originally measuring 120 sq-yd were subdivided into 40 sq-yd sections, later developed into multi-storey units with narrow staircases and compact bathrooms.


 

Layout of compact subdivided plots

The economic and structural toll
The pursuit of affordable housing in Karachi is riddled with soaring property prices, shrinking living spaces, poor construction quality, and widespread bribes to authorities for infrastructure access and unauthorised additions.
At the same time, despite the clear strain on infrastructure, utility connections, whether for electricity, gas, or water, are extended without penalty. Authorities base approvals on the covered area of a plot rather than the number of housing units, allowing builders to add floors with minimal scrutiny. When additional units are built, monthly charges may increase according to informal rules, but no official objections are raised.
In a city where owning a home is deeply tied to dignity, security, and social identity, the desperation to secure housing has reached critical levels. Overcrowded living conditions, poor construction, and lack of oversight have made urban poverty not just visible but normalised.
Numerous incidents of collapsing walls, roofs, and entire buildings have also been reported in some settlements. In September 2024, the wall of an adjacent building collapsed onto the temporary roof of a neighbouring plot in Paposh Nagar, killing one person. In another case from August 2024, the roof of a 60-square-yard plot in Lyari collapsed after heavy rain, resulting in two deaths and five injuries.
Risk of poor construction practices
In most cases, the responsibility for reconstruction or additional construction falls to the builder, contractor, or local mason. Focus group discussions with local communities highlighted that prospective property owners often lack awareness of structural safety, with many expressing sentiments like, “It’s good as long as it’s standing” or “…at least it’s our shelter.”  These statements reflect desperation, naivety, limited choices, and a willingness to compromise safety for the sake of having a home.
For low-income families, owning a house carries immense value — not just as shelter, but as a form of economic security, often used as collateral to navigate financial and social instability. Yet, the focus on immediate need frequently overshadows critical concerns like structural integrity and long-term safety. This trade-off is deeply concerning.
Contractors and masons, aware of the owners’ limited knowledge and tight budgets, often exploit this gap, cutting corners for profit. Regulators typically intervene only when buildings become visibly oversized, by which time much of the construction (rushed and without proper curing) has already compromised safety. In pursuit of quick solutions and short-term gains, lives are being put at risk — a price far too high for a home meant to provide protection.
While financial constraints may lead residents to overlook safety, the ultimate responsibility for enforcing structural standards rests with regulatory bodies. However, weak enforcement, irregular inspections, and gaps in monitoring have allowed unsafe construction practices to become common.
 

Poor construction

Arif Patel, Chairman of the All Nazimabad Builders and Developers Association, stated that the association has a clear policy — any building with three or more floors, approved by the SCBA, must undergo regular inspections and comply with all safety regulations. On paper, the responsibility is acknowledged. However, he admitted that in practice, these inspections are often poorly conducted, and construction quality frequently falls short of required standards.
Structural instability is one of the most primary concerns in poorly constructed buildings. Walking through these neighbourhoods, one can often observe buildings swaying vertically, indicating misalignment or structural tilt. Upon closer inspection, the flaws become even more alarming: reinforcement appears minimal, with low-grade steel bars used sparingly, and horizontal ties either inadequate or entirely missing. Concrete blocks and plaster contain a higher proportion of sand than certified, and the concrete is inadequately watered and cured, compromising its binding strength.
Although many of these structures begin as low-rise buildings, additional storeys are often added without reinforcing the foundation, risking long-term stability. Residents reported that new constructions, often completed in haste, show significant water leakage during rains — a result of poor materials, inadequate insulation, and flawed plumbing. “This and poor insulation are the second most pressing issues faced by these buildings,” said Arif Hasan, architect, urban planner and an advisor to this research.
Final-year architecture students from NED University, while documenting Delhi Colony, came across a collapsed corner building. Upon further investigation, they learned that many adjacent buildings in the area share structural loads with neighbouring aligned structures, often causing them to tilt. In this particular case, the corner building had borne the combined load of multiple structures and had collapsed more than once. The area’s construction is critically unstable, and much of it is at risk of collapsing in a domino effect during a natural disaster, such as an earthquake.
In contrast, recent commercial buildings in these areas tend to have better construction quality, driven by higher rental and ownership prices.
Both Delhi Colony and Paposh Nagar were originally planned as settlements but have since undergone informal developments, leading to narrower streets, increased building densities and heights, above-ground extensions, and a decline in housing quality. As the floors rise, the building’s structural stability becomes a concern. With each added floor, walls and roofs tend to become thinner, compromising insulation. While taller buildings receive ample breeze, they may be structurally unsafe and accessible only via long, narrow staircases, making them inconvenient.
 

Compromised construction quality

Increased density and infrastructure strain
On a 40 or 60 sq-yd plot, initially intended to house a single family of six, there are now often four or more families living in vertically expanded buildings. This dramatic increase in occupancy places strain on essential services such as water, gas, and electricity, often multiplying the original requirements fourfold and extending the pressure to surrounding areas as the trend spreads.
In many cities around the world, property and infrastructure taxes are calculated based on the number of families occupying a property. However, in these densely populated residential neighbourhoods, the lack of such regulation is creating serious challenges in maintaining consistent access to basic services, compounding the daily struggles of residents.
Access to water is often constrained, with the availability of safe drinking water emerging as the most urgent concern among broader infrastructural challenges. As new buildings rise and permissions are obtained from the SBCA, additional floors are often approved following the payment of penalties. However, what the SBCA overlooks in this changing morphology is the increasing number of families and individuals residing on the same plot. Despite these approvals, the capacity of utility services — particularly water and sewerage pipelines — remain unchanged, resulting in mounting pressure on already overstretched systems.
The deterioration of our built environment — seen in both crumbling buildings and failing infrastructure — is not a coincidence but a consequence. Limited housing options, inadequate financial support for low-income populations, neglect in urban planning, and the unchecked pursuit of profit have all converged to erode the quality of life in underserved neighbourhoods. Without intentional reform and inclusive planning, these communities will continue to bear the cost of a system that has long ignored their needs.

The bill, which seeks to protect the rights of children and eventually eradicate marriages of children under the age of 18, reached the presidency on May 27 after sailing through both houses of parliament.
However, the move attracted strong opposition from religious segments of society, with the CII ruling that classifying marriage under the age of 18 as rape did not conform with Islamic law.
 
 

“The Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Bill, 2025 is assented to, as passed by the Parliament,” the notification read.
“Pakistan has reached a milestone in the enactment of important legislation against child marriages,” Rehman said in a statement.
She said that the approval of the bill was successful despite resistance from various sections, adding that President Zardari signed the bill despite pressure.
“The signing of the Child Marriage Restraint Bill is a symbol of a new era of reforms in Pakistan,” she said.
She hailed the approval as a victory for the protection of the rights of women and children, adding, “This law was possible after a long and difficult struggle.”
“This bill is not just a law, it is a commitment that our girls have the right to education, health and a prosperous life,” Rehman continued.
She thanked PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, party leaders, other political parties, representatives of the opposition and the public for their support for the bill.
She also called on other provinces to take steps towards this important legislation.
Earlier, CII member Maulana Jalaludin, who belongs to the JUI-F, said Presi­dent Zardari should prevent anarchy in society and not sign the bill.
Incidentally, members bel­ong­ing to different sects opposed the bill.
Responding to a query, the CII member had said the assembly could not be above the Holy Quran and Sunnah. “This bill is not only against the norms of Sharia but also contrary to the values of our society and our traditions,” Maulana Jalaluddin reasoned, terming the move a western conspiracy to destroy ‘family system’.
The ‘bad intentions’ were evident as the bill was not forwarded to the CII, but approved by parliament ‘in secrecy’, he said.
However, PPP MNA Sharmila Faruqi, who tabled the bill in the National Assembly, said the matter of marriage of girls below 18 years of age, should not be given a religious colour and instead be considered in the context of human rights.
“We are not against marriages. We say marrying girls as young as 13 or 14 years is unfair when girls under 18 years of age do not have right to vote, cannot obtain national identity cards and driving licence,” she added.
In this regard, the PPP lawmaker referred to a decision by Federal Shariat Court of 2022 that allowed the state to set the marriage age.</p><small>2025-05-30 07:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606896-pakistan-wont-allow-india-to-cross-iwt-red-line-says-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan won't allow India to cross IWT red line, says PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan during the past year or so have experienced an alarming decline in their T20 International contests, winning only nine while losing nineteen. Currently languishing at eighth in the ICC T20 International team rankings, the Green-shirts under new captain Salman Ali Agha no doubt will seek to make progress against Bangladesh who are ninth.
 


The home side in the series opener on Wednesday comfortably defeated Bangladesh by 37 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium thanks to impressive batting by Salman (56), Shadab Khan (48, 4-26) and Hasan Nawaz (44). Returning fast bowler Hasan Ali (5-30) produced his best-ever show in the game.
Pakistan are expected to remain unchanged for the second T20 while Bangladesh are most likely to make a couple of changes as they will look to keep the series alive.
Both teams did not practise on Thursday, as they preferred to rest.
Talking to media after Pakistan won the series opener on Wednesday, Hasan Ali attributed his impressive comeback to the national team to the medical team which worked tirelessly with the pacer during the rehab at the National Cricket Academy (NCA).
“When I bowled the first ball [in the first T20], everything went normal. It was not easy to come back and produce such a good performance; I will dedicate it to my wife, my two children, who remained with me during this tough time. Moreover, my medical team which worked at the NCA for my rehab including Dr Iftikhar and  Saboor, all deserved appreciation,” the right-arm pacer said.
Answering a question, Hasan expressed his desire to play in the next World Cup.
“I really want to play the next World Cup; but let us see in between different series, [plus] I have to play in the Blast cricket. If I continue with good performance and my team needs me I will love to play the World Cup,” Hasan said.
He said the main reason behind the victory against Bangladesh was that the players executed the plan perfectly.
“A new set-up is working with the new captain [Salman Ali Agha] and head coach [Mike Hesson] and our simple plan is to embrace modern-day cricket. We have to play this type of game if we want to win against big teams. Now 200 is a par total [in T20 Internationals],” he underscored.
“Yes there is a point discussed to follow a rotation policy for the fast bowlers to keep them fresh. And it is possible when your bench strength is strong,” Hasan said.
Meanwhile, Bangladesh team’s bowling consultant Mushtaq Ahmed while applauding Pakistan’s performance said the visitors had the potential to make a comeback in the series.
“Credit goes to the Pakistan team who produced a fine performance. Their intent was very good. We should learn from our mistakes and we have the potential to come back very hard,” former Pakistan leg-spinner Mushtaq said.
He specially praised the batting of Salman, saying the Pakistan skipper played some delightful shots.
“In any type of cricket, if any batsman plays [proper] cricketing shots he gets good results,” he said.
On Shadab and Rishad Hossain, Mushtaq said, “Shadab Khan is a very much experienced bowler whereas Rishad Hossain is passing through a learning stage; he is a match winner and has a great future for Bangladesh.”
According to Mushtaq, Najamul Hossain Shanto was not selected for the first T20 as the team management looked to test the bench strength.
“As Jaker Ali and Towhid Hridoy are also very good batters and at No.6 Shamim Hossain is also a nice choice, we are testing different combinations. Shanto will also get a chance,” he said.
In Wednesday’s match, Mushtaq highlighted, there was good support for the Bangladesh too in the crowd.
“Bangladeshis respect and love great Pakistan cricketers. There are [ongoing] discussions between the two cricket boards to exchange youth teams to improve cricket,” he said.

“Inflation is projected to remain between 1.5-2.0 per cent in May, with a possible rise to 3.0-4.0pc by June”, significantly higher than a record low of 0.3pc in April, the MoF said in its Monthly Economic Update and Outlook for May.
It stated that the LSM activity remained sluggish so far, but its outlook may improve gradually in the coming months, with recovery expected to be gradual amid continued year-over-year (YoY) contraction and a recent month-over-month (MoM) decline. Nonetheless, improvements in high-frequency indicators — such as rising automobile output, raw material imports, and a more accommodative monetary stance — indicate cautious optimism, it said.
The MoF said the improved weather conditions and increased water availability were likely to support higher crop yields and better farming conditions, contributing to overall economic growth. Exports and remittances are expected to maintain their upward trend in the coming months, keeping the current account within a manageable range.

Govt expects gradual recovery in big industry production

It stated that Pakistan’s rating upgrade by Fitch Ratings was an acknowledgment of macroeconomic stabilisation in the outgoing fiscal year, supported by improved fiscal performance, a current account surplus, and easing inflation.
Revenue growth outpaced expenditure, reducing the fiscal deficit and further strengthening the primary surplus. The current account posted a $1.9 billion surplus, with a robust growth in exports and remittances. Inflation declined to a record low, paving the way for a more accommodative monetary policy stance. Climate finance initiatives, including the Resilient and Sustainable Facility from the IMF and the launching of the Green Sukuk, reinforced the path toward inclusive and sustainable growth.
It said the fiscal indicators demonstrated enhanced management discipline. During July-March FY25, total revenue grew by 36.7pc to Rs13.367tr, compared to Rs9.78tr last year, led by a 68pc rise in non-tax revenues which reached Rs4.23tr, mainly driven by SBP profits, petroleum levy, dividends, and surcharges.The Federal Board of Revenue collection, on the other hand, increased by just 26.3pc to Rs9.3tr during July-April FY25, up from Rs7.362tr last year, but significantly lower than budgeted target.
Total expenditures rose by 19.4pc to Rs16.34tr, with current spending increasing by 18.3pc and development expenditures by 32.6pc.
As a result, the fiscal deficit declined to 2.6pc of GDP (from 3.7pc) while the primary surplus improved to Rs3.469tr (3pc of GDP) from Rs1.615tr (1.5pc) last year.

At a meeting held at the CM House on Thursday, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and Federal Maritime Affairs Minister Junaid Anwar agreed to collaborate on a series of ambitious projects, including the Karachi Coastal Comprehensive Development Zone (KCCDZ).
The KCCDZ, initiated by the maritime ministry in 2021 and included in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, is expected to generate significant employment opportunities, with the feasibility study already complete and implementation planned in three phases across 687 acres.
According to a press statement issued from the CM house, the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) briefed the chief minister on the KCCDZ project, a joint initiative with the federal government through an existing Memorandum of Understanding.

This project, estimated at $3.1bn, aims to reclaim land near Machar Colony for developments, including a business bay, high-tech knowledge park, new industry city, cruise terminal, and a desalination plant. The CM said that the proposed project would not affect any human settlement in the area.
A committee, including the Sindh Planning and Development Minister Syed Nasir Shah, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, and Commissioner Hasan Naqvi, will address land-related issues between the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and the Sindh government. The federal maritime ministry will soon appoint its representatives to the committee.
The meeting included provincial ministers Sharjeel Memon, Nasir Shah, Muhammad Ali Malkani, Environment Advisor Dost Muhammad Rahimoon, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Asif Haider Shah, Principal Secretary Agha Wasif, P&D Chairman Najm Shah, Livestock Secretary Kazim Jatoi, Environment Secretary Agha Shahnawaz and others.
On the federal side, Parliamentary Secretary for Maritime Affairs Dr Darshan Punshi, Director General Ports & Shipping Alia Shahid, Secretary Board of Investment Dr Arif Iqbal, Chairman Port Qasim Authority Rear Admiral (R) Moazzam Ilyas, General Manager KPT Atiq Rahman and other officials were present.
At the outset of the meeting, the chief minister affirmed Sindh’s commitment to collaborate with the maritime ministry on all upcoming projects, emphasising the need for joint efforts to drive the province’s development.
Sewerage system
Recognising the dire need to prevent untreated wastewater from polluting the sea, the chief minister underscored the importance of rapidly installing sewage treatment plants throughout Karachi.
He extended a standing offer to collaborate on every project with the federal ministry, ensuring synergy and maximising benefits for the people of the province.
The federal maritime affairs minister expressed his confidence that projects undertaken in partnership with the Sindh government would deliver substantial benefits to the province and its residents.
Both the federal and provincial governments concurred on the critical importance of working together to promote sustainable coastal development in Karachi.

The chief minister said that the provincial government was actively installing treatment plant-3 (TP-3) in collaboration with CRBC, alongside plans to establish a desalination plant with a capacity of 50,000 gallons of water daily.
He said that the broader Greater Karachi Sewerage Plan (STP-III) was being expedited to tackle the issue of untreated sewage flowing into the sea via the Lyari and Malir rivers. “Upgrades to treatment plants TP-1 and TP-2 will increase their capacity to 100 MGD and 180 MGD, respectively, while a new treatment plant (TP-4) with a 180 MGD capacity will be constructed in Korangi, specifically treating water from the Malir river basin,” he added.
An eco-tourism project was also discussed to launch, offering boat tours through Karachi’s mangrove areas.
Truck stand
The meeting was told that relocating the truck stand from the city had been assigned to the committee of the Advocate General of Sindh and the Commissioner of Karachi. The KPT representatives would also be in the committee, and they would jointly propose the location for shifting the truck stand and then get approval from the chief minister.

It is located in the Milky Way galaxy about 15,000 light-years from Earth in the direction of the constellation Scutum, flashing every 44 minutes in both radio waves and X-ray emissions. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).
The researchers said it belongs to a class of objects called “long-period radio transients,” known for bright bursts of radio waves that appear every few minutes to several hours. This is much longer than the rapid pulses in radio waves typically detected from pulsars — a type of speedily rotating neutron star, the dense collapsed core of a massive star after its death.
Pulsars appear, as viewed from Earth, to be blinking on and off on timescales of milliseconds to seconds. “What these objects are and how they generate their unusual signals remain a mystery,” said astronomer Ziteng Wang of Curtin University in Australia, lead author of the study published this week in the journal Nature.
In the new study, the researchers used data from Nasa’s orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, the ASKAP telescope in Australia and other telescopes. While the emission of radio waves from the newly identified object is similar to the approximately 10 other known examples of this class, it is the only one sending out X-rays, according to astrophysicist and study co-author Nanda Rea of the Institute of Space Sciences in Barcelona.
The researchers have some hypotheses about the nature of this star. They said it may be a magnetar, a spinning neutron star with an extreme magnetic field, or perhaps a white dwarf, a highly compact stellar ember, with a close and quick orbit around a small companion star in what is called a binary system.
“However, neither of them could explain all observational features we saw,” Wang said. Stars with up to eight times the mass of our sun appear destined to end up as a white dwarf. They eventually burn up all the hydrogen they use as fuel. Gravity then causes them to collapse and blow off their outer layers in a  “red giant” stage, eventually leaving behind a compact core roughly the diameter of Earth — the white dwarf.
The observed radio waves potentially could have been generated by the interaction between the white dwarf and the hypothesised companion star, the researchers said.
“The radio brightness of the object varies a lot. We saw no radio emission from the object before November 2023. And in February 2024, we saw it became extremely bright. Fewer than 30 objects in the sky have ever reached such brightness in radio waves. Remarkably, at the same time, we also detected X-ray pulses from the object. We can still detect it in radio, but much fainter,” Wang said. Wang said it is thrilling to see a new type of behavior for stars.
“The X-ray detection came from Nasa’s Chandra space telescope. That part was a lucky break. The telescope was actually pointing at something else, but just happened to catch the source during its ‘crazy’ bright phase.

The committee chair­m­­an, MNA Pullain Ba­­loch, also issued similar directives to Radio Pak­istan and the Shalimar Broad­casting Company, a public limited organisation that operates A-TV channel and FM Radio 94.
The committee was informed that PTV generated an advertising revenue of Rs7.5 billion, surpassing the target of Rs6.19bn in the last financial year.
The target for the current year was likely to be achieved.
The committee was also told the PTV was facing financial constraints as a major chunk of Rs10bn collected as TV fee in electricity bills is spent on salaries and pensions.
Regarding the delay in payment of salaries, the PTV officials told the committee that funds were diverted to pay international financial obligations and acquisition of international media rights.
It resulted in temporary financial constraints, the officials claimed.
The PTV management also presented details of employees who were appointed due to political affiliation and subsequently laid off during the ongoing restructuring.
While taking notice of delay in allotment of plots to journalists in sectors F-14 and F-15 and Barha Kahu in Islamabad, the committee directed the information ministry to scrutinise the applications and redress the grievances of aspirants within the next two months.
The committee members said journalists were facing multitude of issues due to this inordinate delay on the part of the ministry.
The meeting also reviewed the report of a subcommittee chaired by MNA Mahtab Akbar Rashdi on the Pemra (Amendment) Bill, 2025, moved by Asia Naz Tanoli.
The committee direc­ted Pemra to give its views on the subcommittee’s recommendations.
The convener and the mover of the bill separately briefed the committee on the report.

• Finance secretary says legal framework will only be introduced if govt legalises crypto
• Pakistan unveils first govt-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
ISLAMABAD: Amid growing official promotion of Bitcoin adoption, both the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Ministry of Finance (MoF) on Thursday said that cryptocurrency remains banned in the country and all its transactions are illegal under current regulations.
During a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said that although the prime minister had recently formed a Crypto Council — chaired by the finance minister — through an executive order to explore digital asset policy, a cryptocurrency ban is intact under SBP and SECP regulations.
“There will be a legal framework only when the government formally takes a decision, but the current legal status is that crypto is not a legal tender in Pakistan,” Mr Bosal said, conceding that no parliamentary backing exists for cryptocurrency use.
 
 

Mr Bosal also reconfirmed later to journalists that the federal budget would be announced on June 10 and discussions with the International Monetary Fund were ongoing virtually on budget estimates and proposed measures. He said the Asian Development Bank was expected to approve an $800 million loan to Pakistan on June 3.
Committee members expre­ssed confusion over the government’s approach. Mirza Ikhtiar Baig questioned why the public was being encouraged to invest in crypto when it remained legally banned, warning that investors could face serious consequences.
Mohammad Mobeen wondered why the government was dealing with the subject of Bitcoins and cryptocurrency instead of the SBP. He stressed that while the government was calling crypto illegal, it had simultaneously allocated power capacity for mining operations.
Further highlighting the policy inconsistency, he pointed out that Bilal Bin Saqib, CEO of the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC), had been holding meetings with high-profile global leaders.
Shahram Tarakai said the country’s foreign exchange would flow out of the country very soon through cryptos and the government would then be in a fix.
Other members raised questions about whether the crypto mining would be in government or private sector hands, and noted that illegal hawala channels would likely be replaced by unregulated digital transfers.
Sohail Jawad, an executive director of the SBP, said the central bank had issued a directive in 2024, declaring the legal status of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies illegal, and that stance was still intact.
In fact, the Financial Monitoring Unit (FMU) is still referring crypto-related cases to law enforcement agencies for further action, he said.
He said a national working group of digital currency had been established and suggestions had also been given to the Pakistan Crypto Council. He said El Salvador was the only country with legalised cryptocurrency in the world, and even that nation was reconsidering the decision.
The State Bank of Pakistan does not recognise crypto assets, which are digital currencies in which transactions are verified and recorded by a decentralised system. The SBP issued a formal notice in 2022 advising the general public to be cautious of and refrain from trading cryptocurrencies.
Need for regulation
The committee discussion on cryptocurrency was triggered by a bill on digital currency regulations proposed by MNA Sharmila Farooqi. She argued that Pakistan needed to regulate crypto to prevent money laundering, especially after its exit from the Financial Action Task Force’s grey list.
The Pakistan Crypto Council was officially launched in March this year to “regulate and integrate blockchain technology and digital assets” into the country’s financial landscape.
Strategic Bitcoin Reserve
The debate coincided with the unveiling of the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve by Pakistan Crypto Council CEO Bilal Bin Saqib, the newly promoted special assistant to the prime minister on crypto and blockchain.
An official statement released by the Ministry of Finance said the unveiling was held at Las Vegas, United States, at an event for an elite audience that included US Vice President J.D. Vance, and the sons of US President Donald Trump — Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr.
“This wasn’t just a policy moment — it was a rebranding of a nation,” the statement said, adding that Mr Saqib conveyed a bold message that Pakistan was no longer defined by its past.
Speaking at the event, Mr Saqib said Pakistan is “being reborn as a forward-looking hub of digital innovation — powered by its youth, sharpened by necessity, and led by a new generation of tech statesmen.”
He added, “I’m not just here as a minister. I’m here as the voice of a generation — a generation that is online, on-chain, and unstoppable.”
A statement issued by Mr Saqib’s office said that while “other leaders talk about potential, Bilal is unlocking it — with bold national moves that put Pakistan at the centre of the global crypto conversation”.
He also announced the establishment of a national Bitcoin wallet, holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance.
He also thanked President Trump for his role as a peacemaker in the recent India-Pakistan conflict and for his commitment to crypto adoption.

Earlier this week, Aleema Khan, sister of the former prime minister, proposed a ‘give-and-take formula’ for the release of her brother, alleging that “unseen forces” were pressuring judges and inf­luencing legal proceedings against Mr Khan.
“I want to tell the unseen forces that I am ready to negotiate,” she said.
On Thursday, however, PTI leader Ali Zafar told media persons after the hearing of a May 9 case in Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail that the incarcerated PTI chief said that he would never go for the “give and take formula”.

Fawad Chaudhry meets ex-PM, advises him to ‘simultaneously’ talk to govt as well as establishment

“Khan sahab said that he was willing to talk, but only in the best interest of the country and would not demand any gain or relaxation for himself,” he said.
According to Barrister Zafar, the former premier said if he wanted a favour for himself, he would have gotten it a long time ago.
The PTI lawyer said that Imran Khan was willing to talk to the esta­blishment but only for the country.
Political space
Fawad Chaudhry, who also met Mr Khan on Thursday, told Dawn that during the conversation with the former prime minister, he realised that the ex-PM was not getting “proper and correct” information.
 
 

“It seems that everyone, who manages to meet Khan sahab, tries to get someone appointed or spends time making efforts to get someone removed from the party. I told Khan sahab that there should be some strategy to deal with the situation,” he said.
Mr Chaudhry said that he told Imran Khan that currently the PTI was fighting with the establishment, the government and even with the opposition.
“I also informed (him) that the (PTI) leadership, which is out of jail, is a newcomer, as a majority of them joined the party a few years ago and they are not even aware of the situation,” he said.
The former information minister said he told the ex-premier that it would be undemocratic to stress that the PTI would only talk to the establishment, not with the political parties.
“I suggested that, first of all, we should talk to the opposition to form a joint political alliance and then start talks with the government. I said that we need to talk with the government and the establishment simultaneously because only that is how we can create political space for the PTI,” he said.

During the session, chaired by Junaid Akbar Khan, the PAC also established a new subcommittee to address the matter further. Muneeb Amir Pirzada was appointed as its convener, with Nadeem Abbas, Khawaja Shiraz and Saleem Mandviwalla named as members.
Audit officials highli­g­hted that the Pakistan Post Office Department ope­ned multiple accounts in the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) without pr­o­per aut­h­orisation. While the Fina­nce Divi­sion had approved the opening of three accounts, the Post Office opened two additional ones without approval.
“Despite the audit obje­ctions, no departmental action has been taken so far,” audit officials stated. Communi­cations Secretary Ali Sher Mehsud acknowledged that the Pakistan Post Office was facing significant operational challenges.
However, the committee chair expressed frustration over the lack of coordination between the Finance Division and the department.
“The Finance Division says it never received the request, while the secretary claims it was sent. Where is the disconnect?” asked Mr Akbar.
 
 

The committee has also officially sought a response from the Ministry of Finance.
The session also addressed allegations of illegal hiring within the Post Office.
Audit officials reported that advertisements were issued for 4,252 positions, despite only 3,938 being officially sanctioned.
“Most of the documents submitted by the hired individuals are fake. Jobs were sold, and you’re saying there’s a stay order?” remarked an outraged Mr Akbar.
Senator Afnanullah Khan added, “Those who accepted bribes and those who offered them are both at fault. Legal action should be taken against both.”
The PAC decided to refer the matter to the NAB for investigation.
Misuse of over Rs4bn funds
The committee also took up audit objections concerning the unauthorised use of over Rs4 billion in funds by Pakistan Post.
The committee members questioned how utility bill payments collected from citizens were misappropriated.
“These were public funds submitted by people paying their electricity bills. How can you justify using them for other purposes?” questioned the chairman.
Calling the act akin to “robbery”, PAC members demanded accountability. Khawaja Shiraz Mehmood asked what disciplinary measures had been taken against those responsible.
In response, the communications secretary claimed that internal disciplinary steps had been initiated and emphasised the need for financial reconciliation with the National Bank.
The PAC has summoned officials from the NBP to the next session for further clarification on the matter.

TAJIK President Emomali Rahmon welcomes Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif at the Palace of the Nation, on Thursday.—APP

DUSHANBE: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Tajikistan’s President Emomali Rahmon on Thursday reviewed bilateral cooperation in different areas, including political, trade, economy, energy, defence, security, and regional connectivity.
During the meeting, they agreed to pursue new avenues for cooperation with a focus on fostering investment opportunities, enhancing educational lin­kages, prompting cultural exchanges, advancing inf­o­rmation technology collaboration and strengthening people-to-people contacts.
Earlier upon his arrival at the Palace of the Nation, the Tajik leader welcomed the premier and his delegation.
PM Shehbaz arrived in Dushanbe at the invitation of government of Taji­kistan to participate in the International High-Level Conference on Glaciers Preservation (ICGP) being held on 29-31 May.
He is accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Special Assistant to PM Syed Tariq Fatemi, and senior officials.
Upon arrival at Dush­anbe, the premier was received by his Tajik counterpart Qohir Rasulzoda.
PM Shehbaz Sharif and President Rahmon while holding in-depth and wide-ranging discussions recalled the signing of the historic Strategic Partnership Agreement during the prime minister’s visit to Dushanbe in July 2024, which laid a strong foundation for strengthening bilateral relations and advancing shared interests.
On CASA-1000, the two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to positioning it as a pivotal project for regional integration. Wel­coming the holding of CASA-1000 Inter-Governmental Coun­cil in Dushanbe on May 15, the PM spoke of the shared commitment to its early operationalisation.
Regarding economic cooperation, the two leaders, while ack­nowledging the untapped potential in bilateral trade, underscored the importance of actively pursuing new avenues of cooperation in line with the decisions taken during the 7th session of Pakistan-Tajikistan Joint Com­mission on Trade, Economic and Scientific Technical Cooperation, held in Islamabad in December.
They agreed to effectively leverage the existing institutional frameworks including 12 Joint Working Groups (JWGs) to enhance collaboration, especial­­ly in oil and gas and energy sectors.
They took note of growing bilateral cooperation in the field of defence and security and reiterated their resolve to boost the same to overcome the common security challenges. They emphasised the need to enhance cooperation in counterterrorism, combating cross-border organised crime and human and drug trafficking.
The two leaders expressed satisfaction on cooperation at the multilateral fora, including at the UN, OIC, SCO and ECO.
PM Shehbaz reiterated
Pakis­tan’s commitment to strengthening connectivity linkages with Central Asia and highlighted China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as a linchpin of Pakistan’s connectivity with the region.
‘Unlawful actions’
He briefed President Rahmon on the latest situation in South Asia. He said the region could not afford India’s irresponsible and unlawful actions since May 7, which amounted to acts of war and violation of the UN Charter and international law.
He also underscored that the resolution of Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the Security Council resolutions, remains fundamental to securing lasting peace.
President Rahmon said that as a staunch friend of Pakistan, he too was very worried at the events of early May, adding that he would always promote peace and stability in the region. He added he was impressed by the prime minister’s remarkable leadership that was critical to the restoration of peace and security in the region.
President Rahmon reaffirmed Tajikistan’s desire for intensifying cooperation in all fields, terming Pakistan as a trusted partner. He underlined the im­portance of closer collaboration in the areas of science and technology, agriculture, industry, hyd­­­ropower generation, and tourism.
The PM extended invitation to President Rahmon for an official visit to Islamabad. President Rahmon also hosted a special reception in honour of Prime Minister Shehbaz.
Azeri investment
Earlier, the PM said Pakistan was ready to receive $2 billion investment from Azerbaijan in multiple sectors.
The prime minister, while talking to Azerbaijan TV prior to his departure from Lachin to Dushanbe, said: “Yesterday, [Azerbaijan’s] President Ilham Aliyev again reiterated his commitment to invest $2 billion in Pakistan. We are ready for this investment for mutual benefits,” he said.

“Global Assessment Report on Disaster Risk Reduction 2025” by the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) finds that while direct disaster costs averaged $70 billion to $80bn a year between 1970 and 2000, these figures surged to $180bn to $200bn annually from 2001 to 2020. The growing economic burden highlights the intensifying impact of disasters worldwide.
The “big five” disasters — earthquakes, floods, storms, droughts and heatwaves — have accounted for over 95pc of direct recorded losses over the past 20 years. In 2023 alone, these hazards caused direct economic losses of more than $195.7bn, or about 0.015pc of global GDP. Extreme heat, once overlooked, is now included among these primary hazards due to its role in fatalities, reduced productivity, and lower well-being.
Pakistan’s 2022 floods, which killed more than 1,700 people and caused $30bn in damages, led to substantial impacts on capital markets and the country’s sovereign credit rating. “As climate change intensifies extreme events, future climate-induced rating downgrades may be more likely,” the report said. This poses a growing concern for economies and investors alike, including pension funds, insurers, and central banks that hold sovereign debt.

Warns risk reduction critically underfunded at 2pc of aid

Between 1970 and 2023, geophysical disasters such as earthquakes caused approximately $1.59tr in economic losses. Another $5.18tr in losses came from 24,433 reports of floods, storms, droughts, and extreme heat, with other disasters contributing an additional $100bn.
Despite the overwhelming evidence, only 2pc of development aid is allocated to disaster risk reduction. “Under-estimating the risk of disasters means under-valuing the benefits of risk reduction,” the report says. As populations and development increasingly concentrate in vulnerable areas, the exposure and vulnerability to hazards grow significantly.
Climate-induced school disruptions are also rising. In 2024, at least 242 million students across 85 countries faced school closures due to climate events. Of these, 74pc were in low- and lower-middle-income nations, exacerbating educational inequalities and long-term impacts.
 
 

From 2000 to 2023, earthquakes, extreme heat, storms, floods, and droughts were responsible for 90pc of disaster deaths — with earthquakes alone accounting for half. Since 1900, 12 earthquakes have killed more than 50,000 people each, five of which occurred after 2000.
Water-related hazards dominated from 1970 to 2019, making up 50pc of all disasters and 45pc of disaster-related deaths. Floods have increased by 134pc since 2000, with Asia recording most of the associated deaths and economic losses. The number of people exposed to floods rose from 28.1 million in 1970 to 35.1m in 2020 — a 24.9pc increase.
Droughts are similarly widespread. Between 2007 and 2017, they affected at least 1.5bn people and caused $125bn in losses. Most drought-related deaths since 2000 have occurred in Africa. As of 2025, over 920m children — more than one-third of the global child population — are highly exposed to water scarcity.
“Agriculture is the most vulnerable sector to climate impacts,” the report notes, with 82pc of all drought-related losses between 2008 and 2018 occurring in agriculture in low- and lower-middle-income countries.
Between 1984 and 2023, regions such as central U.S., Argentina, Turkey, northwest India, Pakistan, the Horn of Africa, Central Asia, and parts of Australia experienced the highest frequency of severe agricultural droughts — around 8 to 12 events over the 40-year span. Much of this variation is linked to El Niño and La Niña cycles.

Chaotic US trade policy has sent global markets on a roller coaster in recent months. Equity markets were rattled by Trump’s April 2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements, which have since been repeatedly delayed and adjusted.
Following a market revolt after the April 2 tariff shock, Trump paused most import duties for 90 days and vowed to hammer out bilateral deals with trade partners.
Markets have swung wildly through Trump’s on-and-off tariff changes. The S&P 500 index is up 4.1% since duties were announced while European stocks have gained 2.0%.
Gold is up 5.9% from April 2, and the dollar index is down 4.4%. Ten-year Treasury yields have climbed 23 basis points to around 4.4%.
But stocks showed little reaction to the appeals court decision, having already pulled back from the rally sparked by Wednesday’s trade court ruling.
Markets have grown accustomed to the president announcing steep tariffs only to postpone them soon afterward, giving rise to the acronym TACO (Trump Always Chickens Out), coined by the Financial Times.
Asked on Wednesday by a reporter for his response to the term TACO, Trump said the question was “nasty” and in his defence of tariff changes, said: “It’s called negotiation.”
“Trump has already rolled back most of these tariffs anyway, so these court rulings are just headlines,” said Adam Sarhan, chief executive of 50 Park Investments in New York.
“As far as I’m concerned, as long as the market doesn’t tank on the news, it’s just a secondary byproduct,” Sarhan added.
 
 

Earlier, a federal court blocked most of President Donald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on Wednesday, dealing a major setback to the president as he bids to redraw the US trading relationship with the world by forcing governments to the negotiating table through tough new tariffs.
The three-judge Court of International Trade ruled that Trump had overstepped his authority, and barred most of the duties announced since he took office in January.
Attorneys for the Trump administration promptly filed an appeal against the ruling, which gave the White House 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs.
“It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement.

Justice Aminuddin Khan, who headed the 11-judge bench, remarked that PTI had apparently misled the candidates into joining SIC, which was not even a parliamentary party.
The remarks were made on Thursday as the bench resumed the hearing of a set of review petitions filed against the court’s July 2024 order.
Faisal Siddiqi, who was representing SIC, conceded some “mistakes were committed” by the party, but went on to add that “we all make mistakes”. He remarked that even great judges gave bad judgements in the past.

Justice Hilali asks if eight judges amended Constitution by extending deadline for independents to join parties

Justice Khan observed even if the court accepted the SIC’s contention that this confusion was entirely the Election Commission of Pakistan’s fault, the party has also admitted the wrong it committed.
During the hearing, Justice Hilali wondered whether the majority judgement by eight judges in July 2024 had amended the Constitution by extending the requirement of joining a party after winning the election within 15 days.
She also questioned why the SIC chairman, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, who has had a political party since 2013, contested the election as an independent candidate.
“How candidates who in their nomination forms mentioned them as independents were qualified for the rese­r­ved seats since these reserved seats were meant only for the political parties that contested elections and entered the parliament?” the judge questioned.
The PTI never entered the parliament as a party after its members contested elections as independents.
Democratic constitutionalism
Mr Siddiqi, the SIC lawyer, contended the majority judgement addressed all questions being raised by the bench.
He argued that courts have to adhere to the provisions of the Constitution, but those provisions have to be understood in terms of democratic constitutionalism.
“If every judgement has to be democratic, then what will be the impact of the Constitution?” asked Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar.
He wondered whether the counsel wanted judges to decide cases on the public’s will to save the democratic process even if it went beyond the Constitution.
Mr Siddiqi replied that while looking at the Constitution, one should keep in mind that this was a democratic document and that was why every provision “should enhance democratic norms”.
Another bench member, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, observed that his reading of the judgment was that the judges expressed their views through certain observations without referring to the facts of the case.
It seemed that with this bias in their mind, the judges proceeded to discuss and concluded the case afterwards.
The counsel agreed that judges have laid the foundations of the judgment in the beginning and decided the case on these principles but disagreed that it amounted to bias.
When the counsel stated that there were certain points in the judgment that had been agreed upon by all 11 judges, Justice Mazhar wondered whether these reviews pertained to all three judgments or to the eight-judge majority judgment.
Justice Khan emphasised only the majority judgment was under review while the other two were intact.
He also said the counsel was “going beyond the scope of the case” before the court.
The counsel said the majority of the judges had agreed that a number of members contested elections as independent but were PTI-affiliated candidates.
Secondly, all 11 judges held that the reserved seats belong to PTI.
He argued that petitioners who filed the reviews cannot argue that PTI was not a party and therefore, cannot be granted relief.
The lawyer added that Justice Mandokhail and former CJP Qazi Faez Isa, in their note, had granted relief to the PTI.
“That is why their argument was self-destructive,” the counsel emphasised and recalled since PTI did not hold intra-party elections, they were not granted the election symbol, which led to “certain consequences” at the time of filing nomination papers.
The counsel argued the ECP, while misreading the decisions of the PHC and Supreme Court, considered PTI candidates as independents when the party was entitled to get 78 reserved seats in the national as well as provincial assemblies.
Since the party could not get reserved seats, PTI members decided to join SIC, the counsel explained.
At this point, Justice Hilali again asked whether SIC had representation in parliament.
The majority of judges in the July 2024 order agreed several candidates in the parliament belonged to PTI but not to SIC. Therefore, they were entitled to reserved seats, the counsel argued.
Meanwhile, the petitioners, PML-N, PPP and the ECP have already filed additional grounds before the bench.

Produced under HRCP’s Legislation Watch Cell, the report’s findings were presented by digital rights activist Farieha Aziz at an advocacy meeting held as part of a European Union-funded project. Introducing the session, HRCP Director Farah Zia noted with alarm the recent wave of repressive laws, particularly those undermining civic spaces and being used to suppress dissent and freedom of expression.
Farieha Aziz, who authored the report, pointed out that Peca criminalised vague categories of “fake and false information,” carrying penalties of up to three years’ imprisonment. It also establishes a powerful regulatory authority, a complaints council and a tribunal — all subject to disproportionate executive control.
Additional concerns include the reclassification of previously bailable and non-cognisable offences into non-bailable and cognisable ones, thereby widening the scope for coercive action.
 
 


Commission’s report claims law contains serious flaws

Moreover, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency has replaced the Federal Investigation Authority, operating without adequate safeguards.
Speaking at the meeting, journalist Adnan Rehmat emphasised the state’s responsibility to protect individuals’ rights, according to a statement issued by the HRCP. He advocated for the decriminalisation of free speech and suggested engaging political parties through broad-based representation.
Journalist Saleem Shahid criticised Peca for allegedly violating constitutional rights to free speech and access to information. He urged journalists and civil society to form a united front to defend these freedoms.
Former BNP-M legislator Sanaullah Baloch underscored that freedom of expression is essential to a strong parliament.
HRCP Co-Chair Munizae Jahangir highlighted the issue of hyper-regulated connectivity in Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan, as well as the pressure faced by journalists operating in these regions and in Azad Kashmir.
 
 

In this context, journalist Asad Ali Toor shared his personal experience of discovering that his family’s bank accounts had been frozen — allegedly in connection with his work — a tactic Munizae Jahangir described as “economic terrorism”.
Digital rights activists Usama Khilji and Aftab Alam called for the formation of a national coalition of civil society members, journalists, and human rights defenders to engage political parties on the rapid escalation of curbs on freedom of expression and opinion.
Supporting the proposal, HRCP council member Farhatullah Babar stressed the need for countering disinformation while simultaneously protecting the broader rights to free speech and access to information.
Concluding the meeting, HRCP Islamabad Vice Chair Nasreen Azhar proposed that the coalition should identify all laws that conflict with constitutional guarantees of fundamental freedoms.

More than 2000 athletes from 43 countries will compete in the 26th edition of the Asian Athletics Championships, set to take place in South Korea, according to the official Olympics website.
In a video message on his Instagram Stories, he said, “I am competing tomorrow in [South] Korea at 6:15am Pakistan Time.”
He said that this was his first tournament following last year’s Olympics. “Please pray for me so that I qualify for the finals,” he said.
“The final would take place on May 31 at 1:10pm PKT,” he said, asking for prayers so that he could “secure the medal and make Pakistan proud”.
In August last year, Nadeem set a new Olympic record and won a gold medal in the men’s javelin final in Paris with a 92.97m throw.
Nadeem will soon be going to England to prepare for September’s World Athletics Championships.</p><small>2025-05-29 18:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/29225008abdaef8.jpg?r=230016' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914119/4-killed-10-injured-as-rain-related-incidents-rock-kp-rescue-officials' target='_blank'><strong>4 killed, 10 injured as rain-related incidents rock KP: rescue officials</strong></a><br><p>Four people were killed and 10 were injured in rain-related incidents across different districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Thursday, officials said.
The casualties were reported after a series of lightning strikes and structure collapses occurred amid extremely heavy rain.
The spokesperson for Rescue 1122 Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bilal Ahmad Faizi told Dawn.com, that the casualties were reported in the Mohmand and Mardan districts of the province.
“Two people were killed while one was injured in a lightning strike in Mohmand,” he said. “As soon as the incident was reported, the Rescue 1122 control room took immediate action and dispatched a medical response team to the scene.”
He added that the team took timely action and provided first aid to the injured at the scene and later moved him to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital Nawagai.
“The bodies of the two deceased were transported to District Headquarters Hospital Ghalnai after medico-legal formalities,” he added.
“Rescue 1122 medical, fire and disaster teams are performing relief operations,” Faizi said. “Roads are closed in several areas due to falling trees. Rescue 1122 disaster teams and local people are working to clear the roads.”
Providing details of the casualties, Rescue 1122, in a statement, said that in Takht-i-Bahi, a mother and daughter were reported to have died after a ceiling collapsed while a girl was injured, adding that in Katlang Qasmi, a 60-year-old woman was seriously injured, while two children sustained critical wounds in a similar incident at Akhun Baba.
Fifteen-year-old Abdul Salam was seriously injured in a wall collapse on Bakhshali Cham Dheri Road. In Manga, three people were critically hurt in another wall collapse. A 38-year-old woman was injured when a gate collapsed near Jabal Madrasa, and a 40-year-old woman sustained serious injuries in a wall collapse in Rustam Peshkando.
“Rescue 1122 said its medical teams provided first aid to all the injured and transported them to nearby hospitals,” the statement said.
The World Meteorological Organisation forecast that most of South Asia would experience above-normal rainfall and above-average temperatures during this year’s southwest monsoon season from June to September.
Earlier this week, at least three people lost their lives and multiple others were injured as strong winds and thunderstorms lashed several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-05-29 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606809-china-lauds-pakistans-responsible-conduct-during-standoff-with-india' target='_blank'><strong>China lauds Pakistan's ‘responsible conduct' during standoff with India</strong></a><br><p>
