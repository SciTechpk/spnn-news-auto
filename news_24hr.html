In a post on X, the premier said, “The government and the people of Pakistan join the people of Iran in their hour of grief and sorrow and extend the most sincere condolences on the martyrdom of His Eminence Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei.”







He further said, “Pakistan also expresses concern over the violation of the norms of international law. It is an age-old convention that the heads of state/government should not be targeted.”
The premier prayed for the Iranian supreme leader and for strength for the people of the country to bear “this irreparable loss”.
Separately, President Asif Ali Zardari also expressed profound sorrow over the martyrdom of the Iranian supreme leader and other members of Iran’s senior leadership, according to a statement issued by the President’s Secretariat.
“The president said that Pakistan stands with the Iranian nation in this moment of grief and shares in their loss. He observed that the passing of a leader of such stature, along with other senior figures, would be deeply felt across the Muslim world,” the statement said.
He also offered prayers for the deceased and the people of Iran.







PM Shehbaz speaks to Jordan, Bahrain kings
Separately, PM Shehbaz spoke to Jordan’s King Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein to discuss the “evolving regional situation”, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
“The two leaders exchanged views on the serious regional developments following the recent escalation from the Israeli attack on Iran, which was followed by attacks on Jordan and other regional countries,” the statement said.
“The prime minister expressed Pakistan’s deep concern over the situation and emphasised the urgent need for restraint, de-escalation, and dialogue to preserve regional peace and stability,” the statement said.
It added that the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with the kingdom as well as other brotherly countries in the region during this “challenging time”.
“He also reiterated Pakistan’s readiness to support all efforts aimed at restoring calm and promoting stability. Both leaders agreed to maintain close coordination on regional developments,” the statement said.
The premier also posted about it on X, saying, “We emphasised the urgent need for restraint, dialogue, and de-escalation to preserve peace and stability.”







He also spoke to Bahrain King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa to discuss the “ongoing crisis” in the Middle East and Iran’s attacks on several Gulf countries, including Bahrain, after US-Israeli attacks.
According to the PMO, the premier said that such unprovoked acts of aggression only escalated the situation and threatened the peace and stability of the entire region.
“He assured the leadership of Bahrain that Pakistan stood firmly with Bahrain and other brotherly Gulf countries and underscored the need for maximum restraint in this difficult time,” the statement said.







PM Shehbaz also emphasised the need to “preserve the primacy of international law and reiterated that Pakistan would always remain committed to supporting peace efforts and urge all parties to engage in diplomacy and seek a negotiated solution to the crisis”.
In a post on X about his conversation with Bahrain’s king, PM Shehbaz said, “While praying for the safety and security of our brothers and sisters in Bahrain, I emphasised restraint, respect for international law, and the urgent need for dialogue and diplomacy to restore peace and stability in the region.”






</p><small>2026-03-01 18:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/01225627e91d30e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1977118/as-us-iran-tensions-rise-oil-emerges-as-pakistans-biggest-economic-risk' target='_blank'><strong>As US-Iran tensions rise, oil emerges as Pakistan’s biggest economic risk</strong></a><br><p>If the war between Iran and the United States escalates, the single biggest economic threat to Pakistan will come from oil.
Brent crude settled around $72.5 a barrel on Friday, already up nearly 19 per cent year-to-date, according to CNBC. Rumours are swirling of oil touching $100.
For Pakistan, even modest increases carry heavy consequences.
For every $10 rise in oil prices, the current account deficit increases by roughly $1.5–$2 billion, explains former chief executive officer of the Pakistan Business Council, Ehsan Malik.
“If prices were to climb to $100, the deficit could expand by $5–$7bn on an annualised basis, potentially undoing recent gains that allowed FY25 to post a $2bn current account surplus.”
Markets are extremely erratic right now, says energy analyst Syed Rashid Husain.
Iran produces roughly 3–3.5 million barrels of oil per day, exporting about 1–1.5m barrels. While this is far lower than the output of the United States (about 13.5m barrels per day) or Saudi Arabia (around 9–10m), even a loss of one million barrels per day can tighten global balances and push prices higher.
Compounding the risk is the strategic importance of the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow waterway through which roughly 20pc of global oil consumption passes. For years, Iran has threatened to block this passage during periods of heightened conflict.
According to Reuters, oil and gas shipments through the area have already faced disruption, with Iran’s Revolutionary Guards reportedly warning ships that passage is not permitted, although Tehran has not formally confirmed such an order.
Analysts say scenarios range from limited disruptions to Iranian exports to a full blockade of Hormuz.
The ripple effects are already visible. Late Saturday night, petrol prices at pumps in Canada had risen by roughly 10–15 cents per litre, Husain said, speaking from experience.
Russia-Ukraine crisis flashbacks
For Pakistan, the situation evokes the economic horror of the Russia–Ukraine war. During 2022-23, Brent crude hovered around $100–125 per barrel, leading Pakistan to float perilously close to sovereign default.
The chain reaction was brutal. The war pushed up oil prices, widening Pakistan’s import bill and putting pressure on the exchange rate. The rupee slid from around Rs170 per dollar in early 2022 to a peak of Rs305 on Aug 28, 2023, before stabilising in the Rs270–280 range toward the end of that year.
There was, however, an important cushion at the time. Despite sanctions, Russia still exported oil and gas by hook or by crook to many countries; Pakistan also tried to get oil from Russia, and India became a major importer of Russian oil.
Since then, however, the US has pressured India to stop importing and tightened the screws on all of Russia’s supplies. If Iranian barrels are disrupted simultaneously, two significant discounted supply streams could disappear, pushing crude firmly into triple-digit territory if tensions do not de-escalate.
There are already signs of strain. Saudi Aramco has reportedly not allocated a March cargo to a Pakistani refinery amid volatility in global oil markets. Uncertainty in global crude trade has made it difficult to secure shipments for March, and this was before the news of the assassination of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei.
Marine insurers are also considering repricing or cancelling policies in parts of the Middle East, according to reports.
A chain reaction and the IMF
Oil prices have a multiplier effect as they impact secondary markets.
For example, edible oil prices — of which Pakistan imported roughly $3.7bn in FY25 — are indirectly linked to crude oil markets, Malik explains.
Much of the economic breathing space that enabled recent stabilisation came from relatively stable global commodity prices.
“For every $10 increase in oil prices, Pakistan’s inflation typically rises by about 0.5–0.6 percentage points,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research at JS Global Capital.
If oil prices surge, inflation would rise again, making further policy rate cuts unlikely.
Industry would face higher input costs, weakening exports. At the same time, fiscal space would shrink, limiting the government’s ability to lower taxes or provide relief, adds Malik.
“The veneer of stability has been damaged,” says Ammar H Khan, Professor of Practice at the Institute of Business Administration Karachi. Capital outflows could increase, or new investment could slow, hurting job creation and — at the margins — reducing demand for migrant labour abroad.
These repercussions may also extend to remittances, which are vital for keeping the current account afloat.
Even if the conflict lasts only a few days and does not turn into a prolonged war, heightened regional risk can weigh on financial flows, he adds.
All this is taking place in the background of talks with the visiting International Monetary Fund (IMF) team. Industry sources say there had been positive talks with the Fund regarding possible tax relief in the upcoming budget. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also emphasised the need to reduce direct tax rates.
However, given the current global uncertainty, meaningful relief now appears unlikely.
Pakistan was already receiving very little foreign direct investment, notes M Abdul Aleem, secretary general of the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
“What little was in the pipelines, like investments in Reko Diq, will slow down for now,” he says.
“Equally concerning is the law-and-order environment, particularly when it involves the safety of foreign nationals.”
Referring to the recent incident at the US consulate in Karachi, he said stronger preventive security measures should have been in place.
PSX and gold
For equity markets, the implications extend beyond macroeconomic concerns.
Pakistan’s manufacturing sectors rely heavily on imported raw materials and energy inputs. “Take the cement sector as an example,” says Waqas Ghani, Head of Equity Research. “It relies on coal and petcoke as key inputs. If oil prices rise, the prices of these fuels also increase, raising production costs.”
Because many industries depend on imported inputs across the value chain, higher commodity prices quickly squeeze profit margins.
“When input costs rise, margins come under pressure, and corporate earnings can deteriorate,” he said. “Apart from oil and exploration companies, most sectors would face headwinds.”
Beyond fundamentals, market sentiment itself has turned cautious.
“Investors are already becoming more risk-averse,” Ghani noted. “When uncertainty rises, equities are usually the first asset class where investors reduce exposure.”
Several technical factors are also amplifying selling pressure. Foreign investors have been net sellers in recent weeks, while mutual funds are facing redemption pressures from retail investors. When investors withdraw money, fund managers are forced to liquidate holdings, increasing supply in the market.
“At the same time, settlement dynamics can intensify the pressure,” Ghani added. The Pakistan Stock Exchange currently operates on a T+1 settlement cycle, while the banking system operates on a T+2 cycle, which can create short-term liquidity stress for brokers and investors during periods of volatility.
“All these factors combined can create a downward spiral where selling feeds on itself,” he said.
For now, the key trigger that could stabilise markets would be a de-escalation of geopolitical tensions.
“If the conflict subsides and oil prices stabilise, sentiment could recover fairly quickly,” Ghani said. “But until then, markets are likely to remain under stress.”
Much, however, will depend on how global markets react when trading begins.
“It all depends on the evolving situation and any ceasefire news,” said Muhammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities. “A lot will hinge on how US futures open, along with the trend in oil prices and Asian markets.”
Pakistani stocks are likely to fall initially, he added, though the extent will depend on developments overnight. Some markets that opened on Sunday were already down close to two per cent.
Ali Nawaz, CEO of Chase Securities, expects early weakness in trading when it begins.
“The market is likely to see a decline in the opening hours, driven by investor concerns over the US-Iran conflict, the broader Middle East situation and rising oil prices,” he said.
However, he expects the pressure to ease as the week progresses.
“A recovery could follow as the situation moves towards resolution and institutional investors step in for value buying,” Nawaz said. Given the market’s recent corrections, further declines may create attractive valuations for investors, echoing the age-old advice to buy the dip.
As the Pakistan Stock Market bleeds, investors may turn to gold, which is expected to surge. On Saturday, local gold prices jumped by Rs10,000 per tola in Pakistan. Qasim Shikarpuri, president of the All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association, expects international prices to rise by $200–$300 per ounce once markets reopen.
“If that happens, local gold prices could surge by as much as Rs60,000 per tola,” he said.
Bazaars and shopping
Retailers say geopolitical tensions are already affecting shopping activity during Ramazan, a critical sales period for bazaars and malls.
“We have seen this before,” said Asfandyar Farrukh, Chairman of the Chainstore Association of Pakistan. “Even a few days ago, when tensions flared between Pakistan and Afghanistan, and warnings were issued, there was an immediate impact.”
The effect is most visible over the weekend, when shopping activity typically peaks.
“Weekend footfall is usually the highest, especially on Sundays. But in such situations, visitor numbers can fall by half,” he said.
If the tensions subside quickly, retailers expect the slowdown to be temporary.
“If things improve within two or three days, the lost sales can be made up,” he said. “But if uncertainty continues through Ramazan, then the impact could become more significant.”
According to Farrukh, shoppers tend to adjust their behaviour during prolonged uncertainty rather than abandoning shopping altogether.
“People still need to shop for Eid. What they usually do is go out earlier in the day or spread their visits over time,” he said. “But overall, there could still be a 20–25pc decline in footfall during periods of heightened tension.”
Retail activity during Ramazan typically peaks in the final ten days before Eid, though momentum had only recently begun building in markets.
“The last ten days are usually when Ramazan shopping really accelerates,” he said. “But we are already beginning to see some slowdown.”
Farrukh does not expect security concerns to push shoppers significantly toward online retail.
“Eid shopping is an experience. People want to see the fabric, the material, the footwear, hence they prefer to visit markets,” he said. “Online shopping has been growing, but it does not replace the Eid shopping experience.”
Instead, the larger risk for retail spending comes from rising fuel prices.
“If oil prices surge, that will have the biggest impact on consumer spending,” he said. “Fuel prices have already increased, and further hikes are expected. If this situation continues for several days, it would directly affect household spending.”
A path for de-escalation?
Ultimately, much will depend on whether the conflict escalates or finds an off-ramp.
“Domestic politics in the United States may ultimately shape how far this confrontation goes. The US faces congressional midterm elections in November 2026,” notes Husain.
With the American economy already grappling with tariff shocks and a cooling job market amid massive AI investments, the cost of living remains a top voter concern. Surveys cited by The Wall Street Journal show that inflation and household costs remain the most persistent economic complaints.
If gas prices surge sharply, it could damage Republicans at the ballot box, potentially costing them control of the House or the Senate and undermining the administration’s ability to pass major legislation.
That may explain why Donald Trump has suggested there are several “off-ramps” from the military operation, in recent comments to media outlet Axios. Trump is also facing pressure from how own Make America Great Again (MAGA) political base to avoid a prolonged Middle East intervention.
Equally important is Iran’s reaction.
“Iranians have historically been pragmatic in such circumstances,” Husain said. After the killing of Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani in 2020 and the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in 2024, Tehran’s responses were calibrated.
“There will almost certainly be face-saving measures,” Husain said. “But if past behaviour is any guide, those may eventually be accompanied by efforts to de-escalate as well.”
Pakistan has paid a heavy price on its path to stabilisation. Its fragile economic recovery relies heavily on stable oil prices. The difference between escalation and restraint could mean the difference between continued stabilisation and another severe macroeconomic shock.

The situation warranted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to issue an appeal, urging people to remain peaceful.
“Today is a sorrowful day for the entire Muslim ummah, Pakistan’s public and Iran’s public,” he said in a video statement.
Stating that every Pakistani citizen was as aggrieved as Iranians, Naqvi said, “My only request is that we all stand with you, but please do not take the law into your hands. You may protest but peacefully.”

 


Karachi clashes
In Karachi, protesters clashed with law enforcement personnel near the US Consulate on Mai Kolachi Road. Law enforcement personnel resorted to teargas shelling and baton-charge to control the situation.
Subsequently, Section 144 was also extended across Sindh. According to the Home Department, all kinds of wall chalking, protests, demonstrations, sit-ins, rallies, and display of arms were banned throughout the province for one month, effective from March 1.
However, the guards of registered private security companies were allowed to carry weapons at places of duty during work hours, but they were prohibited from displaying or brandishing weapons during movement in vehicles.
According to a statement by Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed listing all casualties, eight bodies were brought to Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK), while two succumbed to their injuries, taking the deaths in the US Consulate incident to 10.
A total of 62 people were injured near US Consulate, with 41 taken to CHK’S SMBBIT, seven taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC), eight taken to Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH), and six taken to Fatimiyah Hospital.
Separately, eight persons injured during protests at Native Jetty and Numaish Chowrangi were brought to SMBBIT, while three wounded in a protest in Paposh Nagar were taken to JPMC.
This took the total number of people injured in protests across the metropolis to 73, Dr Syed’s statement said.
Out of them, 14 remained admitted in hospitals, while the rest were discharged after treatment, it added.
Of those admitted, six were in a critical condition — two at SMMBIT, two at AKUH and one at JPMC.
In its statement, the US Embassy in Islamabad said: “We are monitoring reports of ongoing demonstrations at the US Consulate Generals in Karachi and Lahore, as well as calls for additional demonstrations at the US Embassy in Islamabad and the Consulate General in Peshawar.
“We advise US citizens in Pakistan to monitor local news and observe good personal security practices, including being aware of your surroundings, avoiding large crowds, and ensuring your STEP (Smart Traveller Enrollment Programme) registration is up to date.”







In view of the arising security situation, roads near the US Consulate were closed off to traffic.
Later in the day, when authorities tried to place containers to block the roads near the US Consulate, protesters pelted stones, leading to more clashes.

In an official statement, shared by the information minister’s spokesperson Husain Mansoor, the Sindh government expressed “deep grief” over the loss of lives in the clash.
“The protesters entered after breaching the security cordon of the US Consulate and committed vandalism,” the statement said.
However, the government put the number of deaths at six, adding that “several” were injured.
It formed a high-level joint investigation team (JIT) to “impartially review all aspects of the incident”. The JIT will “assess the circumstances under which the incident occurred and what its causes were”.
The JIT will also determine “who was responsible” for the incident.
While the government affirmed the public’s constitutional right to protest, it stressed that “maintaining a peaceful environment was everyone’s shared responsibility”.
“Any kind of vandalism, violence or taking the law into your own hands is inappropriate,” it noted.
The government requested citizens to “express their emotions only in peaceful and legal ways”.
Citizens are urged to express their feelings only in peaceful and legal ways.
“The government wants to keep the situation under control,” the statement said, adding that while citizens had the right to peacefully protest, no one should take the law into their hands.

In his statement, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah termed the incident “extremely tragic” and expressed his deep grief over Khamenei’s death.
“In this hour of grief, the people of Sindh stand in equal solidarity with Iran and all those who are mourning,” he said.
He directed that an impartial investigation be conducted into the US Consulate incident.
“At a time when the country is facing a war-like situation, it is inappropriate to sabotage peace and order,” CM Murad said.
He contacted various religious leaders, including Allama Shahenshah Naqvi, Allama Shabbir Maisami, and others, to urge them to ensure that public sentiments were controlled at all costs.
Allama Naqvi and others spoke about holding a majlis (gathering) at Numaish, the CM Office statement said, adding that Murad directed the administration and the police to provide full security for it.
CM Murad appealed to all religious scholars and people of different schools of thought to guide the public toward maintaining peace and order.
Expressing his deep sorrow over the loss of lives in the US Consulate incident, he said the government cannot allow anyone to take the law into their own hands.
In a video statement, Allama Naqvi termed the consulate clashes “painful” and urged the public to remain peaceful.
He noted that the Muslim community was saddened over Khamenei’s “martyrdom”, adding that people should voice their grief “keeping in mind the sorrow of Karbala”.



Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar sought immediate details about the situation from Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Azad Khan, a statement from his office said.
“No one will be allowed to take the law into their hands,” Lanjar was quoted as saying. He ordered that the security of sensitive installations be made more effective.
The minister further directed that alternative routes be determined to maintain the flow of traffic and that law enforcement agencies (LEAs) remain fully alert and monitor the situation closely.
“Action will be taken in accordance with the law against elements disturbing law and order,” Lanjar warned.
Meanwhile, the Sindh Rangers said it had deployed “heavy contingents of mobile vigilance teams” across the city in view of the prevailing security situation.

Earlier in the day, Keamari Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Amjad Ahmed Shaikh gathered police contingents to strengthen security at sensitive locations.
2 dead, dozens injured in Islamabad
At least two protesters died and over 30 were injured during clashes with law enforcement personnel near the Diplomatic Enclave, where people had gathered to protest the attacks on Iran.
The clashes came after the district administration had banned all kinds of gatherings under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
According to sources at Polyclinic Hospital, as many as nine injured persons were brought there, but one of them succumbed to injuries.
Sources at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) said a body and 25 injured people were brought to the hospital. The injured included three police officials and two Rangers personnel.
Eight of those admitted to Pims and Polyclinic were in a critical condition.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) Spokesperson Hasnain Zaidi, speaking to Dawn, also said that at least two persons had died.
He claimed that as many as 15 protesters were taken into custody and taken to a police station. “We have started efforts to get them released,” he added.
Police resorted to heavy shelling near the Foreign Office building in an effort to stop the protesters from entering the Diplomatic Enclave. The police, backed by Rangers, succeeded in pushing the protesters back and out of the Red Zone.

In the late afternoon, thousands of people reached Aabpara Chowk to march towards the US Embassy for protests over Supreme Leader Khamenei’s assassination.
However, the march was stopped by the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) at Serena Chowk, where shelling was employed, resulting in multiple injuries.
Protesters also manhandled mediapersons, including cameramen and photographers, snatching their cameras and phones and deleting the pictures and videos.
Replying to a question earlier, Zaidi said that as the situation was becoming out of control, MWM chief Allama Raja Nasir reached the venue.
“Allama sahib, who is the leader of the opposition in the Senate, has been addressing the masses,” the MWM spokesperson added.
In an advisory at noon, the Islamabad police said all routes leading to the Red Zone, which houses important government buildings, had been closed.







The Islamabad district administration had banned all kinds of gatherings in the federal capital under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
According to the district administration, all kinds of gatherings and assemblies would be considered unlawful under Section 144. It urged residents not to take part in any such gathering.
“Strict legal action will be taken in the case of any protest, demonstration or gathering,” the administration warned.







Earlier in the day, the interior minister visited various areas of Islamabad and reviewed the law and order situation in the Red Zone, Diplomatic Enclave, and other areas.
He inspected security arrangements and issued orders to ensure foolproof arrangements in the Diplomatic Enclave.
While noting that peaceful protest was everyone’s right, Naqvi said, “Mischief under the guise of protest cannot be allowed under any circumstances.”
He ordered that security arrangements must be complete and comprehensive in every respect, adding, “The law will take its course against disruption of daily life routines.”
Islamabad IG Ali Nasir Rizvi briefed the minister on the law and order situation. Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa, the deputy commissioner and other officials were also present on the occasion.
Section 144 imposed across Punjab; crowd dispersed outside US Consulate
Meanwhile, hundreds of activists from Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) assembled outside the US Consulate in Lahore at around 11am and attempted to force their way into the building, catching the police off guard.
However, a few policemen on routine duty around the consulate managed to push back the activists protesting the US-Israel attacks on Iran.

Some protesters told Dawn that one of their colleagues scaled the consulate’s boundary wall and was detained by security guards. By that time, police reinforcements had arrived, and a police inspector negotiated with consulate security to secure the protester’s release.
The protesters, including a large number of women, were carrying portraits of Khamenei and raising slogans against the US and Israel.
The MWM had scheduled the protest for 3pm, but its activists gathered at the venue much earlier.
Police cordoned off the area as activists of Tehreek-i-Bedari Ummat-i-Mustafa marched from the Punjab Assembly to join the demonstration at the consulate.
Meanwhile, the Punjab government imposed a ban on gatherings and sit-ins of four or more persons across the province for seven days.
Such assemblies were prohibited in “any public place, street, road, or open space except with the prior permission of the deputy commissioner concerned”, a notification by the Home Department said.
The ban did not apply to marriage ceremonies, funeral prayers, burial processions, courts of law, and “assemblies of officers/officials in government or semi-government offices for official duty”.
A complete ban was also imposed on the “carrying, display, or brandishing of all kinds of weapons (both licensed and unlicensed) or any destruction-causing material in public places” for seven days.
The notification clarified that the ban did not apply to personnel of LEAs and security agencies on official duty.







“This order shall come into force with immediate effect and shall remain in force for a period of seven (07) days, unless modified or withdrawn earlier,” the notification stated.
It stated: “Multiple credible threat alerts, regarding possible terrorist activities planned by hostile groups aimed at targeting minorities or Muslim scholars to trigger sectarian unrest, have been received.
“Assemblies, rallies, gatherings, sit-ins, processions, demonstrations, jalsas etc could present a convenient target for such terrorist attacks, and the possibility of an untoward incident cannot be ruled out.”
The Home Department noted there was a “strong apprehension that certain political, sectarian or anti-social elements may engage in activities, assemblies, gatherings or demonstrations that are likely to cause a breach of public peace, disturb the public order, and create a security risk for the general public and critical infrastructure”.
Curfew in Skardu after protests in GB
Separately, as demonstrations intensified across Gilgit-Baltistan after Khamenei’s assassination, curfew was imposed in the Skardu district.
Protesters set the offices in Gilgit and Skardu of the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) on fire.
They also set a school, the office of the superintendent of police, and the Agha Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) office on fire during the protest.

The GB police issued a statement saying that a curfew has been imposed in Skardu.
The statement said that the Pakistan Army had been called in under Section 245 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), noting that UNMOGIP offices in Skardu and Gilgit were torched.
It said that no casualties were reported due to “timely intervention” by the police and administration.
According to the police, all foreign tourists in GB have been shifted to safe places.
Police requested the public to remain peaceful, saying, “It is everyone’s shared responsibility to thwart attempts to damage national property.”

Protesters blocked the Karakoram Highway (KKH) at multiple locations in Hunza, Nagar and Gilgit, holding pictures of Khamenei and chanting anti-American and anti-Israel slogans. They also staged a sit-in at Siachen Road in Kharmang.
Roads in Shigar and Ghanche also remained blocked, while the Baltistan Road has been blocked in Roundu and other areas. Inter-district roads also remained blocked.
Shops, markets, business markets and commercial activities remained suspended in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Nagar, Shigar, Kharmang, Astore, and Ghanche, a Dawn correspondent reported.
Rallies in DI Khan, other KP areas
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rallies in solidarity with Iran were staged in Dera Ismail Khan, Tank and Paharpur districts.
Hundreds of people staged a rally in DI Khan from Imamia Gate to Fawara Chowk, where participants held a gathering and offered prayers.
The rally, led by Allama Ramzan Tauqeer, was organised on the call of the Shia Ulema Council and other organisations.
Leaders and workers of various political and social groups joined the demonstration.
Among those present were Jamaat-i-Islami district president Manzar Masood Khattak, Advocate Zahid Mohibullah and Mian Allah Ditta Sajid of the Khaksar Tehreek, along with individuals belonging to different schools of thought.
Participants carried portraits of Ayatollah Khamenei and placards bearing protest slogans, while chants were raised against the US and Israel.
Speakers termed the death of Iran’s supreme leader a grave loss for the Muslim world and warned that such developments could escalate tensions in the region. They urged the international community to play its role in ensuring peace and stability.

Addressing the gathering, Allama Tauqeer said the Iranian people were not alone in what he described as a difficult time and that the people of Pakistan stood with them.
JI’s Khattak said any violation of a country’s sovereignty was against international law and could have serious consequences. Other speakers also emphasised the need for restraint, dialogue and regional peace.
According to the administration, the rally concluded peacefully and no untoward incident was reported.
Heavy security arrangements were made by the district police during the rally, with additional personnel deployed along the route and traffic diverted to alternative roads.
Similar protest rallies were also held in Tank, Paharpur and other adjoining areas. Local authorities said the demonstrations remained peaceful, with no reports of violence or disruption from any of the locations.

Samson hit 12 fours and four sixes in his superb 50-ball knock in the winner-takes-all final Super Eights match to thrill a capacity 67,000 fans at a pulsating Eden Gardens.
After the West Indies smacked 70 off the last five overs to score 195-4 after being asked to bat, India lost two early wickets but were always up with the required rate.
Samson, opening for the second match in succession, led the way.
When India slipped to 41-2, he was joined by captain Suryakumar Yadav (18) and the pair added 58 for the third wicket.
Tilak Varma was next to join Samson and scored 27 off 15 before departing in the 15th over with the score 141-4 and India still needing 55.
Samson stood firm and though Hardik Pandya fell for 17, India reached the target with four balls to spare to spark celebrations and fireworks.
Jason Holder and Rovman Powell earlier put on an unbroken stand of 76 for the fifth wicket to help the West Indies set the defending champions a target of 196 to stay alive.
The West Indies sprang a surprise at the top of the order, promoting Test captain Roston Chase to open alongside T20 skipper Shai Hope.
That enabled them to bring in an extra spinner, Akeal Hosein, with regular opener Brandon King left out.
In their defeat to South Africa last week, the West Indies slumped to 83-7 but the new-look opening partnership was more assured.
Spinner Varun Chakravarthy got the first breakthrough, bowling Hope for a sluggish 32.
Shimron Hetmyer raced to 27 off 12 balls before falling to the faintest of edges off Jasprit Bumrah to make it 102-2.
After Chase fell for 40 and Sherfane Rutherford followed, Powell and Holder launched their brutal late assault.
Powell finished on 34 not out from 19 balls with two sixes and three fours, while Holder was unbeaten on 37 off 22 balls with three sixes and two fours.
It could have been better for India but they dropped three regulation catches in a sloppy fielding display, including Chase when he had made just 15.
South Africa, the only unbeaten side in the tournament, beat Zimbabwe by five wickets earlier on Sunday and will face New Zealand in Kolkata in the first semi-final on Wednesday.
The final is in Ahmedabad next Sunday.</p><small>2026-03-01 17:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/0121075692f28d1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1977094/geo-news-transmission-hacked-subversive-message-displayed' target='_blank'><strong>Geo News’ transmission hacked; subversive message displayed</strong></a><br><p>The live television feed of Geo News was hacked on Sunday night, with a subversive message being displayed.
In a statement, the Geo News management said that for the past 24 hours, attempts were being made to hack the channel — which was on the communication satellite PAKSAT — and disrupt its broadcast.
The management said that for some time now, the channel had been facing continuous disruptions.
“Geo News’ screen was hacked to display an inappropriate message,” the statement said, adding that the situation had nothing to do with the channel.
It called on authorities to take notice of the incident, take immediate action and bring those responsible to justice.

The global oil benchmark has rallied this year and reached $73 a barrel on Friday for its highest since July, buoyed by growing concern over the potential attacks that arrived a day later. Futures trading is closed over the weekend.
“While the military attacks are themselves supportive for oil prices, the key factor here is the closing of the Strait of Hormuz,” said Ajay Parmar, director of energy and refining at ICIS.
Most tanker owners, oil majors and trading houses have suspended crude oil, fuel and liquefied natural gas shipments via the Strait of Hormuz, trade sources said, after Tehran warned ships against moving through the waterway. More than 20pc of global oil is moved through the Strait of Hormuz.
Middle East leaders have warned Washington that a war on Iran could lead to oil prices jumping to more than $100 a barrel, said RBC analyst Helima Croft. Rabobank analysts are slightly less bullish, seeing prices holding above $90 a barrel in the near term.
The OPEC+ group of oil producers agreed on Sunday to raise output by 206,000 barrels per day (bpd) from April, a modest increase representing less than 0.2pc of global demand.
While some alternate infrastructure could be used to bypass the Strait of Hormuz, the net impact from its closure would be a loss of 8million to 10m bpd of crude oil supply even after diverting some flows through Saudi Arabia’s East-West pipeline and Abu Dhabi’s pipeline, said Rystad Energy economist Jorge Leon.
Rystad expects prices to rise by $20 to about $92 a barrel when trade opens.
The Iran crisis also prompted Asian governments and refiners to assess oil stockpiles and alternative shipping routes and supplies. Kpler analysts said in a webinar on Sunday that India might turn to Russian oil to make up for potential Middle East supply loss.</p><small>2026-03-01 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/01212835fb80af7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1977044/pm-shehbaz-chairs-meeting-reviewing-pakistans-security-situation-regional-environment' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz chairs meeting reviewing Pakistan’s security situation, regional environment</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday chaired a high-level meeting to review the regional situation and the country’s security situation, state-run PTV reported.
The development comes as Pakistan launched Operation Ghazab lil-Haq against the Afghan Taliban earlier this week after the neighbouring country targeted Pakistani positions along the border.
Separately, the United States and Israel launched strikes against Iran on Saturday, assassinating Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Tehran called the strikes unprovoked and illegal and responded with missiles fired at Israel and at least seven other countries, including Gulf states that host US bases.
In a post on X, the state broadcaster said that during the meeting, the regional situation was reviewed in detail, while Pakistan’s role in maintaining peace in the region and multiple actions in this regard were also considered.







The situation of Afghanistan was also deeply reviewed during the meeting, while the members were also given a briefing on the internal situation of the country and the security arrangements in this regard, it said.
Further, actions taken to repatriate Pakistani citizens in Iran were also reviewed, with the Foreign Office giving a detailed briefing on efforts undertaken for their safe return, PTV said.
It added that evacuation was being facilitated through Azerbaijan for their safe return to the country. It was also briefed that their repatriation was being made possible from Iran via Azerbaijan.
PM postpones visit to Russia
Meanwhile, the premier also postponed his official visit to Russia, citing the recent “regional and internal situation”. The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) confirmed the development in a statement.
It added that the premier’s visit to Russia was of “great significance” for advancing the bilateral relations between the two countries, but given the current situation, it was being postponed.
A new date would be decided after “mutual consultations”, the statement added.







According to Russian media, PM Shehbaz was due to travel to Russia from March 3 to 5.

However, the image is AI-generated.
Khamenei, who ruled the Islamic Republic for over 30 years, was assassinated in a strike in the early hours of Sunday, by the US and Israel — the two countries that had been calling for regime change in Tehran.
Iran called the strikes “unprovoked and illegal”, responding with missiles fired at Israel and at least seven other countries, including Gulf states that host US bases, while vowing revenge for Khamenei’s assassination.
On March 1, a pro-Iranian user, based on his profile picture and past posts, shared a picture of Khamenei under rubble on X with the following caption: “My leader gave up his life, but the Muslim nation did not compromise or sell out the followers of Imam Hussain.”
The post gained 4.8 million views and was liked by 30,000 users.
The same picture was shared by another pro-Iranian user in the same context. The post was captioned: “My dear leader, my life be sacrificed for you”
The post gained 2m views while 16,000 users liked the post.







Another user also shared the same image with the following caption: “Iran releases image of Khamenei’s body beneath rubble.”
The post gained 4.6m views.
An Indian National Congress supporter also shared the image with a similar claim with the following caption: “Salute to the martyrdom of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei Sahib! May Allah bestow forgiveness”
The post garnered 340,000 views.
A Pakistani account also shared the same image with the following caption: “The intelligence was so solid that a photo of Imam Khomeini’s body was even delivered to the Israeli Prime Minister. Internal enemies are always the most dangerous; it’s a lesson for Pakistan.”
The post gained 170,000 views.
Multiple international digital media outlets, such as Antikor, Ahdaath net, Our Islam 24, Harianaceh, Gelora, Andhraj Yothy, Dosja, Face News, Punjab Kesari, Al Wafd news and Dimpe News also shared the same image with a similar claim on their websites.
The same image with a similar claim was further shared on X as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here and here; collectively gaining more than 400,000 views.
It was also circulated on LinkedIn and Facebook, as can be seen here, here, here, here and here.
Separately, a pro-Iranian user, based on his profile picture and past posts, shared a different image that allegedly showed Khamenei’s body on a bed with the following caption: “Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s dead body”.
The post gained 400,000 views.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and keen public interest in the matter of the Iranian supreme leader’s assassination.
A keyword search was conducted to corroborate whether any credible and mainstream international or Iranian news outlets had shared or reported the image, but yielded no results.
Inspecting the image, a rescue worker can be seen standing directly on the rubble over Khamenei’s alleged body, an atypical scenario to real-life rescue or recovery operations, which proceed cautiously to retrieve the injured and the dead.
A forensic analysis of the image through AI-detection tools showed that multiple tools, such as Undetectable.ai, AI or Not, Sightengine, Hive Moderation, and Truth Scan, flagged it as AI-generated.
Analysing the image using Google Gemini’s SynthID further indicated that most of the image had been edited or generated using Google’s AI tools.
As for the second picture, where Khamenei can be seen on a bed, a reverse image search yielded the same visuals shared by Euro News in a September 8, 2014, YouTube video with the following title: “Iran supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has ‘successful’ prostate surgery”.



According to the video description, Khamenei had successfully undergone prostate surgery. The same news with similar visuals was covered by multiple other international media outlets such as BBC, Al-Arabiya English and Mashregh News.
Therefore, the claim that a viral image shows Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s body found from the rubble of a coordinated US-Israeli airstrike is false.

The smell of gunpowder was in the air, regularly punctuated by the deep thumps of tear gas shells being fired. Hundreds of law enforcement personnel, including paramilitary forces, riot police and special units, were in the area — forming security cordons, keeping protesters at bay, and even those taking refuge from the afternoon sun.

The protesters, young Shia men, were scattered, their numbers waxing and waning, but not more than a thousand.
A couple of hundred angry protesters were crowded at the end of the Mai Kolachi Road, which is where the bow of the massive US consulate compound is located.

Quite a few were armed with rudimentary weapons: bamboo sticks and tree branches. One even had a stone tied to a piece of cloth — an improvised bludgeon.
A large number carried portraits of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, assassinated the night before in a joint US-Israeli strike.

Most of them had pieces of cloth tied around their face; to conceal their identity and minimise the impacts of tear gas.
Every now and then, a fiery speech would be followed by slogans, with a couple of young men demanding that the security perimeter be breached, only to be talked down by the elders.

On the sidelines of the protest, when a Rangers’ soldier asked a young man to put down the stick he was wielding, he refused.
“This is not for you. This is for them,” he said, pointing to the US Consulate in the background.
Their demand: to take down the US flag fluttering atop the consulate and burn it.
Another young man told a cameraman not to film them. Meanwhile, at least one journalist had his phone taken away over the same objection, getting it back only after the intervention of community elders.

Earlier in the day, protesters had stormed the consulate, scaling its towering gate and damaging property on the premises.
The protesters dissipated following gunfire, including by local law enforcement and armed protesters, but as the news of deaths among protesters spread, more returned to the site — to avenge their comrades as well as their spiritual leader.
According to Imran, a rescue worker with the Edhi Foundation’s ambulance service, the protesters started converging early in the day.
He said that motorcyclists started showing up on the spacious Mai Kolachi Road along the embassy, which was unusual for the weekend.
“A lot of people race here — on bikes, donkey carts, etc,” he explained. He said that by 6am, around 500-600 people had already gathered outside the consulate.
Imran said his ambulance also came under attack during the protest, showing a dent on the side of the vehicle.

“It was right after I grabbed a policeman, who was struggling after being hit by a stone. I shoved him inside the ambulance,” he said.
“If they had caught him, I don’t know what they would have done,” he said.
This uncertainty was also present among the protesters, gathered in pockets all the way to the Keamari bridge; three of them discussed how to salvage a burnt motorcycle, while another said that their leadership had let them down.
“None of our major leaders are here, instead going to Numaish and other places,” he said.
“Either come here to take us there or send us a clear message,” he added.

He had arrived early and was part of the protest. He said that young men were trying to break the bulletproof glass inside the consulate, without success, when they came under fire.
He then pointed to the solar panels and surveillance cameras located on the road.
“Hopefully, we damaged that,” he said.
Meanwhile, back at the main site of the protest, a forklift was bringing a shipping container to seal off access to the US consulate from the Mai Kolachi side.
However, young men soon started hurling stones as police responded with teargas. The clash was back on, and the sounds of gunshots permeated the air, dissipating the crowd, even if for a little while.

Khamenei, who dominated Iran’s political and religious landscape for nearly three decades, was assassinated early Saturday when his high-security residential compound in central Tehran was targeted. Several family members — including his daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law and a grandchild — were also killed in the strike.
The attack came as Israel and the US launched coordinated strikes across multiple Iranian cities, including Tehran, reportedly killing more than 200 people, according to health officials.
The escalation followed three rounds of indirect nuclear talks between Tehran and Washington — most recently in Geneva on Thursday — that failed to produce a breakthrough.
With Khamenei’s death, attention has shifted to the constitutional mechanism that will determine Iran’s next supreme leader. His office announced Sunday that during the transition, the president, the head of the judiciary and a cleric from the Guardian Council will jointly oversee the functions of the Supreme Leader’s office until a successor is chosen.
Role of the Assembly of Experts
At the centre of the succession process is the Assembly of Experts, an influential body tasked with selecting the Islamic Republic’s highest political and religious authority.
It is composed of 88 senior Islamic jurists and clerics elected by popular vote to serve eight-year terms. Its primary responsibility is to appoint a new supreme leader in the event of death, resignation or incapacity.
Since the 1979 revolution, Iran has had only two supreme leaders: Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, and Ali Khamenei, who succeeded him in 1989.
Article 107 of the Iranian Constitution states that “the determination of the Leader rests with the experts elected by the people,” underscoring the Assembly’s authority to vet and appoint the country’s top figure.
Beyond selecting the leader, the body is responsible for supervising his performance and holds the authority to dismiss him if he fails to fulfil his duties.
The assembly’s most recent elections were held in 2024, and it is currently headed by veteran cleric Mohammad Ali Movahedi Kermani.
How is the new leader chosen?
Potential candidates must first be vetted and approved by the Guardian Council, a constitutionally mandated body that screens candidates for key political positions. Only individuals who pass this vetting process are eligible for consideration.
Following Khomeini’s death on June 3, 1989, the Assembly of Experts convened to fill the leadership vacuum at a critical moment, as Iran was emerging from the eight-year war with Iraq. Khamenei was selected as successor, aided by Khomeini’s personal recommendation and an overwhelming vote during an emotionally charged session.
Under constitutional criteria, the supreme leader must be a qualified Islamic jurist, just and pious, well-versed in political and social affairs, and capable of leadership and sound judgment.
If no candidate fully meets all qualifications, the Assembly may select an individual demonstrating strong leadership ability and political competence.
After deliberations, members vote internally, and the candidate securing a majority of votes from those present is appointed.
Internal deliberations
Before a formal vote, the Assembly conducts private deliberations to assess multiple candidates based on religious scholarship, political experience and administrative competence.
These sessions are held behind closed doors, and details are rarely disclosed publicly. However, the 1989 session in which Khamenei was chosen was recorded, and footage shows him visibly emotional after his selection.
Experts note that succession planning is not improvised but the result of years of preparation. Committees within the Assembly evaluate potential candidates and maintain shortlists to ensure readiness.
After Khomeini’s death, several figures were considered before Khamenei ultimately secured 60 out of 74 votes. His experience as president, role during the Iran-Iraq war, and relatively young age at the time were decisive factors.
Potential successors
Unlike 1989, analysts say there is currently no single dominant figure widely viewed as capable of matching Khamenei’s combined political authority and religious standing.
Several names have circulated in non-Iranian media, including his son, Mojtaba Khamenei. However, assessments suggest he is not in the running, or at least not among the leading contenders.
Mojtaba’s wife was reportedly among those killed in the strike on Khamenei’s compound, and he was not present at the compound at the time.
Another figure mentioned in non-Iranian media is Hassan Khomeini, grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, but insiders say he is also not being considered.
Former President Ebrahim Raisi, who died in a helicopter crash in May 2024, had been viewed by many observers as a potential successor, but his death removed a prominent candidate from consideration.</p><small>2026-03-01 14:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/0118165350f1822.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1977063/south-africa-beat-plucky-zimbabwe-ahead-of-new-zealand-semi-final' target='_blank'><strong>South Africa beat plucky Zimbabwe ahead of New Zealand semi-final</strong></a><br><p>South Africa survived a brilliant all-round show by Zimbabwe captain Sikandar Raza to record a five-wicket win on Sunday, which means they remained unbeaten ahead of a semi-final against New Zealand on Wednesday.
After Zimbabwe scored 153-7 in New Delhi, South Africa survived an early wobble.
Dewald Brevis hit 42 off 18 balls as the 2024 runners-up reached 154-5 in 17.5 overs.
Raza earlier hit 73 and then took 3-29 with his off-spin for Zimbabwe, who had stunned Australia and co-hosts Sri Lanka in the group stage to reach the Super Eights.
Raza struck on the third ball of the South African chase to send back Quinton de Kock, caught behind for a duck.
Raza bowled skipper Aiden Markram for four in the next over.
Ryan Rickelton was hit on the helmet by a bouncer from Brad Evans and took five minutes to recover.
He then lifted Evans for two straight sixes in the next over before the bowler had him caught for 31.
Brevis and David Miller, who hit 22, put on 50 before two more quick strikes from Zimbabwe.
Blessing Muzarabani dismissed Miller, and Raza removed Brevis.
Tristan Stubbs (21) and George Linde (30) then put on an unbeaten 53 to steer their side to the target.
After choosing to bat, Zimbabwe lost the in-form opener Brian Bennett, who hit an unbeaten 97 in the defeat by India, for 15.
Raza reached his fifty off 29 balls before falling to left-armer Kwena Maphaka, caught by Miller off a leading edge.
Clive Madande boosted the total with 26 not out off 20 balls at the end.
Maphaka took 2-21 from his four overs and Corbin Bosch 2-40.</p><small>2026-03-01 13:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653550-pm-shehbaz-terms-khameneis-martyrdom-violation-of-international-law' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz terms Khamenei's martyrdom 'violation of international law'</strong></a><br><p>

Flight operation from UAE ‘has not been restored’ so far
Meanwhile, the Pakistan embassy in Abu Dhabi informed the community based in the United Arab Emirates that flight operations had not been restored so far.
It advised Pakistani nationals “to rely on official and verified sources” of the Pakistani embassy in Abu Dhabi or its Consulate General in Dubai.
The embassy also advised them that prior to travelling, they should confirm their flight status with the respective airline before proceeding to the airport.

From the captain Salman Agha, who was criticised for not being a T20 player, to slow batting rates and the use of all-rounders not up to the job, the Green Shirts were shown to be behind the times in the rapid-fire format.
Former wicketkeeper-batsman Kamran Akmal believes there is a huge gulf in standard between Pakistan and the top sides such as India, West Indies, South Africa and England.
“Other teams have evolved to the demands of Twenty20 cricket, but neither our team nor our players meet those standards,” Akmal told AFP.

 

“It is like other teams are playing on the moon and we are on earth. We only beat smaller teams but lose to top teams.”
Pakistan had high hopes for the T20 World Cup after sweeping Australia 3-0 in a pre-tournament series.
The team boasted a quintet of spinners that should have been suited to the turning pitches in Sri Lanka where they played all their matches.
But they received a rude awakening in their first match against the Netherlands when only they squeezed home by three wickets in the final over thanks to Faheem Ashraf’s 11-ball 29.
‘Failed to handle pressure’
Like most of his predecessors at World Cups, Agha blundered in the pressure-cooker match against India, which only went ahead after reversing the decision to boycott the match just days before the encounter.
Agha won the toss and asked India to bat. The decision backfired badly as Pakistan conceded 175 and were hammered by 61 runs.

 

Agha inexplicably held back his mystery spinner and chief weapon Usman Tariq to the 11th over, by which time opener Ishan Kishan had scored his match-shaping 77 and India were well on their way to a winning total.
“How on earth did you bowl at a venue which was suited to batting first,” questioned former Pakistan player Basit Ali.
“After India scored 175 our batters failed to handle the pressure of a chase.”
Agha also held back Tariq’s second over against England, after he took a wicket in his first, allowing captain Harry Brook to build a sparkling match-winning century.
“It was weak captaincy from Agha,” said Akmal, who also took aim at the head coach Mike Hesson and the selectors.
“We were also not helped by head coach Mike Hesson, who has an obsession for bit-and-pieces all-rounders who were neither complete bowlers, nor good batters.”
The insistence in sticking with the out-of-sorts Babar Azam did nothing to help the team’s shaky batting.
The star batsman’s slow scoring at number four interrupted the side’s rhythm.
He was dropped for the final match against Sri Lanka on Saturday where Pakistan finally posted a total in excess of 200, but it proved too little too late as New Zealand progressed on net run rate.
“We are all fans of Azam but he disappointed us by not adapting to the demands of T20 cricket,” said one Pakistan fan, Saud Baloch, who resigned from his job in the United Arab Emirates to go to the World Cup.
“The whole Pakistan fandom is not only disappointed but angry.
“But we know nothing will change and we will continue to mourn such defeats in future.”</p><small>2026-03-01 11:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/010859206d86bc9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976902/pakistan-maintains-delicate-balancing-act-in-unsc-meeting-on-iran' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan maintains delicate balancing act in UNSC meeting on Iran</strong></a><br><p>UNITED NATIONS: Pakistan struck a delicate balance at a tense UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, condemning unwarranted attacks on Iran, expressing solidarity with Gulf states, and urging an immediate return to negotiations and diplomacy.
The Council’s emergency session examined the repercussions of the US and Israeli air strikes on Iran and laid bare the deep divisions within the 15-member body over the escalating crisis. Speaking at the meeting, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, outlined Islamabad’s growing concern as the situation in the Middle East becomes more complex with each new development.
“Pakistan condemns the initiation of unwarranted attacks against the Islamic Republic of Iran, in violation of international law,” the ambassador said.
At the same time, he stressed that Pakistan also “condemns the attacks against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, and stands in solidarity with all these brotherly countries.”
He warned that, at a time when renewed diplomatic efforts were underway, such actions would “undermine the peace and stability of the entire region, with far-reaching consequences.”
Ambassador Ahmad made clear that Pakistan’s concern extends beyond any single capital. Instead, it is focused on the security architecture of the entire Gulf region — home to millions of Pakistani expatriates and a region with which Islamabad maintains deep political, economic and security ties.
This dual condemnation — of strikes on Iran and of attacks on Gulf states — illustrates the fine line Pakistan is walking. It cannot afford to alienate Tehran, a neighbor with whom it shares a sensitive border and a complex security equation. Nor can it distance itself from Gulf partners that host large Pakistani communities and play a critical role in Pakistan’s economy.
The envoy’s emphasis on mediation and dialogue further underscored this balancing act. “We particularly laud Oman’s role in facilitating and mediating dialogue between Iran and the United States,” he said, aligning Pakistan firmly with diplomatic efforts rather than military blocs.
In another pointed observation, he lamented that “diplomacy has once again been derailed as these attacks have happened right in the middle of negotiations,” warning that “these military actions undermine dialogue and further erode trust that was already in short supply.”
Islamabad’s legal framing was equally deliberate. The ambassador reminded the Council that “the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter are inviolable and sacrosanct,” stressing that the Charter “prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of states.”
This formulation allows Pakistan to oppose unilateral or pre-emptive military actions without directly isolating any particular power beyond the immediate incidents.
At the humanitarian level, Pakistan sought to humanise the crisis. Ambassador Ahmad offered condolences to “civilians caught in the middle of these violent acts,” specifically mentioning “school children in Iran” and the family of a Pakistani national killed in the United Arab Emirates. In doing so, Islamabad reinforced its message that ordinary people — Iranians, Arabs and Pakistanis alike — are the real victims of escalation.
The strategic anxiety was also explicit. “We are deeply alarmed at the risk of regional conflagration,” the ambassador said, noting that the “safety and well-being of millions of our compatriots in the countries of the region is also our top priority.”
Ultimately, Pakistan’s message was straightforward but urgent: “Pakistan calls on all sides to immediately halt escalation and urgently resume diplomacy with a view to achieving a peaceful, negotiated resolution to the crisis.”
Whether the balance Islamabad seeks to maintain can endure will depend not only on its own diplomatic agility, but also on whether the region itself steps back from the brink.</p><small>2026-03-01 10:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653523-emergency-helplines-announced-for-pakistanis-in-gulf-states' target='_blank'><strong>Emergency helplines announced for Pakistanis in Gulf states</strong></a><br><p>

What is the endgame here?</strong></a><br><p>On the international chessboard, no piece can move as freely as the United States. It moves vertically, horizontally and diagonally, across any number of squares. Regime change in Venezuela, blockades on Cuba, strikes on Iran, all within a few months. It can move north, east, south and west.
And Iran? Iran is the opposing king trapped in a corner by not only the king and rook (Israel), but also its own pawns — the many factions inside Iran that the Israelis have been funding to rise up against it. A war against it from abroad and at home.
In refusing to capitulate, the Iranians have decided they would rather die on their feet than be checkmated on their knees in front of their rivals.
The opening gambit
By the day prior to the strikes, the US had at least 50 per cent of its deployable air power around the Middle East poised to attack Iran, including more than 250 combat aircraft. As Professor Pape from the University of Chicago notes, the US had never deployed this much force against a potential enemy and not launched strikes.
All the while, the Iranians were making significant concessions to the US, including importantly that they would even allow American inspectors into the country for verification on their nuclear programme. Trump’s Special Envoy Steve Witkoff remarked that Trump was surprised that the Iranians were not completely capitulating with this much firepower at their doorstep. But Trump had fundamentally misread the Iranian regime’s goal in entering these discussions; which was to prevent their evisceration without subjugation.
At the heart of this, is the Iranian government’s core principle after the revolution of 1979: independence (istiqlal). Iran’s refusal to give up its ballistic missile programme and support for proxies was the country stating that it would rather court war than give up its sovereignty. Consequently, the ambition of Tel Aviv comes up against the defiance of Tehran.
The Omani Foreign Minister went on CBS News the night before the strikes to publicly state how well the negotiations were going, in what seems to be a last ditch effort to avert war. Most importantly, states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Turkey were against this war. These states have been lobbying behind the scenes against the US attacking. The Saudis’ shift in stance appears to have come after Israel’s attack on Hamas in Qatar last year, and its apparent realisation that there needs to be a counter to Israeli hegemony.

 

However, the unprecedented compromises made by the proud pragmatists of Iran were not enough for the Israelis and their powerful co-religionists in the US for whom the balkanisation of Iran is the goal. It has now been revealed by an Israeli officer that the day for the strikes was decided weeks ago, regardless of how negotiations were going. It seems that again negotiations were used as a ruse for preparations. This is yet another indication that the Russians are right about the Americans: they are agreement non-capable. Dialogue does not matter, only the clenched fist.
A game played outside the rules
The strikes against Iran are manifestly illegal and a clear violation of Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter. The Western press has already publicised the incorrect claim that Israel and the US are fighting a war of pre-emptive self-defence against Iran. As Marco Milanović, international law scholar points out, the use of force against Iran would be lawful only if “(1) Iran had the intent (i.e. its leadership decided) to attack the US/Israel; (2) it had the capability to do so; (3) and it was necessary to use force today, because today would be the last window of opportunity to prevent this future attack”.
None of these conditions are met and the argument for pre-emptive self-defence (even if an argument for pre-emption is accepted which many states reject) is even weaker considering President Trump said that the US had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear capability last year.
There is no argument of international law under which these strikes could be lawful given there was no imminent armed attack by Iran which is being thwarted. Iran now has the right to self-defence, under Article 51 of the UN Charter, to respond to these attacks.
The coming moves
Despite President Trump’s fervent belief in the invincibility of the US military, there were a number of leaks from the Pentagon in the days leading up to the war in which officials flagged their concerns about a lengthy conflict.
A long war seems to be Iran’s best bet with the US military being better at ‘one and done’ strikes like the abduction of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro and the assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. Lengthier conflicts, like Iraq and Afghanistan, are much riskier, especially given the current run on the US’ munitions stockpiles and air defence interceptors.
Wargames conducted in 2023 noted that in the event of a war with China, “the United States would likely run out of some munitions — such as long-range, precision-guided munitions — in less than one week.”
However, that is if Iran can last that long. So far it seems that the US has engaged in attacking military targets while Israel has engaged in decapitation strikes, which includes their key target: Iranian Ayatollah Khamenei. They are going after regime officials in an effort to topple it and end the war sooner. However, it may be that regime hardliners come into power and wrest control.

 

Iran is exporting the destruction meted upon it to the US bases of the Arab regimes which surround it. These regimes have subcontracted their protection to the Americans, and Iran has chosen to attack them for this dignity deficit. It hopes that the more damage it inflicts on them means they will clamour for a ceasefire to the Americans on its behalf. Part of this strategy may include Iran closing the Strait of Hormuz through which 20 per cent of world’s oil consumption flows, destabilising the world’s economy.
As it is with most asymmetric conflicts, Iran wins if it doesn’t lose, and the US loses if it doesn’t win.
The board after the game
On February 27, the day before Israel struck Iran, Yoav Gallant, former Israeli Minister of Defence and wanted war criminal by the International Criminal Court, wrote an article titled ‘The Next Strategic Shift in the Middle East’. I read the article anticipating it would be about Israel’s war with Iran, but it wasn’t.
Gallant’s focus of the piece was Turkiye. He advocates for a pivot to countering the Eurasian country, stating that ‘[t]he weakening of Iran is a significant achievement. But the structure replacing it will define the next generation of regional order. Turkey is already positioning itself at the center of that structure, with the military capacity, the institutional reach, and the ambition to shape what comes next’.
When the US was invading Iraq in 2003, Zionists were supporting that war but already wanting to turn to Iran immediately after, popularising the slogan “Anyone can go to Baghdad. Real men go to Tehran.”
It seems now, Israelis are already saying “Anyone can go to Tehran. Real men go to Ankara.”
Israel is, as always, planning a few moves ahead.</p><small>2026-03-01 08:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653491-what-the-cjp-told-the-pti-chairman' target='_blank'><strong>What CJP told PTI chairman</strong></a><br><p>

His assassination removes a figure who for more than three decades stood at the apex of Iran’s political, military and religious order. Yet those expecting the immediate collapse of the Iranian system may be misreading both its structure and its history.
Ayatollah Khamenei was not merely a head of state. As Supreme Leader, he exercised ultimate authority over foreign policy, the armed forces and the direction of the revolution. As Marjai Taqleed, a source of emulation in Shia jurisprudence, he embodied religious legitimacy that extended beyond Iran’s borders. His passing, therefore, creates a vacuum that is institutional as much as personal.

 

Under Iran’s constitution, an interim council comprising President Masoud Pezeshkian, the judiciary chief, and a cleric from the Guardian Council is to assume responsibilities until the Assembly of Experts appoints a successor.
The Assembly must choose from among senior Shia clerics. No consensus candidate has so far emerged.
Names circulating in Tehran include Sadeq Larijani, the former judiciary chief and a close aide to Khamenei; Alireza Arafi, who oversees Iran’s seminaries; Mohsen Araki, a longtime member of the Assembly; Mohsen Qomi, an adviser within the Supreme Leader’s office; and Hassan Khomeini, the grandson of the Islamic Republic’s founder, Ruhollah Khomeini.
Arafi, a source said, may be the favourite for filling in the space left behind by Ayatollah Khamenei.
The late Ebrahim Raisi had been widely seen as a frontrunner before his own death in an air crash. Reports that Ayatollah Khamenei had quietly identified three potential successors during earlier crises suggest that contingency planning was already underway, though the names remain undisclosed.
Institutional depth
Despite the shock, Iran’s system is not built around one man alone. The Islamic Republic rests on multiple pillars, including the clerical establishment, security services, the bureaucracy, and an ideological base shaped by the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih.
Unlike personality-driven autocracies, it therefore has institutional depth.
During the transition phase, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is likely to play a decisive role in managing the affair. Whether as a stabiliser or dominant force, it will seek to prevent fragmentation.

That, however, does not mean friction is impossible. Economic sanctions have already strained society and fueled periodic unrest. Elite rivalries could surface as factions maneuver for influence over the next Supreme Leader.
A hardline successor would definitely double down on ideological orthodoxy. Even if a relatively moderate cleric is chosen, immediate flexibility toward the West appears unlikely, as regimes, in moments of perceived siege, tend to project strength, not compromise.
Iran’s own history counsels against premature obituaries. The Islamic Republic has faced moments far more perilous and yet endured. During the Iran-Iraq War, when the revolution was still young, Iran confronted invasion, diplomatic isolation, and crippling arms embargoes.
It answered not by retreat but by mobilising society through revolutionary zeal and religious conviction, expanding the Basij volunteer force and adjusting its economy to survive under siege.
During that period, the Hafte Tir bombing, carried out by the militant Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), eliminated 74 senior officials in one stroke, among them Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti and several cabinet members.
It was a decapitation attempt targeting the heart of the nascent revolution. Yet the system did not unravel. Vacancies were filled with speed, institutions closed ranks, and the doctrine of Velayat e Faqih was consolidated rather than diluted.

 

The external consequences are already visible. Iran has responded to aggression with missile and drone strikes against Israel and US facilities in the Gulf. Its network of regional allies and proxies, often described as the Axis of Resistance, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, is expected to intensify asymmetrical attacks.
Ayatollah Khamenei’s death will be framed as martyrdom, a narrative that resonates deeply within Shia political theology and could mobilise supporters from Iraq to Bahrain and eastern Saudi Arabia.

For Israel, the operation may have removed a principal adversary, but it also introduces new unpredictability. Khamenei, though implacably opposed to Israel, was a calculating actor who calibrated escalation.
A leadership in transition, under pressure to demonstrate resolve, may be less restrained. Multi-front confrontations stretching from the Gulf to the Levant become more conceivable.
Strategic gamble
The US under President Donald Trump has presented the assassination as an act of “justice” and even an opportunity for Iranians to reclaim their country.
Yet history offers caution. Air power alone seldom topples entrenched systems absent ground intervention or a coherent internal uprising. Instead, external attack often consolidates ruling elites and blunts domestic dissent, at least in the short term.
The strategic gamble is therefore immense. If retaliation expands to target US assets across West Asia, Washington could find itself drawn deeper into a conflict without a clear political end state.
Moreover, with the erosion of deterrence, cycles of strike and counterstrike may harden into a wider war. And if the Islamic Republic survives, as seems probable in the near term, it may emerge more securitized and more distrustful.
Khamenei’s assassination has closed one chapter in Iran’s revolutionary history, but it does not automatically open another aligned with the ambitions of those who ordered the strike. Instead, it ushers in a period of uncertainty.
The Islamic Republic is wounded but not necessarily weakened and the region is unsettled and more combustible. The world may soon discover that removing a man is far easier than reshaping the order he helped build.</p><small>2026-03-01 07:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/653501-kwssip-accelerates-k-iv-pipeline-work-to-meet-deadline' target='_blank'><strong>KWSSIP accelerates K-IV pipeline work to meet deadline</strong></a><br><p>

KARACHI: An official of Civil Defence has informed the Gul Plaza Judicial Commission that the fire and rescue service of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), as well as the Rescue 1122, were equipped with advanced machinery, but failed to douse the fire efficiently and rescue people trapped inside the burning building on Jan 17.
He also deposed that premature shutdown of electricity, lack of emergency/backup lights and closure of gates had further exacerbated panic among people stuck in the ill-fated building and significantly impaired evacuation efforts.
Mirza Mursaleen Baig, a technical instructor at the Civil Defence department, further testified that fire safety measures were found inadequate during an inspection of the building, but a challan could not be filed in court over non-compliance with safety regulations.
While mainly shifting responsibility of the tragic incident to the fire crew and rescue services, he maintained that Civil Defence was facing a severe shortage of staff and resources, and it was impossible to inspect all the buildings comprehensively.
Earlier, the single-member commission headed by Justice Agha Faisal of the Sindh High Court had directed additional controller Civil Defence Fatima Memon to respond to its various questions after outgoing director Abdul Hameed informed it that he could not reply to the questionnaires as he was no longer holding the charge.
However, Mr Baig turned up before the commission, tasked with probing the devastating blaze, and informed it that he was assisting Ms Memon, who has been placed under suspension after the Gul Plaza fire incident.
In his testimony recorded under oath, the technical instructor said that inspection and fire prevention in commercial and industrial sectors and holding training sessions for firefighting/casualty were core responsibilities of Civil Defence.

 

He deposed that inspections of the ill-fated building were carried out in 2024 and 2025, and that fire safety measures were found inadequate, while the building management was directed to comply with safety regulations.
He also said that generally, Civil Defence used to file challans before the special courts in case of non-compliance, but the same could not be filed in this particular case due to the unavailability of courts/judge. The official conceded that the courts had become functional in July last year; however, the challan was not placed before it till the devastating fire incident took place.
Based on available information, Mr Baig further testified that it was a class “B” fire involving multiple types of highly flammable material/fuel, including plastic, rubber, melamine crockery, fabrics, cosmetic products, etc.
As per standard fire safety principles, the electricity is ordinarily shut down where the fire originates from an electrical short circuit, categorising the same as class “C” fire, whereas immediate disconnection of power in class “B” fire was not necessarily mandated unless there is a direct electrical hazard, he maintained.
He also deposed that the premature shutdown of power had contributed to darkness in the premises and panic among the people present inside the building at the time of the incident.
The official of Civil Defence further testified that the exit points should have remained open to facilitate the evacuation, as closure of gates, darkness and smoke have significantly impaired evacuation efforts.
Under the applicable fire safety laws and standard operating procedures (SOPs), the technical instructor was of the view that the building management was required to maintain firefighting capacity sufficient for around 15 minutes before the arrival of emergency services.
He also said that no separate emergency lighting arrangements were installed at the passages/corridors, which were normally required to function in the event of a power shutdown during a fire emergency.
The absence of such emergency lights had further exacerbated panic among occupants, particularly in darkness combined with thick smoke, he said, and further asserted that Civil Defence was facing a severe shortage of staff and resources as there were only 88 personnel for the whole province.
He maintained that only six persons were assigned to the South district with no supporting staff, and under such constraints, it was humanly impossible to inspect all buildings comprehensively.
About the Gul Plaza fire, the technical instructor of Civil Defence said, “I state that the primary responsibility lies with the KMC fire and rescue services and the Rescue 1122 department. They are equipped with advanced machinery such as special oxygen masks with tanks, tools and specialised SOPs to handle such emergencies.
Unfortunately, due to a lack of awareness or negligence, they failed to extinguish the fire effectively and rescue the trapped individuals”.
Thereafter, the commission invited the director general of Rescue 1122 and the chief fire officer to cross-examine the technical instructor of Civil Defence, as he had levelled accusations of serious nature.

However, the collection recorded an 11 per cent increase to Rs8.121 trillion during July-February FY26, compared with Rs7.334tr raised in the same period last year, according to provisional figures released on Saturday.
The FBR had set a revenue collection target of Rs8.550tr for 8MFY26. The revenue shortfall is primarily attributed to a slowdown in domestic sales tax collection, suspension of super tax and several other factors.
The February collection grew by 12pc to Rs944bn from Rs844bn in the corresponding month last year. However, the collection fell short of the monthly target of Rs1.029tr by Rs85 bn.

Records 11pc YoY rise to Rs8.121tr; income, sales tax collection falls

The IMF, in its last review, has already revised down the FBR’s annual tax collection target by Rs150bn.
In FY25, the FBR missed its collection target by nearly Rs163bn, even after two downward revisions and raised Rs11.737tr against the revised target of Rs11.900tr. However, the collection reflects a year-on-year growth of 26.19pc from Rs9.301tr in FY24.
The FBR issued Rs386bn in refunds and rebates to taxpayers during 8MFY26, up from Rs352bn a year earlier, an increase of 9.65pc.
Income tax collection reached Rs3.956tr during 8MFY26, recording a shortfall of Rs142bn against the Rs4.098tr target. However, a 12pc increase was recorded compared to Rs3.525tr in the corresponding period last year.
Similarly, the sales tax collection totalled Rs2.783tr, recording a shortfall of Rs245bn against the Rs3.028tr projection, though it marked a 10pc rise over last year’s Rs2.530tr. Customs duty collection stood at Rs850bn, against the Rs898bn target, resulting in a shortfall of Rs48bn. However, it grew by 5pc compared to Rs813bn last year.
In contrast, the Federal Excise Duty collection reached Rs532bn, surpassing the projected target of Rs526bn and growing by 14pc from last year’s Rs467bn.
According to the FBR, income tax collection will improve further once the super tax is collected. This improved revenue collection performance is not incidental but reflects the structural impact of the FBR’s reforms, especially its enhanced enforcement measures and its coordinated effort to realise revenue stuck in litigation.
The improvement in large-scale manufacturing (LSM) production, a very positive and encouraging development, will help raise maximum sales tax collection in the upcoming months.
By leveraging digital infrastructure and the collection through enforcement measures, the FBR is improving compliance, expanding and deepening the tax net, and fostering taxpayer trust. This performance in direct taxes signals emerging behavioural shifts toward greater voluntary compliance, with potential spill-over benefits in the coming months.
FBR vows to collect due taxes
Federal Board of Revenue Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial said on Saturday that genuine hardship cases would receive special consideration, but stressed that all legally due taxes would be collected under any circumstances.
The chairman further said that tax evasion would not be tolerated. He was speaking with an 18-member delegation from the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI), led by its President, Sardar Tahir Mahmood, at the FBR headquarters.
The delegation discussed key taxation issues faced by the business community in the federal capital.
During the meeting, the ICCI delegation apprised the FBR chairman of various challenges confronting businesses in the capital, including issues related to super tax, tax refunds, point-of-sale (PoS) integration for small businesses, taxation of the real estate and property sector and other operational hardships.
Mr Langrial and assured the delegation that we will do everything we can to support the business community. He emphasised that genuine hardship cases would be given special consideration, while reiterating that the collection of taxes payable under the law would be ensured and tax evasion would not be tolerated under any circumstances.
The Inland Revenue’s members legal and operations responded to the queries raised by the ICCI representatives and provided clarifications on relevant matters.
The FBR chairman stated that establishing a business-friendly environment remains the priority. He directed the concerned wings to examine the issues highlighted by the business community and resolve their genuine concerns at the earliest.

Confidence in the country’s direction has increased more than threefold from 12pc to 40pc since the current government came to power, reaching its highest level soon after the Pakistan-India conflict.
These findings are contained in the Consumer Confidence Index report for the first quarter of 2026. The survey was conducted by a market research company, Ipsos, which interviewed more than 1,000 people across the country. Although economic concerns rem­ain the most worrying, their intensity has fallen sha­rply across all indicators since the first quarter of 2024.
The most pressing issues of inflation, poverty and unemployment have declined significantly over the past two years under the government.
Asked about the current state of the economy, one in four Pakistanis said the economy was strong, with the perception led by men, youth, residents of Punjab and Sindh, and affluent respondents.
“The perception of a strong economy has jumped from 4pc to 23pc, a sixfold increase, since the first quarter of 2024 after the government took office, approaching its highest recorded level,” the report stated.
The survey revealed that only 12pc Pakistanis feel comfortable making household purchases, with higher comfort levels among youth, affluent groups, urban residents and those living in Punjab.
“Comfort in making household purchases has tripled from 4pc to 12pc over the past two years, marking steady progress during the government’s two-year term,” it said.
Regarding economic expectations, one in three Pakistanis expects the economy to strengthen, with optimism highest among youth, rural residents, upper- and lower-income groups, and people in Punjab.
Personal financial optimism has reached an almost record high of 40pc, up from 35pc since the first quarter of 2024, reflecting sustained positive sentiment under the government. When asked about their personal financial situation, 40pc of respondents expected improvement, with optimism strongest among youth, men, Punjab residents, and upper- and middle-income groups.
Comfort in making major purchases edged up from 2pc to 5pc over the past two years, indicating modest improvement.

Following the increase, the price of petrol has jumped from Rs258.17 to Rs266.17 while the HSD price now stands at Rs280.86.
According to the press release, the government has revised the petroleum products’ prices based on the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority’s recommendations.
The new prices are effective from March 1, the press release said.
Petrol is mostly used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers and has a direct bearing on the budget of the middle and lower-middle class.
While the heavy transport sector runs on HSD, its price is considered inflationary as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains and agricultural engines like trucks, buses, tractors, tube-wells and threshers, and particularly adds to the prices of vegetables and other eatables.</p><small>2026-03-01 03:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/03/010836108e68836.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1976835/no-let-up-as-pak-afghan-clashes-enter-third-day' target='_blank'><strong>No let-up as Pak-Afghan clashes enter third day</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: There was no let-up in fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the conflict entered its third day despite efforts by the international community to de-escalate the situation, which has claimed scores of lives since Thursday night.
The clashes started after the Afghan Taliban targeted Pakistani positions along the border in response to earlier air strikes by Pakistan in multiple Afghan provinces to target the militants involved in cross-border attacks. Pakistan launched the operation ‘Ghazb lil Haq’ in response and took out military targets across Afghanistan.
On Saturday, the armed forces continued ground and air operations against the Afghan Taliban overnight, striking formation headquarters in Nangarhar and other areas.
The headquarters of the Afghan army in Kandahar and Nangarhar provinces were destroyed in targeted air strikes carried out by the armed forces, said security sources. State-run media reported that air strikes “hit two targets at the Mohmand Dara Base in Nangarhar” while Afghan Taliban posts near Miranshah and in the Ghulam Khan sector along the border were also destroyed.

Info ministry says 331 Taliban combatants killed, 104 posts destroyed so far

In a statement on Saturday, Info­rmation Minister Attaullah Tarar claimed that under the operation ‘Ghazab lil-Haq’, the armed forces have killed “331 Afghan Taliban personnel and injured more than 500 others” since the start of the operation. He said that the armed forces had destroyed 104 posts and captured 22 others. According to the minister, 163 tanks and other vehicles were also destroyed, and 37 locations had been targeted across the border.
Amid intense clashes along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, authorities across the country took a series of precautionary measures, such as hospital emergencies in areas near the border and a ban on drones in almost all parts of the country.
According to a notification, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir government imposed an immediate and complete ban on outdoor drone flying across the territory for 30 days to ensure the safety of citizens and protection of public and private installations amid heightened tensions along the country’s western borders.
Meanwhile, in Landi Kotal, the authorities relocated all 37 under-trial prisoners to a lockup in Jamrud after mortar shells fired from Afghanistan fell in the nearby tehsil offices compound. Officials said that the tehsil offices compound was earlier vacated, with district administration officials advised to work from home. The ‘open war’ also took a toll on the Afghan refugees, as the state authorities intensified their crackdown against them.
Claim rejected
The information ministry rejected claims about a Pakistani jet being shot down in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar.
The ministry’s fact-check account on X attributed the claims to Afghan Taliban officials that were “amplified by Indian media”.
“The Ministry of Defence of the so-called Islamic Emirate claimed that Afghan forces shot down a Pakistani fighter jet in Nangarhar and captured its pilot alive. The claim was widely amplified by Indian media and Afghan propaganda outlets,” it said.
A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not view Pakistan as the aggressor in the latest escalation and that Islamabad was under pressure to address its security challenges, Reuters reported, adding Wash­ington hoped the situation would not escalate further.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that “our cup of patience has overflowed” and described the fighting as “open war”, warning that Pakistan would respond to further attacks.
According to Reuters, Taliban deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said 19 civilians were killed and 26 wounded in Khost and Paktika. Reuters could not verify the claim.
Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani said in a speech in Khost province that the conflict “will be very costly”, and that Afghan forces had not deployed broadly beyond those already engaged.
Pakistan’s military capabilities far exceed those of Afghanistan, with a standing army of hundreds of thousands and a modern air force. In stark contrast, the Taliban lacks a conventional air force and relies largely on light weaponry and ground forces.

The aircraft, a C-130 Hercules transport plane — manufactured by Lockheed Martin — veered off the runway at El Alto Intern­ational Airport and crashed into an avenue, destroying multiple cars and damaging trucks, local media footage showed.
Mangled parts of the aircraft were seen on the road where the plane came down and bystanders could be seen rushing to grab the scattered cash prompting police to deploy tear gas to repel the hordes. Authorities were later seen setting the money alight in a bonfire at the scene of the crash.
It was not immediately known what caused the crash but witnesses told AFP that the weather had been treacherous.

28 injured as hospitals launch emergency blood donation drive

The Ministry of Defence said it would launch an investigation into the crash.
Colonel Rene Tambo, head of the police homicide division in El Alto, told reporters late Friday that “there are about 20, maybe a few more,” casualties.
Colonel Pavel Tovar of the National Fire Department gave an earlier toll of “between 15 and 16 people” dead in the disaster.
“We are recovering the bodies of these people who have sadly suffered in the accident,” he said.
Bolivia’s health ministry rep­orted that at least 28 people were injured.
Money grab ‘a crime’
Fatalities were recorded both at the airport and on the busy avenue where the plane crashed and struck several vehicles.
The Bolivian Air Navigation and Airports authority NAABOL said in a statement that the C-130 Hercules had departed from the eastern city of Santa Cruz and crashed while landing at El Alto international airport, which has since suspended operations.
The defence ministry in a statement said that “the money transported in the crashed aircraft has no official serial number… therefore it has no legal or purchasing power.” It said that “its collection, possession, or use constitutes a crime.”
The La Paz Prosecutor’s Office received reports of businesses that were also targeted by criminals taking advantage of the chaos.
“Twelve people have been arrested” for questioning, prosecutor Luis Carlos Torres told reporters.
Hospitals in El Alto also launched a blood donation campaign to treat the injured.
La Paz, at an altitude of 1,975 feet and surrounded by Andean peaks, is the highest administrative capital in the world.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi opened US firm Micron Tech­n­o­logy’s Semiconductor Assembly, Test and Packaging unit in his home state of Gujarat, hailing the “dawn of a new era” for India’s technology ambitions.
“When young Indians look back in the future, they will see this decade as the turning point in our tech future,” Modi told the event, which was broadcast on his official YouTube channel.
The plant will convert advanced semiconductor wafers from Micron’s global network into finished memory and storage products.
India’s semiconductor market has expanded from $38 billion in 2023 to an estimated $45-50bn in 2024-25, with government targets of up to $110bn by 2030.
New Delhi is currently developing 10 chip projects worth more than $18bn , including two cutting-edge 3-nanometre des­ign facilities in the cities of Noida and Bengaluru.
Modi said at least three other semiconductor projects would begin production soon.
“India, which is known for software, is now also building its identity in hardware,” he said.

 

The prime minister linked the launch to deepening technological cooperation with Washington, noting India’s entry into the US-led Pax Silica alliance focused on artificial intelligence, critical minerals and supply-chain security — areas where China holds considerable sway.
“The entire world wants to secure these supply cha­ins which are key for hum­anity’s future,” Modi said.
The US ambassador to India, Sergio Gor, said the opening marked “India’s entry into the global semiconductor supply chain as a manufacturer nation”.
“This is just the beginning,” Gor said.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Int­ernational Airlines (PIA) suspended flights to several Gulf countries on Saturday, joining a cascade of global carriers grounding aircraft across the Middle East after US and Israeli strikes on Iran plunged the region into a renewed military conflict and shut down major air corridors.
According to a statement by the PIA spokesperson, flights have been suspended to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Qatar, and Kuwait.
“These flights will not operate until tomorrow evening or until the restoration of airspace, whichever comes later,” the spokesperson said.
“PIA flights to Saudi Arabia will continue; however, their routes have been changed,” he added.
“Flights have been shifted to Boeing 777 aircraft and will reach their destinations via longer routes,” the spokesperson added.







The national carrier requested the travellers to contact the PIA call centre at 111-786-786 for information related to their flights or changes in the booking of flights.
The widespread disruption followed a series of Israeli strikes on Iran and retaliatory missile salvoes from Tehran, forcing an immediate shutdown of airspace over at least seven countries.
The conflict’s most significant impact was felt at Dubai International Airport, the world’s busiest for international travel. Dubai Airports announced a suspension of all flights until further notice, a move echoed by its flagship carrier, Emirates.
Flydubai, its sister airline, also halted operations, while in the neighbouring Emirati capital, Etihad Airways suspended all departures from Abu Dhabi until Sunday morning and cancelled expected arrivals.
The skies over Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Jordan were virtually empty on Saturday, according to flight-tracking service Flightradar24, as civilian aircraft were rerouted around a vast no-fly zone. The European Union’s aviation regulator, EASA, recommended that its airlines stay out of the affected airspace.
Oman Air has also announced cancellations and temporary suspensions of several flights due to the evolving regional situation.
Major international carriers moved swiftly to suspend services. British Airways cancelled flights to Tel Aviv and Bahrain until March 3. Germany’s Lufthansa suspended flights to and from Dubai for the weekend and halted routes to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Oman until March 7.
Air France cancelled flights to Tel Aviv, Beirut and Dubai, while Italy’s ITA Airways suspended its Tel Aviv route and announced it would avoid the airspace of Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan and Lebanon until March 7. Wizz Air halted flights to Israel, Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Amman until the same date.
The chaos rippled eastward, with Air India and Indigo suspending flights to the Middle East. Russia’s transport ministry said its air carriers had suspended flights to both Iran and Israel.
Regional carriers were also profoundly affected, with Qatar Airways and Kuwait Airways temporarily suspending all flights from their home hubs after their national airspace was closed.
Turkish Airlines cancelled flights to 10 Middle Eastern nations, though some Gulf suspensions were only for Saturday.
The sudden shutdown caught many flights mid-air, with a LOT Polish Airlines flight from Warsaw to Dubai forced to return to its origin city. Virgin Atlantic said it would temporarily avoid Iraqi airspace, causing some re-routing.
Throughout the day, more airlines suspended services, including Swiss, KLM, Iberia Express, SAS, Finnair, and Norwegian. Regional operators like Air Algerie and Aegean Airlines also grounded routes. Japan Airlines also cancelled a flight to the region.

Pakistan were knocked out on net run rate despite beating Sri Lanka in their final Super Eights match in Kandy on Saturday.
“We have underperformed in the whole tournament,” Agha told reporters.
“We are out of the semis due to our failure in decision-making in pressure situations.”
Opener Sahibzada Farhan became the only player to score two hundreds in the same T20 World Cup as Pakistan posted 212-8.
But they failed to restrict Sri Lanka to 147 and New Zealand went through to the semi-finals.
“Farhan was outstanding in the tournament but none of the other batters could come up to expectations,” said Agha, who only managed 60 runs in seven tournament matches.
Sri Lankan skipper Dasun Shanaka hit 76 not out off 31 balls with eight sixes as Sri Lanka scored 207-6 to lose by five runs.
A rained-off Super Eights opener against New Zealand and a defeat to England left Pakistan needing to beat Sri Lanka by a massive margin to advance.
“(Head coach Mike) Hesson and I take the responsibility as we selected the eleven for the matches,” said Agha, who added he would not make an immediate call on whether to stand down as captain.
“I will go back and take some time to decide,” he said.
“Because at this point in time, stepping down would be an emotional decision.”</p><small>2026-02-28 19:01</small></div><hr>
