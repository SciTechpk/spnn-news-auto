According to the report, he made the remarks as a delegation of the National Paigham-i-Aman Committee (NPAC), led by its Chairman Hafiz Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi, met with the DG ISPR in Rawalpindi.
“Speaking on the occasion, the DG ISPR emphasised that unity and consensus on matters of national security and narrative were the need of the hour,” it said.
He said a comprehensive discussion was held on internal security challenges in the context of Fitna al Khawarij, Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Tehreek-i-Taliban Afghanistan, which further strengthened the shared stance of all stakeholders, it said.
“Reiterating Islamabad’s principled position on Kashmir and Gaza, DG ISPR said supporting oppressed peoples is Pakistan’s moral responsibility, ” it added.
He stressed that public awareness and a truth-based narrative were decisive tools in countering the enemy’s psychological warfare, the report said.
Terming the meeting as highly productive, the DG ISPR expressed hope for further progress in building trust and enhancing practical cooperation in the days ahead, it said.
Meanwhile, the NPAC delegation expressed unwavering solidarity with Pakistan’s armed forces and reaffirmed their collective resolve to counter anti-state narratives and hostile propaganda, it said.
Assuring full cooperation in promoting the national narrative, the committee strongly condemned Fitna al Khawarij as well as the Afghan Taliban, stressing that terrorism had no justification under any circumstances, the report said.
The committee also announced plans to disseminate the message of Islamic unity, social harmony and constitutional equality across the country through mosques and other religious platforms, it said, adding that it was also agreed to adopt a zero-tolerance policy against hate speech and sectarianism.
The committee also proposed enhancing awareness and guidance sessions in mosques, seminaries and universities to effectively promote the state narrative.</p><small>2026-01-13 11:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13145659d4b999d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966733/over-29000-trees-removed-in-islamabad-talal-chaudhry-says-more-to-be-planted' target='_blank'><strong>Over 29,000 trees removed in Islamabad; Talal Chaudhry says more to be planted</strong></a><br><p>Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry on Tuesday informed irked lawmakers in the National Assembly that 29,115 trees had been removed from the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), but that more than this number would be planted in the coming months.
In the past few days, there has been widespread criticism over the cutting of thousands of mature trees in various locations of the federal capital, including the levelling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian.
PTI MNA Riaz Fatyana moved a calling attention notice on the tree-cutting in the federal capital and the public concern it was causing.
Responding to him, Chaudhry said 29,115 trees have been removed, while “40,000 trees of more than 8-10 feet have been planted”.
He added that another 60,000 trees will be planted in the same areas on March 30, when the weather will be more suitable for planting.

 

The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has maintained that only paper mulberry trees were removed, as they had been causing pollen allergy. However, social media users had alleged that, besides paper mulberry, indigenous trees were also chopped down, making Shakarparian look like barren land.
Climate Change Minister Musadiq Malik has defended the move, stating that paper mulberry was an invasive and “life-threatening” species.
Speaking in the NA, Chaudhry acknowledged that it was a matter of high importance and had been under discussion in the media for many days.
He explained that there were “three possible reasons” for removing the trees: the presence of paper mulberry species; areas designated as brown zones in Islamabad’s Master Plan but commonly regarded as green until development began, including Embassy Road; and sectors also considered green areas until they were built.
He invited the house and the journalists to assess the green areas based on the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) process, adding that the responsible authorities would be answerable if greenery is reduced or green areas are converted into brown.
“Greenery declined till 2020, but the data from 2023-2025 shows that the percentage of greenery has increased compared to before,” the state minister said.







Chaudhry also called for it “not to be made a fashion to make Islamabad the target of criticism or personally hit the CDA chairman”. He added that the decisions were not made by any one person, but taken under a policy.
On the criticism of infrastructure projects based on the argument that trees had to be cut for them, Chaudhry offered to give an on-ground briefing to parliamentarians and journalists on all such projects carried out under the current government.
“If any tree was removed, mature trees four times that number were planted,” he asserted.
On the reason for removing the paper mulberry species, Chaudhry highlighted that “by-air seeding” was carried out during Islamabad’s initial development to add greenery.
“Over time, it became evident that some of these species were hazardous to health, causing allergies and other issues,” he said.
The state minister recalled the Islamabad High Court’s 2009 order to speed up the eradication of paper mulberry trees to mitigate pollen allergies, and the formation of a committee in 2020 to ensure environmental protection in the capital.

 

He also cited a Supreme Court order from 2024, its suo-motu notice and the subsequent involvement of two forest experts regarding the removal of paper mulberry trees from the F-9 Park.
As a result, a standard operating procedure (SOP) was determined wherein a survey of the tree species and numbers is first conducted, followed by a public hearing, before proceeding to felling the trees.
Responding to a query by Fatyana, Chaudhry said, “We have not earned money by removing trees”. Instead, he added, money has been spent to remove trees harmful to health, as the roots of the paper mulberry species also need to be taken out.
“I am saying with utmost responsibility that no other species was removed,” he asserted.







PPP, PTI lawmakers raise concerns over ‘large-scale’ tree-cutting
Reacting to Chaudhry’s explanation, PPP’s Sharmila Faruqui said he had “attempted to justify the mass-cutting of trees, but nowhere in the world trees were felled on such a vast scale due to health issues, or pollen allergy from paper mulberry trees”.
She cited Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States as examples, stating that “targeted control” was employed there to get rid of saplings.
“There is a kingship. You stood up and said to root out the Green Belt because you suddenly realised that it was causing pollen allergy. It does not happen like this; there is a procedure,” Faruqui said.
She claimed that “huge mature trees” were cut down, adding: “This is no justification that you remove the entire Green Belt and say ‘we have planted four saplings’. Those four saplings would not grow up even in 50 years.”
Responding to her, Chaudhry said, “If you want to solve the issue, then stop point-scoring.”
He declared: “We will be responsible if the green area has decreased due to any mega-project, development, or court order.”
The state minister asserted there was “no kingship” and a proper process was followed.
MQM-P’s Farooq Sattar said he agreed with “most of” what Chaudhry said, but insisted that “many old trees” were also cut down, which gravely saddened the public.
“It was definitely needed for development, but then they should come forward and announce proactively how many trees we are planting in their place,” he said.



Speaking on points of order in the NA before Chaudhry’s explanation, PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan and PPP’s Shazia Marri also raised the issue of tree-cutting in Islamabad.
Ali said that if the interior ministry, the Islamabad administration or the climate change ministry had cut the trees “after taking the citizens of Islamabad into confidence, there would not have been mistrust in them”.
“The nearly 40,000 trees you have cut are the lungs of Islamabad,” the PTI lawmaker added. He further urged the relevant authorities to plant 100 saplings in the spring for each tree cut down.
Ali questioned why “50 to 60-year-old trees” were also removed if only paper mulberry trees were being replaced.
Marri also raised her party’s concerns over the “large-scale tree-cutting in Islamabad”. “Whether it is Shakarparian, F-9, or other areas, reports are emerging that thousands of trees are being cut,” she said.
The PPP lawmaker added, “Even if you are justifying it that a specific species harmful to the environment is being cut, but why are they running away from accountability?”
Marri demanded the “actual truth” and the figures on the tree plantation being carried out to make up for it. She recommended that the matter be referred to the NA’s Standing Committee for Climate Change for further debate.







Unanimous resolution urges govt to probe documented passengers’ offloading
Separately, the NA unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the government probe the offloading of documented passengers at various airports across the country.
Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents.

PPP MNA Agha Rafiullah moved a resolution before the NA today, stating that the “government should take immediate steps to investigate the off-loading of documented passengers at various airports”.
The resolution also urged the government to recommend “administrative reforms to ensure transparency, accountability and the protection of passenger rights, while improving communication so that all off-loading decisions are lawful and properly documented”.
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then moved the resolution for voting, which received no opposition and was subsequently passed unanimously.







Speaking later on a point of order, PPP’s Marri termed the offloading of travellers a “very important” issue. “People going abroad for work or education as a result of a good offer, especially with all their complete documents, now have so much fear because of these actions.”
She noted the “demeanour adopted with them despite them having complete documents”, urging the government to take action on the matter.
The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) had linked the offloading incidents to a crackdown on migrant smuggling by denying travel to those with incomplete documents.
In mid-December, growing public fury prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to finally take notice of the issue and form a “special committee” to look into the matter.

 

Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi issued orders to the FIA for the strict screening of travel documents at airports.
In the first week of December, Naqvi had said that 50–70 passengers were being offloaded daily from flights to protect the country’s passport reputation, which, at an average of 60 per day, comes to fewer than 22,000 in a year.
However, official figures showed that the actual number of offloaded passengers in 2025 was three times higher, at 66,000.
According to FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar Raja, 51,000 of the 66,000 passengers offloaded this year were stopped by the FIA for insufficient or unverified documentation.

Bangladesh last week announced that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after Mustafizur Rahman was released by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its games to Sri Lanka.
The World Cup begins on February 7 and Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.
The row erupted on January 3, when India forced Rahman to quit the Indian Premier League (IPL).
Rahman, who has played in the IPL for other teams in previous editions, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.
His sacking sparked fury in Dhaka.
On Tuesday, during a video conference with the ICC, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.
Political ties between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.
India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.
“The BCB reaffirmed its position regarding the decision not to travel to India, citing security concerns,” the BCB said in a statement.
“While the ICC highlighted that the tournament itinerary has already been announced and requested the BCB to reconsider its stance, the Board’s position remains unchanged.”
The ICC have not commented.
The BCB said discussions with the ICC continue to “explore possible solutions”, it added, but that it “remains committed to safeguarding the well-being of its players, officials and staff”.
Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are placed ninth in the ICC T20 rankings.
They have played all the nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.</p><small>2026-01-13 11:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/131509433d4117d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966746/pti-violated-commitments-made-in-preparation-for-kp-cms-sindh-visit-says-sharjeel-memon' target='_blank'><strong>PTI violated commitments made in preparation for KP CM’s Sindh visit, says Sharjeel Memon</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon on Tuesday assailed the PTI for not honouring commitments made in preparation for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s recent Sindh visit.
Memon’s comments come a day after the KP CM concluded his visit to the province. On Monday, the chief minister decried the treatment of him and his entourage in Karachi, saying that the provincial government had “desecrated” the honour of the Sindhi ajrak and topi.
Addressing the events that transpired during the KP CM’s visit, Memon said that the Sindh government was in contact with representatives from the KP government, and the two had “chalked out” the schedule for the visit.
A schedule shared by the PTI at the outset of the visit included a meeting with Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah. However, it did not take place.
“There was a threat alert issued as well by security institutions; we did not disclose it to the public; however, the KP government was informed,” Memon said.
He maintained that, keeping in view the security situation, Sindh Local Government Minister Nasir Hussain Shah assured the delegation of protection and facilities, but he urged them “not to engage in anything that disrupts daily life and puts the safety of the delegation at risk”.
Memon recalled: “The first day, they were informed by Nasir Shah sahib to stay clear of certain areas, considering the threat, yet in the evening, they were seen in the District South“.
The Sindh government had permitted the PTI to hold a rally at Bagh-i-Jinnah.
However, the PTI, citing a delay in receiving the permit, announced a change in venue, saying it would stage the gathering at one of the gates of Mazar-i-Quaid. Finally, CM Afridi briefly addressed hundreds near Mazar-i-Quaid.
The Sindh minister further told the media, “Security plans are pre-decided before any such events […] to prevent any unfortunate incidents”.
Memon maintained that the PTI “violated every commitment they made earlier”.
“The next day, when they went to Hyderabad, they took an unapproved route on their way back to Karachi,” he added, contrary to Afridi’s claims of his convoy being forced to take such a route due to roadblocks.
The minister detailed that the PTI delegation took the route of the Hyderabad Bridge, where Memon said the delegation “got stuck in traffic for a couple of hours”.
Nasir had also refuted Afridi’s claims, saying that police accompanied the KP CM on his way to Karachi via the “safest routes”.

 

The minister recalled that in Hyderabad, the PTI began “criticising the Sindh government again and started name-calling“.
Memon was of the view that the PTI did not “care for the respect they had been accorded during the visit”.
“We do not care about their speeches; however, violations were committed, and all they did was blame the Sindh government.”
“What do you think the Sindh government is going to gain if you get stuck in traffic for a few hours? What benefit will we get out of this teasing?” the minister questioned.

The incident took place in the Gulbadin Landi Dak area of Bannu district. According to a senior official of the district police, the victims were all travelling in the same vehicle when armed men opened “indiscriminate fire” on them.
Of the four victims, two were identified as a father and son. They all died on the spot, the official added.
Local sources said that the peace committee in the area has taken up arms in self-defense to resist militants, leading to an extremely tense situation in the area.
The police official further said that an investigation into the attack has been initiated, but added that it was too early to declare it an act of terrorism.
Attacks on peace committee members in KP have been on the rise in recent months. In November 2025, seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Bannu.
Meanwhile, in October, a member of a tribal peace committee was killed in a clash with terrorists in the Ahmadzai area of Bannu district.</p><small>2026-01-13 11:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13145649b0c5406.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966740/pti-formally-nominates-mehmood-khan-achakzai-as-na-opposition-leader' target='_blank'><strong>PTI formally nominates Mehmood Khan Achakzai as NA opposition leader</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The PTI formally requested the appointment of Pashtunkhawa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the National Assembly (NA) opposition leader on Tuesday, with party Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan confirming the submission of his nomination papers.
This is the second time that the party has formally proposed Achakzai’s name for the opposition leader’s post in the lower house of Parliament.
The development comes a day after NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq began afresh the process for the appointment of the opposition leader — a slot that has been lying vacant for almost five months since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub in August 2025.
Addressing the NA speaker, the written proposal for Achakzai’s nomination — seen by Dawn and dated January 12 — stated: “We, the undersigned members of the National Assembly belonging to the opposition benches, have the honour to nominate Mehmood Khan Achakzai MNA (NA-266) for appointment as the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly of Pakistan.”
It referred to rule 39 of the Rules of Procedures of Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007, saying that the “leader of the opposition is to be appointed from among the members of the house who belong to the opposition and who commands the confidence of the majority of the members sitting on the opposition benches”.
“In view of the foregoing, we hereby affirm that Mehmood Khan Achakzai enjoys the confidence and support of the majority of the members belonging to the opposition, and is, therefore, the most suitable person to hold this constitutional office.
“The timely appointment of the leader of the opposition will ensure the effective discharge of constitutional and parliamentary responsibilities entrusted to the opposition,” it read.
The document added: “We therefore request that, after following necessary procedures for the appointment of the leader of the opposition in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and the previous parliamentary practices, MNA Mehmood Khan Achakzai may please be appointed as leader of the opposition in the National Assembly of Pakistan at the earliest.”
Separately, Barrister Gohar confirmed while speaking to Geo News in Parliament that Achakzai’s nomination papers had been submitted.
The PTI chairman said he was expecting that the PkMAP leader would be notified as the new leader of the opposition in the NA on Thursday.
In response to a question, he said his party had just one nominee for the vacant slot — Achakzai — and only his nomination papers had been submitted.
Incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had named Achakzai for the opposition leader’s slot in the NA in August last year, nearly two weeks after the Election Commission of Pakistan disqualified following his conviction in cases pertaining to riots on May 9, 2023.
The opposition had also submitted Achakzai’s nomination papers — who also heads the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan — to the speaker’s office in October 2025. The submission was, however, made to the speaker’s office rather than presented to him personally.
Meanwhile, Rule 39 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the National Assembly, 2007 confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.
The opposition has also repe­atedly accused the government of delaying Achakzai’s appointment, while the NA speaker had maintained until recently that the matter was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.
Ayub had filed pleas in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal but later withdrew the petitions.
Subsequently, the NA Secretariat sent a letter to PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar in December, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub.
The letter said the provision of the details in writing was necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.
Dogar submitted the required documents to the NA speaker on January 5, following which the latter had said that the constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader would be initiated afresh in the next parliamentary session.
When the session began yesterday, the speaker formally initiated the process for the appointment of the NA opposition leader and asked the opposition to re-submit the proposal for the nomination of the leader of the opposition.

The delegation will be led by Democratic US Senator Chris Coons and will include Republican US Senator Thom Tillis and Democratic Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Dick Durbin along with some members of the House of Representatives, Coons’ office said in a statement on Monday.
Why it’s important
Democratic and Republican US lawmakers said last week they expected the US Senate would eventually vote on legislation seeking to rein in Trump’s ability to attempt to seize Greenland from Denmark, a long-time US ally.
Trump has repeatedly said Washington must own Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying the strategically located and minerals-rich Arctic territory. He says a US military presence there is not enough.
“One way or the other we are going to take Greenland,” Trump has said while adding he would prefer to make a deal with Denmark.
Greenland and Denmark have said that Greenland is not for sale, but Trump has not ruled out taking it by force. Denmark and the US, both Nato members, are scheduled to meet this week to discuss the issue.
“As co-chair of the Senate Nato Observer Group, I believe it is critical that Congress stands united in supporting our allies and respecting the sovereignty of Denmark and Greenland,” Senator Tillis from Trump’s Republican Party said.
Trump’s “continued threats toward Greenland are unnecessary and would only weaken our Nato alliance,” Durbin added.
The delegation will be in Copenhagen on Friday and Saturday, Coons’ office noted.
Competing bills
Republican US Representative Randy Fine introduced a bill on Monday — called the Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act — that, if passed, would give Trump the authority to annex Greenland.
Democratic US Representative Jimmy Gomez planned a competing bill — called Greenland Sovereignty Protection Act — that would block federal money from being used to fund any of Trump’s plans to take over Greenland.
While Trump has previously threatened a take over of the island, concerns about it were renewed after he ordered a deadly US military raid earlier this month in Venezuela to seize its now ousted leader Nicolas Maduro, who was subsequently brought to New York and remains in custody.</p><small>2026-01-13 09:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644825-ml-1-project-work-to-begin-from-karachi-port-in-july-2026-minister' target='_blank'><strong>ML-1 project work to begin from Karachi Port in July 2026: minister</strong></a><br><p>

The agreement, when signed, will enable Pakistani nationals to bypass lengthy immigration processes upon arrival in the UAE.
The decision was made in a meeting between Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and a delegation from the UAE, led by Director General of Customs and Port Security Ahmed Bin Lahij Al Falasi, the press release said.
“The immigration process for the passengers will be completed in Pakistan before travel,” Naqvi was quoted as saying.
He added that with the implementation of the system, Pakistani nationals will be able to bypass lengthy immigration processes upon arrival in the UAE.
“They will be able to exit the airport directly like domestic passengers,” said Naqvi.
The interior minister detailed that the system will be launched as a pilot project, with the first phase set to begin in Karachi. He did not mention any date for the commencement of the pilot project.
Naqvi voiced optimism that the new system will “facilitate travel and improve the overall travel experience”.
The UAE delegation vowed to cooperate during the implementation of the initiative, labelling it as “beneficial” for both countries.
“Relevant authorities will coordinate with each other to finalise the administrative and technical aspects of the pilot project,” the statement read.
It added that after the pilot phase in Karachi, the system will be expanded to other cities as well.
Also present at the meeting were Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Federal Secretary for Interior Khurram Agha.
Restrictions on UAE visas
The development comes as Pakistanis, in the past year, have faced increased difficulties in obtaining visas to the UAE.
In November 2025, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry said that the UAE had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis.
The additional secretary made this revelation during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, further stating that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
Visa rejections were also faced by Pakistani citizens in early July last year, which prompted Naqvi to raise the issue with his UAE counterpart.
In a meeting held the same month, the UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens as the Pakistani minister sought “relaxation in visa policies”.
The UAE Ambassador to Pakistan, Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi, in April had also announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa.
The announcement came after the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, in January 2025, was told that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”.
Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig had said the above, adding that the UAE government had reservations that Pakistanis on “visit visas, not work visas”, resort to begging in the country.
However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, had said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the Gulf country.</p><small>2026-01-13 08:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644819-pakistan-uae-to-ink-pre-immigration-clearance-agreement-to-ease-travellers-woes' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UAE to sign 'pre-immigration clearance' pact to facilitate passengers</strong></a><br><p>

The ML-1 project aims to upgrade and modernise key infrastructure to enhance freight and passenger connectivity from Karachi to Peshawar.
Last month, a review meeting on the key Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) projects was also informed that the project will begin in July this year.
According to a press release issued today, Abbasi, in a meeting with the Chairman Karachi Port Trust (KPT) Rear Admiral (retd) Shahid Ahmed, on January 9, said that the construction of the project will begin from the Karachi Port, starting in July.
During the meeting, he informed chairman KPT that under the project, a 54-kilometre railway section from “KPT to Pipri will be upgraded to ensure seamless cargo movement”.
The two also discussed “measures for strengthening the railway system for efficient cargo transportation from Karachi Port”.
Reduction of congestion at KPT and the surrounding road networks also came under discussion, with the suggestion of shifting “a larger share of cargo transportation from roads to rail”.
“Both sides agreed that rail-based freight transport is a cost-effective and sustainable solution to improve logistics efficiency and support trade activities,” the press release read.
Abbasi also outlined reforms aimed at enhancing the freight handling capacity of Pakistan Railways during the meeting.
In that regard, the minister, stressing the significance of KPT in national and international trade, called for “close coordination between Pakistan Railways and KPT to improve port logistics performance”.
Abbasi also detailed plans to “operate at least four freight trains daily within the next five months, with priority given to bulk cargo transportation”.
Chairman KPT also vowed to work closely with Pakistan Railways, outlining plans to upgrade KPT’s internal railway tracks.
“Both sides agreed that enhanced rail connectivity will not only reduce pressure on roads and ports but will also lower logistics costs, improve turnaround times, and contribute to the growth of trade, industry, and the national economy,” the press release read.
In August 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Railways had recommended expediting work on the project.
The chairman railways briefed the committee that the ML-1 project was among PR’s top priorities, as it is the central railway line linking Karachi with the entire country.
For this reason, the project will commence from Karachi, and efforts are underway to initiate development work at the earliest, he added.</p><small>2026-01-13 07:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1311043276a4e5d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966651/bangladesh-standoff-exposes-iccs-governance-crisis-ahead-of-t20-world-cup' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh standoff exposes ICC’s governance crisis ahead of T20 World Cup</strong></a><br><p>WITH less than three weeks to go before the T20 World Cup starts, the cricketing world looks on as the sport’s global governing body deals with yet another crisis. The latest, too, involves India — the country from where the International Cricket Council’s chairman and the CEO come from — naturally as the co-hosts of the 20-team showpiece.
Bangladesh don’t want to play their matches in India and want them to be shifted to co-hosts Sri Lanka.
Things have come to this point after worsening political relations between the two countries over the last 12 months saw Bangladesh’s star pacer Mustafizur Rahman being withdrawn from Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad on the directives of the country’s cricket board.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason for Mustafizur’s ouster. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) responded strongly, deciding not to play in India with security having become a major concern.
While the BCB said on Wednesday that the “ICC has conveyed its willingness to work closely” with the board to resolve the issue, the latter itself has chosen to not comment on the issue with reports emerging on Monday that Chennai and Thirivananthapuram have been put forward as venue to host Bangladesh’s matches.
There also remains a possibility of Bangladesh not participating in the tournament.
The ICC, while trying to negotiate with the BCB, has not been able to show any kind of muscle as a governing body, especially against the host nation’s board for letting cricket be affected by politics.
This raises question marks over the ICC’s standing as a governing body in the face of India’s dominance via producing the major chunk of revenue that runs it.
The body is led by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and India’s Home Minister Amit Shah’s son Jay, while ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta is also Indian. As former ICC president and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani views it, “the BCCI follows the political agenda of the BJP”.
“The ICC should have a clear policy of not allowing member countries’ politics to interfere with the game,” he told Dawn last week.
Identifying the involvement of politics in the making of the decisions that run the sport as the most important concern, Mani claimed other strong cricket boards were not serious about taking it on.
“Unfortunately, ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] and CA [Cricket Australia] together with BCCI are not prepared to address this and other serious governance issues and together they have prevented ICC from carrying out a governance review which I was pushing for as chairman of PCB,” he said. “The ICC board is terribly conflicted, with each director looking after his country’s interest before considering what is good for the game as a whole.
Mani said he expected the Bangladesh situation to be resolved through “a fudged solution, which will be engineered without addressing the governance failings of the ICC”.
Former West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chairman Dave Cameron, who served in the ICC’s Finance and Com­mercial Affairs committee between 2013-19, echoed Mani’s views, saying that the ICC needed to switch from being “a group of members” to becoming a proper governing body.
“Part of the challenge is that the ICC is not a governing council but is rather made up of countries that sit together as a members’ group, and this is unfortunate,” Cameron told Dawn. “As a governing council, there are some requirements, it’s not being used in that way, which is the detriment at this point.”
PAKISTAN’S OPPORTUNITY
It is not the first time that security concerns triggered by political tensions between India and another country have come to put a tournament at risk. When India hosted the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2023, the PCB was convinced days before the event to send the national team across the border. A stronger deadlock emerged ahead of last year’s Champions Trophy — of which the official hosts were Pakis­tan — with India refusing to return their neighbours’ 2023 gesture.
The ICC had to come up with a “hybrid model” to resolve the Champions Trophy matter and decided that Pakistan and India will play at neutral venues if the global tournament is being hosted by either of the two nations. That decision was hailed as Pakistan’s psychological win in the backdrop of the Indian financial and administrative muscle.
With the recent political shift in Bangladesh triggered by Sheikh Hasina’s ouster as the country’s prime minister and a consequential change of regime in the BCB, the PCB, led by Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, has got closer to the latter.
Naqvi — also the Asian Cricket Council chief currently — and BCB president Aminul Islam were also reportedly at the forefront in making the 2025 Asia Cup happen amid calls for a boycott coming from India.
Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi, who himself has been in the midst of the Pakistan-India cricket issues during his previous tenure, the ongoing tensions are an opportunity for the PCB to form a pressure bloc within the ICC along with the BCB.
“Earlier, on any issue, Pakistan could not count on support from any ICC member if its stance differed from India’s, now it will have Bangladesh on its side,” Sethi told Dawn. “Their joint clout will be greater than the sum of their parts.”
The Pakistan cricket leadership seemed to have sensed the opportunity after Mustafizur was snubbed by the BCCI as it the PCB announced zealously days after the fast bowler’s registration for the Pakistan Super League’s players’ draft.
Social media feeds on Sunday, meanwhile, carried unconfirmed reports of the PCB offering to host Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.
“PCB and BCB should scratch each other’s shoulders in their respective leagues to cobble a common front against the rest of the Boards,” Sethi said.
By Monday evening, BCCI secretary Saikia, as per reports, confirmed no communication was made by the ICC over a potential change of venues for the Bangladesh matches. Henceforth, as the clock ticked and the T20 World Cup neared, uncertainty prevailed and so did the ICC’s deafening silence.

At a press conference on Monday, when asked by the Press Trust of India (PTI) for comment on the Indian criticism of China’s infrastructure development projects in the Shaksgam valley, China‘s Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that it was “fully justified” for China to conduct infrastructure construction “on its own territory”.
“The territory you mentioned belongs to China,” she said.
India’s foreign ministry spokesperson had on Friday said that it reserved the right to take necessary measures to safeguard its interests as the Shaksgam valley was “an Indian territory”.
“We have never recognised the so-called China-Pakistan boundary agreement that happened in 1963. We have consistently maintained that the agreement is illegal and invalid,” he said at a press conference in response to a question from India’s state-owned public television broadcaster Doordashan.
The Indian spokesperson added that New Delhi also does not “recognise the so-called China-Pakistan Economic Corridor”.
“The entire union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh are an integral and inalienable part of India,” he maintained, adding, “This has been clearly conveyed to Pakistani and the Chinese authorities several times”.
He added that India had “consistently protested with the Chinese side against attempts to alter the ground reality in Shaksgam Valley”.
Mao Ning, in response to the Indian foreign ministry spokesperson’s comments, said that China and Pakistan had in the 1960s signed a boundary agreement and delimited the boundary between the two countries, terming it “the right of China and Pakistan as sovereign countries”.
“The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as an economic cooperation initiative, aims at promoting local socio-economic development and improving people’s livelihood,” she said.
“The China-Pakistan boundary agreement and CPEC do not affect China’s position on the Kashmir issue and the position remains unchanged.”
India and China have long clashed over border disputes, but had reached a milestone pact in 2024 on lowering military tensions on their Himalayan border, which escalated after a military clash in 2020 in which 20 soldiers from India and four from China were killed.
Since the pact in 2024, the two countries have taken steps to improve relations, including a resumption of direct flights and enhanced investment and trade flows.
However, Beijing and New Delhi continue to spar over territory, including Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing calls Zangnan and says is a part of South Tibet — a claim India has repeatedly dismissed.
Beijing has renamed places in the northeastern Himalayan state multiple times, prompting strong reactions from New Delhi.</p><small>2026-01-13 06:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13101442fdaa0b3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966724/trump-says-nations-doing-business-with-iran-face-25pc-tariff-on-us-trade' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says nations doing business with Iran face 25pc tariff on US trade</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump announced a 25 percent tariff on any country doing business with Iran, ramping up pressure as a crackdown on protests continues.
Trump, who has repeatedly threatened Iran with military intervention, said in a social media post on Monday that the new levies would “immediately” hit the Islamic republic’s trading partners who also do business with the United States.
“This Order is final and conclusive,” he wrote, without specifying who they will affect.







Iran’s main trading partners are China, Turkiye, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, according to economic database Trading Economics.
Trump has been mulling his options on Iran, which has been roiled by more than two weeks of demonstrations that have defied a near-total internet blackout and lethal force.
Sparked by economic grievances, the nationwide protests have grown into one of the biggest challenges yet to the theocratic system that has ruled Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution ousted the shah.
Iranian authorities have blamed foreign interference for stoking the unrest and staged their own nationwide counter-rallies.

Rights groups warned that the severed communications were aimed at masking a rising death toll.
The Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights (IHR) said the internet shutdown has made it “extremely difficult to independently verify reports” of casualties.
“The international community has a duty to protect civilian protesters against mass killing by the Islamic republic,” said IHR director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam.
The White House said Monday that Trump remained “unafraid” to deploy military force against Iran, but was pursuing diplomacy as a first resort.
US asks citizens to leave Iran
The State Department asked US-Iranian dual nationals to “exit Iran on Iranian passports”.
“The Iranian government does not recognise dual nationality and will treat US-Iranian dual nationals solely as Iranian citizens, “and added that US nationals face“ significant risk of questioning, arrest, and detention in Iran”.







“Showing a US passport or demonstrating connections to the United States can be reason enough for Iranian authorities to detain someone,” added the advisory from the State Department.
“The US government cannot guarantee your safety if you choose to depart using the following options. You should leave only if you believe it is safe to do so.”
China opposes Trump’s tariff threat
China said late on Monday that it opposed “any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction” after US President Donald Trump posted on social media that nations doing business with Iran will face a 25% tariff on US trade.
“China’s position against the indiscriminate imposition of tariffs is consistent and clear. Tariff wars and trade wars have no winners, and coercion and pressure cannot solve problems,” a spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in Washington said on X.
“China firmly opposes any illicit unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction, and will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”
‘Four-front war’
Iran on Monday sought to regain control of the streets with mass nationwide rallies that supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei hailed as proof that the protest movement was defeated.
In power since 1989 and now 86, Khamenei said the pro-government turnout was a “warning” to the United States.
“These massive rallies, full of determination, have thwarted the plan of foreign enemies that were supposed to be carried out by domestic mercenaries,” he said, according to state TV, referring to pro-government demonstrations.
In the capital Tehran, state TV showed people brandishing the national flag and prayers read for victims of what the government has termed “riots”.
At Enghelab (Revolution) Square, parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf told the crowd that Iran was fighting a “four-front war” listing economic war, psychological war, “military war” with the United States and Israel, and “today a war against terrorists” - a reference to the protests.
Flanked by the slogans “Death to Israel, Death to America” in Persian, he vowed the Iranian military would teach Trump “an unforgettable lesson” if attacked.
But Trump said Sunday that Iran’s leadership had called him seeking “to negotiate”.
Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told a conference of foreign ambassadors in Tehran that Iran was “not seeking war but is fully prepared for war”, while calling for “fair” negotiations.
Foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baghaei said a channel of communication was open between Araghchi and Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff despite the lack of diplomatic relations.
Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted shah who has been vocal in calling for protests, told CBS news the government was “trying to trick the world into thinking that (it) is ready to negotiate once again”.
He said Trump was “a man that means what he says and says what he means” and who “knows what’s at stake”.
“The red line that was drawn has been definitely surpassed by this regime.”
‘Respect for their rights’
State outlets were at pains to present a picture of calm returning in Tehran, broadcasting images of smooth-flowing traffic.
Tehran Governor Mohammad-Sadegh Motamedian insisted in televised comments that “the number of protests is decreasing”.
Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies.
The government has declared three days of national mourning for those killed.
The European Union has voiced support for the protesters and on Monday said it was “looking into” imposing additional sanctions on Iran over the repression of demonstrations.
The European Parliament also announced it had banned all Iranian diplomats and representatives from the assembly’s premises.
French President Emmanuel Macron issued a statement condemning “the state violence that indiscriminately targets Iranian women and men who courageously demand respect for their rights”.
Tehran ally Russia, for its part, slammed what it called attempts by “foreign powers” to interfere in Iran, state media reported, in Moscow’s first reaction to the protests.</p><small>2026-01-13 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644789-new-pia-owners-seek-partner-to-revive-airline' target='_blank'><strong>New PIA owners seek partner to revive airline</strong></a><br><p>

India has not officially recognised the Taliban government, but the move signals a deepening engagement, with New Delhi seeking to exploit divisions between Islamabad and Kabul.
Noor Ahmad Noor, a Taliban foreign ministry official, assumed responsibility as charge d’affaires, and has already held meetings with Indian officials, the embassy said in a statement.







“Both sides emphasised the importance of strengthening Afghanistan-India relations,” the Afghan Embassy said, in a post on X late Monday.
India has not commented, but the Afghan embassy posted a photograph of Noor with senior Indian foreign ministry official Anand Prakash.
The Taliban’s strict interpretation of Islamic law may appear an unlikely match for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government, but India has sought to seize the opening.
Nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan fought a brief but deadly clash in May 2025, their worst confrontation in decades.
The appointment is significant for the Taliban, which has sought to reclaim control over Afghanistan’s overseas diplomatic missions as part of a broader push for international legitimacy.
In October, India said it would upgrade its technical mission in Afghanistan to a full embassy.
Russia is the only country to officially recognise the Afghan Taliban government.</p><small>2026-01-13 05:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/13101112b493067.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966611/discos-resort-to-forced-loadshedding-as-shortfall-surges-to-4000mw' target='_blank'><strong>Discos resort to forced loadshedding as shortfall surges to 4,000MW</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The power distribution companies (Discos) have started forced loadshedding across the country after the electricity shortfall surged to nearly 4,000 Megawatts, including 1,000MWs in the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) alone, comprising five districts.
According to official sources, the situation has been persisting for the last many days due to dense fog causing repeated tripping of various power plants in the southern region, while the hydel power generation remains negligible in the ongoing winter.
“When we compare the situation with the previous year’s, the electricity demand has increased by approximately 2,000 MW during the winter, owing to the extensive use of heating appliances,” the official, who requested anonymity, explained while talking to Dawn on Monday.
In addition, he said, the reduction in the gas supply to Lahore-based power plants, along with the closure of one unit at the Sahiwal Coal Power Plant, has further constrained the generation capacity, leaving Discos with no option but to resort to loadshedding in Punjab, Sindh and other provinces.
According to another official source, the situation has worsened over the last 4-5 days after a couple of power plants in the southern region went off grid due to the tripping caused by dense fog.
“From these plants, the Matiari-Lahore High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) transmission line supplies power to Punjab, especially Lahore,” he maintained, adding that the situation is expected to improve in the coming days as the work is underway to restore these plants.
On the other hand, the consumers are suffering because of the hours-long forced loadshedding — three to six hours in the urban areas and six to 10 hours in rural areas of Punjab, Sindh and other provinces.
“In Sukkur city, forced loadshedding has been continuing for three to five hours daily. But the rural areas, especially in the interior Sindh, are facing eight to twelve hours loadshedding on a daily basis these days,” a Sukkur-based consumer told Dawn.
According to a Lahore-based consumer, the forced loadshedding is being observed for three to six hours on a daily basis in the city these days. “For the last couple of days, we are also experiencing shortage of water supply from the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), due to the non-operation of tube-wells because of the loadshedding. This has also resulted in unavailability of warm water in this chilly weather,” he complained, asking the government to intervene and ensure uninterrupted electricity and gas supply.

 

Meanwhile, Lesco also continued observing forced loadshedding for hours in Punjab capital and the adjoining districts following a shortfall of over 1,100MW in its total consumption of over 3,200MW in peak hours.
Since the power shortfall has emerged due to lesser allocation from the national grid, Lesco Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Ramzan Butt says the company has no option but to go for loadshedding in such a situation.
“At present, the hydel power generation is zero. Meanwhile,the consumers earlier using the solar net-metering system, have also returned to the Lesco’s system due to non-generation by their solar power equipment because of the dense fog. Moreover, we have no supply from those selling solar power to us through net metering. Likewise, various power plants went off the grid due to tripping caused by the harsh foggy weather,” he explained.
“This all led to power shortfall in our total consumption,” he added.
The Lesco CEO said that at 7:45pm (Monday), the total demand of Lesco, which covers Lahore city district and the districts of Kasur, Okara, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib, was 3,241MW, whereas the supplies from the national grid was 2,160MW, resulting in a shortfall of almost 1,100MW.

KARACHI: The gas crisis that Karachiites have been facing for the past four days further intensified on Monday, as several neighbourhoods remained completely without gas, while other areas struggled with critically low gas pressure.
While office-goers, schoolchildren and other people continue to endure the cold-induced agony of a crippled gas supply, the gas utility concedes the problem, saying it experienced a reduction in gas supply from one more field.

 

City’s minimum average temperature remained in the single digit as the Met Office said it was 8.1 degrees Celsius on Monday.
Residents across the city said that the winter freeze had once again exposed the complete failure of the gas utility’s distribution infrastructure and system, turning everyday life into a continuous struggle for them.
Public frustration
“How long will Karachi tolerate a utility that can’t secure its own supply,” wondered a disgruntled housewife from Gulistan-i-Jauhar.
A resident of Nazimabad, where gas supply was disrupted for hours, said that the gas utility offered the same tired narrative each winter, while the public paid the price.
“Until the company is held accountable, infrastructure is upgraded and the government stops turning a blind eye, Karachi’s residents will remain hostages of a broken system,” she added.
As the temperature dropped to single digits, homes were left with cold kitchens and delayed breakfasts, forcing students, workers and the elderly to turn to expensive LPG cylinders — a short-term arrangement that only added to their financial burden.
Pakistan Peoples Party’s Sindh General Secretary, Senator Waqar Mehdi, voiced deep concern over the ongoing gas shutdowns, loadshedding and dangerously low pressure reported across Sindh, especially in Karachi.
In a press statement, he noted that regardless of the weather, be it scorching heat or biting cold, Karachi’s residents continued to endure persistent gas cuts, erratic pressure and frequent power outages.
“The prime minister should take immediate notice of the gas shutdown in Karachi,” he demanded and urged that strict action be taken against anyone responsible for the continued suffering of the city’s residents.
He said that even as gas supplies were cut and loadshedding persisted, residents were still being hit with bills running into the thousands, while the gas utility continued to fall short of delivering a normal, reliable service to the public.
The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) announced that the utility had experienced a reduction in gas supply from two fields, which disrupted service to several parts of the city.

 

A gas utility spokesman said that the amount of gas received from these two gas fields was about 45 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d). “Due to this, gas pressure has decreased in some areas of Karachi; however, the situation has started improving in the last one hour,” he added.
The spokesperson said that the SSGC was taking various steps to ensure gas supply, the most significant of which was the suspension of gas supply to Fauji Fertiliser. “At the same time, a decision was taken to suspend gas supply to industries on Sunday so that gas supply to domestic consumers can be ensured,” he added.
The spokesperson claimed that the gas company was supplying 28 MMcf/d more gas to domestic consumers this winter compared to last year. “However, the system line pack has been severely affected due to the drop in temperature in the franchise area,” he added.
He said that the gas utility was monitoring the situation and that the restoration of gas from the fields would be immediately delivered to domestic consumers.

Besides replacing the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) with three town corporations, the ordinance gives the government-appointed administrator more powers and an indefinite tenure.
The new ordinance was introduced at a time when the local governments in Islamabad were scheduled to be held on February 15. Thousands of people from all 125 Union Councils had already submitted nomination papers for the elections. However, sources said, chances are now slim that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) will assert holding the elections as scheduled.
Meanwhile, the ordinance also stated that in the absence of local government, the administrator can hold office until the new local government elections are held - replacing the bar that the administrator’s tenure shall not exceed six months.
The ordinance also empowered the administrator to levy tax, fee, rate, rent, toll charge or surcharge.

Amendments to LG Act replaces MCI with three town corporations, gives administrator more powers and indefinite tenure

The federal cabinet recently approved 14 amendments to the Act, including a change in the name of the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad, replacing it with town corporations.
According to the ordinance, there will be three town corporations in Islamabad and each town corporation will comprise, as far as practicable, the territorial limits of a National Assembly (NA) constituency within the capital. Islamabad has three NA seats.
It is relevant to note here that when the election schedule was announced by the ECP, the local chapter of the PTI had claimed that the government fearing defeat would opt for an escape route and would not conduct the elections in February.
However, PML-N former deputy mayor Syed Zeeshan Ali Naqvi had rejected the claim of the PTI, stating that the ordinance was brought for a better local government system in Islamabad.
“It is habit of PTI to make false claim. We will defeat them in local government elections whenever held as we did in 2015-16. Actually, through this ordinance, we want to have three separate town corporations and three mayors for better service delivery,” he said and added that his party wanted a vibrant local government system in Islamabad.
“You know the previous election was held on the basis of weak local government Act that was why the local government representatives could not live up to the expectations of the their constituents. Local government representatives in their tenure remained busy in removing bureaucratic hurdles,” he said. “Now, when elections will be held people of Islamabad will have an effective local government setup,” he said.
Whenever elections are held, according to the new ordinance, each town corporation will have a mayor and two deputy mayors, four women, one peasant/worker, one trader/ businessman, one youth member and one non-Muslim member.
The term of the last local government expired in February 2021, and since then elections have been delayed under various pretexts. As a result, around 2.5 million residents of Islamabad continue to face issues ranging from water shortages to unpaved streets etc.
Earlier, the ECP conducted delimitations of constituencies multiple times and issued election schedules on several occasions, only to be cancelled later.
A few years ago, the elections were even cancelled a day before polling.
It is pertinent to note that when the local government’s term ended in 2021, the PTI was in power and elections were supposed to be held within 120 days. However, the PTI government did not take serious steps to conduct the polls. When the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) came into power, it too delayed the elections.
During the PDM’s tenure, elections were set to be held in 50 union councils (UCs), but the government argued that the number should be increased to 101 UCs, leading to further delays.
Later, when arrangements were finalised to hold elections in 101 UCs, the PDM government proposed increasing the number of UCs from 101 to 125. Elections were then scheduled for 125 UCs, but in September last year the government decided to increase the number of general seats in the UCs.
Last month, the ECP decided to hold elections for 125 UCs, but the government has now introduced fresh amendments to the local government law.

The PC-1 worth of Rs40 billion has been approved by the National Steering Committee of Sehat Sahulat Programme (SSP) chaired by Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal. The service will be resumed from Jan 16.
The meeting of the committee was attended by health secretary Hamid Yaqoob, special secretary of health and CEO of SSP Arshad Khan, along with members of the National Steering Committee.
The committee reviewed progress on the restoration and launch of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) services to all permanent resident families of ICT, AJK, and Gilgit-Baltistan.
The CEO of Federal SSP Arshad Khan shared prime minister’s directives for immediate restoration of the services.

Rs40bn approved for the programme

“The committee approved the revised PC-I with an estimated cost of approximately Rs40 billion, extending up to 30th June 2027, to provide free hospitalisation services to all permanent resident families of ICT, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan under the UHC model of Federal Sehat Sahulat Programme.
“It was also decided to extend existing contracts with State Life Insurance Corporation and Nadra through addenda to ensure uninterrupted services, while outstanding liabilities will be cleared from the PSDP as per the prime minister’s directions,” a statement issued by the health ministry claimed.
Speaking on the occasion, Syed Mustafa Kamal said the country must adopt modern health insurance and strategic purchasing models rather than directly managing hospital services to ensure quality, efficiency, and dignity in healthcare delivery.
The minister confirmed that the prime minister will launch the restored services on Jan 16.
Over 10 million residents of Islamabad, AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan were (GB) suffering since March 2024 as the service was suspended because the federal govt had failed to clear its dues. On the other hand, residents of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab were enjoying the facility. Residents of KP have been getting the best possible medical facility as they can get medical treatment at private and public sector hospitals whereas residents of Punjab can only get treatment at public sector hospitals.
Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif had launched the health card programme on Dec 31, 2015, for Islamabad and described the move a first step towards making the country a welfare state. He had also announced the card would be expanded to all parts of Punjab, Balochistan, AJK, Gilgit-Baltistan and then Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata).
People of Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) could not benefit from the initiative at that time because their governments had declined to become part of the federal government’s programme in which they also had to contribute. Later, the KP had launched its own health card namely Sehat Insaf Card.
During the tenure of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government, the programme was expanded across the country.
In April 2022 some of the hospitals had suspended the service as they feared that the PML-N government might discontinue the programme as PTI promoted/marketed the programme as its initiative.
Later, the PML-N government limited the programme to public sector hospitals in Punjab and the service was completely suspended in Islamabad, AJK and GB.
Since the start of health card in year 2015, the State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan has been dealing with the card facility, and in 2021 it again won the contract of insurance of health cards for the next three years (2022 to 2025). The insurance has been further extended to June 30, 2027.

GILGIT: Gilgit-Baltistan is in the grip of severe cold temperatures as local people are suffering multiple difficulties owing to acute power shortages and absence of basic facilities.
Three people, including a woman tourist, died due to suffocation caused by LPG leakage in Ghanche and Skardu.
According to police, a couple died of suffocation inside a room due to leakage of LPG in Khawla Brah area of Ghanche district.
The couple had been married only three months ago and were residing together at their home. The couple went to sleep on Sunday night in a room where an LPG heater was operational.
Later, family members found them lying unconscious inside the room. They were immediately shifted to DHQ Hospital, Khaplu, where they were declared dead on Monday.
In another incident, a woman tourist was found dead while her husband was injured due to LPG suffocation in their hotel room in Skardu on Sunday.
Police said the tourist couple from Punjab’s Talagang area were sleeping in a local hotel room in Skardu. They added that both of them were found unconscious on Sunday and shifted to hospital, where the woman was declared dead. The police suspected that leakage of LPG in the room caused her death, while the condition of her husband is stable.
The body was dispatched to their native village, while police have kicked off an investigation into the matter.
‘20-hour power outages’
People across the region are facing severe difficulties due to harsh weather, with most of them remaining indoors. Locals said the region faced over 20 hours of power outages during winter, along with shortages of firewood and gas.
Authorities said that in upper areas of Baltistan — Astore, Hu­­nza, Nagar, and Ghizer — the mercury plunged to minus 16 degrees Celsius on Sunday night, bringing life to a standstill.
Ahmed Khan, a local resident of Astore, told Dawn that residents had been experiencing harsh weather conditions since this week.
Frozen water has made roads slippery, while unavailability and high prices of firewood and electricity shortages have added to the misery of people.
Zulfiqar Ali from Skardu said tourism, the main source of income for locals, had declined completely, leaving people jobless.
Other activities, including agriculture and local commerce, have also been suspended.
Rahim Karim from Gojal said the area experienced less snowfall this year; however, temperatures plunged to minus 14 degrees Celsius. People in the area depend on tourism, which is seasonal, and for half of the year many remain jobless.
PMD refutes claims
The Pakistan Mete­orological Department (PMD) certain social media platforms were circulating misleading and unverified forecasts claiming an extreme cold wave across Pakistan from Jan 16 to 25, with record-breaking temperatures.
The PMD refuted these claims, clarifying that no such extreme or historic cold wave was expected during this period.
It advised the public and stakeholders to rely solely on official forecasts, warnings, and advisories issued by the PMD and to avoid spreading unverified information that might cause unnecessary concern.

Meeting at Parliament House under Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, the party passed a unanimous resolution seeking the immediate release of political prisoners and the restoration of family visits for the former prime minister. The group claimed the country is passing through a “sensitive phase.”
Participants called on democratic forces to agree on a new Charter of Democracy to ensure transparent, free and fair elections so people can elect their true representatives. The resolution also demanded the implementation of the Peace Jirga declaration for lasting peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
The party condemned the police brutality against the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan in Punjab and obstacles created for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister in Sindh.
Paying tribute to Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan and de-seated members, the group praised supporters in Lahore and Karachi for demonstrating their struggle for democratic rights.

Officials said over a hundred students and pilgrims entered Pakis­tan through Gabad-250 border crossing point, while more were expected to return on Tuesday (today).
A group of Pakistani students reached the border in coaches and crossed into Pakistan from Iran on Sunday evening while pilgrims reached on Monday afternoon.
The officials of the FIA immigration confirmed the return of students and pilgrims from Iran. “Over 100 students and pilgrims have returned to Pakistan from Iran in the last two days,” Balaach Yaqoob, senior FIA official told Dawn over the phone. He said another group of 50 students was expected to reach the Gabad-250 border on Tuesday morning.
“Around 40 Pakistani pilgrims including women and children reached Gabad on Monday afternoon,” the official in charge of the Gabad border post said. He added, “We have also received an 18-member family of Pakistani pilgrims at the immigration office.”
According to them, he said, more pilgrims were on their way to Gabad. He said most of the students and pilgrims, who arrived at the border crossing, later left for their hometowns.
About the 50 other students who were expected to arrive on Tuesday, the official said, “We are waiting for them. They are students of Zanjan University of Medical sciences.”

The issue resurfaced a couple of days ago, after an alleged statement attributed to the proscribed religious outfit surfaced, claiming that both were “in the custody of agencies”.
However, senior law enforcement officials are sticking to their earlier stance, maintaining that the two are hiding somewhere in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK). They said the Rizvi brothers had fled on the day the Punjab police launched a pre-dawn operation in Muridke to dismantle the TLP protest camp along G.T. Road.
“I give you my word that they are not in the custody of any security agency and are still in AJK. They are most likely sheltered by a loyal worker of the banned organisation somewhere in the hilly areas,” said a senior officer. Talking to Dawn, he rejected the alleged TLP statement, terming it a “false, funny and self-generated claim”.
A source said a senior Punjab official was tasked with contacting federal authorities to verify the claim after the statement went viral on social media.
He said the provincial official conveyed to a senior official in Islamabad the Punjab police intent to arrest the “fleeing Rizvis” in multiple cases if they were in custody of any security agency, but the federal authorities told him the absconding TLP chief and his brother were not in the custody of any agency.
The source said the two brothers had assumed the status of “high-profile wanted criminals” in cases registered against them under serious and heinous offences, including anti-terrorism charges.
“So far, 44 FIRs have been registered against Saad and Anas in Sheikhupura and 11 in Lahore, in which they are nominated,” he said, adding that the charges were of a grave nature.
Asked why the LEAs had failed to trace them, the official said the absconding TLP leaders were not using phones or other devices, making it difficult to track their location or hideouts.
“We have activated all systems across the country, and it has been confirmed by relevant state institutions that the TLP chief and his brother are still in Pakistan,” he said, ruling out the possibility of their fleeing abroad.
He added that the Punjab police were actively pursuing the fugitives and had constituted several teams.
About the charges, the official said both had allegedly instigated TLP workers and hardcore activists to carry out attacks on law enforcement officials, besides damaging government vehicles and property.
An SHO lost his life, while dozens of others sustained injuries during repea­ted attacks by TLP workers in Lahore and Sheikhupura. He said the TLP chief and his brother had led the “Gaza March”, launched from Lahore, where the party’s headquarters are located, in October last year, with the stated aim of marching towards Islamabad.
Meanwhile, the FIA also moved swiftly, traced around 95 bank accounts allegedly operated by Saad Rizvi, and initiated investigations under money laundering charges, the official said.
Dawn tried to contact the spokesperson/representative of the banned TLP to verify the recent statement claiming that Saad and Anas were in the custody of state agencies. However, the representative neither answered the call nor responded to WhatsApp messages.

DERA ISMAIL KHAN: At least nine people — seven police officials and two civilians — lost their lives in terrorist attacks in Tank and Dera Ismail Khan districts, officials said on Monday.
A police official said SHO Gomal police station Ishaq Ahmad Khan, five other policemen were martyred when an improvised explosive device (IED) targeted an armoured personnel carrier (APC) in Tank’s Gomal area, about 25km from Kot Wali. He added the powerful explosion completely destroyed the police vehicle and also claimed the life of a passer-by.
Rescue 1122 teams rushed to the scene soon after the incident and shifted the bodies and injured to nearby hospitals.
The martyred police personnel were identified as SHO Ishaq Ahmad Khan, Assistant Sub-Inspector Sher Aslam Khan, driver Abdul Majeed, Arshad Ali, Hazrat Ali, and Ehsan­ullah, who served as driver.
Police said the passer-by who was critically injured in the blast later succumbed to his injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The identity of the civilian victim could not be immediately ascertained.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi sought a report from senior officials regarding the attack on Tank police. He expressed deep condolences to the families of the martyrs and their colleagues.
Cop, his cousin martyred
Separately, an Elite Police Force constable was martyred alongside his cousin, in a gun attack in Paharpur tehsil of Dera Ismail Khan, police said.
According to the officials, the incident occurred on Kathgarh Road within the jurisdiction of Paharpur police station. Elite force constable Ismatullah and his cousin Amir died on the spot, while the attackers managed to flee.
Police reached the spot and shifted the bodies to a nearby hospital for medico-legal formalities.
Three cops injured in Lakki blast
Meanwhile, three policemen, including an SHO, were injured when an APC was targeted with an improvised explosive device on the Lakki-Darra Tang Section of the busy Bannu-Mianwali Road on Monday.
A police official said the bomb attack occurred near Jabbarkhel within the limits of Saddar police station and added that the injured policemen were out of danger.
According to a police statement, Lakki Marwat DPO Nazir Khan visited the site, assessed the situation, and ordered a search operation in the area.
The district police chief said that such cowardly acts could not lower the morale of the police force. He said that Lakki Marwat police were responding vigorously to every challenge and were ready to render any sacrifice for the protection of the public.
The DPO asserted that police were resolutely tackling Fitna al Khawarij and added that security had been further increased in the area.
Two terrorists killed in Lakki
Two terrorists were killed in a clash with security forces and police in the Kaichi Kamar area of Lakki Marwat district on Monday.
A police official confirmed the development and said that the security forces and police jointly launched an intelligence-based operation after receiving information about the presence of Fitna al Khawarij in the trans-river belt.
Fitna al Khawarij is the term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the operation, an intense exchange of fire took place, resulting in the neutralisation of two terrorists”, the official maintained.
The slain terrorists were identified as Sheryar alias Sheri and Irfan alias Paan. Police said they were wanted by law enforcement agencies in several terrorism-related cases, including attacks on law enforcement personnel, targeted killings, and IED blasts.
Two killed in Bannu IBO
In Bannu, the Counter-Terrorism Department, in coordination with local police, carried out an intelligence-based operation (IBO), which left two militants dead.
According to police, following an exchange of fire on Jhandokhel Road near Shagi Machankhel, two terrorists were found dead. They were identified as Sohail Khan alias Sangri and Ismail alias Usman.
Police said both were involved in attacks on Sheikh Landik and Fateh Khel police posts, in which eight police constables were injured. They were also involved in attacks on security forces’ convoys and an IED attack on the under-construction Rescue 1122 building.
Attack foiled
In another incident, militants attacked the Nala Kasho police post. However, the attack was foiled due to timely retaliation by police personnel.
Bannu DPO Yasir Afridi later distributed awards among the personnel who repulsed the attack.

“We will have to transform the entire system and become an export nation on an emergency basis, otherwise, the dependence on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and friendly countries for financial support would continue,” said Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal at a news conference on Monday.
He conceded the country’s export performance in first four months (July-October) was not satisfactory even though exports grew by around 1pc. He also said there were genuine questions and impatience why GDP was not growing fast quickly but it was a pragmatism decision of the government not to rush for growth through consumerism as was done by the previous government in 2022.
To gain quick growth to 6pc in 2022, the then government facilitated consumerism by opening imports which increased growth rate but created $50bn trade deficit that evaporated the country’s foreign exchange reserves and then led to massive devaluation and inflation whose impacts are felt even today despite corrective measures.

Ahsan Iqbal says special cell to be created at PM Office for addressing hurdles to achieving ‘40pc growth’ target

“We don’t have to go for artificial growth but the one which is backed by all sectors of economy including agriculture, industry and exports for sustainable path. This can only be done through pragmatism. If we were to break free of external crutches and achieve economic independence, we have to leapfrog exports. There is no other option,” he said.
The minister said a committee he led proposed comprehensive measures to the PM, including announcement for an export emergency, rapid payment of refunds and a special unit in the PM Office with a dedicated hotline tasked with listening to exporters and businesses issues for settlement on emergency basis.

 

He said the committee had also proposed allowing the industrialists and businesses negotiate with their employees to give up long holidays on special occasions against special incentives and payments to avoid break up production cycles. He said other proposals had been framed in consultation with 20 high priority potential sector for export growth.
He said the prime minister had taken those proposals very seriously and had constituted another committee, led by the deputy prime minister and represented by the ministries of finance, planning, economic affairs and other public and private stakeholders for implementation. These recommendations would be finalised next week and presented to the PM for an implementation strategy.
“There is no other way to gain economic sovereignty. The question is how fast we grow our exports,” he said, otherwise the country would again need IMF or friendly countries’ support or both.
He said the government was engaging with the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) to make export plans with local chambers at district level.
The minister conceded that uncompetitive energy prices were a challenge and also because of IMF programme but these conditions should be put to best use to reform agriculture, fiscal and energy sectors in two years for accelerated growth immediately after 2027.

ISLAMABAD: The Federal Constitutional Court finally settled into its newly renovated building on Constitution Avenue on Monday, where FCC Chief Justice Amin­uddin Khan presided over a bench to resume hearing challenges to the imposition of the super tax inside the refurbished Courtroom No. 1.
Before the hearing, Justice Aminuddin Khan inaugurated the new court building in a simple ceremony attended by Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamir Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi and K.K. Agha, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, Supreme Court Bar Association President Haroonur Rashid, FCC Registrar Hafeez Khan, along with lawyers and staff of the new establishment.

 

The FCC has a total sanctioned strength of 13 judges. Soon after its establishment, the FCC was shifted to the Islamabad High Court on a temporary basis, though it was originally envisaged that the new apex court would be housed in the building designated for the Federal Shariat Court (FSC). The FCC had to move to the IHC after FSC judges resisted the plan and denied access to their premises.
Courtroom No. 1 has been completely revamped with new furniture and fixtures, replacing the older seating, along with the installation of a modern audio system to facilitate lawyers and litigants.
However, a senior lawyer expres­sed disappointment over the curre­ntly available facilities in the buil­ding. “Neither is there a bar room for lawyers nor any canteen for litigants inside the FCC,” Advocate Tallat Abbas Khan told Dawn, adding that lawyers had no choice but to cross the road and enter the Supreme Court building just to sit and rest after a day’s work.
He said that since the FCC had become the country’s top court, it would attract a large number of lawyers and litigants in the future, but the facilities currently available were in­­sufficient to cope with the expected volume.
Inside Courtroom No. 1, lawyer Rashid Anwar complained before a three-judge bench headed by the FCC chief justice, hearing the super tax case, that he could not determine how much time he had consumed during arguments as there was no wall clock in the courtroom.
At this, the chief justice obser­ved that the present set-up lacked several facilities, but assured that the issues would be addressed soon.
Referring to a request regarding video-link facilities to different cities, the chief justice said that while the facility was currently not available, it might be provided in the future.
The new FCC building houses seven courtrooms, though only three are currently functional, all located on the first floor. Recently, 22,910 cases were transferred from the Supreme Court to the FCC.
Litigant Facilitation Centre
In a separate development, Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi inaugurated a newly constructed room for advocates-on-record and a Litigant Facilitation Centre at the Supreme Court building as part of ongoing reforms aimed at strengthening service delivery and improving access to justice.
SCBA President Haroonur Rashid, along with members of his cabinet, was also present on the occasion. The newly established centre will provide structured facilitation to advocates-on-record, enabling them to guide litigants on procedural requirements, case filing, documentation and related matters.
However, some lawyers said the facility did not adequately cater to their needs.

Sources told Dawn that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had forwarded a summary advising President Zardari to withdraw the Special Economic Zones (Amendment) Ordinance, 2026.
In his remarks during the year’s first NA session, PPP’s Naveed Qamar had not specified which ordinance was promulgated without the president’s approval when he led a walkout by the party, saying it would not participate in proceedings until the situation was addressed.
Sources in the PPP, however, had confirmed to Dawn he was referring to an ordinance related to special economic zones.
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, meanwhile, said that nowadays there was an e-office through which files were approved online. “This ordinance was also approved. Staff to staff, it was considered approved,” he said in a statement.
The minister acknowledged that when the ordinance’s file was received, it did not bear the president’s signature.
“It had already been printed. A mistake was made which has been rectified,” he stated. “As a goodwill gesture, these bills were not notified because the president did not approve them,” he said.
He noted that the president had 10 days to give his assent to bills passed by a joint sitting of Parliament.
“As a goodwill gesture, these bills were not notified because the president did not approve them,” he said.
“The PPP and the PML-N have a good relationship and because of this relationship, the ordinance has been withdrawn,” the minister said. “In the future, we will approach these matters with understanding,” he concluded.
After the withdrawal of the ordinance, PPP’s Shazia Marri said the party would now attend Tuesday’s NA session.
PPP stages walkout in NA, calls move ‘shameful’
Speaking on the floor of the NA earlier in the day on a point of order, PPP’s Qamar said, “There is a very serious constitutional anomaly taking place.”
He highlighted that Parliament’s primary responsibility was to legislate. “Without the assemblies, there is only one way of legislating, which is if the president promulgates an ordinance under Article 89(1) of the Constitution,” he said.
“For the first time in Pakistan’s black legislative history, an ordinance has been promulgated without the approval or the signature of the president, which is shameful and against the Constitution,“ he alleged, without specifying what the ordinance was.
He said that for the first time, the government was “deviating from the Constitution”.
“How can you promulgate an ordinance and put it into effect without getting the president’s approval on it?” he asked. The PPP leader said that the party had not seen such a practice even during military dictatorships.
“I do not know what the government’s excuse is for doing this,” he remarked. He made it clear that the law would have no standing anywhere, including in a court of law and Parliament.
Declaring that the PPP would not participate in proceedings until the situation was addressed, he announced a walkout along with other members of his party.
For his part, Law Minister Tarar had attempted to call the PPP members back to no avail.
“Please come back and join the proceedings. Let me explain that things are going in the right direction,“ he said. He explained that an ordinance was issued on the premier’s advice and “there is no doubt that the president has to assent to it”.
Tarar insisted that Article 89 of the Constitution was subject to Article 48(1) of the Constitution under which the advice of the prime minister was binding on the president.
“It has been brought to our notice … there is something circulating on social media. Let me recheck,” he said.
He noted that “nine or 10 bills and ordinances” were pending presidential assent, and the ministry only came to know on Sunday that President Zardari had given his assent to those bills.
“Maybe it is part of that or it is not part of that,” he said.
He said the deeming clause is invoked under Article 75 of the Constitution when the bills returned by the president and passed by the Parliament in a joint sitting are not assented to within ten days. “But we never notified them out of respect for the president,“ he remarked.
He said he would speak to the relevant quarters and get back to PPP’s Qamar.
Later, PPP MNA Hussain Tariq returned to the assembly only to point out the lack of quorum. After a headcount, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq suspended the proceedings. Subsequently, the session was adjourned till 11am on Tuesday.







NA speaker gets ball rolling on opposition leader’s appointment
Separately, NA Speaker Sadiq also sought proposals for the nomination of the opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament during Monday’s session.
The post has been vacant since August 2025, following the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). While the opposition has accused the government of delaying the appo­intment despite them putting forward Mahmood Khan Achakzai’s name for the role, Sadiq has maintained that the delay was because the matter was sub judice.
At the outset of Monday’s session, Sadiq reiterated his stance that he could not initiate the nomination process earlier as the matter was subjudice and the NA Secretariat had been made a party in the cases.
He said that as PTI’s Ayub had withdrawn his petitions in the Supreme Court and high courts against his removal, the nomination process could now be formally initiated.
“This issue had to head towards resolution only then. We would have done so if we had not been made a party [to the case],” Sadiq said.
Addressing the opposition benches, he said proposals for nominating the opposition leader may be submitted in his chambers by 3pm tomorrow (Tuesday), as per Rule 39(ii) of the Rules of Procedures.
Rule 39 confirms it is the sole prerogative of the speaker to ask the opposition at any time to submit a name, after which the opposition may present it.







Sadiq stated that the nominations should be accompanied by the signatures of members of the opposition. The count will be made at 3pm on January 14 in accordance with Rule 39(iii) of the NA rules, the speaker announced.
The MNA having the greatest numerical strength after the signature of the members shall be declared as the opposition leader.
It is worth noting that the opposition had submitted the name of Achakzai — who heads the opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) — to the speaker’s office in October 2025 rather than presenting it to the speaker personally.
Speaking in the NA, Sadiq recalled that he had informed PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan and opposition chief whip Malik Amir Dogar that the matter was sub judice when they had called on him in November 2025.
He highlighted that he had written letters to the opposition on Nov 19, Dec 5, Dec 19 and Dec 29 to “confirm the status”, following which Dogar submitted the required documents.
Responding to him on the assembly floor, Dogar said he had submitted an application with the signatures of 76 opposition MNAs keeping in view Rule 39.
“We are unanimously willing to provide verification however you want,” he said, reiterating that Achakzai was their choice as per PTI founder Imran Khan’s decision.
Dogar assured the speaker that the opposition would fulfil the required process tomorrow, and requested him to formally notify the opposition leader immediately.

The development came as Indonesian Defence Minister Lieutenant General (retd) Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin called on Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.
“The meeting focused on matters of mutual interest, evolving regional and global security dynamics, and exploration of avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” it said.







“Both sides underscored the importance of strengthening institutional linkages, training collaboration and defence industrial cooperation between Pakistan and Indonesia,” it added.
“The visiting dignitary lauded the professionalism of Pakistan’s armed forces and acknowledged their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. He also expressed Indonesia’s desire to further expand defence ties with Pakistan across multiple domains,” it said.
CDF Field Marshal Munir reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fostering a strong and enduring defence relationship with Indonesia, based on shared values, mutual respect, and convergence of strategic interests, the statement concluded.
Meanwhile, a defence delegation led by the Indonesian minister also called on Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu at Air Headquarters in Islamabad, a separate ISPR statement said.
“The meeting reaffirmed the historic and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Indonesia and focused on strengthening bilateral air force cooperation, particularly in capacity building, training and technological collaboration,” the statement said.
It added that the air chief briefed the delegation on PAF’s modernisation drive, including infrastructure development, revamped training and the induction of niche capabilities to enhance readiness for multi-domain operations.







The Indonesian defence minister praised the PAF’s professionalism, combat readiness and indigenisation achievements under the National Aerospace Science and Technology Park, expressing strong interest in expanding cooperation in training, aviation and aerospace domains, the statement added.
“The meeting reflected growing momentum in Pakistan-Indonesia defence ties and a shared resolve to deepen cooperation through sustained engagement and dialogue,” it concluded.
The meetings come a month after Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto visited Pakistan, with the two countries agreeing to enhance bilateral trade, expand cooperation in health, agriculture, information technology, science and education, and deepen coordination on regional and global issues, including Palestine.</p><small>2026-01-12 17:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644715-pakistan-indonesia-closing-in-on-jets-and-drones-defence-deal-say-sources' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Indonesia closing in on jets and drones defence deal: sources</strong></a><br><p>
