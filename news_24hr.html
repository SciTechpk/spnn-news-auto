• Red Cross says aid blockade to Gaza ‘unacceptable’
• Military strikes across the enclave kill 105 people
CAIRO: Dozens of community kitchens in Gaza shut their doors on Thursday due to a lack of supplies, closing off a lifeline used by hundreds of thousands of people in a further blow to efforts to combat growing hunger in the enclave.
The move followed hours after the US-based World Central Kitchen (WCK) charity announced that it had run out of the ingredients necessary to provide much-needed free meals and had been prevented by Israel from bringing in aid.
Amjad al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian Non-Governmental Organisations Network (PNGO) in Gaza, told Reuters that most of the enclave’s 170 community kitchens had shut down after running out of stock due to Israel’s continued blockade on Gaza.
Shawa said the decision by the WCK, announced late on Wednesday, and the closure of community kitchens on Thursday would cause a drop of between 400,000 to 500,000 free meals per day for the 2.3 million population.
“The remaining kitchens will be closing soon. The hunger catastrophe is beyond words. People are losing their lone source of food,” Shawa added.
Those Gazans trying to cook independently meanwhile complain that flour still available on the market is contaminated.
Israel has faced growing international pressure to lift an aid blockade that it imposed in March after the collapse of a US-backed ceasefire that had halted fighting for two months.
Two weeks ago most of the population relied on one and a half meals per day, but in the past few days that has dropped to one meal a day, and even that will lack meat, vegetables or the necessary healthy components, said Shawa.
‘Unacceptable’
The Red Cross denounced the human cost of the war raging in Gaza, slamming Israel’s “unacceptable” full blockade on aid into the besieged and conflict-ravaged Palestinian territory.
Aid agencies have repeatedly warned of a growing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, which they say has been exacerbated by an Israeli blockade on all aid since early March.
“It is unacceptable that humanitarian aid is not allowed into the Gaza Strip,” Pierre Krahenbuhl, director general of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), told reporters in Geneva.
“That’s just fundamentally against anything that international humanitarian law provides.” The situation in Gaza is on a “razor’s edge” and “the next few days are absolutely decisive”, he added.
“There’s a moment where we will also run out of anything that’s left in terms of medical supplies and other” aid, he said.
“Right now, the most effective way to get aid to people is to lift…actions or decisions that were taken to prevent aid from reaching” inside Gaza, Krahenbuhl said. “There are huge quantities of aid that are on the borders of Gaza that can go in tomorrow,” he insisted.
On Thursday, the Gaza health ministry said Israeli military strikes across the enclave killed at least 105 people in the past 24 hours, in one of the biggest death tolls in a single day in two months. More than 52,700 people have been killed by Israel since Oct 2023.
Published in Dawn, May 9th, 2025</p><small>2025-05-09 03:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/681d5b6b16aa6.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909603/inclusive-or-exclusive-growth' target='_blank'><strong>Inclusive or exclusive growth?</strong></a><br><p>THE government has clearly stated that inclusive growth is its foremost priority. This is reassuring, but will require reforms in the economic and development agendas of both the government and its international partners. Losing no time, we must prioritise people’s needs, particularly for the poorest households. Inclusive, and not exclusive, growth means lifting millions out of poverty and giving the children from such households their fundamental rights — primary education, basic nutrition and the right to survive their fifth birthday.
This is a call to put people’s development front and centre, and to deal with the shameful neglect of social and human development. Lessons can be drawn from the Social Action Programme in the late 1990s when multinationals and the Pakistan government designated resources to improve the lagging social indicators in health, education and population. Indeed, that exclusive focus and policy priorities, backed by additional financing didlead to improvements in crucial indicators. Fertility declined from 5.8 to 4.4 children per woman, female net enrolment rates rose from 38 to 48 per cent and the infant mortality rate declined from 100 to 80 deaths per 1,000 births in the 10-year period from 1995 to 2005.
Over the past two decades, we have seen growing stagnation in social development: in particular, fertility rates and female and male enrolment rates have remained alarmingly stagnant. This is not surprising since there have been no notable investments in social development due to the lack of funds. A new and aggressive social development agenda has to be launched to break the current trajectory that is leading us away from inclusive growth.
Some actions that can pay huge political and social dividends, with ripple effects, must be prioritised. The first step is for the state to focus on compulsory and free universal primary education. It will demonstrate the state’s determination to redress the decline in investment in Pakistan’s children. It is the state’s responsibility, above all, to provide free, and enforce compulsory, schooling for all children. Those who can afford it send their children to school, especially to the large number of private schools. The poorest households are unable to send their children to school because they cannot: there is no teacher and no school where their children can be enrolled free of cost. This enhances the wide gulf between classes, disbarring any upward generational mobility for millions of children and leading to intergenerational decline in mental abilities.

Over the past two decades, we have seen growing stagnation in social development.

Quality in the eyes of parents is determined by the presence and qualification of teachers and not physical buildings. They will send their children to school if the teachers are present. Above all, sending all children to school, if it is made a national priority, can be achieved rapidly. For primary schooling, the focus should be on female teachers as they can teach both boys and girls, while having double shifts can eliminate the need to build new schools. This would also tap the potential of thousands of girls and women across the country for productive work.
The second step is to truly empower Pakistan’s women and girls. Inclusive growth has no room for gender bias. Low educational performance and stagnant participation in the labour force do not reflect the aspirations of the 120m women and girls in the country. Women and girls want the same opportunities as men, and when these are available to them, they perform better against all odds.
Foremost, we must step up efforts to encourage women to enter the labour force. Female labour force participation rates have stagnated at less than 24pc for more than a decade. No country can claim inclusive growth or equitable progress without the active contribution of women to household income and savings. Unleashing their productivity will trigger positive social and economic transformation. Existing laws against violence in the workplace and female mobility promotion in Sindh and Punjab are good steps. However, more efforts such as a mandatory quota for women in private and public sector jobs are required. The media can certainly contribute by breaking underlying patriarchal mental models that restrict women’s sphere to the home.
The third and possibly the easiest step to implement is to reduce the current high levels of fertility and associated high maternal morbidity and mortality. Repeated and closely spaced pregnancies half of which are mistimed or unplanned are not the fault of women — 3.5m of these pregnancies end in induced abortions and 1.4m unwanted births annually. This can be changed. Fertility levels can be brought down if pregnancy rates are reduced by half, with pregnancies being truly planned.
 
 

Changing stagnating fertility patterns to ensure healthier spacing of pregnancies and fewer unplanned pregnancies will directly help lower infant mortality and malnutrition which continue to be central to the World Bank Country Partnership framework. Arguably, steps are required to improve food security and child stunting, but malnutrition cannot be addressed without reducing fertility in the country.
Left to women, Pakistan could have a lower fertility rate. Women’s stated wanted fertility is one child less than the current 3.6 births per woman. This would bring Pakistan’s fertility closer to the level of our own national goals for FP2030 agreed upon in the Council of Common Interests’ 2018 goals. Extended birth spacing services and campaigns like the ones followed in comparable Muslim countries like Indonesia and Bangladesh will bring rapid change.
Above all, economists and planners who belie­­ve inclusive growth is equivalent to greater GDP growth need to acknowledge that any gains will be eroded by rapid population growth and low so­­cial development contributing to low productivity.
As pointed out in Pakistan@2050: Demographic Change, Future Projections and Development Oppor­tunities, a reduction in the population growth rate is largely possible with the reforms stated above. It will bring a dramatic rise of 37pc in the per capita income and 5pc GDP growth by 2050.
Pakistan will only lose more time if it puts aside the social development agenda. We cannot wait for economic growth rates to rise to invest in people. Instead, social development investment should be allowed to propel inclusive growth.

And there are real fears of escalation to a full-scale war between the two countries that have nuclear weapons. India attacked several places early on Wednesday. Given the situation, the Islamabad and Punjab governments announced the closure of all educational institutions on Wednesday. The situation is very tense and fears of escalation are very much there, especially given the drone incursions across Pakistan on Thursday.
But there were no instructions, from the education departments about Thursday or the next few days for that matter. All schools and universities have been taking their own decisions and moving from one decision to another. My daughter’s school sent a message on Wednesday night that classes would be in person and on campus. Early morning, when we were getting ready, we got a message that classes would be online. And we have just received a message that education will be online till further notice. Some universities have moved classes online for a few days. Others are carrying on in person. Some have allowed students to have more flexibility and decide whether they want to come in or not.
Emergencies in Pakistan are becoming more frequent and raising uncertainties for everyone. I do not remember having this situation in the days and years when I was in college or school. In recent times, we have seen schools and universities being shut down during the pandemic, smog, cricket matches, visits of dignitaries, conflict or fear of war, public protests, anticipated public protests, rain, floods, cold and heat. I am sure I am forgetting some of the other reasons. The number of days that are lost from the education perspective has gone up.
 
 

This disrupts education delivery for sure. It upsets students, upsets their learning, makes continuity, covering the syllabus and other planned lessons difficult, makes teaching a lot harder for the already stressed-out and stretched-to-the-limit instructors, and lowers educational outcomes. We have plenty of evidence of poorer learning outcomes from the pandemic days.
Here is just a small example. It is almost the end of the spring semester for a lot of universities and they were gearing up for examinations. There are many universities that have hostels too where a lot of young people are staying. These young people are away from their families. In a situation like the current one, it is inevitable that parents would be concerned about children who are away from them. And many young people might be feeling concerned or scared too and might need the comfort of their parents and families. Should universities let young people go home? Should they postpone examinations? Should they move to online examinations? Or should they expect young people to soldier on irrespective of what is happening?

Should contingency planning not get more attention from the educational authorities?

Every time something like this happens, the response is always the same. Yes, this is bad, but what can we do? We cannot endanger our children or expose them to x, y, or z. It is true that once we are in a situation, there is not a whole lot that can be done, but should we then not start preparing for such situations through regular planning? Should contingency planning not get more attention from the educational authorities and regulators? We might not be able to plan for all contingencies as nature or circumstances can always spring new surprises on us, but we can start anticipating many things. Smog is going to hit us in large parts of Punjab, KP and some parts of Sindh for sure and a number of times in a year. Extreme weather conditions and events are becoming the norm and are to be expected. Political protests will happen. Terror attacks have seen an uptick and it seems they will be with us for the foreseeable future. And, it seems, we will keep repeating the tension cycle with India, as will they.
Should provincial education departments as well as the HEC, the higher education regulator, not go through an exercise that does some contingency planning for how to respond to situations that we are going to see more of? Some scenarios could be developed as guidelines for universities and schools, to figure out responses and to also, if needed, invest in appropriate infrastructure and/ or services, to ensure that the switch to contingency is as smooth as possible. What sort of investment should be made in public school infrastructure or services, and teacher training to ensure better delivery of education services when contingencies arise? It is the schools with fewer resources, in the public as well as private sector, that suffer more and will suffer more. But these are the very schools we should be more worried about as they are in the majority and learning poverty already tends to be higher in them.
When we came back from Covid — and we were back in person — a lot of universities and schools stopped paying for Zoom licences as it was considered a waste of money. Now, when we have to switch, schools use the free Zoom facility but then have to tailor classes for free sessions. Or they have to switch to other free platforms which teachers might or might not be familiar with.
There is definitely a need for better contingency planning. Extreme events or unpredictable events are increasing. They are becoming more ‘predictable’ and so we need to take them into account in education planning at both the school and university level. At one time it was just about the unpredictability of load-shedding. All of us individually arranged for generators or UPS, etc. Now it is at a much bigger level; we will need institutional and public responses to these.

The market capital had lost Rs1.3 trillion in value in three sessions as jittery investors preferred to exit the market amid growing uncertainty about the economic outlook as geopolitical tensions turned into a military standoff after India hit three cities with missiles in the wee hours of Wednesday, martyring over 31 innocent civilians. Pakistan’s armed forces responded with the downing of five Indian fighter planes.
Meanwhile, Indian shares fell on Thursday in their most volatile session this month. The Nifty 50 settled 0.58pc lower at 24,273.8 and the BSE Sensex fell 0.51pc to 80,334.81 after struggling for direction in early trade.
Topline Securities Ltd said the PSX faced an unprecedented meltdown on Thursday as the benchmark KSE-100 index plunged by 6,482.21 points, closing at 103,527.82 — marking the largest single-day decline in the index’s history in absolute terms.

Indian shares fall in most volatile session this month

Investor sentiment remained deeply shaken throughout the session, which saw extreme volatility. The KSE-100 recorded its highest-ever intraday movement of 10,282 points, swinging from an intraday high of 1,872 points to an intraday low of 8,410 points.
The market crash followed alarming geopolitical developments after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry announced that Pakistani forces had neutralised 25 drones sent by India since last night. He also confirmed that four army personnel were injured after one drone managed to partially strike a military target, despite the majority being intercepted.
The statement sent shockwaves through financial markets, triggering widespread panic selling amid fears of escalating cross-border hostilities. Investors rushed to offload positions, leading to a broad-based decline across sectors.
Amid the sharp sell-off, trading was temporarily halted for one hour after the KSE-30 index dropped more than 5pc for five consecutive minutes, activating the market’s circuit breaker mechanism.
The largest drag on the benchmark index came from Fauji Fertiliser,  Mari Energies, United Bank, OGDC, and Pakistan Petroleum, which eroded 2,051 points from the benchmark index.
Ali Najib, Head of Sales at Insight Securities, said PSX commenced the session on a positive note as the index gained 1,872 points or 1.70pc. However, media reports about drone attacks dampened investors’ confidence regarding the current escalation is fizzling out.
Selling pressure diminished the previously strong momentum after ISPR’s con­­firmation. Conse­quen­tly, PSX went through with its historic bloodbath, and at 12:34 pm, trading was halted for an hour.
However, there was no sigh of relief after trading resumed at 13:34 pm as the benchmark index continued to receive selling pressure.
The market participation was strong as the trading volume rose 18.81pc to 653.55 million shares, and the traded value rose 17.65pc to Rs35.43 billion day-on-day. Ahsan Meha­n­­ti of Arif Habib Corpora­tion said stocks witnessed the largest decline amid security unrest, adding that the weak rupee, economic uncertainty, and falling Pakistan’s dollar bonds played a catalyst role in the record bearish close at PSX.

Pope Leo appeared on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica after white smoke had billowed from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signifying the 133 cardinal electors had chosen a new leader for the 1.4 billion-member Catholic Church.
“Peace be with you all,” he told the cheering crowd, speaking in fluent Italian. He also spoke in Spanish during his brief address, but did not say anything in English.
Prevost, 69 and originally from Chicago, has spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru and has dual Peruvian nationality. He became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given few media interviews and rarely speaks in public.
President Donald Trump swiftly congratulated Prevost on becoming the first US pope. “What excitement, and what a Great Honor for our Country. I look forward to meeting Pope Leo XIV. It will be a very meaningful moment!”  Prevost beco­mes the 267th Catholic pope after the death last month of Pope Francis, who was the first Latin American pontiff and had led the Church for 12 years.
Francis had widely sought to open the staid institution up to the modern world, enacting a range of reforms and allowing debate on divisive issues such as women’s inclusion of LGBT Catholics.
Leo thanked Francis in his speech and repeated his predecessor’s call for a church that is engaged with the modern world and “is always looking for peace, charity and being close to people, especially those who are suffering”.
He had not been seen as a frontrunner and there was a brief moment of silence when his name was announced to the packed St Peter’s Square, before people started to clap and cheer.
“I’m just thrilled. I hope this can bring to America a more loving community. I think there’s a lot of hate in America. I think there’s a lot of racism. I have experienced it,” said Lailah Brown, 28, from Seattle, Washington, an African American.
“I hope America does not embarrass the pope,” he said.
Ahead of the conclave, some cardinals called for continuity with Francis’s vision of greater openness and reform, while others said they wanted to turn back the clock and embrace old traditions.
Unlike Francis, who spurned much of the trappings of the papacy from the day he was elected in 2013, Prevost wore a traditional red papal garment over his white cassock.
A crowd of clergy and staff members at Chicago’s Catholic Theological Union erupted in a joyful cheer as Pope Leo walked out onto the Vatican balcony, some four decades after he graduated from the South Side school.
It was an “explosion of excitement and cheers that went up in the room … many of us were just simply incredulous and just couldn’t even find words to express our delight, our pride,” said Sister Barbara Reid, president of the theology school.
Pope Leo graduated from the school in 1982 with a master’s degree. Reid called Leo intellectually brilliant, saying he has an extraordinarily compassionate heart.
“It’s an unusual blend that makes him a leader who can think critically, but listens to the cries of the poorest, and always has in mind those who are most needy,” she said.
The last pope to take the name Leo led the Church from 1878 to 1903. Leo XIII was known for his devoted focus on social justice issues, and is often credited with laying the foundation for modern Catholic social teaching.
Felicitations
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez was among world leaders congratulating the new pope.
“May his pontificate contribute to strengthening dialogue and the defense of human rights in a world in need of hope and unity,” Sanchez said.
Prevost has attracted interest from his peers because of his quiet style and support for Francis, especially his commitment to social justice issues.
Prevost served as a bishop in Chiclayo, in northwestern Peru, from 2015 to 2023.
Francis brought him to Rome that year to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world’s bishops.
“Most of us thought a US cardinal would never become pope, but Prevost got strong support from cardinals from Latin America where he worked for 20 years,” said Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit commentator who has covered the Vatican for decades.
“He is multilingual and has a reputation as a listener,” said Reese.  “The Holy Spirit continues to surprise us.”

Airports have been shut, exams postponed and markets have been on edge. On Thursday, the military said that 25 Israeli-made Indian drones were shot down over different parts of Pakistan. In some cases, India’s drone attacks led to damage and injuries. While India had struck sites in AJK and Punjab in its initial aggression on May 7, yesterday’s drone targets included Sindh as New Delhi climbed up the escalatory ladder. Indian media outlets claimed that Pakistan attacked targets in held Jammu and Kashmir, but the government has denied this. The fact is that India initiated hostilities against Pakistan on the basis of unproven allegations in the Pahalgam killings, and launched its so-called ‘Operation Sindoor’. Pakistan retaliated by downing five of its jets. It is now time for all to step back from the brink.
India’s defence minister asserted that his country wanted to resolve “problems through dialogue”, while its military stressed its “commitment to non-escalation”. But the fact remains, that India is persisting with its provocative attacks, jeopardising civilian lives on this side of the border. Therefore, its ‘commitment’ to dialogue and non-escalation remains highly questionable.
One positive development on Thursday came in the form of a statement by Deputy PM Ishaq Dar that contacts between both states’ NSAs and DGMOs had been established. Sadly, while foreign friends have counselled restraint, there has been a marked indifference on the part of the international community to actively help defuse the crisis. This indifference is perplexing in a nuclear neighbourhood, as an escalation in hostilities will not remain a bilateral matter, but affect all of South Asia as well as the Middle East.
 
 

Therefore, the UN and states that enjoy a good rapport with both Islamabad and New Delhi should play a role in cooling temperatures. President Donald Trump has urged both countries to “stop” the violence, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke to the PM on the matter. Other foreign powers, such as the Gulf states, Iran, and others should also redouble their efforts for a diplomatic solution.
Jingoism is evident in both countries, but elements in India’s media, cultural and political sphere have been egging on their country in the confrontation. Perhaps they think of war in the context of Bollywood action films. The actual reality of conflict is much darker. Even a conventional war would cost countless lives and increase misery on both sides. What a nuclear showdown has in store is too horrific to contemplate. Therefore, sense must prevail, and the march to war should be halted. Along with foreign efforts, the contacts made between the NSAs and DGMOs must continue in order to de-escalate matters and return to a more manageable state of affairs.

The show, however, will go on with the closing stages of this season’s PSL to be held in the United Arab Emirates.
“The PCB confirms that the remaining fixtures of the HBL PSL X have been shifted to the UAE,” the PCB said in a statement in the early hours of Friday morning. “The exact sche­dule of matches, outlining the dates and venues, will be shared in due course.”
Four matches of the league stage of the country’s glitzy T20 extravaganza are still to be held, which will decide which four teams advance to the playoffs.
That, after Thursday’s match between Peshawar Zalmi and Karachi Kings, which was to be held at the Pindi Cricket Stadium, was called off hours before the scheduled start time.
Pakistan’s military on Thursday said it took down nearly two dozen Indian drones sent on this side of the border since the previous night. One of those drones crashed within the stadium’s complex, inflicting some damage.
The worsening situation saw the PCB, PSL and government officials gather for a meeting, which continued till late in the night with other venues, including Karachi and Dubai, coming into consideration for the remaining eight matches of the league.
PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement that the board had decided to shift the remaining matches to the UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers could be saved from “the possible reckless targeting by India”.
He also stressed it was important for the board “to ensure the mental well-being of all players” participating in the tournament.
PCB spokesperson Amir Mir had told Dawn earlier on Thursday the security of the players, especially the foreigners is the most important for us. “There have been drones brought down in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi We will decide in due course what needs to be done.”
Carrying out the matches in Rawalpindi only also came under discussion, sources said.
Asked if postponing all the remaining matches for an indefinite period was an option, sources in PCB said that it was highly unlikely as foreign players due the national and international commitments of foreign players.
BBC Sport had reported that a postponement was being considered.
Earlier on Thursday, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also Pakistan’s interior minister held a meeting with the PSL teams — except Multan Sultans, who are currently in their home city — in Islamabad and met foreign players.
Out of remaining eight matches — four were slated to be held in Rawalpindi, one in Multan and three in Lahore, including the final.
The cross border tensions also affected Thursday’s Indian Premier League match between Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals in the Himalayan region of Dharamsala, which was called off midway due to a “floodlight malfunction” according to the Board of Control for Cricket in India.
The incident occurred hours after the BCCI had said that it had shifted the match between Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians — scheduled to be held on Sunday in Dharamsala – to Ahmedabad.
Cricket boards around the world were monitoring the situation across the two countries with several foreign-based players featuring in both the PSL and the IPL.
Bangladeshi media reported that The Bangladesh Cricket Board was working to bring home Nahid Rana and Rishad Hossain — participating in the PSL for Peshawar Zalmi and Lahore Qalandars respectively — “in a timely and secure manner”.
“The BCB is in active coordination with the PCB and the Bangladesh High Commission in Islamabad to ensure that all necessary measures are in place to guarantee the security of our players,” the board said in a statement.
BBC Sport reported that some English players participating in the PSL were considering leaving while others wanted to stay.
The Professional Cricketers’ Association (PCA) has been in regular contact with the 15-person contingent, it said.
Cricket West Indies (CWI) also said that it was in touch with their players in the PSL and IPL and has engaged West Indies Players’ Association (WIPA) “to coordinate and ensure the safety, security, and well-being of all West Indies players and support personnel in the region”.

On Thursday night, Indian news channels were flooded with reports claiming that India’s air defence systems had shot down Pakistani jets during alleged attacks on  multiple locations across Jammu in India-held Kashmir and Punjab in  India.
Although the claims were widely repeated, no evidence or footage was offered to substantiate them.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar dismissed the claims that India shot down Pakistani jets, including an F-16 and two JF-17 fighter jets. He termed the claim “absurd and false”.
“Fake and concocted stories will get you nowhere. Such false claims only reflect your desperation. Denied and rejected,” the minister said in a post on X.
 






Separately, speaking to Geo News, the information minister challenged the Indian government to provide proof of downing any PAF fighters or capturing a pilot.
“I am 100 per cent denying it. With fullest confidence at my command, I am denying it,” the information minister said.

Also on Thursday evening, Indian media claimed Pakistan had launched attacks using missiles and drones across Jammu in India-occupied Kashmir.
The Foreign Office immediately rubbished this claim as well.
 
 

“[Pakistan] categorically rejects the baseless and irresponsible allegations propagated by the Indian media, accusing Pakistan of launching attacks on Pathankot, Jaisalmer, and Srinagar. These claims are entirely unfounded, politically motivated, and part of a reckless propaganda campaign aimed at maligning Pakistan,” it said in a statement on Thursday night.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif also contradicted the Indian misinformation.
“We deny it, we have not mounted anything so far,” Mr Asif told BBC in an interview. The minister added that when Pakistan does strike, everyone will know it. “We will not strike and then deny.”
He said Pakistan will not deny any actions it takes.
Earlier, Indian media reports claimed that explosions were heard in held Kashmir and there was a blackout in the region.
In a statement on X, the Indian military said there have been no losses reported and that the threat has been “neutralised”, without giving any proof.

ISLAMABAD: At least three people lost their lives and seven, including four soldiers, sustained injuries as Pakistan intercepted and destroyed as many as 25 Indian drones that had intruded into its airspace across the country, possibly to target military installations.
According to the military, the locations where these drones were neutralised included Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi, and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur, Umerkot and Karachi in Sindh.
Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military’s chief spokesperson, confirmed that one civilian lost their life while another sustained injuries in Miano.
Moreover, as per police, one person each was slain in Attock and Rawalpindi.
“One drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” said the army spokesperson. “Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.
The rest of the drones apparently missed their potential targets and caused damages in densely populated areas.
 
 

Three drones were shot down in Walton and Burki, near Lahore. Officials said two drones crashed in Walton, while another crashed in Burki soon after security forces intercepted them. According to a witness, they heard multiple explosions in the old Walton airport area, leading to widespread confusion among locals.
In Rawalpindi, one person — a resident of Lahore — lost his life and two were inj­ured after a drone crashed near the Pindi Cricket Stadium on the Murree Road.
A police officer said that the stadium’s food street was not fully open and there were not many people around ; otherwise, there could have been more casualties.
Another drone damaged a house after it crashed on its rooftop in the Westridge locality of the garrison city. However, no casualties were reported.
In Attock, a farmer was killed near Jabbi Kasran — a town in Fateh Jang tehsil — after an Indian drone was downed. The injured person was taken to hospital, but could not survive.
In Gujranwala, three drones were destroyed in different locations of the district. The locals found wreckage of the drones in the Tokrian village of Wahndo and Solakhanabad village on the outskirts of the city. Another drone was found in a field near Aimanabad’s Agu Bhandar village of Gujranwala.
In Gujrat, parts of an Indian drone were found in Peer Jhand village in the jurisdiction of the Dinga police station. According to eyewitnesses, some parts of the drone fell in the field while some crashed on a house, falling through its roof into a room on the ground floor. However, everyone remained safe.
In Bahawalpur, an Ind­ian drone was destroyed in the Cholistan desert. According to the announcement, the Indian drone hit the area of Chapoowala in the desert in the limits of tehsil Yazman.
In Karachi, two drones fell on the outskirts of the Malir district, partially damaging the roof of a house. The first drone fell on a house in the Sharafi Goth slum, said area police SHO Sadaruddin Mirani. It damaged the roof partially, but no one was hurt. He said the incident occu­rred at around 10:30am.
The officer said that the drone was two and a half feet long.
Soon after, another dr­­o­ne fell near the residential neighbourhood of Gulshan-i-Hadeed.
Malir SP Mansoor Gulzar Bozdar told Dawn the drone fell in a hilly area near Link Road. He said it did not cause any damage to life or property.
In Umerkot, an Indian drone also crashed near the village of Sufi Akbar, close to the Chhor cantonment. Fortunately, no casualties or injuries were reported.
‘Serious, serious provocation’
India also admitted that it targetted military installations.
A statement by India’s Press Information Bureau said army installations were targeted “at a number of locations across Pakistan”. However, the attacks mostly took place in areas heavily populated by civilians.
As he shared details about the operation that downed drones, Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the Pakistan Army used “their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully” to shoot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones.
Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said, “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”
“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” it added.
“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.
During the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.
“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” Lt-Gen Chaudhry continued.
“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the ISPR chief added.
According to BBC News, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said the Indian government needs to transition from “cinema” into the “real world we live in” and called the strikes a “phantom defence”.

Lahore, Islamabad, Karachi and Sialkot airports were the most affected, as air traffic was halted for several hours amid rising tensions between Pakistan and India. How­ever, flight operations at the four airports later resumed on Thursday after temporary suspensions.
The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) initially said that flight operations at Karachi’s Jinnah Inter­nat­ional Airport would remain suspen­ded until midnight, but they resu­med earlier than scheduled. Flight operations at Islamabad, Lah­ore and Sialkot airports resumed by evening.
Earlier in the day, the PAA had temporarily suspended operations at Karachi, Lahore and Sialkot airports until Thursday noon, citing operational reasons. Islamabad International Airport also briefly suspended flights during the day.
Later, the PAA extended the closure at Lahore, Islamabad and Sialkot until 6pm before confirming their reopening.
Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) confirmed that the country’s ongoing security situation severely disrupted air operations nationwide.
“In the interest of air safety, some routes have been restricted as a precaution, affecting several flights,” a PIA spokesperson said. “The temporary closure of air routes has been undertaken to protect the assets of domestic carriers and ensure passenger safety.”
The airline urged passengers to remain patient and cooperate with airline staff, adding that its call centre was actively contacting affected travellers.
For passengers of diverted flights, PIA said it had made arrangements for meals and accommodation. Passengers were advised to check flight status via the PIA website or helpline before heading to the airport.
Passengers stranded
Passengers said that they faced immense difficulties due to last-minute cancellations. “I was scheduled to fly to Washington via Doha in the early hours of Thursday from Lahore airport, but the airline rescheduled the flight for later that morning.
Ghazala Bibi, another traveller, said her flight to Dubai from Sialkot was cancelled at the last minute due to the airport’s suddenclosure.
Passengers arriving from abroad also faced immense difficulties due to diversions. Domestic air travellers encountered similar issues, with flight operations disrupted for a third consecutive day due to intermittent airport closures.
“Domestic flights have been badly affected over the past three days,” an official said.
The Haj flight operation, which began recently, has also been almost suspended amid the escalating situation between the two countries.
While a tour operator told Dawn that most international airlines had suspended flights to and from Pakistan until May 10, the PAA said it was continuously issuing revised notices to airmen or Notams to update the status of airport operations and the opening of airspace.

• 200 ongoing uplift projects likely to be closed
• Ahsan says proper allocations cannot be made for key schemes                        
ISLAMABAD: The federal government will present the next fiscal year’s budget on June 2, with a 16 per cent lower development allocation of Rs921 billion, resulting in the likely closure of about 200 ongoing development projects.
This was announced at a press conference by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who disclosed that an indicative budget ceiling (IBC) of Rs921bn for the next year provided by the Ministry of Finance was over three times lower than Rs2.9 trillion demanded by the Planning Commission based on requirements of various ministries for development projects.
The figure is also around 16pc lower than the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr, slashed on the instructions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from Rs1.4tr approved by the parliament as part of the federal budget 2024-25.
The minister said he would contest the IBC provided by the finance ministry and request the prime minister for higher allocations of at least Rs1.6tr to provide the rupee cover for foreign-funded projects.
The minister also launched the Planning Ministry’s Monthly Development Update for May 2025 during the press conference, a new initiative on the pattern of finance ministry’s monthly economic outlook.
Responding to a question, Mr Iqbal said authorisation for the disbursement had been issued for about Rs900bn out of Rs1.1tr PSDP for the current year.
He hoped the authorisation would increase during May and June. However, he hastened to add that the finance division had its own constraints, as resources were needed to increase the development budget, which required an increase in the tax-to-GDP ratio.
He said the Annual Plan Coordination Com­mittee would meet on May 23 to finalise the next year’s development programme in consultations with provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.
Meanwhile, the National Economic Council (NEC) is expected to meet on May 26 or 27 to approve the development programme and macroeconomic targets for the next fiscal year. The federal budget would be presented on June 2, he said.
For the next fiscal year’s development budget, the minister bemoaned that Rs2.9tr was requested from the Ministry of Finance, which provided an IBC of only Rs 921bn, about Rs178bn lower than the current year.
“This is a cause of concern for us,” he said. “This will affect even the inflow of foreign exchange. We will need Rs700bn to provide rupee cover to foreign-funded projects during the next development budget. If we do not have enough rupee cover, we cannot utilise all the allocated foreign exchange component.”
Mr Iqbal said that with such a meagre IBC, proper allocations could not be made to the important projects, which would result in delays and cost escalations of such schemes. He said that the number of provincial projects in the PSDP would be reduced, while about 200 slow-moving projects would be closed.
Irregularities in key projects
He said the cost of Diamer-Bhasha Dam has escalated from Rs480bn to Rs1.5tr due to delays. Likewise, the cost of the Dasu Hydropower Project has increased from Rs500bn to Rs1.7tr.
The minister said there were several lapses in the implementation of the Dasu Hydropower Project. No project director or CFO was hired for such a huge project, and it was operated by Wapda’s own people.
He said that even the contracts for the construction of roads in the project area were allotted in dollars. “There are irregularities in the Dasu project and we want that responsibility to be fixed,” he emphasised, regretting that the financial viability of these projects had diminished due to rising costs.
Similarly, the minister said that there were shocking irregularities in the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project. The plan was started in such a hurry that the contractor was mobilised prior to the consultant, which the minister said was a serious irregularity.
“Interestingly, once in a meeting I asked the CFO of Neelum-Jhelum regarding his qualification, and I was stunned to know that he had a Master’s in Geography,” he said.
Mr Iqbal said the report of the International Marine Corps regarding the failure in the Ne­­e­lum-Jhelum Hydropower Project was awaited.
In reply to a question as to why a civilian could not be appointed as Wapda chairman, the minister said: “In my opinion, a civilian should be appointed as Wapda chairman and he should be a hydrology expert of international repute. I will recommend this to the prime minister.”
He reiterated that funding priorities under the next PSDP would align with the government’s Uraan Pakistan programme, aimed at job creation and economic uplift. “Projects approved under Uraan are expected to generate 120,000 direct and indirect jobs,” he said.

In a press conference, Ishaq Dar said India “deliberately fired” projectiles, three of which were dropped in Amritsar, the capital of Indian Punjab, located around 54km from Lahore.
He added that a fourth projectile entered Pakistani airspace, which was shot down by the air defense system in Dinga, Gujrat, around 87km from the nearest point on the India-Pakistan border.
Mr Dar’s remarks were in response to claims by New Delhi that it neutralised attempts by Pakistan to hit multiple “military targets” using “drones and missiles” on the night of Wednesday and Thursday.
Mr Dar added that India’s “deliberate” attack was a “malicious strategy” to “falsely implicate Pakistan” for targeting civilians and incite Indian Sikhs.
Sitting beside Mr Dar, the armed forces spokesperson also accused India of launching a false flag operation. 
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the projectiles, which he claimed were launched by India the previous night. 
He claimed India fired four projectiles from Adampur, a town in Jalan­dhar district of Indian Punjab. Three projectiles were “intently targeted” at Amritsar while one was taken down over Dinga, Lt-Gen Chaudhry added.
He said India’s claim that Pakistan attacked 15 locations was a “fantastic and cooked-up story”.
Every projectile leaves a digital signature, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said, asking India to share details about the origin of the projectiles it claimed were launched by Pakistan. 
The military spokesperson also lambasted the Indian media for falsely accusing Pakistan of launching attacks.
“When Pakistan strikes, we won’t need the Indian media to report it. The whole world will come to know. Its reverberations will be felt everywhere.”

Moratinos will continue in his current role as High Representative for the United Nations Alliance of Civilisations (UNAOC), which he has held since 2019, according to a statement by the UN spokesperson’s office.
“Moratinos brings decades of diplomatic experience and leadership on multilateral issues, including dialogue among civilisations and combating discrimination,” it said. “Moratinos has reinforced UNAOC’s role as a global platform for dialogue and bridge-building.”
A seasoned diplomat, Moratinos served as Spain’s foreign minister from 2004 to 2010, during which his country held the presidency of the Security Council and led several international organisations, including the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and the Council of Europe.
On X, Moratinos uploaded a statement expressing his gratitude and stating he was truly honoured for the appointment.
“I thank the secretary general for the new responsibility that I have been entrusted with. I am also grateful for the support of member states and especially the OIC Core Group,” he wrote.
“The appointment of a UN special envoy to combat Islamophobia will contribute to strengthening our response to Islamophobia,” he added. “I wish to reaffirm my commitment to stand in solidarity with Muslim communities and to stand up against all forms of discrimination and bigotry.”

However, the footage dates back to October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.
On Wednesday, Pakistan mourned the loss of 31 lives in overnight attacks by Indian forces on civilians, describing New Delhi’s actions as “terrorism” and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC).
The Pakistan military termed the downing of five Indian fighter jets as a major victory — and it was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials admitted that at least three of their aircraft had “crashed” within their territory.
As both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the damage caused by Indian strikes at six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.
Since the breakdown in ties after the Pahalgam incident, the Indian mainstream and social media outlets have been spreading propaganda against Pakistan.
On Wednesday, an Indian user posted a video on X showing a missile strike on a residential area, claiming it depicted India attacking Pakistan. The post did not provide any other details about the alleged attack, such as the date, context or location.
The caption of the post said, “Happy Diwali, Pakistan. Indian Army – Jai Hind,” and included a hashtag of “Operation Sindoor”, the Indian military’s name for its aerial incursion.
The post quickly gained traction, amassing over 5.1 million views.
Other Indian users shared the same claim here and here, garnering over 406,000 views and 540,000 views, respectively.
The video was also circulated on Facebook here and on Instagram here and here.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its high virality and intense public interest in the ongoing Pakistan-India military escalation.
A reverse image search conducted to investigate the video yielded a post by a user on X dated October 2, 2024, with the caption, “Iran officially declares state of war against Israel.” The post featured the same viral video.
 






Refining the search for that date yielded an October 1, 2024, YouTube video by Indian state broadcaster Doordarshan titled: “Iranian missiles targeting the Nevatim airbase in the Negev Desert”.
 


A keyword search for “Iran airstrike” and “Israel” around the corresponding date yielded an October 1, 2024, news report from Al Jazeera, titled “Iran says missiles fired at Israel in response to assassinations.”
According to the report, Iran launched a missile attack on Israel on October 1, 2024, in retaliation for the killing of senior Iranian and allied leaders, including top commanders from Hezbollah and Hamas. Israeli authorities reported that around 200 ballistic missiles were fired, triggering air raid sirens and shelter warnings across several regions. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps had claimed responsibility, labelling the attack a response to Israeli “crimes”. While many of the missiles were intercepted, some caused significant damage and casualties, escalating fears of further regional conflict.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows an Indian attack at an unnamed location in Pakistan amid their recent escalation is false.
The video is old from October 2024 and shows Iranian airstrikes on Israel’s Nevatim airbase.
Multiple claims
At the same time, iVerify Pakistan observed multiple other claims regarding the Pakistan-India escalation. Here are more claims that were debunked by the platform.


Video of Baloch people celebrating India’s strike - MISLEADING


On Wednesday, an X user, who is an Indian supporter based on their past posts, shared a video of a group of men dancing to a song, with some children joining in as well.
The caption of the post said, “Live visuals. Celebrations have started in Balochistan after India’s Operation Sindoor against Pakistan.”
The video received 2.2m views and was shared 7,400 times. The footage was shared with the same caption here, here and here.
A reverse image search of the video yielded a link to a YouTube video, dated August 15, 2023. The video has since been made private. However, the video was also shared on the uploader’s TikTok account on Aug 16, 2023.
 


The YouTuber named Azmat Baloch, with a following of 10.5K subscribers who posts videos of cultural Balochi dances on his channel, titled the clip, “Balochi lewa balochi dance.” Thus, the clip is not related to the current Pak-India escalation and does not show Baloch people celebrating Indian attacks.


Video of Pakistani anchor crying on broadcast following Indian airstrikes – FALSE


On Wednesday, a known Indian propaganda account shared a video claiming to show a Pakistani anchor breaking down in tears during a broadcast following the Indian airstrikes.
The caption of the post said: “The Pakistani anchor on Indian strike.”
The post gained 1.8m views.
The same video with the same claim was extensively shared by other users as can be seen here, here, and here.
However, a reverse image search yielded a YouTube video uploaded on April 14, 2025, by Express News titled: “Palestine Kay Masoom Logo Mujhe Muaf Krna | Anchor Farwa Waheed Bursts into Tears During Live Show”.
 


The nearly 13-minute-long clip featured the anchor bursting into tears while expressing solidarity with the people of Gaza in the wake of atrocities perpetrated by Israel in its military campaign in the territory.


Video of Indian airstrikes on Pakistan - FALSE


On Wednesday, Indian journalist Aditya Raj Kaul posted a 32-second clip showing what looked to be explosions and airstrikes.
The caption of the post said, “Breaking: Pakistan Army confirms attack by India. India has launched an attack on Pakistan. Missiles fired at Kotli, Muzaffarabad, and Bahawalpur — confirmed by DG ISPR to Pakistani journalists. India goes after the terror state Pakistan.”
The post gained 1.5m views.
The same video was shared by several Pakistani accounts as can be seen here, here and here, as well as by Indian accounts as can be seen here, here, here, here, here and here with a total of 480,500 views.
A reverse image search yielded an X post of Afghan media outlet Kabul News on October 23, 2023, showing Israel’s bombing in Gaza.
 






The video showed the same footage with the caption that said, “Israel intensified its bombing of Gaza last night. According to Palestinian media reports, 400 people, including women and children, lost their lives in last night’s bombings, and hundreds more are still trapped under collapsed buildings.”


Video showing aftermath of Indian attack on Lahore - FALSE


On Thursday, a video showing fire and thick smoke in the sky was shared on X by a user who, based on his previous posts, appeared to be a PTI supporter.
The caption of the post said: “They have reached Lahore, may God protect. The enemy is very cowardly. Attack him quickly before he tries to go to Jati Umra with evil ambition.”
The post garnered over 535,000 views.
The same video was shared by an Indian account. The post garnered over 10,000 views.
The same video also circulated on YouTube as can be seen here, here and here.
A reverse image search yielded a YouTube video uploaded on August 7, 2024, titled “LPG gas tanker blast in Pakistan”.
 


A side-by-side comparison revealed identical visual elements in both videos, including the fire, thick smoke, the highway location marker and the minaret. These consistent features confirmed that the viral footage was not recent and was falsely linked to current events involving India and Pakistan.
 




Viral video of Indian jet shot down by Pakistan Air Force – FALSE


On May 7, a Pakistani user shared a video on X showing a jet being shot down by an air defence system, claiming it depicted an Indian aircraft. The post garnered over 400,000 views.
The same claim was shared by other Pakistani users as can be seen here and here.
However, a keyword search showed that neither Pakistani defence officials nor Indian authorities have released any such footage of aerial dogfights as of now.
A reverse image search yielded a YouTube channel that featured videos similar to the viral clip.
The description of the channel, translated from Japanese, reads: “I enjoy casual military simulations. I sincerely thank everyone who always supports me.”
Videos similar to the viral clip can be found here, here and here.
Users in the comments of the viral videos similarly pointed out that they were fake and from a video game.

Pope Leo appeared on the central balcony of St Peter’s Basilica around 70 minutes after white smoke billowed from a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel, signifying that the 133 cardinal electors had chosen a new leader for the 1.4 billion-member Catholic Church.
“Peace be with you all,” the new pope told the cheering crowd.
The choice of Prevost was announced by French Cardinal Dominique Mamberti with the Latin words ‘Habemus Papam’ (We have a pope) to tens of thousands of people gathered in St Peter’s Square to hear the news.
Aged 69 and originally from Chicago, Prevost spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru and became a cardinal only in 2023. He has given few media interviews and rarely speaks in public.
 
 

Leo becomes the 267th Catholic pope after the death last month of Pope Francis, who was the first Latin American pope and had led the Church for 12 years and widely sought to open the staid institution up to the modern world.
Francis enacted a range of reforms and allowed debate on divisive issues such as women’s ordination and better inclusion of LGBT Catholics.
Ahead of the conclave, some cardinals called for continuity with Francis’ vision of greater openness and reform, while others said they wanted to turn back the clock and embrace old traditions.
Prevost has attracted interest from his peers because of his quiet style and support for Francis, especially his commitment to social justice issues.
Prevost served as a bishop in Chiclayo, in northwestern Peru, from 2015 to 2023.
Francis brought him to Rome that year to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops across the globe, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world’s bishops.
Prevost said during a 2023 Vatican press conference: “Our work is to enlarge the tent and to let everyone know they are welcome inside the Church.”</p><small>2025-05-08 17:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/082228385ac08de.jpg?r=011122' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1909458/trump-heralds-breakthrough-tariff-deal-with-uk' target='_blank'><strong>Trump heralds ‘breakthrough’ tariff deal with UK</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday announced a “breakthrough deal” on trade that leaves in place a 10 per cent tariff on goods imported from the UK, while Britain agreed to lower its tariffs to 1.8pc from 5.1pc and provide greater access to US goods.
The agreement announced by Trump from the Oval Office marked the first since Trump triggered a global trade war with a barrage of levies on trading partners following his return to the White House in January.
“It opens up a tremendous market for us,” Trump said.
“This is a really fantastic, historic day,” Starmer said by teleconference.
The United States has been under pressure from investors to strike deals to de-escalate its tariff war after Trump’s often chaotic policymaking upended global trade with friend and foe alike, threatening to stoke inflation and start a recession.
 






Top US officials have engaged in a flurry of meetings with trading partners since the president on April 2 imposed a 10pc tariff on most countries, along with higher rates for many trading partners that were then suspended for 90 days.
The US has also imposed 25pc tariffs on autos, steel and aluminium, 25pc tariffs on Canada and Mexico, and 145pc tariffs on China. US and Chinese officials are due to hold talks in Switzerland on Saturday.
Warm relationship
With the British economy struggling to grow, the tariffs had added to the pressure on his government. Jaguar Land Rover paused its shipments to the US for a month and the government was forced to seize control of British Steel to keep it operating.
The deal will reduce US tariffs on British auto imports to 10pc from the current 27.5pc, according to a UK statement. The lower rate will apply to a quota of 100,000 British vehicles, almost the total exported to the US last year.
US tariffs on imports from the struggling UK steel industry will fall to zero from 25pc, while British tariffs on US ethanol will fall to zero from 19pc.
Both sides have agreed on new reciprocal market access on beef, with UK farmers given a tariff-free quota for 13,000 metric tonnes. There will be no weakening of UK food standards on imports.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that Britain is expected to announce a purchase of $10 billion worth of US-assembled Boeing aircraft, although a White House graphic referred to “aircraft parts”. In turn, Lutnick said that the US will allow duty-free imports for Rolls-Royce jet engines.
Lutnick said that the deal would create $5bn in new annual export opportunities for American producers, while the new tariffs that stay in place would produce $6bn in annual new US revenue.
 






While seeking a deal with the US, Britain had refused to lower its food standards, which are closely aligned with the European Union. However, Britain’s farming trade union has said that some US producers who do not use growth hormones or antimicrobial washes could be given greater market access.
Trump said the 10pc “baseline” tariff would stay in place and that other countries may face higher reciprocal tariffs even as they negotiate similar trade deals with the US.
Details were scant on tariffs on UK pharmaceuticals imports, which could damage AstraZeneca and GSK, although a White House fact sheet said the deal would create a secure pharma supply chain.
Initial news of an announcement sent shares in luxury carmaker Aston Martin up 10pc, while British retailers with operations in the US, including JD Sports and Primark owner AB Foods, also rose.
Trade tightrope
Starmer’s government has been seeking to build new trading relationships post-Brexit with the US, China and the EU without moving so far towards one bloc that it angers the others.
Economists and one FTSE 100 chief executive said the immediate economic impact of a tariff deal was likely to be limited but that trade agreements in general would help long-term growth. Britain struck a free trade agreement with India this week.
There are also domestic political risks. Polling shows the government remains deeply unpopular, making any move to cut taxes on multi-national tech companies a big risk.
Britain’s digital service tax, levied at 2pc of UK revenue for online marketplaces, would continue unchanged.
It was expected to raise about £800 million ($1.1bn) this year, but companies such as Google and Amazon have passed the cost on to customers through ad surcharges and higher selling fees, respectively.
“The American, Indian and other deals we can do will be really important to the long-term economic health of the UK, but don’t expect them to result in overnight euphoria,” the CEO said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p><small>2025-05-08 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603675-pakistans-chinese-made-jet-brought-down-two-indian-fighter-aircraft-us-officials-say' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's J-10s brought down two Indian fighter aircraft, US officials say</strong></a><br><p>

A day earlier, Pakistan mourned the loss of 31 lives in overnight attacks by Indian forces on civilians, describing New Delhi’s actions as “terrorism” and accusing it of continuous ceasefire violations on the Line of Control (LoC).
The Pakistan military termed the downing of five Indian fighter jets as a major victory —  and it was seemingly acknowledged when Indian officials admitted that at least three of their aircraft had “crashed” within their territory.
On Wednesday, as both countries continued to trade heavy artillery fire, authorities revealed the extent of the damage caused by Indian strikes at six locations — Ahmedpur East, Muridke, Sialkot and Shakkargarh in Punjab and Muzaffarabad and Kotli in Azad Kashmir.
“The Pakistan Army, using their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully, have shot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones,” the ISPR said in a press release today.
Referring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said: “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”
“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” the statement added.
“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.
Meanwhile, the Indian defence ministry admitted that its armed forces targeted a number of locations in Pakistan in the morning today. Indian outlet ANI News reported that Harpy drones were used by the Indian military to target Pakistan’s “air defence system”. According to the Database of Israeli Military and Security Export, the Harop is a “later development of the Harpy”.
The ministry’s statement also alleged that Pakistan had “increased the intensity” of firing at the LoC, where the two countries’ troops have been exchanging fire for the past several days.
 
 

“The Harpy is designed to attack radar systems and is optimised for the suppression of enemy air defences (Sead) role. It carries a high explosive warhead,” the ANI report read.
In a press briefing early today, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said Pakistan’s forces had neutralised 12 drones sent by India since last night. He also stated that four army personnel were injured as one drone, besides those downed, managed to engage a military target partially.
The ISPR DG detailed the locations where 12 of those drones sent by India were neutralised — Lahore, Attock, Gujranwala, Chakwal, Rawalpindi and Bahawalpur in Punjab, as well as Sukkur’s Miano, Umerkot’s Chhor and near Karachi in Sindh.
“Other than these 12, one drone, however, managed to engage a military target near Lahore partially,” Lt Gen Chaudhry said.
“Four men of the Pakistan Army have been injured in this attack near Lahore and partial damage to an equipment has occurred,” he said.
The DG ISPR further said that as a result of India’s drone activity, one civilian embraced martyrdom and another was injured in Miano.

During the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.
“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” he continued.
“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the DG ISPR said.
“The Indians have resorted to these measures after] having miserably failed on the night of May 6 and 7, when they attacked places of worship and civilian infrastructure and killed innocent civilians, including children, women and [the] elderly,” he continued.
 


He further said: “Not only that, having faced the destruction of five of their aircraft, multiple drones, and suffering heavy casualties along LoC and damage, it appears that India has apparently lost the plot.
“And rather than going on a path of rationality, it is further escalating in a highly charged environment to satisfy the hubristic mindset of the Indian government,” Lt Gen Chaudhry asserted.
“The international community can visibly see the path that India is treading through this extremely provocative military aggression in a region, which is highly fragile and putting the security of the region and beyond at risk,” he said.
The DG ISPR added that the Pakistan armed forces remain “fully vigilant to any type of threat”. He then repeated the details of the Indian drones downed in Urdu.</p><small>2025-05-08 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/603636-at-least-40-50-indian-soldiers-killed-in-retaliation-along-loc-following-missile-attack' target='_blank'><strong>At least 40-50 Indian soldiers killed in retaliation along LoC following missile attack</strong></a><br><p>

• 13 people, including two girls, martyred in Subhan mosque strike
• Funeral of Bahawalpur victims held at Dring Stadium
LAHORE: Tensions between India and Pakistan have intensified after a series of Indian air and drone strikes resulted in the deaths of at least 31 Pakistani civilians, with many others injured, including 16 martyred only in Muridke and Bahawalpur.
As many as three civilians were kil­led when four Indian missiles struck Jamia Masjid Ummul Qura and an ad­­joining house in Muridke, some 40 kilometres from Lahore. The decea­sed were identified as Abdul Malik (from Jhang), Mohammad Alam (Samundri), and Midasar (Chunian).
Two others were injured and shif­ted to local hospitals. Sources said that the area had reportedly been evacuated earlier due to warnings of a possible strike, which helped reduce further casualties. The mosque was des­troyed and local authorities later arr­a­­­nged visits for both international and domestic media to inspect the site.
Bahawalpur
In Bahawalpur, officials confirmed that 13 civilians, including four men, seven women and two three-year-old girls, were killed in the missile strike on Subhan Mosque, located in the Chowk Azam area on the outskirts of Bahawalpur between the night of May 6 and 7.
The military’s media wing ISPR has yet to release an official list of the deceased. Most of the victims belonged to the same family, but they have yet to be officially identified.
When Dawn contacted the related government officials for the lists of the martyrs and injured, it was informed that the ISPR was finalising it before releasing it to the media.
 
 

High-level visits were conducted by Corps Commander Bahawalpur Lt Gen Aqeel, Divisional Commissioner Musarrat Jabeen and Punjab Health Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique, who met with the injured at Bahawal Victoria Hospital on directives from the Punjab chief minister.
The targeted mosque and madressah complex are located in Azam Chowk, not in Ahmedpur East as previously speculated.
The madressah premises also include residences, where most of the deceased lived and were targeted by the Indian missiles.
Dawn learnt that the private seminary during the last week had been evacuated by the local administration, apprehending any Indian assault on it. However, the residents of the seminary’s residential quarters and students were allowed to return just a day before the attack.
Witnesses reported hearing four po­­werful explosions that shook windows as far as Satellite Town and Ba­­ghdadul Jadeed Railway Station. Des­pite the panic, many residents rushed towards the blast site, chanting slogans in support of the armed forces.
 
 

Meanwhile, life went on as usual in Bahawalpur, with commercial activities in the grain, vegetable markets and local bazaars continuing on Wednesday along with the normal flow of traffic on roads.
However, public and private schools, colleges, and universities remained closed under the government’s orders.
The funeral prayers for victims were offered at Bahawalpur’s Dring Sta-dium under tight security measures.
Narowal
In Narowal’s Shakargarh sector, Indian forces launched drone and mortar shell attacks on civilian areas late Tuesday night. A government dispensary sustained partial damage, while mortar shells and drone munitions fell in surrounding fields but failed to detonate. The Pakistan Army also launched a counterattack on Indian forces. The Indian army also fired ammunition in the Harra and Sial villages.
A drone was later recovered from a tree and defused by the bomb disposal squad after being alerted by citi­­zens. Narowal Deputy Com­mis­sioner Syed Hassan Raza declared an emergency at all hospitals across the district, including BHUs, RHCs and DHQ Hospital. Doctors and paramedical staff were placed on 24-hour alert and full stocks of medicines and medical supplies were ensured.

Only in one unlikely case of normal circumstances and stable exchange rate at Rs280, the average base tariff would reduce by Rs2.25 per unit in fiscal year 2025-26 to Rs24.75 from prevailing rate of about Rs27 per unit.
In case of local currency depreciation to Rs300, the base tariff reduction would be around 30 paise per unit. The reduction mainly stems from lower capacity payments.
The average Power Purchase Price (PPP) would be on top of about Rs8.16 to Rs9.52 per unit fuel cost, taking the total electricity price to range between Rs34 and Rs35 per unit excluding taxes, fees, duties and surcharges.

30 paise to Rs2.25 reduction depends on rupee-dollar parity

The Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) of the Power Division has formally submitted a request for projected PPP for the next fiscal year from July 1 to determine the consumer-end tariff.
 
 

The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has arranged a public hearing on May 15 to review the request in consultation with all stakeholders and give its determination for implementation by the government.
The CPPA request outlined seven scenarios developed through sensitivity analysis of key assumption parameters, specifically demand, hydrology, fuel prices, and exchange rates. Across the analysed scenarios, indigenous fuels constitute 55pc to 58pc of the overall energy mix, while clean fuels contribute between 52pc and 56pc.
The worst-case scenario — marked by a high exchange rate of Rs300, low hydrology, standard fuel prices, and normal demand — yields the highest projected PPP at Rs26.70/kWh against Rs27.
In contrast, the best-case scenario assumes normal demand and an exchange rate of Rs280, resulting in the lowest PPP at Rs24.75/kWh, primarily due to reduced capacity charges.
Electricity demand is projected to grow between 3 and 5pc in all cases, but only if the exchange rate remains stable at Rs280. The exchange rate has been assumed to be Rs300 in all six other cases. In addition, US inflation has been taken at 2pc, Pakistan inflation at 8.65pc besides 11.9pc Karachi Interbank Offe­red Rate, 4.07pc international interest rate, and transmission losses at 2.80pc.
The Nepra determination would be taken to the federal cabinet for approval and subsidy allocation, and the power division would file a follow-up tariff table to Nepra for subsidy punching for various consumer categories and slabs be­­fore formal notification with effect from July 1 as already committed to the International Monetary Fund.

India launched a devious attack on Pakistan late on Tuesday night before the latter’s retaliation escalated the situation. But while things got serious along the border, the foreign players had a meeting with the PSL leadership.
“The foreign players met PSL chief Salman Naseer at a dinner last night and they had a ‘gup shup’ [informal chat],” Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) spokesperson Amir Mir told Dawn on Wednesday. “Naturally the current scenario may have come under discussion.
“There is no chance of the foreign players leaving the country anyway with airspace issues, but  they are living under a heavy security blanket of Pakistan Army.
“There have been surgical strikes on both sides of the border but we don’t expect that affecting the PSL. But if, God forbid, things do escalate, we will sit together to decide our next step.”
The PCB, meanwhile, did not expect the tensions to affect the ongoing PSL season, which is nearing its knockout stages.
The tournament returned to Rawalpindi with the match between Islamabad United and Quetta Gladiators, with three more games to be played at the venue in the next three days while the final first-stage match of the PSL is scheduled for May 11 in Multan.
According to the PCB, the Qualifier is set to take place in Rawalpindi on May 13, while both the Eliminators and the final of the event are to be held on May 14, 16 and 18, respectively at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium.
Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Cricket Board said on Wednesday that it was in touch with its players participating in the PSL.
“The BCB is in active coordination with the PCB and the Bangladesh High Commission in Islamabad to ensure that all necessary measures are in place to guarantee the security of our players,” the board said in a statement.
Speaking to a Bangladesh sports outlet, BCB president Faruque Ahmed revealed that the board is taking a wait-and-see approach and will assess the ongoing situation over the next few days before making a final call.
“We are really working on the current situation [as far as going to Pakistan for the T20I series] and it can wait for another three to four days,” said Faruque. “Let’s see how it progresses but at the moment our main concern is regarding the two players [Nahid Rana and Rishad Hossain] who are currently in Pakistan competing in the PSL.”
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) also announced that it would follow guidance from the UK Foreign Office and consult with its own security teams to assess the situation on the ground.
The board said it was in direct contact with players and will provide them with the latest security advice as the situation develops.
However, the ECB made it clear that the final decision on whether to remain in Pakistan for the tournament will rest with the individual players themselves.
“The board’s approach is to support its players with up-to-date information and expert guidance, while respecting their personal choices in light of the current regional tensions,” said the ECB.
New Zealand Cricket also released an official statement addressing the matter.
“We are aware of the relevant reports,” said NZC. “We continue to assess the security environment for our players and coaching staff in all overseas environments to ensure they’re in receipt of the most updated advice.”

Rescue services have been put on high alert and a central control room established to ensure seamless monitoring and coordination.
While the armed forces ferociously responded to the attack, the Punjab government swiftly took measures to ensure public safety, announcing the immediate closure of public and private sector universities, colleges, and schools, as well as the suspension of ongoing examinations at various academic levels.
As 26 civilians have been martyred and 46 sustained injuries in Indian missile attacks, the Punjab government cancelled staff holidays and called all law-enforcement agencies officials to handle any eventuality.

Despite high alert, educational institutes  allowed to function normally; social media flooded with memes after damages to India

In line with the `War Book’ protocols, the Punjab government activated the siren and warning system and instructed the security forces to immediately secure the vital and sensitive areas across the province. It also called for identification of shelters and making them functional for civil defence. Keeping all and sundry on high alert, the Punjab government instructed the civil administration in respective districts to ensure foolproof security measures as “further hostile attacks in near future particularly targeting vital and sensitive areas cannot be ruled out.”
Meanwhile, people kept their morale high and came out on roads and intersections in several cities as well as the points of attacks in five cities and chanted slogans in support of the armed forces.
Weighing the situation after India accepted its defeat while hoisting a white flag, the Punjab government did not extend holidays in public and private educational institutions and allowed them to resume their academic and examination activities as per their notified schedules.
The examinations postponed on Wednesday will be rescheduled after completing the notified date-sheets by respective education boards and universities. Though institutions were closed, the bazaars opened and the public did shopping unhindered.
The Punjab government is, however, still on high alert. Punjab Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman on Wednesday morning held a high-level video-conference meeting with administrative secretaries from all provincial departments, including the chairman of Planning and Development Board.
The chief secretary directed all provincial departments, divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners and police formations to maintain full readiness in accordance with the protocols outlined in the ‘War Book’.
The chief secretary was briefed about the `War Book’ protocols by the home department as he along with the IG Police and additional chief secretary visited the central control room linked with control rooms at each deputy commissioner office in respective districts in the province.
The chief secretary stressed the need to formally document all [preparedness] measures for the development of comprehensive guidelines. He instructed that control rooms in the departments of Home and the Implementation and Coordination would remain operational round-the-clock. The departments were advised to coordinate closely with the home department for any necessary support.Home Department Special Secretary Fazalur Rehman briefed the provincial top brass on the implementation of `War Book’ protocols. He stated that robust security arrangements had been put in place to safeguard critical infrastructure and ensure public safety across the province.
Briefing the meeting on ongoing security measures, IG Dr Usman Anwar asserted that the Punjab Police were on high alert and personnel had been deployed at all key locations, including border outposts to maintain heightened vigilance.
As the war had apparently subsided in a matter of hours, the public continued chanting slogans in streets and took to X handles and other social media platforms to express their humour and ran trends like ‘Sindoor bun gaya Tandoor’ and created scores of memes to enjoy the victory.
