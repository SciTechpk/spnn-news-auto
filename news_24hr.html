The Hindustan Aeronautics Limited-built Tejas jet crashed at about 2:10pm local time.

Videos circulating on social media showed the aircraft failing to recover from an aerial maneuver and bursting into a ball of flames after impacting the ground as onlookers watched in shock. A plume of smoke billowed from the crash site as emergency vehicles sped towards it.
The incident happened on the last day of the Middle East’s biggest airshow, which features a flying display each afternoon. Hundreds of people were watching from a grandstand, while the apron was packed with planes, helicopters and other hardware on static display.
In September, India signed a $7 billion order for 97 upgraded Tejas Mk1A fighter jets to replace its Russian MiG-21 fleet after decades of use.
In a post on X, the Indian Air Force (IAF) confirmed the death of the pilot in the incident.
 






“An IAF Tejas aircraft met with an accident during an aerial display at Dubai Air Show, today. The pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident,” said the post.
“IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief. A court of inquiry is being constituted to ascertain the cause of the accident,” it added.
Footage of the crash showed the fighter executing a low roll before crashing in flames about a mile (1.6 kilometres) from the show site.
The UAE aviation authority was not immediately available to comment on whether it would lead a local investigation. The Indian embassy said it was in touch with UAE authorities. Experts stressed it was too early to say what caused the crash.
GE, the engine manufacturer, said in a statement that it was ready to support the investigation.
‘Oil leak’ controversy
Earlier this week, social media was abuzz with posts claiming that the Indian fighter jet was ‘leaking oil’ while parked on the tarmac. Pictures showed shopping bags placed beneath the Tejas to collect the leaking liquid.
Some posts claimed the leak continued on the second day of the international air show. However, there was no official comment on the topic by the Indian government or the armed forces.
The Press Information Bureau (PIB) of India, in a post, claimed that it was a “routine draining process, not a technical malfunction”.
The bureau added that it was part of the “standard pre-flight procedure to remove condensation, which naturally forms as part of the aircraft’s cooling system”.
 






The Tejas, meaning “brilliance” in Hindi, is a domestically designed and built fighter jet that was commissioned into the Indian Air Force in 2016. The aircraft has been beset by design and other challenges and was once rejected by the Indian Navy as too heavy.
 






The biennial airshow is being held at Dubai’s Al Maktoum International Airport from November 17-21.
The show, according to its website, brought together over 1,500 exhibitors, 200 aircraft across flying and static displays, 12 conference tracks, and 450 global visionaries.
India had been gauging interest from potential foreign buyers at the week-long airshow, a major arena for global arms and airliner markets and well-known for bold displays making use of wide vistas of airspace.
Friday’s accident was the first on record for the world’s third-largest airshow, after Paris and Britain’s Farnborough. Airshow accidents were common in the 1970s, but have become rare at the top aerospace events as safety restrictions were tightened in recent decades.
This is the second known crash of the fighter jet, which is powered by General Electric (GE) engines. The first crash was during an exercise in India in 2024.
The Tejas Mk-1A fighters are crucial for India’s efforts to bolster its air force’s depleting fighter squadrons and replace ageing jets in the face of China’s growing military strength and support for arch-rival Pakistan.
The IAF expects to operate a fleet of almost 220 Tejas fighters and its advanced Mk-1A variants over the next decade after HAL completes the pending orders.
The rollout of the fighter has been delayed due to slow deliveries from GE of 99 engines ordered in 2021, of which only four have arrived so far. GE has blamed supply chain issues following Covid-19.

Washington has presented Kyiv with a 28-point plan that would require Kyiv to give up additional territory, scale back the size of its military and forever abandon hope of joining the Nato alliance.
Ukraine’s European allies said they had not been consulted over the plan and scheduled an urgent phone call to discuss the situation. Britain and Germany said their leaders would take part.
Zelensky’s office did not say whether he would join in.
US officials said the plan was drafted after consultations with Rustem Umerov, secretary of Ukraine’s National Security and Defence Council, a close Zelensky ally who served as defence minister until July.
“This plan was drawn up immediately following discussions with one of the most senior members of President Zelensky’s administration, Rustem Umerov, who agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and presented it to President Zelensky,” a senior US official said on Thursday.
But Umerov said on Friday he had not discussed the plan’s terms, much less approved them.
“During my visit to the United States, my role was technical organising meetings and preparing the dialogue. I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure,” he wrote on Telegram.
After meeting a visiting US delegation on Friday, Umerov said Kyiv would not accept a plan that violates its sovereignty.
‘We are ready for constructive, hard work’: Zelensky
Zelensky, who met a US Army delegation on Thursday, has acknowledged receiving the plan but has not commented directly on its contents.
“Our teams — Ukraine and the USA — will work on the points of the plan to end the war,” the president wrote overnight on Telegram. “We are ready for constructive, honest and prompt work.”
The Kremlin, which has so far been cautious in public, said Russia had not received anything official from the United States about a 28-point peace plan for Ukraine.
Kyiv should make a “responsible decision” and do it now, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.
Russia’s demands spelt out, Kyiv’s left vague
The plan, a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters, includes terms that Ukrainian officials have previously dismissed as tantamount to surrender after their soldiers fended off a full-scale Russian invasion for nearly four years at huge cost.
It would require Ukraine to withdraw from territory it still controls in eastern provinces that Russia claims to have annexed, while Russia would give up smaller amounts of land it has captured in other regions.
Ukraine would be permanently barred from joining the Nato military alliance, and its armed forces would be capped at 600,000 troops. Nato would agree never to station troops there.
Sanctions against Russia would be gradually lifted, Moscow would be invited back into the G8 group of industrialised countries, and frozen Russian assets would be pooled in an investment fund, with Washington given some of the profits.
One of Ukraine’s main demands, for enforceable guarantees equivalent to the Nato alliance’s mutual defence clause to deter Russia from attacking again, is dealt with in a single line with no details: “Ukraine will receive robust security guarantees”.

A US delegation in Kyiv was expected to brief European embassies there on its contents later on Friday. European countries are now funding Ukraine’s defence alone after US President Donald Trump cancelled financial support.
“We have always said [the] for any plan to work, it needs to be with Ukraine and the Europeans on board,” the EU foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, said in Brussels.
Trump, who returned to office this year vowing to quickly end the war, has accepted some of Russia’s justifications for its 2022 invasion of its neighbour while also expressing some impatience with Moscow.
Last month, he cancelled a proposed summit with Russia’s Vladimir Putin and imposed sanctions on Russia’s two main oil companies, a step not taken by his pro-Ukrainian predecessor Joe Biden.
The full force of those sanctions was due to come into effect on Friday, Washington’s deadline for foreign buyers of Russian oil to wind down purchases.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing that Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff had quietly worked on the plan for about a month and that Trump supports it.
“This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after five years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,” she said.
The acceleration in US diplomacy comes at a time when Ukrainian troops are on the back foot on the battlefield and Zelensky’s government has been undermined by a corruption scandal. Parliament fired two cabinet ministers on Wednesday.
Ukrainian forces repelled Russia’s initial assault on Kyiv in 2022, but their attempted counteroffensive failed in 2023.
With the war’s fourth winter approaching, Russian troops occupy almost one-fifth of Ukraine and have been grinding slowly forward along a 1,200-kilometre front line while bombarding Ukrainian energy supplies.
Russia says it has taken control of the city of Kupiansk in northeastern Ukraine and most of Pokrovsk in the east, its first big prizes in nearly two years. Kyiv denies losing control of those cities but has acknowledged that Russia is advancing.</p><small>2025-11-21 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/212240154994c49.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956525/ttap-pti-stage-demonstrations-against-27th-amendment-across-kp-and-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>TTAP, PTI stage demonstrations against 27th Amendment across KP and Punjab</strong></a><br><p>The PTI and the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday staged demonstrations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab in protest of the 27th Constitutional Amendment and the mistreatment of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters outside Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail.
Concurrently, the PTI and TTAP staged a protest in Karachi, where police detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the demonstration’s scheduled venue.
In KP, the demonstrations were staged on the directives of the PTI’s KP President Junaid Akbar, after the TTAP made the decision to march. They were held at the district level, where charged PTI workers chanted slogans against institutions while holding portraits of the party founder.
In Peshawar, dozens of PTI workers held a protest outside the Peshawar Press Club, which was addressed by Provincial Minister for Local Government Meena Khan Afridi, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Sher Ali Arbab and the PTI’s Peshawar district president Irfan Saleem.
 






In his speech, Afridi said that Imran has presented two options to the leadership of TTAP.
“The first option is to hold negotiations with the powers that be to sort out all outstanding issues,” he said, adding that if the negotiations failed, the second option would be peaceful protest across the country.
 
 

He assailed the powers of immunity granted through the 27th Constitutional Amendment, which defines that the president and military leadership cannot be prosecuted.
“Immunity is un-Islamic, unethical and in violation of traditions,” he said.
“The 1973 Constitution was a social contract between the masses, the state, government and institutions, which ended with the 27th Constitutional Amendment.”
He urged the Insaf Lawyers Forum to challenge the 27th Amendment and stage a protest against it with the support of the public.
Saleem added that the party’s struggle for the supremacy of the constitution, the rule of law and human rights would not stop till achieving their goals.
He slammed security agencies for allegedly detaining Pashtoon Tahafuz Movement (PTM) workers following the conclusion of the grand jirga at the KP Assembly on November 12.
“Only the elected people have the right to rule Pakistan, while those imposed on the nation have no rights and are ruling the country illegally.”
Demonstrations in KP’s districts
In Swabi, PTI workers claimed that the incumbent federal government has been working for the establishment since coming to power through a fraudulent election.
The party staged a protest on Swabi-Jahangira road in Tordhir against the 27th Constitutional Amendment, claiming that it was passed to strengthen “powerful personalities” instead of common people.
 






Speaking on the occasion, MNA Shahram Khan Tarakai said that terrorists have never been tried in the courts of Islamabad, but PTI leaders have been tried there to stop them from serving the people.
Meanwhile, in Mohmand’s Mian Mandi Bazar, PTI workers staged a large protest against the recently-passed Amendment, calling it a “direct assault on Pakistan’s constitution, judicial subjugation and extension scheme”.
Party workers, led by district leaders including MNA Sajid Khan and MPA Muhammad Israr, waved black flags and chanted “Withdraw the 27th Amendment” and “Long Live the Constitution”.
 






“The 27th Amendment is a dangerous conspiracy against the nation’s constitution. It was passed to block the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf from the elections,” claimed MNA Khan.
MPA Israr said in his address, “The mistreatment of Imran Khan’s sisters the day before yesterday is beyond tolerance. The establishment wants to completely dismantle the PTI. “
He added that through Form 47, the rulers are stripping away judicial independence and hollowing out national institutions.
In Battagram, the PTI, led by Battagram chapter president Niaz Muhammad Khan Trand, staged a protest on the Karakoram Highway. The demonstration featured party workers holding placards with slogans against the federal government.
Trand stated that Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam, emphasising accountability for all actions. He criticised the PML-N government for “placing itself above the law through the 27th Amendment”, which he deemed unacceptable.
 






He further claimed the amendment aimed “to conceal the government’s mismanagement, corruption and administrative failures”.
Niaz accused the PML-N government of attempting to sideline PTI, its leadership, and workers, asserting that PTI remains the most popular and acceptable party in Pakistan.
Meanwhile, in Bajaur, scores of PTI workers and supporters attended the demonstration in the Sewai area of War Mamund tehsil, where they chanted slogans against the PML-N-led federal government and its allies while waving party flags.
The protesters said that the 27th Amendment was nothing but an attempt to further destroy the judiciary system in the country.
Protests staged across Punjab
In response to the protest call by the PTI and the TTAP, the PTI’s Chief Organiser in Punjab, Aliya Hamza, also instructed her party’s ticket holders to join the movement.
All party ticket holders, even at the union council level, were instructed to wear black bands, hold pro-democracy and judiciary placards and take out rallies in their areas, she said in a message posted on X.
 






By evening, aside from small protests, no big gatherings were reported.
Hamza posted on X that the protests had been peaceful, with ticket holders, lawyers and the party’s Punjab chapter protesting outside their tehsil courts against the 27th Amendment and the unethical treatment of Imran’s sisters.
“Participants held protest placards and staged a peaceful demonstration,” she wrote.

By-polls are due in NA-18 (Haripur), NA-96 (Faisalabad-II), NA-104 (Faisalabad-X), NA-143 (Sahiwal-III), NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan-II), NA-129 (Lahore-XIII), PP-73 (Sargodha-III), PP-98 (Faisalabad-I), PP-115 (Faisalabad-XVIII), PP-116 (Faisalabad-XIX), PP-203 (Sahiwal-VI), PP-269 (Muzaffargarh-II) and PP-87 (Mianwali-III) on Sunday.
The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had sent letters to the federal secretaries of defence and interior on Thursday, requesting them to deploy civil armed forces/army to allow peaceful conduct of polling and also to take other appropriate measures to protect the lives of election officials, voters and the public at large.
An order, available with Dawn, issued today from the interior ministry said the government authorised the deployment of “sufficient strength” of civil armed forces as second-tier responders on standby in quick reaction force (QRF) mode only and the Pakistan Army as third-tier responders in QRF mode under Articles 220 and 245 of the Constitution.
It added that the troops were empowered to exercise powers under Sections 4 and 5 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, from Saturday to Monday.
“The exact number of troops will be worked out by the respective home departments and Election Commission of Pakistan in consultation with concerned stakeholders on the basis of on ground requirements/assessment,” the order said.
Faisalabad DMO fines Rana Sanaullah, son-in-law
Separately, Faisalabad District Monitoring Officer Muhammad Murtaza Malik fined Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and his son-in-law, Rana Ahmad Sheheryar, candidate for PS-116, for failing to comply with the code of conduct for the by-polls.
The DMO’s order said a notice was served to Sanaullah today for violating the code of conduct, but he failed to comply and participated in Shehryar’s election campaign by addressing a public gathering at Nawaz Sharif Park, which was broadcast on electronic and social media.
The DMO imposed a Rs50,000 fine on him, saying the matter would be referred to the ECP on failure of payment.
The same fine was imposed on Shehryar for failure to provide a reply to Sanaullah’s participation in his election campaign.</p><small>2025-11-21 17:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634785-war-threat-with-india-still-persists-says-defence-minister' target='_blank'><strong>War threat with India still persists, says defence minister</strong></a><br><p>

A Bangladesh court had sentenced Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year.
The ruling came months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February.
Addressing his weekly press briefing today, Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said several queries were received regarding the development, on which he said: “This is an internal matter of Bangladesh. The people of Bangladesh are fully capable of addressing their issues in accordance with their own democratic and constitutional processes.”
 


Hasina was found guilty of ordering lethal force by a tribunal in the capital Dhaka, 15 months after resigning and fleeing to India in the face of a student-led uprising that killed hundreds or more.
 
 

The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal — a court that Hasina set up to try war crimes from Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence from Pakistan — marked a dramatic turn for a political career that began when she avoided death during the 1975 coup because she happened to be in Europe.
After the sentence was handed down, the Bangladesh government had told India that failure to return her would be a highly unfriendly gesture and an affront to justice.
“Under the existing extradition treaty between the two nations, this is a binding obligation for India,” Bangladesh’s foreign ministry had said in a statement.
But all previous efforts so far to persuade New Delhi to send her back have faltered.
New Delhi said it was committed to “the best interests of the people of Bangladesh, including in peace, democracy, inclusion and stability in that country. We will always engage constructively with all stakeholders to that end”.
The development also came amid a thaw in ties between Islamabad and Dhaka, with trade and bilateral relations seeing a marked improvement.
FO condemns targeting of Kashmiris in wake of Delhi blast
Andrabi issued a statement condemning the recent wave of arbitrary arrests and detention of people in India-occupied Kashmir after a bomb blast in New Delhi.
“Pakistan remains gravely concerned about the persistent and serious human rights situation in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.
“The prevailing policies, marked by widespread detentions, arbitrary arrests, and extensive restrictions on fundamental freedoms, continue to amount to collective punishment of the occupied Kashmiri population.”
Andrabi added that reports of Kashmiri youth being profiled based on their identity and faith “further heighten these concerns”.
“India continues its efforts to alter the demographic character of the occupied territory and to erode the religious, cultural, and social heritage of the Kashmiri people,” the statement added.
“These measures appear to form part of a deliberate strategy to suppress the legitimate aspirations of the Kashmiri population.”
Andrabi added that thousands of Kashmiri youths remain missing, while political representatives remain in custody. He said that these actions cannot undermine the Kashmiri people’s “enduring commitment to realising their internationally recognised right to self-determination”.
“Pakistan calls upon the international community, including the United Nations, the Human Rights Council and the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, to take full cognisance of the grave human rights situation in IIOJK,” the statement read.
The FO requested that international bodies urge India to take immediate remedial measures, ensure accountability for documented violations and allow international human rights organisations to conduct independent and impartial assessments.
“A just, peaceful, and lasting resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, remains essential for durable peace and stability in South Asia,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2025-11-21 17:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/212149460dc3392.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956521/13-terrorists-killed-by-security-forces-during-operations-in-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>13 terrorists killed by security forces during operations in KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces killed 13 terrorists during two separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Friday.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in the statement that a joint intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in the Pahar Khel area of Lakki Marwat district, conducted by security forces and the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, ten khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
The CTD said in their statement earlier today that two key commanders were among the terrorists killed in the IBO, which was launched at 7:30am.
“During the operation, 10 terrorists were killed, including two key commanders of the Teepo Gul group: Commander Niaz Ali, known as Akasha and Commander Abdullah, known as Shipunkoi,” the CTD said, adding that five terrorists were wounded, and one facilitator was arrested in the IBO.
In a separate IBO conducted in Dera Ismail Khan district, three terrorists were killed by security forces, according to ISPR.
“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from [the] killed Indian sponsored khawarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians,” the military’s media wing said.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area as [the] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out [the] menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
Earlier this week, the ISPR said that 38 terrorists were killed in four separate IBOs conducted over a period of three days in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in terror incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, the Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-21 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/21202843b34139f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956517/police-detain-protesters-heading-to-karachi-press-club-for-ttaps-protest-against-27th-amendment' target='_blank'><strong>Police detain protesters heading to Karachi Press Club for TTAP’s protest against 27th Amendment</strong></a><br><p>The Karachi police on Friday detained about half a dozen people to prevent them from moving towards the venue of a scheduled protest by the opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), held as part of countrywide demonstrations against the recently passed 27th Constitutional Amendment.
All roads leading to the Karachi Press Club (KPC) were closed by the police after buses and other heavy vehicles were parked to block access. Contingents of female police personnel were also deployed.
Some protesters were detained as they attempted to reach KPC. PTI Sindh spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar told Dawn that “more than two dozen protesters” were detained near the KPC.
 






Also detained was civil society activist Alifya Sohail, not part of the TTAP protest, who was initially taken to the Artillery Maidan Police Station, where her phone was taken from her and she was not permitted to contact anyone.
She was subsequently moved to the Women Police Station situated on Sharae Faisal.
 






No case was registered against her, nor was there any written complaint against her.
Sohail has been consistently covering civil society protests, enforced disappearances and activities of rights group Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) in Karachi for several years.
 






Journalists and human rights activists called her arrest a serious attack on press freedom and demanded her immediate release.
The police claimed later in the day that all detainees were released.
 






Tehrik-i-Numandagi Awam protest
The protest organised by the Tehrik-i-Numandagi Awam brought together civil society members, grassroots activists, and lawyers who collectively condemned and rejected the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
It marked the launch of the platform, which is “a national movement formed to restore the Constitution, defend fundamental rights and re-establish the people’s mandate,” as per a press release issued by the group.
It was held amid heavy police deployment outside the KPC, where contingents of police could be seen carrying batons.
Lahore-based academic Dr Ammar Ali Jan, speaking to Dawn, assailed the 27th Amendment, calling it an “affront” to democracy.
Jan stressed that the “Constitution is a contract between the people and the state,” noting that with the passing of the 27th Amendment, the state was blocking all avenues of “resistance to the system”.
“Where would a common person go to get justice when you block all legal paths?” he questioned.
Decrying the amendment, one of the participants, Samrina Hashmi, expressed her frustration over the current state of affairs while speaking to Dawn.
“I am 65 years old. I am so frustrated. When will I see my country flourish? We have been fighting all our lives against martial law, dictatorship. It seems we are going back to 1958,” she remarked, in an apparent reference to the military coup staged by General Ayub Khan in 1958.
Organiser Riaz Ahmed told Dawn that the amendment was a “question mark on the state of our judiciary”.
He called for the annulment of the 26th and the 27th amendments.
On the matter of resistance against the amendment, Ahmed told Dawn that “there was solid momentum” building against it.</p><small>2025-11-21 16:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/21185617817f4f1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956513/abeyance-of-indus-waters-treaty-presents-real-threat-to-regional-stability-dar-tells-eu' target='_blank'><strong>Abeyance of Indus Waters Treaty presents ‘real threat’ to regional stability, Dar tells EU</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday reiterated that the “illegal and unilateral” step to hold the Indus Water Treaty (IWT) in abeyance is a “real threat” to regional stability while addressing the Indo-Pacific Ministerial Forum Roundtable in Brussels.
India in April held the IWT in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence. Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
Speaking at the EU forum in Belgium’s capital today, Dar emphasised that water must be a source of cooperation “and not weaponised for politics”.
“We believe that durable peace in South Asia cannot be achieved without a peaceful resolution of decades-old Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and aspirations of Kashmiri people,” Dar said.
On the subject of Afghanistan, the foreign minister said the country “remains a consequential relationship for Pakistan and the regional stability”.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have also come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism.
“We desire a peaceful, stable, friendly, connected, and prosperous Afghanistan. We urge the Afghan Taliban regime to act responsibly, honour their commitments, and work towards rooting out terrorism from its soil,” Dar restated.
With reference to Israel and Gaza, DPM said the situation in the Middle East “impacts us all directly”.
“Pakistan commends efforts of President Trump, along with eight Arab Islamic countries, including Pakistan, leading to the signing of the peace agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, heralding a ceasefire,” he said.
“The ongoing atrocities in Gaza and violations of the peace agreement must end, as well as the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands,” he added.
“Our foreign policy is grounded in the criticality of a credible, time-bound political process consistent with relevant [UNSC] resolutions, leading to the establishment of an independent, sovereign, viable, and contiguous state of Palestine based on pre-1967 borders, with al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital,” Dar stressed.
The foreign minister also spoke on the conflict in Ukraine, which he pointed out has disrupted energy and food markets, “with real consequences for people around the globe”.
He said that Islamabad’s position on the conflict is anchored in the UN Charter. “We hope for a peaceful resolution of this conflict at the earliest. The model of cooperation adopted by the [EU] offers many lessons for the international community, proving that inclusivity and interdependence are the surest foundations of peace and prosperity.”</p><small>2025-11-21 16:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634777-onus-of-trade-suspension-border-opening-delay-rests-with-taliban-regime-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Onus of trade suspension, border opening delay 'rests with Taliban regime': FO</strong></a><br><p>

An initial statement by Rescue 1122 said the incident took place early in the morning after the boiler of the factory exploded, causing the collapse of the building and nearby structures.
However, the rescue service later attributed the explosion to a gas leak, which was also confirmed in the statement issued by Faisalabad Commissioner Raja Jahangir Anwar’s office.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered on the state’s behalf by the police and mentioned 20 dead, with 19 named victims, and seven injured.
City police spokesperson Muhammad Tariq confirmed to Dawn that the Mansoorabad police had arrested the factory owner.
The statement by the commissioner’s office said no boiler was present in the factory, adding that four factories were operating in the Malikpur area. “A fire erupted in one of the factories due to gas leakage and engulfed the other factories as well.”
Seven houses in the area were also affected, the statement said. According to Rescue 1122, the explosion caused the roof of the factory and those of adjacent houses to collapse.
The statement by the commissioner’s office said that 17 bodies were pulled out from the rubble.
It said the injured were taken to Allied Hospital, and three were discharged after first aid while three were admitted to the burn unit.
It added that a five-member inquiry team was being constituted to probe the incident.
The statement said that the rescue operation at the site had been completed and the clearance process was under way. The situation was being monitored, it added, further quoting Commissioner Raja saying that “we share the grief of the heirs of those killed in this unfortunate accident”.
An earlier statement by Rescue 1122 detailed the rescue operation at the glue factory, saying that it was carried out under the supervision of the district emergency officer, and more than 20 ambulances and fire tenders took part in it.
It also said that the Faisalabad Control Room had received a call about the explosion at the glue factory at 5:28am.
Videos of the rescue work shared by Rescue 1122 showed workers combing through the rubble of buildings and looking for survivors.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz expressed grief over the loss of lives in the incident, a statement issued by her office said. It said she extended condolences to the bereaved families and sought a report on the incident from the Faisalabad commissioner.
Meanwhile, Punjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar had directed that Rescue 1122, the fire brigade and all related agencies be provided full support.
In a statement, he said that police officers and officials should continue rescue operations to find people buried underneath the rubble. He also directed traffic police to ensure easy access to the site of the incident for ambulances and other rescue vehicles.
National Trade Union Federation (NTUF) Secretary General Nasir Mansoor expressed concern over the “tragic deaths of labourers” in the incident and expressed solidarity with their families, a press release issued by the labour organisation said.
It quoted Mansoor as saying: “Factories have turned into death [traps] for labourers and industrialists are doling out death certificates.” He further accused governments and the labour department of “criminal negligence”.
“The Punjab government is directly responsible for the labourers’ death,” he said, according to the press release.
The NTUF stressed that safe working conditions should be prioritised and demanded Rs3 million be given in compensation to the family of each labourer killed in the incident. The organisation also called for the provision of complete and free medical treatment for the injured.
Last year in April, a dozen workers were injured in a steam boiler explosion at a textile mill in Faisalabad. Rescue 1122 reported that as a result of the blast, not only did fire break out in the factory, but the roof of a hall also caved in.
FIR
The FIR was registered at the Mansoorabad Police Station on the complaint of Sub-Inspector (SI) Ehtesham Abbas under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of a common object), 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempt to murder), 336B (causing hurt by use of corrosive substance) and 440 of the Pakistan Penal Code; Sections 3 (punishment for causing explosion likely to endanger life or property) and 4 (punishment for attempt to cause explosion or for making or keeping explosive with intent to endanger life or property) of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908, and Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.
SI Abbas said he reached the spot and contacted the rescue teams to save people, requesting help from locals to aid the operation as well.
It said that the owner of the factory, the factory manager and the employees used dangerous chemicals and flammable substances in containers, due to which there was fear among locals who had also previously raised complaints to no avail.
“Many deaths have occurred due to the explosion of containers filled with these same dangerous chemicals and flammable substances,” the FIR said, naming 19 people and one unknown person among the dead, while seven were injured.

​According to PIA spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez Khan, the attendant did not report for flight PK-798 from Toronto to Lahore.
“When contacted, he cited ill health as an excuse,” the spokesperson said, adding that the matter is being investigated.
“In case of illegal disappearance, departmental action will be initiated against the flight attendant,” Khan said.
Missing PIA crew members, particularly in Canada, have been reported in the past, too.
Last year in October, a cabin crew member was reportedly gone missing while on duty. The missing crew member, based in Islamabad, had disappeared during a layover in Toronto.
Similarly, a 47-year-old PIA steward was reportedly gone missing in Canada in March 2024.
In February 2024, another member of the airline’s cabin crew was reported missing while on duty. The member had arrived in Toronto on PIA flight PK-782 from Islamabad but failed to report for duty on the return flight, PK-784 to Karachi.</p><small>2025-11-21 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2119515250e49a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956519/ozempic-wegovy-users-who-suffered-vision-loss-compensated-by-danish-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Ozempic, Wegovy users who suffered vision loss compensated by Danish govt</strong></a><br><p>Four people in Denmark who developed serious eye conditions after using popular weight-loss and diabetes drugs Wegovy and Ozempic are entitled to compensation, an independent body ruled on Friday.
More than 40 people had sought reimbursement after they said they had developed a serious eye condition as a result of using one of the drugs, both made by Novo Nordisk, according to the Danish Patient Compensation Association.
The condition, NAION (non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy), is a lack of blood supply to the optic nerve, which can lead to a loss of vision.
The association said that it had ruled on five cases so far, and found four people who merited compensation.
“It’s unfortunate for the patients who have been affected by the side effect. NAION is a serious condition that causes permanent and incurable damage to vision,” the association’s director, Karen-Inger Bast, said in a statement.
Bast added that the cases were difficult to assess, given that it was a new medicine and the patients were already at increased risk of developing NAION.
In total, the four patients would receive 800,000 kroner ($123,000), but the association noted that the amount could increase depending on the impact the condition could have on their lives going forward, for instance, if it affects their ability to work.
Medical compensation in Denmark is generally paid out by health authorities.
Last year, the Danish Medicines Agency asked a European medical watchdog to review a Danish study that showed a link between semaglutide — the active ingredient in Ozempic and Wegovy — and NAION.
In June, that watchdog — the PRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee) — concluded that NAION was a “very rare” side effect of semaglutide, affecting up to 1 in 10,000 users.
Novo Nordisk said it had reviewed the decision by the Danish Patient Compensation. In a statement sent to AFP, the drugmaker noted that following PRAC’s findings, patient leaflets for all semaglutide products had been updated to include NAION as a “very rare” reaction to the drugs.
But it said the “benefit-risk profile of semaglutide remains favourable”.</p><small>2025-11-21 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/211730478e0fa0d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956509/how-many-indian-air-force-jets-have-crashed-in-non-combat-incidents-over-the-last-five-years' target='_blank'><strong>How many Indian Air Force jets have crashed in non-combat incidents over the last five years?</strong></a><br><p>An Indian fighter aircraft, the indigenously developed Tejas, crashed during a demonstration flight at the Dubai Air Show on Friday.

July 9: SEPECAT Jaguar
The Indian Air Force (IAF) said two of its pilots were killed as a Jaguar fighter jet crashed near a village in Rajasthan’s Churu district.

The country has one of the world’s highest rates of gender-based violence and femicide (GBVF), leading to deaths five times higher than the global average, according to the United Nations’s gender equality organisation UN Women.

In one of dozens of “lie-in” protests countrywide, thousands of people dressed in black lay on the ground for 15 minutes at an event in Johannesburg’s city centre, just a few kilometres (miles) from the venue where G20 leaders will meet on Saturday and Sunday.

Organisers said the action was to honour the 15 women murdered every day in South Africa.

A 2022 government survey found that one in three South African women had experienced physical violence, and almost 10 per cent had faced sexual violence.

More than 10,700 cases of rape were reported to police in the first three months of 2025, but the real numbers are expected to be much higher.

“I’m here standing for not only myself but my younger sisters, my siblings and every woman in South Africa,” said one of the protesters, 23-year-old Lefika Jonathan.

The government’s disaster management said that after evaluating the “persistent and immediate life-safety risks posed by ongoing acts of violence”, it had concluded that GBVF met the “threshold of a potential disaster”.

This made the issue a priority for the executive branch of government and “all organs of state”, it said.

“All we want is justice,” said another protester, 19-year-old student Nomhle Porogo.

She hoped the timing of the protest meant “those in higher positions can hear our cries”. But she was unimpressed by the decision to wait until South Africa was in the international spotlight to classify the problem a disaster – a longstanding demand from women’s rights groups.

“For them to declare it a national disaster when it suits them and in front of our visitors because they want to make our house look clean for visitors…is an injustice,” she told AFP.</p><small>2025-11-21 14:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634768-jamadi-ul-sani-moon-not-sighted-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Jamadi ul Sani moon not sighted in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

According to an official notification, the senior-most minister, Mian Abdul Waheed, retained the department of law, justice, parliamentary affairs and human rights, which he had also held in the previous coalition government.
Sardar Javed Ayoub was assigned forests, wildlife, fisheries and the Muzaffarabad Development Authority; Syed Bazil Ali Naqvi was given health and population welfare; Javed Iqbal Budhanvi received food; and Nabila Ayoub was allocated the portfolio of the Kashmir cause, arts and languages.
The portfolios of works and communications (C&W), local government and rural development and finance and inland revenue also went to the PPP loyalists, Sardar Ziaul Qamar, Chaudhry Amar Yasin and Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, respectively.
Yasin is the son of PPP AJK President Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, who was overlooked for the office of prime minister in the recent change.
Most recent entrants to the PPP retained the portfolios they had held in the Chaudhry Anwarul Haq–led coalition government.

Deevan Ali Chughtai — elementary and secondary education
Malik Zafar Iqbal — higher education
Chaudhry Arshad — energy and water resources
Chaudhry Muhammad Rasheed — Power Development Organisation
Yasir Sultan — physical planning and housing
Chaudhry Akhlaq —revenue, stamps and evacuee property
Faheem Akhtar Rabbani — tourism and archaeology

Arshad and Sultan are the brother-in-law and son, respectively, of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood.
Sardar Muhammad Hussain, a new entrant into the PPP who previously held population welfare, was assigned social welfare, women development, zakat and usher.
Muhammad Rafique Nayyar and Chaudhry Ali Shan Soni — who were not part of the previous coalition setup — were allotted religious affairs and auqaf and agriculture, animal husbandry, irrigation, dairy development and small dams, respectively. Both had joined the PPP slightly earlier than the other newcomers.
Among the advisers, Fahad Yaqoob was given trade and industry, labour, sericulture and the Government Printing Press, while Sardar Ahmad Saghir received sports, youth and culture.
Yaqoob is the son of senior PPP legislator and former president Haji Yaqoob Khan, while Saghir — who had also served as adviser in the Mr Haq–led government — is the son of MLA Shahida Saghir, who recently joined the PPP.
Contrary to speculation that the information department would go to Nayyar, the prime minister retained the portfolio with himself.
Rathore was sworn in as the 16th prime minister of AJK on Tuesday.
The oath-taking ceremony was held a day after PPP’s Rathore was announced as the new AJK premier after Chaudhry Anwarul Haq was ousted through a vote of no-confidence (VoNC) in the region’s legislative assembly.
The oath was administered by AJK Legislative Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar at the President’s House in Muzaffarabad. The speaker performed the duty on behalf of AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood, who reportedly could not travel to the regional capital owing to his health issues.</p><small>2025-11-21 14:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2118105401694cc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956514/karachi-residents-face-acute-water-shortage-amid-frequent-ke-power-failures' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi residents face acute water shortage amid frequent KE power failures</strong></a><br><p>Karachi’s residents continued to face a worsening water crisis on Friday due to repeated electricity outages by K-Electric (KE), which have disrupted the city’s water pumping operations
According to the spokesperson for the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), the city’s crucial K-3 pumping station experienced a major electric breakdown late last night, and the fault had yet to be resolved.
The spokesperson said the station had also faced a significant breakdown on Tuesday, with electricity restored only a day ago after a 41-hour delay.
Just hours later, the electric cable fault reappeared, forcing the station to shut down again. The station had been temporarily shut down on Monday to fix technical issues, but problems persisted.
The breakdowns have caused an estimated total loss of 335 million gallons of water, severely affecting the supply across Karachi. Areas such as North Nazimabad, Gulberg Town, Gulistan-i-Johar, Scheme 33, various blocks of Gulshan-e-Iqbal, New Karachi, Saddar and Clifton are among those experiencing severe shortages.
Earlier incidents at the Dhabeji pumping station on November 5, 11, 13 and 15 due to cable faults also resulted in prolonged electricity interruptions and worsened the city’s water shortage.
KWSC officials stated that despite all administrative and technical efforts, the lack of consistent electricity supply continued to impact pumping operations.
They urged KE management to prioritise the immediate and stable restoration of power to pumping stations to ensure that the water supply to Karachi was quickly normalised.</p><small>2025-11-21 14:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2118311615f6065.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956508/explainer-what-you-need-to-know-about-indias-indigenously-developed-hal-tejas' target='_blank'><strong>Explainer: What you need to know about India’s indigenously developed HAL Tejas</strong></a><br><p>An Indian fighter aircraft, the indigenously developed Tejas Mk1A, crashed during a demonstration flight at the Dubai Air Show on Friday. The jet, developed by the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), crashed at about 2:10pm local time.
According to the Indian Air Force (IAF), the pilot of the jet died in the crash.
Here are some facts about New Delhi’s indigenous fighter aircraft.
Made in India
The LCA (Light Combat Aircraft) Tejas is a 4.5-generation multirole, single-engine, all-weather fighter aircraft designed to perform air and ground combat roles, according to its manufacturer HAL. It is currently operated by India’s navy and air force.
The Tejas Mk1A, which was involved in today’s accident, features a delta-wing configuration and is powered by an American General Electric F404-GE-IN20 turbofan engine.
The jet, named after the Sanskrit word for “radiance”, reportedly carries an Advanced Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar system and, with eight hardpoints, can fit a variety of weapons ranging from beyond visual range missiles and bombs.
According to a report from Indian outlet Frontline, 60 per cent of the aircraft’s components were made locally.
The IAF took delivery of 40 aircraft in 2021.

Key facts

Max Speed: Mach 1.8
Service ceiling: 50,000 feet
Maximum payload: 14,600lb
Combat range: 739 kilometres
Fly-by-wire piloting system

Taking to the skies
The LCA project’s development started in the 1980s, with New Delhi seeking to replace the MiG-21 Bisons, which had a poor safety record and were nearing the end of their service lives.
The Indian government launched the Aeronautical Development Agency under the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in 1984 to oversee the aircraft’s development, with HAL being appointed as the primary manufacturer.
Developing the aircraft took 20 years; the delta-wing design was finalised in 1990, with the prototype’s first flight in 2001. After the development of more prototypes, the first Limited Service Production aircraft took flight in 2007.

However, the Tejas was grounded for three months due to issues with the ejection system.
“The grounding of [the] Tejas … took place because of the new pilot’s helmets. Since these protruded above the ejection seats, the helmets could have prevented a smooth ejection by smashing into the fighter’s canopy before it was blown off,” a report in Business Standard from November 2012 read.
“Since that constituted a serious safety issue for pilots, flight-testing was halted in August.”
Operational history
The jet featured in military parades in India and made its international debut at the Bahrain Airshow in 2016.
Other than ceremonial use, the aircraft has participated in training exercises, such as ‘Gaganshakti-2018’ — the largest in India at the time — and the Vayu Shakti exercise in 2019.
The jet’s first operational deployment was on August 18, 2020, when the No 45 squadron was deployed along the Line of Actual Control, amid tensions with China.
Aside from today’s incident, the Tejas has only had one other recorded crash, when it crashed in India’s western state of Rajasthan last March. The pilot ejected safely, the Indian Air Force said in a statement.</p><small>2025-11-21 14:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/211618423f1526e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956498/7-killed-in-attack-on-peace-committee-office-in-bannu' target='_blank'><strong>7 killed in attack on peace committee office in Bannu</strong></a><br><p>Seven people were killed when a peace committee office was attacked in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bannu district, police said on Friday.
Police officials told Dawn that one among those killed was a ‘good Talib’ — a term used to refer to a former militant who has surrendered to the state — and the rest were his relatives.
In their complaint to the police, the victims’ family has maintained that the attack was a result of a family feud. However, police say the family has taken the stance to avoid another potential attack carried out in retaliation.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Havaid police station under Sections 302 (punishment for intentional murder), 324 (attempt of intentional murder), 149 (every member of an unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common objective) and 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
The FIR said that the suspects barged into the victims’ baithak (guesthouse), opened fire on them and fled. Three suspects were nominated in the FIR, which said they were accompanied by other armed men and led by a terrorist commander.
According to the complainant, named Abdullah, there was enmity between his family and the suspects over the matter of a murder.
Peace committees, or village defence committees, were formed to assist law enforcement agencies in defending KP areas against terror attacks. These also include former militants, often referred to as ‘good Taliban’.
Peace committee officials in KP have been targeted by terrorists in the past as well.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “strongly condemned” today’s attack, state-run APP reported.
The prime minister expressed “deep grief and sorrow” over the loss of precious lives in the attack, which he said was carried out by “Fitna-al-Khawarij”.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term designated by the state for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP).
APP, citing an official statement, reported that PM Shehbaz prayed for the “elevation of ranks of the departed souls in jannah (paradise) and for patience for their families”.
He directed relevant authorities to identify those responsible and ensure they received due punishment, the report said.
“Such cowardly acts, aimed at sabotaging peace efforts, expose the evil intentions of the Fitna-al-Khawarij to create unrest in Pakistan. These cowardly actions cannot, at any cost, weaken the resolve of the people.
“The entire nation stands united to defeat anti-state elements,” the statement quoted him as saying.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also condemned the attack “carried out by *Fitna-al-Khawarij”,* a statement issued by his office said.
“He expressed deep sorrow over the loss of life in the attack,” the statement said, adding that he also extended condolences to the bereaved families.
The statement quoted him as saying: “This cowardly attack of terrorism is a nefarious attempt to undermine peace and stability. Such cowardly acts of Fitna-al-Khawarij cannot weaken the high morale of the people. The state and the nation are standing united against enemies of peace.”</p><small>2025-11-21 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634750-cm-afridi-challenges-ecp-summons-on-code-breach-in-phc' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi challenges ECP summons on code breach in PHC</strong></a><br><p>

Tremors were felt in eastern states in neighbouring India that border Bangladesh, but there were no immediate reports of major damage there, authorities said.

Muhammad Yunus, the head of Bangladesh’s interim government, said the injured included students from Dhaka University, factory workers in the city of Gazipur and residents of Narsingdi, the epicenter of the earthquake.
His statement gave no details of how the five died. Police said earlier three people had been killed when the railing of a six-storey building collapsed during the earthquake.
Several of the injured taken to hospital from Narsingdi, about 40 kilometres east of Dhaka, were in a critical condition, health adviser Nurjahan Begum told reporters.
Dhaka residents rushed out of their homes as buildings shook and some makeshift structures collapsed, Reuters witnesses said.
 
 

“We felt a strong jolt and buildings were shaking like trees,” said resident Suman Rahman. “Staircases were jammed as people rushed down. Everyone was terrified, children were crying.”
The fire department said some people had been injured when bricks and loose cement fell from buildings that were under construction.
“I have never felt such a tremor in my life. We were at the office when furniture started shaking. We rushed down the stairs on the street and saw other people on the road already,” said Sadman Sakib, who works in Dhaka.
The government was closely monitoring the situation and had directed departments to intensify rescue operations in affected areas, Yunus’ office said in the statement.
Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar expressed sorrow over the “tragic loss of lives”.
“Our heartfelt condolences for the bereaved families and prayers for the swift recovery of all those who have been injured,” he posted on X.

Peshgi system is the commonly used term for the practice of debt bondage in Pakistan. Instead of just seeking wages in exchange for labour, poor workers take an advance from an employer (in cash or any other form) under the obligation to work for that employer until the debt is paid off.
“Child labour at kilns, once a painful reality, was eliminated under a campaign initiated by [then chief minister] Shehbaz Sharif, neglected for [four] years, and now fully revived and strengthened by CM Maryam Nawaz,” Aurangzeb said in a post on X.
 







The senior minister’s post highlighted that all brick kilns across Punjab have been geo-mapped, QR-coded, drone-surveyed and linked to a central monitoring dashboard.

“Punjab is now also transitioning government construction towards block-based building, moving away from traditional kiln bricks,” she added, calling the development “not just reform” but a “human rights revolution”.
According to a letter addressed to CM Maryam by Members of Congress Thomas R. Suozzi and Jack Bergman (shared by Aurangzeb on X), “the mechanisation and modernisation of this critical sector will not only support Pakistan in fulfilling its international obligations to end bonded [labour] but also position Punjab as a more attractive destination for foreign direct investment, particularly from American businesses committed to ethical and sustainable engagement”.
The letter added that the progress is “vital” to enhancing bilateral economic relations and strengthening the overall Pakistan-US partnership, “fostering long-term growth and cooperation”.
Moreover, it said that the province is “well-positioned to serve as a pilot province for this initiative”, setting a benchmark for the nation.
“Modernising brick kilns is a critical step that will not only advance human rights but will also make Pakistan more attractive to long-term foreign investment,” stated the letter.
Over 12.5 million children in Pakistan are involved in child labour, according to the Child Rights Movement National Secretariat. One in four households in Pakistan employs a child for domestic work, often in hazardous conditions, as per the International Labour Organisation.
According to a provincial survey, working children accounted for 11.1 per cent of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s child population.
On this year’s World Day Against Child Labour in June, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif urged parents and employers to join forces in eliminating child labour.</p><small>2025-11-21 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/211452379355be3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956494/mohsin-naqvi-announces-revised-prize-money-for-next-psl-edition' target='_blank'><strong>Mohsin Naqvi announces revised prize money for next PSL edition</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Friday announced a “new reward” for the upcoming Pakistan Super League (PSL) edition set to be held in April 2026.
“Complementing the Pakistan Super League’s growth, I am thrilled to announce a new reward for franchises in the forthcoming editions,” Naqvi said on X.
The champions will take home $500,000 — the same as the 2025 edition — while the runner-up team will take home $300,000, which is an increase of the previous year’s $200,000 reward.
Additionally, a $200,000 reward will be given to the “best franchise contributing towards cricket development.
 






Separately, PCB announced on Friday that the auction for the two new PSL franchise teams will take place on 6 January, 2026, while the decision for which cities have been shortlisted will be made after December 15.
“This marks a significant milestone in the league’s continued expansion and its commitment to expanding its footprint across Pakistan,” the board said of the development.
“The addition of two new teams will also create fresh commercial, sporting and fan engagement opportunities.” 
PSL, which began in 2016 with five teams, expanded to six franchises with the addition of Multan Sultans in 2018. The inclusion of two more sides would mark its first major restructuring in seven years and push the total number of teams to eight.</p><small>2025-11-21 09:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634707-french-commander-reveals-secret-behind-air-combat-victory-of-pakistan-over-india-in-may-2025' target='_blank'><strong>French commander confirms Pakistan's air superiority in May 2025 combat with India</strong></a><br><p>

The Kolkata-based Telegraph reported that Modi had avoided the last two multilateral platforms where the US President was present — the Asean summit in Malaysia and Trump’s Gaza Peace Summit in Egypt — “resulting in speculation that the prime minister was trying to avoid a meeting with the American leader till the India-US trade deal is finalised”.
Trump’s administration has said it will not attend the first G20 summit in Africa, alleging that the host country, previously ruled by its white minority apartheid system until 1994, discriminates against white people. The US president has also rejected South Africa’s agenda for the November 22-23 summit of promoting solidarity and helping developing nations adapt to worse weather disasters, transition to clean energy and cut their excessive debt costs.
The Indian Ministry of External Affairs on Wednesday had confirmed Modi’s participation in the G20 summit.
Prior to embarking on the trip, Modi said he will present India’s perspective at the forum in line with its vision of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’ and ‘One Earth, One Family and One Future’.

“Will be attending the G20 summit in Johannesburg, South Africa. This is a particularly special summit as it is being held in Africa. Various global issues will be discussed there. Will be meeting various world leaders during the summit,” Modi posted on social media platform X.
 






“During the visit, I also look forward to my interaction with the Indian diaspora in South Africa, which is one of the largest outside India,” Modi said in the statement he shared along with his post on X.
On the margins of the summit, Modi is expected to hold bilateral meetings with some of the leaders present in Johannesburg. He is attending at the invitation of South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.
Earlier this week, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs had said that Modi was expected to speak at all three sessions of the summit.
According to Press Trust of India, a top official of the MEA on Thursday had said that he would not like to prejudge what would figure in the leaders’ declaration, but all important matters relevant from the perspective of India and the Global South will be “highlighted by our leadership”.

The FCC was established under the recently enacted 27th Constitutional Amendment amid much opposition from the opposition and within the judiciary. According to government officials, the creation of the FCC is intended to reduce the Supreme Court’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases, and strengthen the independence and credibility of the judicial system.
“The creation of this court represents an important moment in the nation’s ongoing constitutional journey,” Justice Aminuddin said in a message posted on the newly launched website for the FCC.
“One that reinforces our collective commitment to the rule of law and to the enduring promise of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,” he stressed.
He said that the FCC “has been entrusted with a mandate of great significance: to interpret the Constitution with clarity, independence and fidelity; to safeguard the fundamental rights guaranteed to the people; and to ensure that the constitutional order remains a source of stability, justice and balance for all institutions of the state.”
“The work of this court is not only judicial — it is also a solemn trust that carries profound implications for the lives, liberties and aspirations of Pakistan’s citizens,” he said.
“As we begin our institutional life, our focus remains firmly on building a judicial forum that embodies integrity, impartiality and intellectual rigour,” he said.
Justice Aminuddin added that each matter brought before the court would be approached with an “unwavering commitment to fairness and restraint, guided solely by the Constitution and the principles of justice that lie at its heart”.
“We aspire to nurture a tradition of reasoned adjudication, institutional dignity and public confidence — qualities that are indispensable to any constitutional court,” he said.
He further said that as the first FCC chief justice, he considered it a “privilege to contribute to the foundations of an institution whose purpose transcends individuals and moments in time”.
On Thursday, Justice Aminuddin Khan had visited the designated site for the establishment of a new record room within the premises of the Islamabad High Court.
Accompanied by Justice Ali Baqir Najafi and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah, the FCC CJ reviewed the proposed arrangements and approved the shifting of the relevant judicial files from the Supreme Court to the newly identified Record Room facility at the IHC.
During the visit, Justice Aminuddin stressed the importance of a secure archiving and efficient accessibility of judicial records to support ongoing and future judicial proceedings.</p><small>2025-11-21 08:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634704-in-maiden-message-as-cj-justice-aminuddin-terms-fcc-creation-a-landmark-in-constitutional-journey' target='_blank'><strong>In maiden message as CJ, Justice Aminuddin terms FCC creation a landmark in constitutional journey</strong></a><br><p>

“The CCP has issued show cause notices to seventeen major private school systems for allegedly abusing their dominant position by compelling parents to purchase expensive, logo-branded notebooks, workbooks, and uniforms exclusively from school-authorised vendors,” a press release by the CCP said.
“The action has been taken to safeguard millions of school-going children and their families from unfair pricing practices,” it added.
According to the commission, the enforcement action follows a detailed suo motu inquiry initiated on the basis of numerous complaints from parents, guardians, and other stakeholders.
It said that the complainants alleged “arbitrary fee hikes, non-transparent selling practices, and the bundling of mandatory branded school supplies, effectively leaving families with no choice but to purchase these items at inflated prices”.
The CCP said that the school systems under scrutiny included the Beaconhouse School System, The City School, Headstart, Lahore Grammar School, Froebel’s, Roots International, Roots Millennium, KIPS, Allied Schools, Super Nova, Dar-e-Arqam, STEP School, Westminster International, United Charter School, and The Smart School, among others.
“These school networks operate hundreds of campuses nationwide and collectively educate millions of students, giving them considerable influence over enrolled families,” it said.
According to the handout, the CCP’s inquiry showed that parents were mandated to buy logo-bearing notebooks, workbooks, uniforms, and other ancillary school products from exclusive school-authorised outlets, the statement said.
“In several instances, schools sold compulsory ‘study packs’ through online portals or designated vendors, with students prohibited from using generic notebooks or uniforms from the open market,” it added.
The CCP defined the relevant markets as, firstly, the provision of education services to enrolled students, where each school enjoyed a 100 per cent market share, making students “captive consumers”; and secondly, the market for ancillary school products, which became the “tied market”.
 
 

The inquiry report concluded that many study packs were “up to 280pc more expensive than similar items available in open markets”.
It also found that leading school systems engaged in tying arrangements, making continued enrollment conditional upon purchasing secondary products such as notebooks and uniforms.
The report also added that schools appointed exclusive vendors, foreclosing the market for thousands of small stationery and uniform sellers nationwide, according to the statement. It said that mandatory branded supplies and restrictive trading conditions violated sections 4(1) and 4(2)(a) of the Competition Act, 2010.
“High switching costs, such as limited school options, substantial transfer fees, and transportation constraints left parents with no viable alternative, enabling schools to enforce these practices without resistance,” the press release added.
The CCP observed that these practices “restricted market access, harmed small retailers, and limited consumer choice across Pakistan”.
“Private educational institutions account for nearly half of all student enrollment in the country, it said. “With inflation already straining household budgets, the imposition of overpriced branded materials further burdens families and raises concerns about excessive commercialisation within the education sector.”
According to the commission’s statement, it has directed the seventeen school systems to submit written responses within 14 days, appear before the commission through duly authorised representatives, and explain why enforcement orders under Section 31 and penalties under Section 38 should not be imposed.
Failure to comply may result in ex-parte proceedings, the statement said.
Under the law, it added, CCP may impose a penalty of up to 10pc of the annual turnover or Rs750 million, whichever is higher, for such violations.</p><small>2025-11-21 07:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2110322030a0b71.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956457/afridi-pens-letter-to-maryam-over-manhandling-of-imrans-sisters-denial-of-his-visitation-rights' target='_blank'><strong>Afridi pens letter to Maryam over manhandling of Imran’s sisters, denial of his visitation rights</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a letter to his counterpart in Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, has raised concerns over the alleged manhandling of PTI founder Imran Khan’s sisters by police and the obstruction of the incarcerated ex-premier’s visitation rights.
The development comes after Afridi on Thursday was denied access to meet Imran for a seventh time. Further, two days ago police had allegedly manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters from outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where they were camped out after being denied a weekly meeting with him.
The letter, which was shared by the PTI on social media platform X early on Friday, said that Afridi wished to draw Maryam’s attention to “serious concerns” regarding the “administration of court-mandated visitation rights” of Imran and the recent treatment of his family members.
 






“Clear and binding judicial directions govern Imran’s visitation schedule. These orders explicitly permit his close family members and nominated individuals to meet him on specified days. Despite the unambiguous nature of these instructions, repeated reports indicate persistent non-implementation by the authorities responsible for compliance,” Afridi said.
He also termed accounts of the “inappropriate and rough treatment” of Imran’s sisters during a recent attempt to visit him as “particularly disturbing”.
“These individuals are apolitical private citizens, seeking only to meet their brother in accordance with court permissions. Even if restrictions were to exist for political visitors — which is a different category altogether — there is no conceivable legal or administrative basis for obstructing or mishandling immediate family members whose presence is neither political nor disruptive in nature,” the KP chief minister said.
“Their obstruction, physical restraint or temporary detention is therefore wholly unacceptable,” he said.
Afridi said that such actions created a “clear impression” that judicial directives were being disregarded, and that jail and police authorities were not safeguarding or facilitating the rights of visitors.
He urged Maryam to ensure a proper, safe and dignified waiting area for authorised visitors.
“The current practice of stopping them nearly a kilometre away and compelling elderly family members — particularly women — to sit on roads is wholly inappropriate and must be discontinued,” he said.
He said that the Punjab government should ensure the implementation of all court directives on visitation. He also called for identifying and holding individuals accountable for obstructing, insulting, or physically manhandling peaceful visitors, including Imran’s family and members of the KP cabinet.
He said that the Punjab government should also issue instructions to the prison and police authorities to prevent the recurrence of such incidents. Further, he called for establishing a mechanism ensuring that all future meetings were facilitated in an “orderly, respectful and legally compliant manner”.
Afridi ended his letter by saying that Imran was a former prime minister and the leader of a political party he himself represented.
“Any deviation from court-mandated procedures in his case, or any disrespectful treatment of his immediate family, becomes a matter of direct institutional concern,” he said, adding that he could not remain indifferent when Imran’s dignity and rights were being compromised.
“I am therefore constrained to demand that these issues be addressed promptly, decisively and in full conformity with judicial directions,” he said.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
On Thursday, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan had expressed concern over the reports of Imran’s sisters being “manhandled” and noted that the rights of prisoners’ families to meet their relatives and the right to peaceful assembly were protected under national and international human rights law.
“HRCP calls for a transparent inquiry and urges authorities to ensure the rights, safety and dignity of all involved are fully respected,” it said in a post on X.</p><small>2025-11-21 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634682-after-e-challans-robot-cars-to-curb-no-parking-violations-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>After e-challans, robot cars to curb no-parking violations in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

According to the UN’s World Urbanisation Prospects 2025 report, Karachi could be the globe’s fifth most populous city by 2050, with a population of around 33m. This is in keeping with the worldwide trend of rapid urbanisation. But as Karachi expands, its services and infrastructure are not growing apace. As per the Economist Intelligence Unit’s ranking from earlier this year, it is amongst the world’s five least liveable cities. If this dubious distinction is to change, much work is needed at the official level.
The Sindh government has said that the ‘Greater Karachi Regional Plan, 2047’ will be ready within two years. There is, of course, much to address: damaged roads, water shortages, a broken sewage system, encroachments, lack of integrated public transport, etc. It is hoped that the master plan that is in the works focuses on these and other problems the megacity faces. Perhaps Karachi has suffered over the decades more due to lack of political will to make things better, rather than a lack of funding or planning. Among the many solutions offered is a more responsive local government system, with directly elected officials — from the mayor to local councillors — who can be held to account by the voter for lack of service delivery. The Sindh government often talks of protecting provincial autonomy; yet it should also extend this spirit of devolution to the province’s local governments, particularly in urban spaces. As the UN report suggests, “sustainable development requires integrated planning” that coordinates “housing, land use, mobility and basic services”. If Karachi is to be transformed into a liveable city, integrating these solutions is essential. But if the same old empty rhetoric and official apathy continue, the megacity may further be disfigured by an exacerbated chaotic urban sprawl and an exploding population in an environment where only the law of the jungle prevails.
