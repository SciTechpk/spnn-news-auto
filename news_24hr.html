The European Union on Monday adopted fresh sanctions against Russian oil interests, targeting a handful of traders for helping Moscow to circumvent Western sanctions on crude exports.
The latest EU sanctions prohibit the bloc’s citizens from doing business with the listed companies and individuals, reducing their access to shipping and insurance providers. The EU has listed more than 2,600 individuals and companies in total.
The EU has targeted nine individuals and entities supporting Russia’s shadow fleet of oil tankers, the Council of the European Union and the EU’s Official Journal said, referring to businessmen linked to oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil as well as shipping companies that own and manage tankers.

Murtaza Lakhani is also said to have sold Iraqi oil under Saddam regime; holds stake in Arctic Vostok Oil project

Among those targeted by the EU is Canadian-Pakistani oil trader Murtaza Lakhani, CEO of trading company Mercantile & Maritime. “Through his companies, he enables shipments and export of Russian oil, notably from the Russian state-owned oil company Rosneft,” said the listing in the EU’s Official Journal.
“In particular, Murtaza Lakhani controls vessels transporting crude oil or petroleum products originating in Russia or being exported from Russia.”
He started his career at global trader Glencore, where he worked on Iraqi oil exports during the Saddam Hussein era and later moved to Iraq’s Kurdistan region, where he acted as an intermediary between the oil ministry and international companies to sell oil independently of Baghdad.
During this period, he helped Russian state-controlled energy giant Rosneft to sign oil and gas deals in Kurdistan, working closely with Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, including during signing ceremonies at Russia’s main economic forum in St Petersburg.
Building on this relationship, Lakhani partnered with top oil trader Vitol to invest in a 5pc stake in Rosneft’s largest oil project in decades, Vostok Oil in the Arctic.
“This country (Russia) is the largest resource country in the world. Hampering it is a very short-term effect, not a long-term goal for anybody. They will always need Russia,” he told Russia’s SolovievLive at the St Petersburg Forum in June.
Lakhani, Mercantile & Maritime, Litasco Middle East DMCC and 2Rivers Group did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.
The EU has imposed 19 packages of sanctions so far, but Moscow has managed to adapt to most measures and is still selling millions of barrels of oil to India and China, albeit at discounts to global prices. Much of this is transported using a so-called shadow fleet of vessels operating outside of the Western maritime industry.
The bloc is expected to list more than 40 ships in Russia’s shadow fleet this week, bringing the total to about 600 vessels.

During the hearing, none of the accused appeared despite repeated summons. Taking notice of their continuous absence, the court initiated proclamation proceedings against all three and adjourned the hearing.
A case has been registered against CM Afridi and others at Ramna police station over their alleged involvement in the November 26 protest.
Earlier, the same court had initiated similar proceedings against the chief minister and other accused in another case registered at Noon police station.

Meanwhile, in a separate development, ATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra issued notices on a petition filed by PTI lawyers seeking the removal of terrorism provisions from a case related to alleged violence against Khawar Manika during proceedings of a marriage case pertaining to the Iddat period.
During the hearing, senior lawyer Babar Awan appeared on behalf of the PTI lawyers and submitted a petition under Section 23, requesting the abolition of terrorism charges from the case. The court issued notices on the petition and directed all parties to present arguments at the next hearing.
Further proceedings were adjourned until January 16. The case involving alleged violence against Khawar Manika has been registered against PTI lawyers at Ramna police station.

A SCREEN grab from a viral video shows Bihar CM Nitish Kumar pulling down the veil of a doctor, who came to receive a certificate.

NEW DELHI: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar invited criticism from the opposition on Tuesday after he pulled off a woman doctor’s hijab at a graduation ceremony.
Opening himself up to more questions about his mental health a month after taking oath as the Bihar chief minister for the 10th time, Kumar was seen in a widely shared video clip as pulling a hijab down from the woman’s face during a government event in Patna.
The video clip shows the 74-year-old politician handing a certificate to an AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) doctor during the event on Monday and motioning to her to remove her hijab.
Before the woman could react, Kumar is seen reaching out and pulling down the hijab, exposing her mouth and chin.

Nitish Kumar’s act of pulling down woman’s face covering draws condemnation, raises questions about his mental health

The moment appeared to catch the woman off guard. Two men, including Bihar’s Home Minister Samrat Choudhary, half-heartedly attempted to stop Kumar, while others on stage laughed, treating the moment as an awkward joke rather than a violation.
The clip has sparked widespread outrage across India and Pakistan, with social media users, activists and commentators demanding an apology, as well as the resignation of the 74-year-old chief minister.

For many, the incident has become less about one man’s lapse in judgment and more about the normalisation of disrespect toward Muslims in India.
Terming Kumar’s act “vile”, the Congress party said he should resign from the chief minister’s post, while the former chief minister Lalu Yadav’s party said it was wondering whether this was proof of his mental health deteriorating.
Weeks before the Bihar elections in November, which Mr. Kumar’s JDU party and the BJP swept, he had come under fire after a video of him garlanding a woman at a public meeting had gone viral. A JDU MP, who tried to stop him from doing so, was rebuked by the chief minister.
Infuriated, Zaira Wasim, a former Indian actor, demanded an “unconditional apology” from Kumar. “A woman’s dignity and modesty are not props to toy with”, she wrote.
Politician Priyanka Chaturvedi said that she wouldn’t be surprised if the woman were to say that “she is okay about it”, as she will be one facing consequences regardless.
Member of the Lok Sabha, Aga Syed Ruhullah Mehdi, called for an apology, labelling it an “indefensible” and “deeply disturbing” act.
He also highlighted that the CM should be stepping down from his role after this “erratic” behaviour, questioning his mental ability.
Fact-checker Mohammed Zubair wrote on X: “Even Deputy CM tried to stop him. He wouldn’t have done this if he was in his sense[s]. There are several such videos of him behaving awkwardly.”







Iltija Mehbooba Mufti, daughter of former held Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, told the Press Trust of India: “Just because you’re the CM, it doesn’t mean you can pull off a woman’s hijab. Power doesn’t give you the right to humiliate Muslims. If you’re not well, please step down.”
Her mother also weighed in, tweeting: “Does one attribute it to old age or the normalisation of humiliating Muslims publicly. The fact that people around him watched this horrific incident unfold as some form of an entertainment is even more unsettling.”







Former Indian cricket team captain Mohammad Azharuddin, who currently serves as the Minister for Minority Welfare in Telangana state, told PTI: “Very sad to see this. A head of the state behaving in such a manner is unacceptable, and nobody should do this, not even someone in such a position. What has been done is a very bad act, and it is strongly condemned. Such actions should not be repeated, and appropriate action must be taken, because when the head behaves this way, it gives a wrong signal and encourages others in the state to do the same.”

In a series of 11 interviews with author Chris Whipple conducted over Trump’s first year back in office, Wiles, the first woman to serve as White House chief of staff, described the teetotaling president as having “an alcoholic’s personality” and an eye for vengeance against perceived enemies.







She also said Vice President J D Vance has “been a conspiracy theorist for a decade” and described his shift from Trump critic to supporter as “sort of political”, motivated by his Senate campaign rather than principle.
In a post on X, Wiles called the Vanity Fair story “a disingenuously framed hit piece on me and the finest president, White House staff, and cabinet in history”, saying it omitted important context and selectively quoted her to create a negative narrative.







White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt also responded on X, saying Wiles is a loyal and trusted adviser to Trump, and the administration fully supports her.







Vance defended Wiles, telling reporters in Pennsylvania that he admires her consistency and authenticity both in and out of the president’s presence. “I’ve never seen her be disloyal to the president of the United States and that makes her the best White House chief of staff the president could ask for,” he said.

According to Susie Wiles, the magazine omitted context and quoted her selectively to create a ‘negative narrative’

In the interviews, Susie Wiles took aim at the way billionaire Elon Musk dismantled the US Agency for International Development and how Attorney General Pam Bondi initially responded to the planned release of the Jeffrey Epstein files.
Wiles said she warned Trump against pardoning the most violent participants in the Jan 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol and pressed him to delay his decision on sweeping trade tariffs, but was unable to change his mind in either case.
She said the administration should have applied greater scrutiny to the deportation of immigrants in the country illegally to avoid errors.
“He has an alcoholic’s personality,” Wiles said of Trump, explaining that her upbringing with an alcoholic father prepared her for managing “big personalities”. Trump does not drink, she noted, but operates with “a view that there’s nothing he can’t do. Nothing, zero, nothing”.
In the interviews, Wiles said Bondi “completely whiffed” her early handling of the Epstein files, an issue that upset Trump’s right-wing base.
Bondi had initially suggested she was going to release incriminating information about Epstein’s alleged network of acquaintances but then backed off.
Bondi said on X that Wiles works tirelessly to advance Trump’s agenda with loyalty, adding that any effort to sow division within the administration would not succeed and that the team remains united.







Susie Wiles said in the interviews that she had read the Epstein documents and acknowledged that Trump’s name is in them, but that “he’s not in the file doing anything awful”.
Trump’s push to have New York Attorney General Letitia James prosecuted on allegations of mortgage fraud was perhaps motivated by feelings of vengeance against the Democratic official, Wiles said.
The case against James, a Trump critic, “was maybe the one retribution”, Wiles said. She added that while Trump may not wake up thinking about retribution, “when there’s an opportunity, he will go for it”.

• Negotiations continue on ISF mandate as Pakistan warns against Israeli violations• US media reports no one has come forward yet as Washington pushes states to step up
WASHINGTON: Pakis­tan and several other Muslim nations are seeking clarity on the mandate of the proposed International Stabili­sation Force (ISF) for Gaza, even as the United States accelerates efforts to advance a strategy aimed at managing postwar security in the devastated territory.
The issue came into sharper focus on Tuesday, when Pakistan urged the full implementation of relevant UN Security Council resolutions and warned that continued Israeli settlement expansion and military actions were rapidly eroding the viability of the two-state solution.
Addressing a Security Council briefing on the Middle East under Resolution 2334, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, said the Palestinian people had endured “decades of illegal occupation marked by dispossession and denial of their inalienable rights,” with Gaza’s situation deteriorating to an “unprecedented scale” over the past two years.
His remarks followed reports earlier the same day that Israel had issued new demolition orders for the Nur Shams refugee camp in the northern occupied West Bank, effective this week — a development a senior official of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) described as “more devastating news”.
The diplomatic push coincided with parallel discussions outside the UN. On Tuesday, US Central Command hosted a conference in Qatar bringing together dozens of partner nations to discuss plans for the ISF. US media reports earlier this week said the Trump administration was seeking to assemble a multinational force of around 10,000 troops, potentially under the command of a US general, which could take much of the next year.
The Wall Street Journal reported that while Washington was pressing other countries to contribute troops, “none have stepped forward yet”. “There is deep sensitivity about legitimacy,” a diplomat in Washington explained. “No country wants its troops to be seen as imposing security rather than supporting peace.”
Adding to the debate, the Washington-based Stimson Centre released a report on Tuesday cautioning the Trump administration that many countries were reluctant to provide troops for a Gaza security force, but that incorporating UN expertise and frameworks could help ease those fears. The idea of grounding any stabilisation force in a UN-mandated structure has also been advocated by Pakistan and several Arab and Muslim states during earlier UN deliberations.
Diplomats familiar with the talks say a central concern is avoiding a security vacuum following the ceasefire. Speed of deployment is therefore seen as critical. Officials say the ISF would need pre-positioned resources, streamlined command arrangements and political authorisation in advance to ensure it can move quickly once an agreement is reached.
Operational effectiveness is another key issue. Planners argue that the force would require robust logistical support, intelligence-sharing mechanisms and freedom of movement across Gaza. Force protection has also emerged as a major challenge. Gaza’s dense urban environment and the presence of armed factions pose significant risks to any international deployment. Officials stress that clear rules of engagement, adequate defensive capabilities and sustained political backing would be essential to safeguard personnel.
Negotiations are also continuing over the scope of the ISF’s mandate. While details remain unresolved, diplomats say it could include monitoring ceasefire compliance, supporting local security arrangements and facilitating humanitarian access. The extent to which the force would be authorised to use force remains highly sensitive, with some states advocating a robust mandate and others urging strict restraint.
Sustained political and financial backing from major powers is widely viewed as indispensable. Analysts note that past international missions have faltered when support from key capitals waned. “A stabilisation force cannot succeed if it becomes politically isolated or underfunded,” a former UN peacekeeping official said.
Humanitarian access is expected to be a core objective of such a deployment. Aid agencies have repeatedly warned that insecurity and restrictions have severely hampered relief operations in Gaza. Diplomats say a stabilisation force could help create conditions for large-scale humanitarian deliveries and early reconstruction, particularly in heavily damaged areas.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan will roll out a locally developed secure messaging app, ‘Beep’, for government employees in the coming months, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecom was informed on Tuesday.
The committee was told that the app — inspired by the Chinese platform WeChat — is almost ready for launch and is expected to meet its project deadline of June 30, 2026.
National Information Technology Board (NITB) Chief Executive Faisal Iqbal Ratyal said Beep had been developed locally and certified by relevant government agencies for official use.
Committee Chairman Syed Aminul Haque directed the NITB to ensure the timely rollout of the application.
“The purpose of launching Beep is to provide a secure messaging platform for public sector employees nationwide,” Mr Ratyal told the committee. He said the launch would take place in phases, starting with federal ministries and attached departments.
He added that the rollout was expected to begin within the next two months and that the app would be integrated with Pakistan’s federal e-Office system, enabling secure messaging, document sharing and workflow coordination within government institutions.
According to the NITB, Beep will offer end-to-end encryption for text messages as well as video calls used by government officials.
Committee members raised concerns about data security and the protection of official communications, citing recent global incidents that underscored vulnerabilities in digital platforms. Mr Ratyal stressed that additional security features had been incorporated and that Beep’s encryption standards had been strengthened to make it suitable for sensitive discussions.

 

On operational costs, the NITB chief said the platform would operate on a usage-based fee model and efforts were under way to make it financially self-sustaining over time.
Secretary IT told the committee that revenue generation was not the primary objective and that the main priority remained secure, efficient and reliable communication across state institutions. The committee was also informed that the National Computer Emergency Response Team (NCERT) had formally cleared the application for official deployment.
Members noted that WhatsApp, owned by Meta, remains the most widely used platform for voice calls, video calls and media sharing, but its data servers are located outside the country. Officials said Beep’s servers would be based in Pakistan, with stricter security safeguards inspired by WeChat.
The committee was also briefed that the federal e-Office system had been introduced to reduce paperwork and improve transparency, and that integrating Beep was expected to strengthen internal coordination and reduce operational risks.
PTA claim ‘incomprehensible’
In a separate discussion, lawmakers expressed a lack of confidence in Pakistan’s internet and telecom services and rejected the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority’s claim of 99 per cent user satisfaction.
Mr Haque challenged the PTA’s data presented in its Quality of Service report, which stated that mobile signal satisfaction stood at 99pc nationwide. Committee members unanimously rejected the figure, saying frequent internet slowdowns and weak mobile signals contradicted the regulator’s assessment. They described the claim as incomprehensible given prevailing conditions.
Committee member Sadiq Memon criticised the report and questioned the seriousness of the regulator’s approach, calling the findings “ridiculous” and warning that the gap between official reporting and public experience was widening.
Sharmila Faruqui questioned the methodology used by the PTA to compile its surveys and called for future Quality of Service assessments to be conducted by independent third parties rather than the regulator itself. She said external audits were necessary to improve credibility and ensure transparency.
The committee also recalled its earlier direction that the 5G spectrum auction be held in Pakistani rupees and that spectrum prices should not be set unnecessarily high. It directed that any discount or concession granted to telecom operators during the auction should be strictly linked to network and infrastructure improvements.
The committee also expressed concern over the absence of the director general of the Special Communications Organisation (SCO) for the third consecutive meeting.

So far this year around 2.5 million Afghans have returned to the country, the UN’s special representative Georgette Gagnon told a Security Council briefing in New York last week.
That represents “a six per cent population increase, compounding the deep-rooted economic, climate and humanitarian crises the country already faces”, she said.
Citing Afghanistan’s “deepening humanitarian crisis”, Amnesty said there is an increased “real risk of serious harm for returnees”.

 

The organisation said that nations must comply with international law that “prohibits the forcible return of anyone to a place where they face a real risk of grave human rights violations”.
Generations of Afghans have fled to Pakistan and Iran over decades of successive wars, meaning that many young people have never lived in the country.
But Pakistan and Iran began forcing them to leave in recent years, with Islamabad alleging the population includes “terrorists and criminals”.
Amnesty also cited media reports that “Germany, Austria, and the European Union are in negotiations with the de facto Taliban authorities to facilitate forced returns”.
Many of the newcomers to Afghanistan are shunned and unable to find jobs, while women and girls face severe restrictions under the Taliban.
“This rush to forcibly return people to Afghanistan ignores why they fled in the first place and the serious dangers they face if sent back,” said Smriti Singh, Amnesty’s South Asia director.

Imran’s sisters, party workers and supporters had staged a sit-in at Factory Naka, demanding their court-mandated meeting with the PTI founder.
A court order issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on March 24 this year mandated that meetings with Imran would be permitted twice a week, on Tuesdays and Thursdays. However, the PTI maintains that the order is not being honoured.
Despite the IHC’s order, Imran’s sisters — Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Khan Niazi — along with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, have tried and failed to meet Imran over the past several weeks. Last Tuesday, after being denied a meeting with the PTI chief, his sisters and party supporters staged a sit-in, which was later dispersed with water cannons.
Early on Wednesday, water cannons were again used to disperse the protesters, with police starting their operation at 2am. Initially, water cannon vehicles were used to disperse the protesters, with police later baton-charging those who remained.
Some of the party workers were arrested but the number could not be confirmed.
Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir, who remained at the protest until late Tuesday night, condemned the inhuman treatment meted out to the protesters.
Meanwhile, in a post on social media platform X at 4am on Wednesday, the party’s central information department said that it condemned “in the harshest possible terms” the disregard of the IHC order and the “extreme state brutality” witnessed outside Adiala jail.
“These actions are not merely administrative failures; they constitute a direct assault on the Constitution, the rule of law, and the authority of the judiciary,” the party said, adding that the “willful defiance of judicial orders has effectively become official government policy”.







“At the behest of the government, the Punjab police crossed all limits of oppression by launching an assault using chemical-laced water cannons against Imran Khan’s sisters, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, other party leaders, PTI workers, and peaceful sit-in participants,” the party said.
“There was no emergency situation, no legal justification, and no provocation whatsoever. Despite this, women, elderly individuals, and peaceful protesters were subjected to chemical-infused water, physical violence, and the forcible arrest of multiple workers. This represents a textbook case of fascism, police brutality, and political victimisation at its worst,” it added.
The PTI said that such actions “clearly reflect the panic, insecurity, and moral bankruptcy of a deeply frightened government”. It further said that such “oppression, repression, and fascism cannot last forever”.
“History bears witness that no matter how powerful tyranny may appear, it ultimately meets its end. The day will surely come when those responsible for these unconstitutional, illegal, and inhumane actions will be held fully accountable,” it added.
A video posted by the party on X showed a water cannon being used to disperse what appeared to be protesters as a large contingent of police stood on the side.







Another video posted by a party showed what appeared to be a drenched protester, saying that his “chest was burning” and his eyes were also affected.







In a separate video, Aleema, whose clothes were also drenched, looked at her hands and said, “They used a chemical, it is [burning] so much.”







“Poisonous, chemical-laced water was used,” party lawyer Naeem Panjutha said on X. He said that the water cannon was unleashed on the protesters, including Imran’s sisters and others.
“I myself fell; many workers fell; several were also arrested,” he said.







During the sit-in, some of the demonstrators had scrawled pro-PTI messaging on the walls of petrol pumps and other structures near the protest site. Some of the messages included the number “804”, which is reportedly Imran’s prisoner number.

‘Have no other option left besides protesting’
On Tuesday, Imran’s sisters had marched toward the prison before being stopped. Speaking to a reporter as she marched, Aleema said, “We will sit wherever we are stopped”.
When asked if she had prepared for the deployment of water cannons or a prolonged sit-in, she replied that she had brought warm clothes and a blanket, showing the latter on camera.







Speaking to reporters, Aleema stated that this occurred every Tuesday at the same location, maintaining that the protesters were not engaging in any illegal or unconstitutional activities.
“We have no other option left besides protesting,” she said. “Our founder’s demand is the restoration of the Constitution, democracy and the rule of law.”
She claimed that the judiciary had been stripped of independence, unemployment was rising due to the stoppage of trade with Afghanistan and that the security situation was deteriorating.
Referring to her sister Uzma’s brief meeting with Imran on December 2 and the government’s claim of “political conversations” that violated jail rules, Aleema urged the government to inform the family what was discussed.
“Tell me what political matters my sister discussed in the last meeting. Political topics should be discussed with the people of the party,” she said.
Asked about a recent AI (artificial intelligence)-generated image of Imran in prison, which went viral, Aleema acknowledged she was not aware of artificial intelligence, but maintained that he looked the same as the person in the photograph as recently as October.
“Until two months ago, when we used to go visit the jail, the founder used to look exactly like this,” she said. “It may be AI, but it is the right AI.
“I don’t know what the prison looks like from the inside, but I can say that Imran Khan looked like this on October 16, the last time we met,” Aleema added.
She said that Imran told Uzma during their meeting that “the mental torture is far worse than the physical torture” and that he is being kept in solitary confinement.
“They think he will break, but Imran Khan is a man with faith in God. He will not break,” Aleema emphasised. “Imran Khan has said he is ready to accept death, but he will not be subdued by cruelty and injustice.”
She added that the government wants Imran to cut a deal with them, but insisted that he is not imprisoned for himself, but for the supremacy of the Constitution and rule of law.
Naeem Haider Panjhuta, Imran’s spokesperson on legal affairs, filmed a video from the site of the sit-in, showing crowds of PTI workers staging the demonstration into this evening.
“We are waiting for a meeting with Khan sahib. Today is the designated day for family and lawyers to meet him,” he said. “They are not letting us meet him, despite the IHC court order and visits being permitted in the jail manual.”







PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, who was also present at the sit-in, urged everyone to come and join the demonstration and express solidarity with the sisters of the party founder.
“This is not only the job of the assembly members,” he said. “How can these people (the government) tell someone what they can and cannot discuss in a meeting?”
However, the party’s secretary general gave a fiery response to a question, asking, “Do you think 20-30,000 people can overthrow a system that has been in place for the past 78 years?
“We are calling out to the entire nation. We do not want to carry on this drama for another day, after which people will die,” Raja said. “We will make a conscious effort and will not submit to pressure.”
He added that people’s consciences need to be shaken to ensure Imran’s release and said that the moment would come when hundreds of thousands of people would take to the streets.







Meanwhile, Noreen Niazi told reporters that the PTI is a peaceful political party and claimed that they had been “injured” by the water cannons deployed last week.
She added that they would “do whatever is necessary to free Imran Khan” and maintained that he was unlawfully imprisoned.







Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of his wife. Imran’s son, Kasim Khan, expressed fear during a December 1 interview that authorities are concealing “something irreversible” about his father’s condition.
However, Uzma Khanum, Imran’s sister, said on December 2 that her incarcerated brother was “perfectly fine” after she was allowed to meet him, putting to rest rumours surrounding the former premier’s health.
In a short talk with the media after the meeting, she said: “Imran Khan’s health is perfectly fine. However, he was very angry and said that they are subjecting him to mental torture.”
She added that Imran was confined to his cell throughout the day and was allowed only a short time outside. Uzma further said that he was not in communication with anyone, and the meeting between them lasted around 30 minutes.
Last Friday, a United Nations special rapporteur warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment and called on Pakistani authorities to comply with international norms and standards.
Expressing grave concern over the report, the party said it exposed the “degrading treatment” of party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan during his incarceration at Adiala Jail and amounted to a “blatant violation of international law and fundamental human rights.”</p><small>2025-12-17 02:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961621/transporters-hold-firm-as-talks-continue' target='_blank'><strong>Transporters hold firm as talks continue</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Amid negotiations between goods transporters and government departments to resolve a nationwide strike that has entered its 10th day, industrialists warned on Tuesday that each passing day was adding billions of rupees in trade and export losses.
Transporters said talks were underway with representatives of the federal and Punjab governments and relevant departments, including the ministries of ports and shipping and communications, the motorway pol­i­ce, the National Highway Autho­rity (NHA) and senior officials of the Fede­ral Board of Revenue (FBR) and Customs. They claimed the federal and Punjab governments had ackno­wledged that their demands were justified.
The negotiations were continuing late into the night and were ongoing at the time of going to press, officials said.
Earlier, transporters said the strike would continue until their dema­nds were accepted. The Transp­orters’ Goods Association (TGA) also told a Sindh government committee at the Commissioner’s Office in Karachi that the shutdown would remain in place until issues raised in its charter of demands were addressed. The demands include designated parking for goods carriers near Karachi Port Trust (KPT), and matters related to licensing and the plying of 25- to 30-year-old vehicles.

Industrialists urge PM to end goods transport shutdown as containers pile up

Patron-in-chief of the Pakistan
Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMEA) Muhammad Jawed Bilwani described the halt in port activity as “economic sabotage” and said the strike had disrupted the national supply chain, pushing exports and imports towards a standstill.
He warned that exporters were being forced to consider costly and risky air consignments to meet delivery schedules and insisted that continued inaction could cause “heavy and irreparable” damage to the economy.
Mr Bilwani said port operations had come to a halt, leaving thousands of export and import containers stranded, while several hundred containers already loaded on vessels remained at sea, awaiting berthing space.
He cited Pakistan’s average daily exports at $92 million and monthly exports at $2.849 billion, adding that the textile sector alone accounted for $52m in daily exports and around $1.617bn per month.
He urged the prime minister to take notice and intervene to end the strike, saying it was necessary to protect exports and domestic commerce from further damage.
Atif Ikram Sheikh, president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), said the transport strike was having serious negative consequences and freight forwarding at ports had been severely affected. He said imported goods were stuck at ports and exporters were unable to dispatch orders on time.
Korangi Association of Trade and Industry (KATI) President Muhammad Ikram Rajput said the delay in resolving issues between transporters and authorities had become unbearable for the industry. He said businesses were already grappling with high energy costs, elevated interest rates and weak demand, and the collapse of transport services had added further pressure.
Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PLGMEA) Chairman Nadeem Bukhari said that while efforts to improve road safety and regulatory compliance were welcome, the sudden disruption in freight movement had created significant operational challenges for export-oriented industries.
Medicine supplies disrupted
The strike has also begun disrupting the supply of essential medicines across the country, with shortages reported in several cities and towns as pharmaceutical products from major manufacturing hubs fail to reach pharmacies, medical stores and healthcare facilities, industry and market representatives said.
They said medicines produced in Karachi and Lahore were not being transported to other parts of the country, warning that a prolonged disruption could create serious difficulties for patients, particularly those suffering from chronic illnesses.
Tauqeerul Haq of the Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said pharmaceutical companies had received reports of shortages from different regions as manufacturers were unable to dispatch products from industrial centres.
He said stocks of medicines used for diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases and mental health conditions were running low, while demand had risen due to a flu outbreak. He added that many manufacturers had slowed or stopped production as warehouses reached capacity and finished goods could not be moved, while raw materials required for production were also failing to reach factories.
Abdul Samad Budhani, chairman of the Pakistan Chemists and Druggists Association, also stressed that transporters were not delivering medicines to different parts of the country and pharmacists were receiving complaints from patients unable to find essential drugs.
Balochistan has been the worst-affected province, according to Malik Roohullah Kakar, president of the Medicines Traders Association of Balochistan. He said that around 80 per cent of medicines used in the province are supplied from Karachi, and the transporters’ strike had led to shortages in Quetta and other towns across Balochistan.

He was 86 years old.
Asif said the veteran politician died after a prolonged illness and is survived by three sons and four daughters.
His grandson, columnist Hassan Kamal Wattoo, also posted about the former CM’s demise on social media platform X.
“With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of my beloved grandfather, Mian Manzoor Ahmad Wattoo,” he said, adding that funeral prayers would be held at the Wasawewala stadium in Okara at 2pm tomorrow.







President Asif Ali Zardari expressed deep grief over his demise, a post on the Presidency’s X account said.
It added that the president paid tribute to Wattoo’s “invaluable public service, role in strengthening democracy, and contributions to national unity”.







State-run APP reported that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condoled his death, saying in a statement that “services of late Manzoor Wattoo for the country’s politics will always be remembered”.
The deceased politician belonged to the PPP and also served as federal minister for Kashmir affairs during the 2008-2013 PPP-led coalition government.
Wattoo’s profile
Wattoo hailed from Deepalpur in Punjab’s Okara district and had decades of experience in politics. He was born on August 14, 1939.
The politician was first elected chairman of the Okara district council in 1983 and became a member of the Punjab Assembly in 1985. He was also elected speaker of the assembly at the time.
In 1988, Wattoo was again elected as an MPA (independent) and soon joined the Nawaz Sharif-led Pakistan Muslim League (PML), which was part of Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) at the time. This time too, Wattoo became speaker of the house.
In 1990, he was elected as MNA and MPA from the IJI’s platform but opted to remain in Punjab, becoming speaker for the third time in a row.
In April 1993, the province saw a week of political wheeling and dealing, centring primarily around Wattoo’s manoeuvres to win over a majority of PML lawmakers and replace then-chief minister Ghulam Haider Wyne. Wattoo’s power grab had been triggered by the April 18, 1993, dismissal of the first Nawaz Sharif government in Islamabad, by then-president Ghulam Ishaq Khan, on charges of corruption and under Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution.
The motive behind Wattoo’s move was to strengthen his hold in Punjab against Nawaz ahead of the National Assembly polls, scheduled for July. As many as 151 out of around 220 PML lawmakers — in a house of 248 — deserted the party, voted out Wyne, and installed Wattoo in his place.
The PPP’s support also played a role in Wattoo’s election as the chief minister. The party, which had been unable to recapture Punjab, had to accept Wattoo as chief minister in exchange for the PML-Junejo’s support for it in Islamabad.

 

Later, the PML would split into two new factions: one led by Nawaz and the other, PML-Junejo, by Wattoo in Punjab and Hamid Nasir Chattha at the Centre, following the demise of its president, Mohammad Khan Junejo.
After Wattoo had a fallout with PPP in 1995, then-prime minister Benazir Bhutto installed Arif Nakai, another PML-Junejo man, as the new chief minister.
The same year, Wattoo formed PML-Jinnah after parting ways with Chattha, who wanted to become the PML-Junejo president.
In 1996, Wattoo became MNA from the PML-Jinnah platform. He faced corruption references and was convicted in a case. Wattoo was in jail for a few months and was later moved to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology on health grounds. His hospital room was declared sub-jail and he stayed there for over two years.
After his acquittal, he joined Pakistan Muslim League – Quaid (PML-Q) during the regime of former military ruler Pervez Musharraf. He was considered to be a close friend of the former president and had agreed to merge his PML-Jinnah into PML-Q on Musharraf’s advice.
He later joined PPP just after getting elected as an independent candidate in the 2008 general election, which he won from both NA-146 (Okara-IV) and NA-147 (Okara-V). Wattoo decided to retain the NA-146 seat and his son Khurram Jehangir was later elected on a PPP ticket in the by-election for NA-147.
Wattoo was made PPP’s central Punjab president in October 2012. He also served as federal minister for Kashmir affairs during the 2008-2013 PPP-led coalition government.
Wattoo was known for being a master of the art of carving his way out to important positions in nearly every setup and his elevation to the PPP’s command in Punjab was shocking to many among the party’s provincial cadre.
Wattoo joined the PTI in September 2018, after he violated the PPP discipline by contesting the July 25 general election as an independent candidate against the party nominee.
He had made seat adjustment at the local level with the PTI candidate in a bid to win, but in vain.
Last year, he had rejoined the PPP.</p><small>2025-12-16 22:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639827-33-magnitude-earthquake-hits-balochistans-panjgur' target='_blank'><strong>3.3-magnitude earthquake hits Balochistan's Panjgur</strong></a><br><p>

Mahboob Ali told Dawn that she was part of an international expedition organised by Elite Exped, which departed from Pakistan on December 2. It reached Union Glacier on December 6 and she completed her journey on December 14.
In a post on her Facebook page, Baig said she was “deeply grateful and humbled” to have successfully skied to the last degree of the South Pole, part of her pursuit of the Explorer’s Grand Slam.
“This ski journey has never been accomplished by any Pakistani in the past. It has been one of the most challenging and meaningful experiences of my life, and it is still difficult to put into words,” she wrote.
“From standing on the summit of Mount Everest in 2013 to completing the Seven Summits, the highest mountains on each continent, from climbing K2 and Nanga Parbat to now reaching the South Pole, this journey has taken me across the highest mountains and the most remote places on Earth,” Baig added.
“Every step along the way has taught me patience, resilience, and the power of belief.”
She further wrote that the journey, though difficult, “has been about trusting the dream, staying committed through uncertainty, and continuing to move forward even when the path feels impossible”.
The mountaineer expressed hope that her efforts would remind others, particularly women, that dreams are worth pursuing, regardless of how long they take.
“Carrying the flag of Pakistan and my Ismaili flag across mountains, continents, and polar ice has been the greatest honour of my life. I remain grateful for every opportunity, every lesson, and every person who walked this path with me,” she said.
Baig expressed gratitude to her community members for funding the expedition and thanked her team, her family, fellow mountaineer Nirmal Purja and Elite Expeditions for their support.
“Without their trust, encouragement, and kindness, this journey would not have been possible.”
Namira Salim, also known as Pakistan’s first astronaut to have gone into space, is the first Pakistani to have reached the North and South Pole. She is also the recipient of the Tamgha-i-Imtiaz (2011) for her achievements in adventure sports.
Baig, who hails from the remote village of Shimshal, became the first Pakistani woman to scale Mount Everest in 2013. She also holds the unique record of being the first Pakistani to climb the Seven Summits — Everest, Kilimanjaro, McKinley, Mont Blanc, Elbrus, Aconcagua, Vinson and Puncak Jaya.
In 2010, she became the first to ascend the virgin peak Chashkin Sar (above 6,000m), now called the ‘Samina Peak’. She conquered another virgin peak in 2011, which was named ‘Koh-i-Brobar’ or ‘Mount Equality’.
In 2023, she and fellow mountaineer Naila Kiani became the first Pakistani women to summit the 8,125-metre-tall mountain Nanga Parbat — the world’s ninth-highest peak.
In 2022, she summited K2 along with her team, just three hours before Kiani reached the peak.</p><small>2025-12-16 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/162354371e10631.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961437/police-confirm-bondi-gunman-was-from-indias-hyderabad-family-claims-no-knowledge-of-his-radicalisation' target='_blank'><strong>Police confirm Bondi gunman was from India’s Hyderabad; family claims no knowledge of his radicalisation</strong></a><br><p>Indian police said on Tuesday that one of the gunmen in Australia’s Bondi Beach shooting, Sajid Akram, was originally from the southern Indian city of Hyderabad but had limited contact with his family in India.
The death toll in one of Australia’s worst mass shootings stands at 16, including 50-year-old Akram, who was shot by police. The man’s 24-year-old son and alleged accomplice, identified by local media as Naveed Akram, was in critical condition in hospital after also being shot.
Hyderabad is the capital of Telangana state. Australian police said both men had travelled to the Philippines last month, the father on an Indian passport and the son on an Australian one.
“The family members have expressed no knowledge of his radical mindset or activities, nor of the circumstances that led to his radicalisation,” Telangana state police said in a statement.
The purpose of the trip is under investigation, officials said, adding it was not conclusive whether they were linked to any terrorist group or whether they received training in that country.
Telangana police said the factors that led to the radicalisation of the two gunmen “appear to have no connection with India or any local influence in Telangana”.
In its statement on Tuesday, Telangana police said Sajid Akram visited India on six occasions, mainly for family-related reasons, since he migrated to Australia in 1998.
There was no “adverse record” on him before he left India, the statement added.

Police added that Sajid Akram had got a degree in commerce in Hyderabad, the large and bustling tech and pharma hub that is the state capital.
Akram then moved to Australia in November 1998 to find work and married a woman described as of European origin, with whom he had a son and a daughter.
Sajid and his son Naveed, who allegedly killed 15 people and wounded dozens of others at a Hanukkah celebration on Sydney’s Bondi Beach, arrived on November 1 with the southern Philippine province of Davao listed as their final destination.
The father and son spent nearly the entire month of November in the Philippines, Manila’s immigration department confirmed on Tuesday, with the father entering the country as an Indian national.
“Sajid Akram, 50, Indian national, and Naveed Akram, 24, Australian national, arrived in the Philippines together last November 1, 2025 from Sydney, Australia,” immigration spokeswoman Dana Sandoval told AFP, adding they departed on November 28.
Australian police said on Tuesday both men had travelled to the Philippines last month and the purpose of the trip is under investigation. Philippines police have said they are investigating the matter.

 

Islamic State-linked networks are known to operate in the Philippines and have wielded some influence in the south of the country. They have been reduced to weakened cells operating in the southern Mindanao island in recent years, far from the scale of influence they wielded during the 2017 Marawi siege.
“Early indications point to a terrorist attack inspired by Islamic State, allegedly committed by a father and son,” Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said at a news conference.
“These are the alleged actions of those who have aligned themselves with a terrorist organisation, not a religion.”

 

Police also said the vehicle which is registered to the younger male contained improvised explosive devices and two homemade flags associated with ISIS, or Islamic State, a militant group designated by Australia and many other countries as a terrorist organisation.
The father and son allegedly fired upon hundreds of people at the festival during a roughly 10-minute killing spree at one of Australia’s top tourist destinations, forcing people to flee and take shelter before both were shot by police.
Some 25 survivors are receiving care in several Sydney hospitals, officials said.
Australian PM says ‘Islamic State ideology’ drove Bondi Beach gunmen
The father and son were driven by “Islamic State ideology” when they fired on crowds at Bondi Beach, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday.
“It would appear that this was motivated by Islamic State ideology,” Albanese told national broadcaster ABC.
“With the rise of ISIS more than a decade ago now, the world has been grappling with extremism and this hateful ideology,” he said in a separate interview.
Albanese said Naveed, reportedly an unemployed bricklayer, had come to the attention of Australia’s intelligence agency in 2019 but was not considered an imminent threat at the time.
“They interviewed him, they interviewed his family members, they interviewed people around him,” Albanese said.
“He was not seen at that time to be a person of interest.”
Memorial of flowers
Israeli Ambassador Amir Maimon visited Bondi on Tuesday and urged the Australian government to take all required steps to secure the lives of Jews in Australia.
“Only Australians of Jewish faith are forced to worship their gods behind closed doors, CCTV, guards,” Maimon told reporters in Bondi, after laying flowers at the temporary memorial and paying his respects to the victims.
“My heart is torn apart … it is insane.”
A string of anti-Semitic incidents in Australia has unfolded in the past 16 months, prompting the head of the nation’s main intelligence agency to declare that anti-Semitism was his top priority in terms of threat to life.
At Bondi, the beach was open on Tuesday but was largely empty under overcast skies, as a growing memorial of flowers was established at the Bondi Pavilion, metres from the location of the shootings.

Bondi is Sydney’s best-known beach, located about 8.2km (5 miles) from the city centre, and draws hundreds of thousands of international tourists each year.
Olivia Robertson, 25, visited the memorial before work.
“This is the country that our grandparents have come to for us to feel safe and to have opportunity,” she said.
“And now this has happened right here in our backyard. It’s pretty shocking.”
Ahmed al Ahmed, the 43-year-old Muslim father-of-two who charged at one of the gunmen and seized his rifle, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds.
He has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump.
A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$1.9 million ($1.26 million).







Tougher gun laws
Australia’s gun laws are now being examined by the federal government, after police said Sajid Akram was a licenced gun owner and had six registered weapons.
Akram received his gun licence in 2023, not 2015 as had been earlier stated, police said on Tuesday.
Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said gun laws introduced by the previous conservative Liberal-National coalition government following the Port Arthur massacre needed to be re-examined.
Former Liberal Prime Minister John Howard, who introduced the gun restrictions in 1996, said on Tuesday he didn’t want to see gun law reform become a “diversion” from the need to tackle anti-Semitism.
Albanese had let the Jewish community down, Howard told reporters.
“He should have done more to fight anti-Semitism, a lot more,” he said.
The 15 victims ranged from a rabbi who was a father of five, to a Holocaust survivor, to a 10-year-old girl named Matilda Britvan, according to interviews, officials and media reports.
Two police officers remained in critical but stable condition in hospital, New South Wales police said.
Matilda’s aunt has spoken publicly of her family’s heartbreak, saying they were devastated by her death.
“I am beyond belief that this happened. I look on the phone and I am hoping it’s like a little big joke, not real,” Lina Chernykh told 7NEWS Australia.</p><small>2025-12-16 18:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16233903b0bcd69.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961482/lawmakers-grill-trump-officials-on-us-alleged-drug-boat-strikes' target='_blank'><strong>Lawmakers grill Trump officials on US alleged drug boat strikes</strong></a><br><p>Donald Trump’s top national security officials faced a grilling from lawmakers Tuesday on US strikes against alleged drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific — operations that have raised alarms about escalating military force near Venezuela.
The House and Senate briefings, led by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, came amid mounting unease in Congress over the president’s widening campaign in waters off Latin America, and as lawmakers weigh measures to curb Trump’s authority to act without their approval.
US officials say the operations target narcotics bound for American shores.
Critics counter that the campaign — which has destroyed at least 26 boats and killed at least 95 people, according to US military figures — is legally ambiguous and strategically unclear.
The classified sessions preceded a possible Senate vote on resolutions aimed at restricting Trump from launching military action against Venezuela without congressional consent.
But Senate Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters as he left the room that the officials had offered nothing new.
“The administration came to this briefing empty handed… and if they can’t be transparent on this, how can you trust their transparency on all the other issues swirling about in the Caribbean?” Schumer said.
The boat strikes have drawn particular scrutiny over a September 2 operation in which US forces carried out a follow-up attack on a disabled boat, killing two survivors of the initial strike.
Lawmakers from both parties have demanded answers on the legal basis for that attack and why Congress has been denied full access to video footage, which so far has been shown only to a handful of senior lawmakers.
Schumer has warned that secrecy – combined with the presence of US troops and a carrier group in the region — risked dragging the country into another open-ended conflict.
He told reporters he reiterated the demand for every senator to be given access to the complete, unedited tape of the September 2 strike but was rebuffed.
‘Highly successful mission’
Rubio and Hegseth defended the “highly successful mission” as they left the briefing, and said the Pentagon would allow the House and Senate Armed Services Committees to view the video alongside the commander who ordered them, Admiral Frank Bradley.
“But, in keeping with longstanding… Department of Defense policy, we’re not going to release a top secret, full, unedited video of that to the general public,” Hegseth added.
Beyond the boat strikes, the administration has ratcheted up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro — deepening sanctions, deploying warships and aircraft near his coastline and seizing an oil tanker linked to Caracas.
Trump has declared that Maduro’s “days are numbered” and pointedly refused to rule out a US ground invasion.
Legal experts say the case highlights a central tension in Trump’s approach — that treating drug trafficking as an act of war may violate international law.
This week, Trump signed an executive order classifying fentanyl — which is stocked and administered by hospitals — as a “weapon of mass destruction,” an escalation supporters say reflects the gravity of the opioid crisis.
Specialists note, however, that most of the intercepted boats were believed to be carrying cocaine, not fentanyl.
Despite mounting scrutiny, the campaign shows no sign of slowing.
On Monday, the Pentagon said it had carried out fresh strikes against alleged drug boats in the Pacific, killing eight people described as “narco-terrorists.” The Senate briefing also follows last week’s dramatic US seizure of an oil tanker accused of transporting sanctioned Venezuelan fuel in a network linked to Iran.
Republican senator and staunch Trump ally Lindsey Graham said as he emerged from his briefing that the video was the least of his concerns, asserting that the September 2 strike was lawful.
“Most Americans want to know what’s going to happen next. I want to know what’s going to happen next. Is it the policy to take Maduro down? It should be, if it’s not. And if he goes, what’s going to happen next?”</p><small>2025-12-16 18:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16193915368c586.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961473/police-official-brother-martyred-in-gun-attack-in-kps-lakki-marwat' target='_blank'><strong>Police official, brother martyred in gun attack in KP’s Lakki Marwat</strong></a><br><p>A police official and his brother were martyred in a gun attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Tuesday.
The constable had completed his polio duty and was travelling to his village with his brother when motorcycle-riding terrorists opened fire near the Chwar Khel area, said a spokesperson for Lakki Marwat police.
The bodies of Amir Nawaz and Ameer Mohammad, siblings of former district councilor Ali Gul, were transferred to the district headquarters hospital.
Immediately after the incident, a heavy police contingent reached the scene and launched a search operation in the area to arrest the culprits.
The funeral prayers of the martyred constable and his brother were offered later in the evening
District Police Officer Nazir Khan, Deputy Commissioner Hamidullah Khan, SP Investigation Murad Ali Khan, along with other senior police and district administration officials, police personnel, and a large number of relatives of the martyrs, attended the funeral.
In another attack on a polio team in KP’s Bajaur, a constable and another person were martyred in Salarzai tehsil after unidentified assailants attacked a polio team as the nationwide polio campaign entered its second day.
On December 1, a cop was martyred while five others were injured in a suicide blast targeting a police mobile in KP’s Lakki Marwat district.
In November, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in KP’s Hangu.
As militant attacks in KP surge, the provincial police force had asked the government to grant a special allowance to its personnel, which would cost around Rs4.2 billion per month.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022. With the end of the ceasefire, the TPP had vowed to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.</p><small>2025-12-16 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16194945575a579.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961475/afghan-health-minister-reaches-new-delhi-for-official-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan health minister reaches New Delhi for official visit</strong></a><br><p>Afghanistan’s Minister for Public Health Noor Jalal Jalali on Tuesday reached the Indian capital of New Delhi on an official visit, the country’s health ministry said.
The visit marks the third by an Afghan official in the last three months, after Afghanistan’s Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Industry Minister Nooruddin Azizi visited New Delhi.
“The multi-day visit aims to strengthen bilateral health cooperation, promote the exchange of experience, and coordinate joint efforts,” said the Afghan health ministry.







According to the statement, Jalali is to hold separate meetings with Indian officials, particularly health authorities, and take part in several organised programmes.
“Discussions will also focus on capacity-building opportunities for Afghan health workers, the import of quality medicines into Afghanistan, medical equipment, and other related issues,” it said.
The visit comes after the Taliban-led government in Afghanistan barred the traders from importing pharmaceutical goods from Pakistan.
Randhir Jaiswal, the spokesperson of the Indian Ministry of External Affairs, confirmed the visit and extended a warm welcome to the Afghan delegation.







“The visit reflects India’s enduring support for Afghanistan’s healthcare system, and we look forward to productive discussions,” he said.
As Kabul’s relations with Islamabad deteriorated, the Taliban regime has sought closer ties with New Delhi.
The main issue between Islamabad and Kabul remains cross-border terrorism, with numerous attacks originating from Afghanistan and targeting security forces in Pakistan.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism and stop providing sanctuary to the TTP, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.</p><small>2025-12-16 17:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1621073809cacb6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961478/ecp-suspends-re-polling-at-22-polling-stations-of-na-251-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>ECP suspends re-polling at 22 polling stations of NA-251 in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday suspended the schedule for re-polling at 22 polling stations of NA-251 (Sherani-cum-Zhob-cum-Qila Saifullah), which was to take place on December 18.
A notification to this effect was issued a day after a two-member bench of the Supreme Court, comprising Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shehzad Ahmad Khan, suspended the election tribunal’s order of re-polling at the polling stations.
JUI-F’s candidate Syed Samiullah had won the seat in the 2024 general elections with a thin margin of less than 100 votes.
After hearing a petition filed by Pashtoonkhwa National Awami Party Chairman Khushhal Khan Kakar, who challenged the 2024 general election results, the election tribunal, headed by Justice Aamir Nawaz Rana, ordered re-polling at 22 polling stations on the grounds that Form-45s from the stations were missing.
The tribunal’s decision was challenged before the SC by JUI-F legislator Samiullah.
The SC bench issued the stay order against the re-polling, suspended the election tribunal’s ruling and adjourned further hearing of the case until the winter vacations of the SC were over.
JUI-F Senator Advocate Kamran Murtaza appeared before the court on behalf of Samiullah.
The election commission had de-notified Samiullah on December 4 in view of the election tribunal’s order of November 24.</p><small>2025-12-16 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16113520908469e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961446/all-20-passengers-kidnapped-by-dacoits-from-quetta-bound-bus-rescued-police' target='_blank'><strong>All 20 passengers kidnapped by dacoits from Quetta-bound bus rescued: police</strong></a><br><p>All 20 passengers abducted from a bus by Katcha area dacoits near Ubauro in Sindh’s Ghotki district have been recovered unharmed, the Sukkur Range Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) said later on Tuesday.
Around 25 dacoits had attacked the bus in Sadiqabad on Monday night and kidnapped several passengers after injuring the driver.
DIG Sukkur Range, Captain (retired) Faisal Abdullah Chachar, told Dawn that he reached Ghotki and led a large contingent of police personnel from different stations in Ghotki, Sukkur, Khairpur and Kashmore, along with Rangers officials.
DIG Chachar led the joint operation with other senior officers, including Ghotki Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Muhammad Anwar Khetran, Sukkur SSP Azhar Khan Mughal and Khairpur SSP Samiullah Soomro.
“We rescued all hostages unharmed from the clutches of the dacoits, with whom we engaged in a gunfight,” the DIG said.
All routes leading to the Katcha area were blocked in time by police, preventing the dacoits from taking the hostages deeper into the riverine area.
Meanwhile, the rescued hostages informed the police that two dacoits were injured during the operation.
When the police engaged the dacoits, a police constable sustained injuries to his hand. Police moved the wounded personnel to Rahim Yar Khan Hospital for treatment.
A police spokesperson confirmed to Dawn that a search operation against the dacoits is still ongoing.
When contacted by Dawn, the Rahim Yar Khan district police officer, said that the passengers were not kidnapped in his jurisdiction but from a section of the link road going through Guddu in Sindh.
“Sindh police have recovered all the hostages from the clutches of the armed dacoits,” he said.
Mirpur Mathelo Deputy Superintendent of Police Abdul Qadir Soomro told Dawn that earlier today, 14 passengers were initially recovered by the police; however, one of them died of a heart attack in a sugarcane field.
“The body of the deceased hostage was moved to Ubauro Hospital, while and two injured hostages were moved to the hospital for medical treatment,” he said.
An earlier statement from DIG Chachar said that 10 of the kidnapped passengers had been rescued in an initial overnight operation under his command.
The attack
According to some videos shared on social media after 9:30pm on Monday, a passenger said a Sadabahar Company coach departed for Quetta from Sadiqabad at 8pm.
When it reached near the Murid Shaikh area near M-5 Motorway, it took a turn towards Guddu at the Punjab-Sindh border. Some 65kms from the area, the dacoits intercepted the coach and started firing.
They entered the bus after smashing the windows and asked the passengers to leave the coach, but did not harm the female passengers.

 

Katcha is the area of land running along the Indus River, which is divided between Punjab and Sindh. The region is notorious for banditry.
For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur frequently.
PTI leader’s condemnation
PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh, in a statement, condemned Monday night’s incident and called into question the efficiency of Sindh and Punjab police.
“More than twenty citizens were kidnapped; now their bids will be put up,” he said, stressing that the rulers were “failing” to protect their citizens.
He noted that Katcha areas had been declared “no-go” areas. Sheikh called for the immediate release of all the hostages.</p><small>2025-12-16 17:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639774-two-year-old-dies-after-falling-into-sewage-pit-in-layyah' target='_blank'><strong>Two-year-old dies after falling into sewage pit in Layyah</strong></a><br><p>

The HRCP expressed grave concern over the “rapidly shrinking space for independent and critical news reporting in the country”, including the ban on government advertisements to the Dawn Media Group and its outlets.
The development comes as several media bodies have condemned the government’s unannounced restriction on advertisements to Dawn Media Group’s TV and radio outlets — imposed after curtailing ads to its flagship newspaper — and called on the authorities to immediately rescind the ban.
“The HRCP expresses grave concern over the rapidly shrinking space for independent and critical news reporting in the country, including the reported 13-month ban on government advertisements to the Dawn Media Group, which has recently been extended to Dawn News and CityFM89,” the commission said in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday.
“This is ironic, given that Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Dawn, championed press freedom,” it said.







The commission added that the selective withdrawal of state advertising, which constituted public funds, had increasingly been used as a “coercive instrument to pressure media organisations, influence editorial choices and penalise critical journalism”.
“We reiterate that freedom of expression and democratic accountability cannot survive where economic coercion is used to discipline the press,” it said.
The HRCP also urged the government to end such “discriminatory practices and restore an enabling environment for free, independent and responsible journalism”.
‘Economic murder’
The All Pakistan Newspaper Employees Confederation (Apnec) has condemned the banning of advertisements in media outlets as the ‘economic murder’ of media employees and urged the government to stop targeting Dawn.
While addressing a meeting, Apnec Secretary-General Asghar Khan strongly condemned the closure of Dawn Media Group’s advertisements and demanded that the practice be stopped immediately and that advertisements be distributed according to merit and law
“Ban on Dawn newspaper advertisement would be considered an attack on freedom of the press.”
“Apnec fully believes in freedom of expression and democracy and has always fought against brutality and undemocratic tactics in media houses in the past,” he added.
The chairman of the confederation, Shakeel Yamin Kanga, termed the closure of advertisements as an economic murder of media employees and an attack on freedom of expression and said that the government should not play with the lives of media workers.
“All Pakistan Newspaper Employees Confederation stands with its colleagues in this difficult time,” he said.
The confederation also pledged that if the government did not take any action, there would be a nationwide protest.
Last week, the Council of Newspaper Editors (CPNE) said Dawn was among Pakistan’s most respected media outlets, and stopping the release of government ads to the group amounted to financially crippling the organisation.
The All Pakistan Newspapers Society (APNS) also spoke out against the stoppage of government ads to the group’s outlets, saying it was “dismayed”.
The Pakistan Broadcasters Association (PBA) slammed the ban on ads for Dawn Media Group outlets as well, saying it had always resisted “using advertising as tools to control media and free expression”.
The Joint Action Co­­mmittee (JAC), comprising re­­presentatives of multiple journalist bodies, also criticised the restriction, saying the government was using official advertising as a tool to pressure media organisations.
Earlier this year, the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) noted in its ‘Islamabad Declaration’ that Dawn has been denied advertisements by the federal and Punjab governments since October 2024 “because of its professional and critical approach in reporting and editorials”.
This was not the only way in which authorities have tried to obstruct Dawn’s reporting — after the so-called ‘Dawn Leaks’ saga, the paper’s circulation was blocked in large parts of the country, especially the cantonment areas.</p><small>2025-12-16 15:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1619543603a27c5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961474/indonesia-welcomes-first-panda-born-in-the-country' target='_blank'><strong>Indonesia welcomes first panda born in the country</strong></a><br><p>Indonesia has welcomed the arrival of the first giant panda born in the country, marking a significant milestone after years of efforts to breed the vulnerable species.
The cub was born on Nov. 27 at the Taman Safari Indonesia wildlife park in Bogor, West Java, to giant panda pair Cai Tao and Hu Chun. Both pandas arrived in the park in 2017, under a 10-year joint research programme and as a symbol of the friendship between Indonesia and China.
Taman Safari Indonesia’s Corporate Communication Manager Trully Erlynda said the birth is the culmination of a decade-long international collaboration.
“We welcome the panda cub’s birth with gratitude and joy. It is a proud year-end milestone for Indonesia and a sign of advancing international conservation cooperation,” Trully said on Monday.
In August, the veterinary team at Taman Safari Indonesia, working with the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) in Berlin, performed an artificial insemination procedure on giant pandas Cai Tao and Hu Chun in an effort to achieve the first panda birth in Indonesia.
Reproducing giant pandas is considered one of the greatest challenges in wildlife conservation. Female pandas are fertile only once a year, and their receptive window lasts just two to three days. The egg remains viable for only a few hours, making natural breeding success rates extremely low.
Taman Safari has pursued artificial insemination to breed giant pandas since 2022, but previous attempts did not produce a successful birth. In 2024, the program reached a milestone when fertilisation was confirmed 40 days after the procedure, although the embryo failed to fully develop.
Trully of Taman Safari said the latest insemination effort involved “highly precise hormone monitoring, strict behavioural observation and the implementation of international animal welfare standards” to maximise the chances of success.
After fertilisation was confirmed, she said, Chinese experts monitored female panda Hu Chun through her pregnancy and delivery. Trully added that on Nov. 30, nursery specialists from China’s Panda Centre and the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda (CCRCGP) arrived to assist with the cub’s early care during this crucial stage.
She noted that experts from the CCRCGP remain on site to provide ongoing technical support.
“This success reflects the effectiveness of the science-based reproductive program developed by Taman Safari Indonesia, supported by continuous technical guidance from Chinese experts,” she said.
Trully said the panda cub is in stable condition and is being monitored around the clock by Taman Safari Indonesia’s Life Science team. The cub has shown strong early developmental indicators, including healthy vocalisation, effective nursing and consistent weight gain.
Over the next 30-60 days, the cub is expected to undergo significant development, such as improved temperature regulation, fur growth, the opening of its eyes and the emergence of early motor skills.
Trully said that at this early stage, the panda cub is not yet accessible to the public.
“Our team will continue to prioritise the health and well-being of both the mother and her cub,” she said.
On Dec. 4, President Prabowo Subianto officially named the panda cub Satrio Wiratama, meaning “a noble, brave and virtuous warrior”, and gave him the nickname Rio.
During a meeting that same day with Wang Huning, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), President Prabowo also shared photos of the newborn cub, highlighting the significance of the successful breeding effort.
In a statement, the Presidential Palace said Rio’s birth is expected to further strengthen Indonesia-China relations while raising public awareness about the importance of protecting endangered species. The statement added that the breeding efforts underscore the government’s commitment to environmental sustainability as a key pillar of national development.
With the birth of Rio, Indonesia joins Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand as the only Southeast Asian nations to have successfully bred a giant panda through artificial insemination.
According to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, the giant panda is classified as vulnerable. Data from the National Giant Panda Conservation and Research Centre estimate that only about 1,860 individuals remain in the wild, with a further 700 living in managed care facilities around the world.

In the deadliest terror attack in the country’s history, at least 144 people ─ mostly schoolchildren ─ were killed when heavily armed militants stormed the army-run public school on Dec 16, 2014. Seven soldiers of the Special Services Group and two officers were among the wounded.

 

In a message posted on his X account, PM Shehbaz said, “Today, we commemorate the martyrs of the APS Peshawar tragedy — the innocent children, teachers and staff whose sacrifice is forever etched in our national conscience.
“Their sacrifice remains a constant reminder of our collective responsibility to defeat terrorism,” the premier stressed.
“The Pakistani nation will always stand united, firm and unwavering in its resolve to eradicate the scourge of terrorism,” he added, praying for the families of the martyrs.







In his message, President Asif Ali Zardari remembered the sacrifices of the children and the staff, vowing to stand with the families of the martyrs.
“Today, we remember the innocent children and staff of the Army Public School whose lives were taken in the brutal terrorist attack on December 16, 2014,” he said in a message posted by his spokesperson on X.
“Their sacrifice remains a solemn reminder of the heavy price our nation has paid in the fight against terrorism,” the president said.







He vowed to stand with the families “who continue to bear this pain with courage”.
“The nation will always honour the resilience of the APS families who transformed their grief into strength for Pakistan,” he stressed. He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to eliminating terrorism, stating that the country’s resolve remained “absolute”.
“There can be no soft corner for terrorists or those who support, finance, shelter or justify them,” he said, emphasising that “there can be no negotiations with those who raise arms against the state or target our children”.
“We strongly condemn Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan,” he went on to say.
The evidence of its involvement in efforts to destabilise our country is well documented. Pakistan will continue to expose these hostile activities and will defend its people with full resolve,” he said.
The president warned terrorists’ “apologists, facilitators, and supporters” that the armed forces will not “spare them and will defeat terrorism, no matter what political, ideological or fake religious garb they try to shroud themselves in”.
President Zardari paid tribute to the armed forces, law enforcement agencies, and intelligence services “whose efforts have prevented many such tragedies.”
“We will continue to pursue every terrorist and every facilitator until justice is done,” he added.
“The memory of the APS martyrs strengthens our resolve. Pakistan will never allow the enemies of peace to succeed,” the president concluded.
The Foreign Office (FO) also issued statement, saying: “On the anniversary of the heinous terrorist attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan solemnly remembers the innocent children and teachers who were martyred in an act of sheer inhumanity.
“Their sacrifice stands as an enduring symbol of the nation’s resolve to confront and defeat terrorism in all its forms.”
The statement added that “this tragic anniversary underscores the continuing urgency of eradicating the menace of terrorism”.







It highlighted that Pakistan had been among the hardest-hit countries in this fight, having lost more than 90,000 lives and borne immense economic and social costs.
“These sacrifices remain an enduring reminder of Pakistan’s frontline role and unwavering commitment to counterterrorism.”
The statement further said that Pakistan’s security forces and law enforcement agencies had a role in saving “countless precious lives — not only of Pakistanis, but also of people across the region and beyond”.
The country’s security forces and law enforcement agencies continued to take decisive and effective action against terrorist groups, the statement said, adding that at the same time, “Pakistan faces a persistent threat from terrorist elements operating from across the border, with sustained support from our adversaries”.
“We have consistently drawn attention to this challenge and have taken resolute measures to prevent terrorism from spilling over into our territory.
“In doing so, Pakistan has acted as a bulwark against the spread of terrorism beyond its borders, contributing significantly to the security and stability of the wider region and beyond.
“This unrefuted reality underscores the urgent need for concrete action to dismantle terrorist sanctuaries and to cut off all forms of support to all terrorist groups, including those targeting Pakistan,” the statement said.
It added: “As we honor the martyrs of APS, Pakistan reaffirms its unshakeable resolve to protect its people, defend its sovereignty, and pursue its vision of lasting peace through unity, resilience, and an uncompromising stance against terrorism —irrespective of its origin.”</p><small>2025-12-16 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1615133700158b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961460/at-least-2-including-police-constable-killed-in-attack-on-polio-team-in-kps-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>At least 2, including police constable, killed in attack on polio team in KP’s Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>At least two people, including a constable, were killed after unidentified assailants attacked a polio team in the Salarzai tehsil of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district, the police said, as the nationwide polio campaign entered its second day.
The attack comes a day after the government launched the final polio campaign of 2025, which is set to run until December 21.
Public Relations Officer (PRO) police, Israr Khan, confirmed to Dawn that two people, including a passerby and a policeman guarding the polio team, were killed in the attack on Tuesday afternoon in the Thangi area of Salarzai.
Khan identified the martyred cop as Constable Sajad Ahmed, who passed away after sustaining critical injuries, while another civilian was “shot dead by the armed men when he attempted to chase after the assailants.”
“Local residents also confirmed the account, while the assailants managed to escape,” Khan said, adding that the police had launched a search operation.
He also confirmed that no polio workers were harmed in the incident.
Polio vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed, and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in KP.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi condemned the attack, extending condolences to the families of the deceased, according to a statement posted on X by his digital media spokesperson.
“Polio workers and the security personnel assigned to protect them are performing their national responsibility,” KP CM was quoted as saying.
He termed the incident “an assault on humanity and national responsibility”.
He vowed that the “campaign will not be allowed to be impacted in any way”.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the attack, expressing grief over the death of the police constable, state broadcaster PTV reported.
He vowed to “bring the perpetrators to justice,” stressing that the campaign will continue until the virus is eradicated from the country.
The premier also prayed for the “speedy recovery of the injured”.







In October, a Levies constable deployed for the security of a polio team was killed when unidentified assailants opened fire on him in Swat.
According to official data cited in a November 9 report, a total of 96 people had been killed by alleged terrorists in KP since 2012 until then, including 61 policemen, 27 health workers and five civilians.
Also, 170 people, including 124 policemen, 28 health workers and 21 civilians, had been injured in attacks on polio teams. During this period, 32 health workers, three civilians and one policeman were kidnapped during vaccination campaigns.
Of the people who were subjected to violence in the shape of death, injuries and kidnapping, 283 were men and 18 women.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases this year, with the highest number of cases in KP at 19.
Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-12-16 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639741-attack-on-polio-team-in-bajaur-kills-two-including-cop' target='_blank'><strong>Attack on polio team in Bajaur kills two including cop</strong></a><br><p>

Ahmed was identified on social media as the bystander who hid behind parked cars before charging at the gunman from behind, seizing his rifle and knocking him to the ground. The act saved several lives, authorities have said.

“I think he’s a role model for us all and it really encompasses the Aussie spirit and I’m incredibly proud to live in the area and I think everybody is, it blows me away, absolutely blows me away,” said Adam Pogorzelski, a local resident in Ahmed’s neighbourhood, in the suburb of Sutherland, about 26 kilometres from the centre of Sydney.
Ahmed, a father of two, remains in a Sydney hospital with gunshot wounds. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited him earlier on Tuesday and told media that Ahmed will undergo more surgery.
Ahmed has been hailed as a hero around the world, including by US President Donald Trump who said Ahmed was “a very, very brave person” who saved many lives.
A GoFundMe campaign set up for Ahmed has raised more than A$2 million.
A 50-year-old father and his 24-year-old son allegedly carried out the attack at a Jewish celebration on Sunday afternoon, killing 15 people in the country’s worst mass shooting in almost 30 years.
“I was actually proud when I saw it, I thought to myself, wow is that Ahmed, because I know him, then I looked at it twice and then I realised it was him …,” said a 20-year-old worker at a neighbouring chemist who did not wish to be named.“What he did was unbelievable.”</p><small>2025-12-16 10:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16134800ee5ca53.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961456/ihc-dismisses-justice-jahangiris-objections-on-cj-dogar-led-division-bench-hearing-fake-degree-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC dismisses Justice Jahangiri’s objections on CJ Dogar-led division bench hearing fake degree case</strong></a><br><p>The Islamabad High Court (IHC) has turned down Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s objections on a division bench, led by Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, hearing challenges to the legitimacy of his law degree and appointment as a judge, it emerged on Tuesday.
The objections were raised by Justice Jahangiri, also an IHC judge, during the hearing of the petition challenging his qualification on Monday, with CJ Dogar and Justice Muhammad Azam Khan presiding over the proceedings.
The same bench previously also barred Justice Jahangiri from judicial work in September in the case, but the order was later set aside by the Supreme Court (SC).
Justice Jahangiri had appeared in person before the bench yesterday and presented his arguments.
A court order issued after the hearing, a copy of which is available with Dawn, said he had raised preliminary objections on the constitution of a division bench instead of a single bench to hear lawyer Mian Dawood’s petition.
Moreover, Justice Jahangiri “expressed his no confidence” in the bench on the ground of filing of an intra-court appeal against CJ Dogar in the SC, the order stated.
The court, however, observed that “on the administrative side, keeping in view the sensitive nature of allegations of having an invalid/ fake degree having been levelled against a sitting judge of this court, it was deemed conducive, proper and in the fitness of things to constitute a division bench to hear this case instead of a single bench”.
It further said, “Even otherwise, the constitution of benches to hear cases, is the sole prerogative of the chief justice.”
The court also noted that “it is not a first instance of this kind wherein the division bench has been constituted to hear a certain petition”.
Based on these observations, the court turned down Justice Jahangiri’s objection to the constitution of the division bench to hear the case for “having no force”.
On Justice Jahangiri expressing a lack of confidence in CJ Dogar on the basis of an appeal filed against the latter in the SC, the court observed that the plea had been dismissed by the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) on November 24.
In July, Justice Jahagiri, along with four other IHC judges, filed an intra-court appeal against the SC’s constitutional bench decision of upholding the seniority of the IHC that raised Justice Dogar to the top.
The five judges requested the SC not to consider Justices Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Asif as judges of IHC until they took fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194.
The intra-court appeal was fixed before the FCC following its establishment under the 27th Constitutional Amendment and eventually dismissed for non-prosecution.
Highlighting the plea’s dismissal in its order for Monday’s hearing, the IHC also cited various previous SC orders.
It noted that in the case Asif Ali Zardari vs The State (PLD 2001 SC 568), the SC had upheld that the “judge of a superior court is a keeper of his own conscience and it is for him to decide whether to hear or not to hear a matter before him”.
“In ‘Ms. Benazir Bhutto vs The President of Pakistan’ (1992 SCMR 140), the issue of transfer of case before the judge on the basis of bias was explained, and it was observed that there is a marked distinction in the approach on the question of bias between a case of a judge of a subordinate court and a case pertaining to a judge of a superior court in as much as in the former case, the superior courts do grant transfer applications on the ground of a judge having personal, pecuniary or proprietary interest in the subject matter whereas in the latter case, the Supreme Court does not grant transfer application on the above ground for want of power,” the IHC observed.
Moreover, it recalled that in M.H.Khondkhar vs The State (PLD 1966 Supreme Court 140), the SC held that an application for transfer “does not lie at all against a judge of the high court”. And in the same context, the SC “has already passed an exhaustive order in the case titled Muhammad Azam Khan Swati vs The State and another (2023 P Cr.L.J. 350)”.
In light of these rulings, the IHC also turned down Justice Jahangiri’s objection pertaining to a lack of confidence in Justice Dogar.
According to the court order, Justice Jahangiri also informed the court during Monday’s hearing that “no record relating to this case was provided to him” and requested time to engage the services of a private counsel and to obtain copies of the case.
At that, the court directed the Higher Education Commission (HEC) to provide Justice Jahangiri with its report on the matter along with annexures.
During a hearing of the case on December 8, the HEC, in its detailed report submitted to the IHC, endorsed Kara­chi University’s (KU) findings that the LLB degree of Justice Jahangiri was obtained through unfair means.
“The office is also directed to do the needful in this regard and provide copies of the instant petition along with annexures and reports of the HEC as well as of KU to the respondent,” the court order from Monday’s hearing said.
The court also summoned the KU registrar in person along with a record of Justice Jahangiri’s law degree at the next hearing on Dec 18 (Thursday).
The case
The controversy surrounding Justice Jahangiri’s law degree originated from a letter that began circulating last year on social media, purportedly from the University of Karachi’s (KU) controller of examinations.
Subsequently, a complaint pertaining to his allegedly fake degree was submitted to the Supreme Judicial Council — the top forum for judicial accountability that probes allegations of misconduct against judges — last year in July and a petition challenging his appointment was also filed in the IHC earlier this year by lawyer Mian Dawood.
The controversy has followed a protracted legal trajectory since Sept 16, when the same IHC division bench first took up the petition and issued an interim order restraining Justice Jahangiri from performing judicial functions until the maintainability of the petition could be decided.
The decision, made without issuing prior notice to the judge, had sparked debate within the legal community over whether a high court could suspend a sitting judge through an interim order. On Sept 29, the SC intervened, setting aside the restraining order.
A five-member constitutional bench, headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, held that a high court could not bar a judge from performing judicial functions while hearing a quo warranto petition.
The ruling clarified that it addressed only the legality of the interim order and not the merits of the allegations. The SC later directed the IHC to decide all preliminary objections and proceed with the matter in accordance with law.
Justice Jahangiri was also one of the six IHC judges who wrote to the SJC last year, alleging interference in judicial affairs by intelligence agencies. The letter sparked a wider debate on judicial independence and led to demands for an inquiry.</p><small>2025-12-16 10:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/161433530774ef2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961457/pia-says-flight-schedule-affected-in-4-punjab-cities-due-to-dense-fog' target='_blank'><strong>PIA says flight schedule affected in 4 Punjab cities due to dense fog</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) said on Tuesday that dense fog had affected its flight schedule in Lahore, Multan, Sialkot and Faisalabad, affecting both domestic and international operations.
In a statement, the spokesperson for the national carrier urged passengers travelling domestically and internationally to obtain the latest information about their flights before leaving for the airport.
The spokesperson said that temporary changes were made to the schedule to ensure passenger safety and to avoid unnecessary delays in flight operations.
He said that dense fog affected visibility significantly, creating challenges for aircraft during landing and takeoff. He added that passengers could contact the PIA helpline for updates on the status of their flights.
According to the weekly weather outlook issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department, cold and dry weather was likely to expected in most parts of the country on Tuesday.
“Moderate to dense fog/smog is likely to persist over Punjab, upper Sindh and plain areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” it said.







Last week, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) had forecast heavy smog and fog across Punjab from Dec 12 to 16 (Tuesday) and urged citizens to adopt precautionary measures.</p><small>2025-12-16 09:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639693-ihc-orders-to-re-record-witnesses-statements-in-imaan-mazari-controversial-tweets-case' target='_blank'><strong>IHC orders to re-record witnesses' statements in Imaan Mazari controversial tweets case</strong></a><br><p>

IHC’s Justice Mohammed Azam Khan passed the directives while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order, when the court had recorded the testimonies of all prosecution witnesses. Chattha had appeared before the court while Imaan’s lawyers had marked her presence. The court, however, had ordered the prosecution to proceed with the witnesses’ testimonies.
On Tuesday, IHC’s Justice Khan observed that witnesses’ statements should be recorded again and said that the case was being referred back to the trial court without touching its merits.
During the hearing, defence counsel Riasat Ali Azad told the court that senior advocate Faisal Siddiqui had submitted his power of attorney but was busy with cases in Lahore, seeking a hearing after court vacations.
He also pointed out that the Supreme Court (SC) had directed an early decision in the matter, though no specific timeframe was fixed. Last week, the apex court had stayed trial proceedings against the two until their pending appeals were decided by the IHC.
Meanwhile, the prosecutor, Raja Naveed, maintained that the complete record was available before the court.
Azad then argued that the accused were entitled to full protection under Article 10A (right to a fair trial) of the Constitution and raised the objection that the record had not been properly provided. He contended that the issue had been raised at the previous hearing as well.
During the hearing, the court also questioned whether the statement of the four witnesses had been recorded in the absence of one of the accused. At this, the prosecutor responded by saying that the conduct of the accused was also a relevant factor.
Defence counsel Azad insisted that witness statements must be recorded in the presence of the accused and sought time until Monday.
Subsequently, the court issued directives to the trial court.
The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.</p><small>2025-12-16 07:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/16114346f8bedd7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1961445/pakistan-seeks-oil-deal-with-russia-as-energy-ministries-hold-talks' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks oil deal with Russia as energy ministries hold talks</strong></a><br><p>Russia and Pakistan are in talks on a potential oil-sector agreement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told RIA news agency in remarks published on Tuesday.
“All of these areas are Russia’s strengths. And we would be very happy if Russia agreed on an agreement in this sector with Pakistan,” Aurangzeb told RIA in an interview when asked about wider cooperation in exploration, production and refining between the two countries.
“At present, the issue is being discussed by the energy ministries of both sides.”
Russia also discussed upgrading a refinery in Pakistan with Russian companies involved, Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev had said in November.
Pakistan has stepped up engagement with Russia in recent years as Moscow sought new energy markets after Western sanctions over Ukraine, and Islamabad looked to lower import costs.
Pakistan began buying Russian crude in 2023.
Aurangzeb also said Russia and Pakistan are looking into building another steel plant in Pakistan, RIA reported.</p><small>2025-12-16 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/639639-pakistan-renews-pledge-against-terrorism-on-11th-anniversary-of-aps-attack' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan renews pledge against terrorism on 11th anniversary of APS attack</strong></a><br><p>
