A day prior, the ombudsman ordered the removal of KE CEO Alvi after finding him guilty of workplace harassment.
Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company’s former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, read the order issued by provincial ombudsman retired Justice Shahnawaz Tariq.
According to a petition Alvi filed with the SHC today — available with Dawn.com — his lawyers argued that Khan has neither levelled any allegations of “harassment of a sexual or physical nature” before the ombudsman, nor presented any evidence of gender discrimination within KE.
“There was no allegation that the petitioner, being in a position of authority, sought out any sexual favour, nor any gender based discrimination was alleged or could be made out as several women are holding high-level positions within the organisation,” the petition read.
“In the circumstances, the findings in the impugned order are flimsy, not sustainable and completely disproportionate. No hostile work environment was alleged or proved as a result of gender based discrimination nor as a result of harassment.”
The plea also noted: “The learned provincial ombudsman did not have jurisdiction over the affairs of a trans-provincial organisation such as KE and so also did not have jurisdiction to take cognisance on a complaint filed by an ex-employee.”
In a court order issued today and seen by Dawn.com, the SHC said that as per the petitioner, KE was a “trans-provincial entity/establishment” and the provincial ombudsman had no jurisdiction to act upon the complaints, which should instead be addressed by the federal ombudsman.
The order said the “contention raised requires consideration” and said that notices be issued to the respondents, as well as the Sindh advocate general and deputy advocate general for August 8.
“Till the next date of hearing, [the] operation of the impugned decision will remain suspended,” the order read. It, however, ordered Alvi to deposit the Rs2.5 million penalty with the court’s nazir.
In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, KE Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security retired Colonel Wahid Asghar and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of “causing harassment, intimidation and mental agony”.
The ombudsman’s order said that Alvi had “committed harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team”.
Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which would be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.</p><small>2025-08-01 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/011750311d84ba4.jpg?r=175130' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928054/psx-crosses-141000-barrier-in-wake-of-us-trade-deal' target='_blank'><strong>PSX crosses 141,000 barrier in wake of US trade deal</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) crossed the 141,000 barrier on Friday on the back of a new trade deal with the United States and securing a lower tariff rate.
The PSX regained its bullish momentum after dipping by as many as 433 points in the morning. The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 483.07 points (0.35 per cent) to reach 139,873.49 points at 12pm, from the previous close of 139,390.42 points.
The index rose by 1,644.56 points, or up by 1.18pc, to close at 141,034.98.
Having witnessed heavy selling pressure on Tuesday due to corporate earnings and political noise, the PSX had bounced back above the 139,000-mark yesterday, driven by the trade agreement with the US.
Late on Wednesday night, a Pakistani delegation led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in Washington, DC, finalised a trade agreement with the US, expected to lower tariffs, although no figure was announced. US President Donald Trump had also said Washington would help Islamabad develop “massive oil deposits”.
In its statement issued today, the finance ministry said the government was “pleased to announce the successful conclusion of tariff-related discussions” with the US.
“As per the outcome of these talks, a tariff of 19pc will be applicable for Pakistani exports to the US market,” it said.
The statement noted that the decision reflected a “balanced and forward-looking approach by the US authorities, keeping Pakistan competitive relative to other South and Southeast Asian countries”.
“In particular, this tariff level is expected to support Pakistan’s export potential, especially in key sectors such as textiles, which remain the backbone of the country’s export economy,” the ministry highlighted.</p><small>2025-08-01 12:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01135217b268161.jpg?r=135243' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927992/pakistani-goods-face-reduced-19pc-us-tariff-as-trump-hits-dozens-of-countries-with-steep-duties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani goods face reduced 19pc US tariff as Trump hits dozens of countries with steep duties</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump has introduced tariffs on exports from dozens of trading partners, including a 19 per cent tariff on Pakistani goods — revised from the previous 29pc — a day after the two countries finalised a trade agreement.
According to an executive order detailing the tariffs, it was announced that Pakistan is set to face a 19pc tariff rate as Trump’s tariff deadline comes to an end on August 1 (today).
The order listed higher import duty rates of 10 to 41pc starting in seven days for 69 trading partners as the 12:01am EDT (9:01am PKT) deadline approached.

What we know so far:

Pakistani goods exported to US to now be taxed 19pc as part of Trump’s global tariffs
The rate is lower than the proposed 29pc after trade talks with US
Finance ministry sees major opportunity to expand Pakistan’s footprint in US market
Official notes Pakistan ‘possibly only country’ offered investments alongside
Levies for 68 other trading partners range from 10-41pc, with India facing 25pc tariff

Canada’s duties raised to 35pc; Brazil slapped with 50pc; China facing Aug 12 deadline


Late on Wednesday night, a Pakistani delegation led by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in Washington, DC, finalised a trade agreement with the US, expected to lower tariffs, although no figure was announced. Trump also said Washington would help Islamabad develop “massive oil deposits”.
In its statement issued today, the finance ministry said the government was “pleased to announce the successful conclusion of tariff-related discussions” with the US.
 






“As per the outcome of these talks, a tariff of 19pc will be applicable for Pakistani exports to the US market,” it said.
The statement noted that the decision reflected a “balanced and forward-looking approach by the US authorities, keeping Pakistan competitive relative to other South and Southeast Asian countries”.
“In particular, this tariff level is expected to support Pakistan’s export potential, especially in key sectors such as textiles, which remain the backbone of the country’s export economy,” the ministry highlighted.
 
 

In the first 11 months of the outgoing fiscal year (FY), exports to the US rose by 11.06pc to $5.552 billion from $4.999bn a year earlier. In FY24, Pakistan’s textiles exports to the US reached $5bn representing 92pc of its overall exports to that country.
The ministry said it belived that the current tariff arrangement presented a “significant opportunity to expand Pakistan’s footprint in the US market”. “It is now essential for Pakistani exporters and trade bodies to adopt an aggressive and focused marketing strategy to capitalise on this development,” it stressed.
The ministry also pointed out a “substantial potential for growth in other sectors”, affirming that the government was committed to facilitating exporters through policy support, market intelligence and trade promotion initiatives.
“The Government of Pakistan looks forward to further positive engagements and close cooperation with the United States in the areas of investment, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, mines & minerals, energy, and other emerging sectors.
“Pakistan will continue to engage closely with President Trump and the US administration to promote the shared goals of economic development and mutual prosperity,” the statement asserted.
 
 

It appreciated the “constructive engagement” of the US authorities and acknowledged the valuable role played by its team, including the commerce ministry and the Pakistan Mission in Washington DC, and other public and private sectors stakeholders.
In a recorded video statement, Aurangzeb said he and his team had a “very constructive final round of discussions” with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, which the “led to finalising the trade deal”.
“Trade and investment have to go hand in hand,” the finance czar stressed, adding that the “bilateral and strategic partnership has come up prominently”.
Giving insights on the process, the minister pointed out the private sector’s role as it was the “first constituent” to volunteer in helping to reduce the trade imbalance.
Terming it a “win-win situation” again for the future, Aurangzeb said: “I think we are in a good place today […] in terms of where we have arrived before August 1.”
 






Pakistan has emerged with the second-lowest tariff rate of any South Asian country. Afghanistan got hit with a 15pc levy, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Vietnam with 20pc, and India with 25pc.
CNN noted: “There is also satisfaction locally that Pakistan’s tariff rate is much lower than neighbour and arch-rival India’s. Fears in Islamabad that India was trying to isolate Pakistan financially have been somewhat tempered by the 25pc tariff rate that the Trump administration hit New Delhi with.”
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) maintained its bullish momentum and crossed the 141,000-point barrier, despite dipping by as many as 433 points in the morning.
The benchmark KSE-100 index rose by 1,644.56 points (1.18pc) to reach a intraday high of 141,160.93 points at 4:11pm, from the previous close of 139,390.42 points. It finally closed at 141,034.98 points.
Having witnessed heavy selling pressure on Tuesday due to corporate earnings and political noise, the PSX had bounced back above the 139,000-mark yesterday, driven by the trade agreement with the US.

Pakistan ‘possibly only country’ offered investments as well
Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad highlighted on X: “Pakistan is possibly the only country which the US has offered its investments as well, besides a competitive trade deal.”
He noted the “deal signals a strategic deepening of economic ties and shared growth”.
Speaking to Geo News, Schehzad expanded upon possible US investment in Pakistan’s energy sector, which he termed the “biggest area” in the economy.
“We need global partnerships in energy. We import 80-90pc of all our energy needs,” the finance minister’s adviser observed.
 


“If such an economy — a giant which has expertise in oil and gas — if they’re coming and talking about massively building oil and gas reserves, so we can export to the entire region, not just fulfil our own needs, this is a big development,” the adviser emphasised.
“If Pakistan make a deal with the US to set up big plants for exploration or machinery, we’ll get benefits in tariffs through that as well,” he added.
“The way Pakistan has been treated compared to different countries in this region, very encouraging and important,” Schehzad said, referring to the higher 25pc levy imposed on India.
While noting that the government’s role was to negotiate and secure a good deal, he called on the private sector to execute it through business-to-business, export contracts, and export engagement.
“The import bill can be reduced, the dollar can be impacted, overall employment generation, and GDP can be improved,” Schehzad highlighted.
He pointed out that the Pakistani companies, such as Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) and the Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), were stakeholders in Balochistan’s Reko Diq mining project.
‘Failed to align sufficiently’
Trump set rates including a 35pc duty on many goods from Canada, 50pc for Brazil, 25pc for India, 20pc for Taiwan and 39pc for Switzerland, according to a presidential executive order.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Some of them had reached tariff-reducing deals; others had no opportunity to negotiate with his administration. Trump included an exception for some goods shipped within the coming week.
Goods from all other countries not listed would be subject to a 10pc US import tax. Trump had previously said that the rate might be higher.
The administration also teased that more trade deals were in the pipeline as it seeks to close trade deficits and boost domestic factories.
According to the executive order, if a trading partner fails to take “adequate steps” to address the tariffs or retaliates against the US, the commerce secretary and trade representative, in coordination with the appropriate senior officials, shall recommend additional action.
Facing a Friday deadline of his making, the Republican president has tapped emergency powers, pressured foreign leaders, and pressed ahead with trade policies that sparked a market sell-off when they were first announced in April.
 
 

This time, markets had a more muted reaction. Stocks and equity futures fell modestly in Friday morning trading in Asia.
Trump’s order said that some trading partners, “despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the United States on economic and national-security matters”.
Other details are still to come, including on the “rules of origin” that will determine what products might face even higher tariffs.
Trump also said “we have made a few deals today that are excellent deals for the country”, and a US official later told reporters that they were still to be announced.
Canada, Mexico
Trump issued a separate order for Canada that raises the rate on Canadian goods subject to fentanyl-related tariffs to 35pc, from 25pc previously, saying Canada had “failed to cooperate” in curbing illicit narcotics flows into the US.
The higher tariffs on Canadian goods contrasted sharply with Trump’s decision to grant Mexico a 90-day reprieve from higher tariffs of 30pc on many goods to provide more time to negotiate a broader trade pact.
Trump complained to reporters earlier that Canada had “been very poorly led”.
Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was disappointed by Trump’s decision.
“While we will continue to negotiate with the United States on our trading relationship, the Canadian government is laser focused on what we can control: building Canada strong,” Carney said in a post on X.
 






US duties and tariffs will heavily affect lumber, steel, aluminium, and automobiles, he added, vowing action to protect Canadian jobs, buy Canadian goods, invest in industrial competitiveness and diversify export markets.
The extension for Mexico avoids a 30pc tariff on most Mexican non-automotive and non-metal goods compliant with the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement on trade and came after a Thursday morning call between Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.
“We avoided the tariff increase announced for tomorrow,” Sheinbaum wrote on X, adding that the Trump call was “very good”.
About 85pc of US imports from Mexico comply with the rules of origin outlined in the USMCA, shielding them from 25pc tariffs related to fentanyl, according to Mexico’s economy ministry.
 






Trump said the US would continue to levy a 50pc tariff on Mexican steel, aluminum and copper and a 25pc tariff on Mexican autos and on non-USMCA-compliant goods subject to tariffs related to the US fentanyl crisis.
“Additionally, Mexico has agreed to immediately terminate its Non-Tariff Trade Barriers, of which there were many,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, without providing details.
India discord
Goods from India appeared to be headed for a 25pc tariff after talks bogged down over access to India’s agriculture sector, drawing a higher-rate threat from Trump that also included an unspecified penalty for India’s purchases of Russian oil.
Although negotiations with India were continuing, New Delhi vowed to protect the country’s labour-intensive farm sector, and the threat of higher rates from Trump triggered outrage from the opposition party and a slump in the rupee.
Without a deal, the rate will go into effect from Friday and single out India for harsher trade conditions than its major peers, potentially damaging the economy of a strategic US partner in Asia seen as a counterbalance to Chinese influence.

Trump’s rollout of higher import taxes comes amid more evidence they have begun driving up consumer goods prices.
Commerce Department data released on Thursday showed prices for home furnishings and durable household equipment jumped 1.3pc in June, the biggest gain since March 2022. Recreational goods and vehicles prices shot up 0.9pc, the most since February 2024. Prices for clothing and footwear rose 0.4pc.

Brazil slapped with 50pc tariff; China facing Aug 12 deadline
Trump hit Brazil’s exports on Wednesday with a steep 50pc tariff as he escalated his fight with Latin America’s largest economy over its prosecution of his friend and former president Jair Bolsonaro, but softened the blow by excluding sectors such as aircraft, energy and orange juice from heavier levies.
The run-up to Trump’s tariff deadline was unfolding as federal appeals court judges sharply questioned Trump’s use of a sweeping emergency powers law to justify his sweeping tariffs of up to 50pc on nearly all trading partners.
 
 

Trump invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare an emergency over the growing US trade deficit and impose his “reciprocal” tariffs and a separate fentanyl emergency.
The Court of International Trade ruled in May that the actions exceeded his executive authority, and questions from judges during oral arguments before the US Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit in Washington indicated further scepticism.
Meanwhile, China is facing an August 12 deadline to reach a durable tariff agreement with Trump’s administration, after Beijing and Washington reached preliminary deals in May and June to end escalating tit-for-tat tariffs and a cut-off of rare earth minerals.

The car, a grey Honda City vehicle, was recovered from the Kak Bridge. Search teams found Qazi’s body last Friday, who was aged approximately 62–64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) Phase 5.
The body of the colonel’s daughter, Muneba, however, has not been found yet. “The body of the girl who drowned in the floodwater will also be found soon,” District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah told Dawn.com.
The retired colonel and his daughter headed to the gate in their car, despite heavy rains and waterlogged streets.
According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station, “Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain.”
With the onset of the monsoon season in Pakistan, which typically lasts from late June to September, different parts of the country witness heavy rainfall and a heightened risk of extreme weather events like flash floods and landslides, especially in northern and western regions.</p><small>2025-08-01 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0116592614b6c1c.png?r=170051' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928047/iranian-president-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Iranian president to visit Pakistan on Saturday: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Friday confirmed that Iranian President Dr Masoud Pezeshkian will pay a state visit to Pakistan over the weekend.
Iran’s IRNA news agency had reported on Wednesday that the Iranian president’s political adviser, Mehdi Sanai, had said Pezeshkian was due to visit Pakistan on Saturday for a two-day trip with discussions with “cultural and commercial elites” on the agenda.
In a statement today, the FO confirmed the development, saying the Iranian president “will pay a state visit to Pakistan on August 2-3, 2025” at Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s invitation.
Dr Pezeshkian will be accompanied by a high-level delegation, including Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, senior ministers and other high-ranking officials.
The FO said Dr Pezeshkian will meet President Zardari and also hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz.
“This marks Dr Pezeshkian’s first official visit to Pakistan as president of Iran. It may be recalled that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last visited Iran on May 26, 2025. The visit is expected to further strengthen the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Iran,” the FO said.
 






Pakistan has recently expressed solidarity and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which experts say is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.
Pezeshkian will be the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. The visit was initially planned for the last week of July.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar previously said that President Pezeshkian would “soon” make an official visit to Islamabad, according to IRNA.
Speaking in an interview on the sidelines of his visit to New York, FM Dar had said Pezeshkian was scheduled to visit Pakistan and expressed hope the trip would take place in early August. “Pakistan supports diplomacy and a wise approach in the region and welcomes all efforts toward de-escalation and dialogue with Iran,” he was quoted as saying.
PM Shehbaz visited Iran on May 26 as part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the conflict with India. He met Iranian leaders, including Pezeshkian, to strengthen ties and deepen regional cooperation.
He had previously visited Iran in May 2024 to attend the memorial ceremony of former president Raisi and met Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p><small>2025-08-01 12:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01163714f0b9872.png?r=164654' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928039/enduring-pak-china-partnership-to-keep-playing-pivotal-role-in-regional-stability-coas' target='_blank'><strong>Enduring Pak-China partnership to keep playing pivotal role in regional stability: COAS</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Pakistan and China will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.
The army chief made the remarks at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was commemorated at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today, according to a press release by the military’s media affairs wing.
“He emphasised that their enduring partnership will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and safeguarding shared strategic interests,” said the statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Defence Attaché Major General Wang Zhong, Chinese Embassy officials and senior military officers from the Pakistani tri-services were also present.
COAS Munir extended a warm welcome to the Chinese guests and congratulated the PLA on its 98th founding anniversary, lauding the army’s “pivotal role in China’s defence, security and nation-building”, the ISPR said.
 


The army chief emphasised that “despite shifting strategic dynamics, the friendship between the two nations has remained steadfast and unshakable”, according to the press release.
“The COAS underscored the strength and strategic significance of Pakistan-China relations, emphasising that the bond between the two nations is unique, time-tested, and exceptionally resilient amid evolving regional and global challenges.
“The Field Marshal highlighted that the Pakistan-China strategic relationship exemplifies mutual trust, unwavering support, and shared commitment,” the statement added.
Concluding his address, COAS Munir “reaffirmed that the Pakistan Army and the PLA are true brothers-in-arms”, the ISPR stated.
Addressing the gathering, Ambassador Zaidong expressed his sincere gratitude to the army chief for hosting the event commemorating the PLA’s 98th anniversary.
He acknowledged the steadfast role of the armed forces in the “fight against terrorism and reaffirmed China’s unwavering support for and commitment to its strategic partnership with Pakistan”, according to the ISPR.
 
 

Today’s renewed affirmation of the strong bilateral ties comes just a week after COAS Munir paid an official visit to China, where he met with Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
During the visit, the Chinese leadership hailed the Pakistan Army as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.
Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability, and development.
In recent weeks, both countries have strengthened their cooperation in maritime, agriculture, media, disaster management and various other fields.</p><small>2025-08-01 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01164349b9ca8ce.jpg?r=164831' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928045/annual-inflation-accelerates-to-41pc-in-july-on-back-of-rising-food-fuel-costs' target='_blank'><strong>Annual inflation accelerates to 4.1pc in July on back of rising food, fuel costs</strong></a><br><p>Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Friday showed that consumer inflation accelerated to 4.1 per cent year-on-year in July, up from 3.2pc in June, driven by rising prices for food items, fuels and medicines.
July’s consumer price inflation month-on-month was 2.9pc, the bureau said.
The finance ministry on Monday had projected consumer inflation for July to remain in a range of 3.5-4.5pc, citing stable prices and improved supply conditions, as price pressures ease further after the previous fiscal year’s sharp decline.
The higher inflation reading follows the State Bank of Pakistan’s assessment of a deteriorating inflation outlook, leading it to leave the key interest rate unchanged at 11pc.
The bank’s monetary policy committee said on Wednesday that energy prices, particularly for gas, had risen more than expected, and it considered the real policy rate should be adequately positive to keep inflation in the 5-7pc target range.
Short-term inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index, had risen by 4.07pc week-on-week ending July 24, driven primarily by a sharp uptick in the retail prices of vegetables and petroleum products.
It marked the steepest weekly increase in recent times, primarily attributed to the surge in petroleum prices and their cascading impact on domestic costs. The government has significantly increased petroleum rates over the past month, which, alongside elevated transport fares, has escalated the cost of transporting perishable goods.
Pakistan is pushing through a series of economic reforms under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme, including a contractionary government budget passed in June that slashed spending to curb the fiscal deficit.</p><small>2025-08-01 11:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616832-indias-operation-mahadev-holds-no-significance-for-pakistan-fo' target='_blank'><strong>India's Operation Mahadev holds no significance for Pakistan: FO</strong></a><br><p>

For decades, dozens of bandit gangs armed with sophisticated weaponry have operated with impunity in northern Sindh as well as southern Punjab. Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets that cripple local businesses, brutal killings and looting people on the major highways have become a daily reality.
According to a statement from the office of the Inspector General of Punjab, almost 40 bandits, using rocket launchers and grenades, attacked the Sheikhani police picket in the Katcha area, situated between Chowk Sewetra and Chowk Mahi near the Guddu-Kashmore Road on Thursday night.
“During the attack, policemen of Elite Force, including Muhammad Irfan, Muhammad Saleem and Nukhail of Bahawalnagar, together with Khalil and Ghazanfar of Rahim Yar Khan, were martyred,” the statement said, adding that a bandit was also killed when the police retaliated.
Following the sudden attack, police started a search operation against the bandits in the area, it added.
Inspector General (IG) Punjab Police Dr Usman Anwar took notice of the incident and sought a report from the regional police officer, Bahawalpur.
“IG Usman also instructed the Rahim Yar Khan District Police Officer, Irfan Ali Sammon, to immediately arrest the bandits involved in the attack,” the statement added.
The funeral prayers of martyred policemen were to be offered at Rahim Yar Khan police lines at 2:30pm today, it added.
Last month, different dacoit gangs of the Katcha area, through their social media posts and videos, had directly challenged the writ of the police and claimed that they would target them. As seen in the videos, the dacoits were equipped with the latest, sophisticated weapons, per the statement.
Per the statement, the bandits had recently attacked stone-carrying trucks near the Hajipur area to extort money from the owner of the trucks. Similarly, area locals complained that several bandit gangs still had complete control over different islands of the Indus River.
In March, three people were shot at and killed by dacoits in the Jamaldin Wali area of tehsil Sadiqabad near the Indus River to avenge the murder of a YouTuber dacoit.
In January, three members of the Hindu community from Chowk Sawetra area near Bhong were allegedly kidnapped by dacoits of Katcha area.</p><small>2025-08-01 11:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616823-despite-shifting-strategic-dynamics-pak-china-ties-remain-unshakable-coas' target='_blank'><strong>Despite shifting strategic dynamics, Pak-China ties remain unshakable: COAS</strong></a><br><p>

A glacial burst, or glacial lake outburst flood (Glof), refers to an outburst of water from a glacial lake which could lead to severe flooding downstream. Pakistan is home to over 13,032 glaciers, the largest reservoir of glaciers outside of the polar regions. However, experts have warned that about 10,000 glaciers in Chitral and GB have been reported to be receding due to climate change–induced temperature rise.
GB’s government spokesperson, Faizullah Faraq, said that the father and son had fallen into a ravine and been buried under the debris of the Bagrot glacier as it burst, injuring both.
“Locals and Rescue 1122 saved the father while the son was killed,” he said.
Former member of the Bagrot Valley Assembly, Captain (retd) Muhammad Shafi, said that the father and son had been travelling on foot on the glacier in Barchi village when it collapsed.
“The father was rescued after several hours of efforts by the rescue team, but the son could not be rescued alive,” he said, adding that the father was transported to the hospital.
According to local journalist Imtiaz Gulab Bagoro, the father and son were from Balchi village. They were heading from Gargo village to Barchi village when the glacier collapsed.
He said that the father and son were rescued after 10 hours, while Gilgit Rescue 1122 reported that the rescue took eight hours.
The rescue team added that the son’s body had been moved to his native village of Balchi.
According to Faraq, new flash floods had “wreaked havoc in every direction” in the Khanbari area of Diamer district.
 
 

“Floods in Khanbari have destroyed people’s standing crops, lands and water channels,” he said, adding that floods were continuing across the province.
The Bagrot Valley has been a victim of climate change for the past several years, with many Glofs affecting the population.
According to non-governmental organisations (NGOs), several glacial lakes have formed in the valley.
To reduce the risks of these glacial lakes, NGOs have planted hundreds of trees in the Bagrot Valley and built protective walls with foreign aid. Early warning systems have been installed at several places in GB to inform the population about the flood situation due to climate change.
Safdar Ali, who is in charge of the information department of the Glof project, said that 200 early warning stations had been established in 16 valleys to protect the human population from flood waves due to climate change, of which 147 stations were active.
According to him, the early warning system had reported the danger in the Hassanabad nullah, but “since there was no major threat to the population, the practice of repeatedly sounding the siren did not continue”.
Ali said that the data of the early warning system was being transferred to the meteorological department, based on which weather alerts were being issued.
In June, the National Disaster Management Authority’s Nat­ional Emergencies Ope­ration Centre issued a Glof alert for northern areas, including GB, citing a dangerous combination of persistent high temperatures, intensified monsoon currents and a prevailing westerly wave.
The same month, three members of a family, including a man and his teenage son, were buried alive in a glacial slide while taking pictures at Sohni Waterfall near Naran.
Last year in August, a glacial lake outburst hit a village in Upper Chitral district, displacing 30 families.</p><small>2025-08-01 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/011324402248097.jpg?r=133537' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928031/israel-sharpens-travel-warning-for-israelis-in-uae-cites-terror-threat' target='_blank'><strong>Israel sharpens travel warning for Israelis in UAE, cites terror threat</strong></a><br><p>Israel is evacuating most of its diplomatic mission staff in the United Arab Emirates after Israel’s National Security Council sharpened its travel warning for Israelis staying in the Gulf country.
The UAE’s Israeli and Jewish community has grown more visible since 2020, when the UAE became the most prominent Arab state in 30 years to establish formal ties with Israel under a US-brokered agreement dubbed the Abraham Accords.
“We are emphasising this travel warning given our understanding that terrorist organisations (the Iranians, Hamas, Hezbollah and Global Jihad) are increasing their efforts to harm Israel”, the NSC said in a statement.
“They are driven by heightened motivation to exact revenge following Operation Rising Lion, in addition to the anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian incitement which has intensified since the start of Operation Iron Swords, and even more so in response to Hamas’ starvation campaign,” it said, using the names for its military assaults on Iran and Gaza.
The NSC statement said “past experience” has taught Israel that “terrorist organisations often focus their efforts in neighbouring countries” and warned of possible attempts to target Israeli and Jewish individuals in the UAE, especially around Jewish holidays and Shabbat.
The NSC’s travel alert for the UAE — which remains unchanged at level III — strongly advises against non-essential travel and urges Israeli citizens to “seriously reconsider” visiting the Gulf state.
The Israeli foreign ministry spokesperson’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
There was no immediate comment from the UAE’s foreign ministry.
Israel is concerned about retaliatory attacks following its recent military operation against Iran and as it faces mounting international pressure over the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.
In March, the UAE sentenced three people to death for the murder of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi who was killed in November in the Gulf country. Such crimes are rare in the UAE, which is largely viewed as one of the safest places in the Middle East.</p><small>2025-08-01 08:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01125414d7b1e16.jpg?r=125419' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927851/marital-rape-why-shantis-case-is-a-test-for-pakistans-justice-system' target='_blank'><strong>Marital rape: Why Shanti’s case is a test for Pakistan’s justice system</strong></a><br><p>“The last thing she asked for was a sip of water,” recalled Najma Maheshwari, referring to 19-year-old Shanti, a newlywed who died last week after brutal sexual violence allegedly inflicted by her husband, who is now in custody.
“Then she closed her eyes and never opened them again,” she said quietly, her voice steeped in sadness.
Najma, a social activist from Shanti’s neighbourhood, accompanied her brother Sayon to the government-run Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Trauma Centre. “Her insides were torn, she was bleeding profusely from her anus and writhing in pain. Hospital visitors urged us to move the gurney outside, complaining that the stench was unbearable.
“While cleaning her, medics removed worms from her gut — her injuries were that severe. I’ve seen much in my work, but never such horror or pain,” Najma told IPS by phone from her home in Lyari, an informal settlement in Karachi.
 

Najma Maheshwari, the social activist who was with Shanti when she died.

After two weeks at the hospital and a day trip to attend Shanti’s funeral in her village, 38-year-old Najma — mother of four — was deeply shaken. “I can’t eat, and the indescribable stench still haunts me,” she said.
According to the complaint lodged by Sayon with the police, Shanti’s husband, Ashok Mohan, had “inserted a metal pipe” followed by his “hand and arm” in her anus two days after her marriage. Not content, he bit her on her breasts and neck and threatened to kill her if she disclosed the act to anyone.
“They were engaged for two years before we married her off; she was very happy during the celebrations,” recalled Sonya, Shanti’s sister-in-law, adding that the groom, who is 25 years old, lived just a few lanes away and seemed like a good match.
The sexual violence, just three days after her marriage, led Shanti to bleed heavily from the anus. When the bleeding wouldn’t stop, her in-laws took her to two health facilities, but when the doctors gave up, they brought her home.
“We went to see her … she lay motionless, and her mother-in-law claimed it was just diarrhoea and her period, so we left, not realising how serious it was,” said Sonya.
Two weeks later, as Shanti’s condition worsened, her in-laws called her brother. Seeing her state, he rushed her to the hospital — but it was too late.
“There was clear evidence of anal trauma caused by sexual violence,” confirmed Dr Summaiya Sayed, Karachi’s chief police surgeon, saying Shanti was brought in “comatose” and placed on a ventilator. Her injuries worsened as she continued passing stool, leading to her death three weeks later.
The legal recourse
“This is a clear-cut case of marital rape,” said Syeda Bushra, a lawyer at Karachi-based Legal Aid Society, which provides free legal aid. She has handled sexual violence cases for nearly a decade.
While no specific law currently defines marital rape, the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Act of 2013 holds husbands accountable as violators.
“Though the law may not explicitly mention marital rape, its broadened definition under Section 376 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) allows prosecution of husbands,” explained Bushra.
This marks a significant shift from Section 375 of the PPC, which previously exempted marital sex — an exemption removed in 2006 by the Protection of Women (Criminal Laws Amendment) Act.
Bushra described marital rape as “undeniably a form of domestic abuse” but noted it remains rarely reported. Many women choose divorce instead, as marital rape is still taboo and often not even recognised as such.
Government surveys reveal grim realities: the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) reported that 47 per cent of respondents in 2012–2013 considered wife-beating justifiable — a figure that only slightly declined to 43pc by 2017–2018. The World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 2023 data paints an even darker picture, showing that 85pc of married women in Pakistan experience physical or sexual violence — far higher than Bangladesh’s 53pc and India’s 29pc.
Islamabad-based gender and governance expert Fauzia Yazdani highlights how religious texts and traditions are often deliberately misinterpreted to justify abuse. Supporting Yazdani’s view, lawyer Bushra notes that women brave enough to seek justice frequently face defence attorneys citing selective Quranic verses to defend their husbands. “It’s not just disturbing — it’s deeply problematic,” Bushra said.
A push for accountability
While activists challenge these harmful narratives, legal experts push for accountability within the justice system.
“The cruelty of the act that led to Shanti’s death means her husband may face charges of both rape and murder, setting a vital precedent for criminalising marital rape,” said Bahzad Akbar, a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society who has specialised in gender-based violence cases for four years.
In 2022, Akbar secured Sindh’s first-ever marital rape conviction, where the husband was sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and fined Rs30,000 (USD 106) for sodomy. But it took two years for the verdict.

Today, with the 2021 Anti-Rape Act having established special courts, Akbar is hopeful for a swift trial and justice in Shanti’s case.
“Shanti’s case will be a test for society,” he said, “Offering hope to women enduring sexual abuse in marriage that justice is possible.”
Tragically, Shanti’s case did not spark widespread outrage.
“That’s because she was a woman, and in this society, women are seen as disposable,” explained Yazdani.
According to her, gender-based violence is rarely recognised as a crime in Pakistan’s collective mindset, which is why it remains inadequately addressed within institutions.
“There’s still no official definition for misogyny and patriarchy; there are no local terms capture these concepts,” she said, holding the government, the judiciary, the police, the country’s opinion makers, and even independent oversight bodies responsible for failing the Pakistani women “over and over again.”
This disconnect between societal attitudes and institutional responses, she argued, creates a void that even robust laws struggle to bridge.
Legal experts acknowledge that while Pakistan has strong laws protecting women, enforcement remains weak.
“When laws are made in a social vacuum, what do you expect; they will remain ineffective,” observed Yazdani.
Lack of awareness
That disconnect between law and lived reality is starkly visible in the experiences shared by healthcare professionals.
“I meet smart, accomplished women who still believe they have no right to refuse their husbands. Many see sex without consent as their marital duty,” said Dr Azra Ahsan, a senior gynaecologist and obstetrician based in Karachi.
After years of hearing young, married women quietly confide their pain — often long after the damage was done — Dr Ahsan became convinced that sexual and reproductive health (SRH) education is crucial to raising awareness about reproductive health, including marital rape.
To fill this gap, she and a group of like-minded doctors at the Association for Mothers and Newborns (AMAN) — the implementation arm of Pakistan’s National Committee for Maternal and Neonatal Health — developed Bakhabar Noujawan (Informed Youth), an online SRH program endorsed by the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, launched in 2023.
“We’re trying to introduce it in colleges, but convincing faculty is an uphill battle — they first need to grasp the course’s importance,” she said.
Covering over two dozen culturally sensitive topics — from premarital counselling, child and cousin marriage, domestic violence, STIs, to teenage pregnancy — the programme doesn’t shy away from tough conversations. “We’re now developing a module on marital rape,” says Ahsan, head of AMAN. “The first draft is nearly complete.”
Alongside SRH education, Sayed emphasised the need for mental health and emotional wellness programs.
“Too many young people carry the trauma of childhood sexual abuse,” she said. “As they grow, that buried pain can manifest in troubling ways — some develop sadistic or masochistic behaviors, especially when exposed to unchecked pornography. It doesn’t heal them; it deepens the harm.”
Lawyer Akbar, who has handled nearly two dozen child sexual abuse cases over the past four years, said 70pc involved incest. At Karachi’s three medicolegal centers, Sayed reports four to eight sexual violence cases daily, yet only three alleged marital rape cases were recorded in 2024 — underscoring severe underreporting.
Experts say this silence stems from deeply entrenched norms conditioning women to endure abuse rather than speak out.
“Even today, parents tell their daughters at marriage, ‘Your husband’s home is your final home — you should only leave it in death’,” said Yazdani, adding that Pakistani society remains bound by social mores that consistently deny women their rights. “She is compartmentalised and viewed only through the lens of relationships, her duty simply to obey the men around her — father, brother, husband, even her son.”

A highly exorbitant rate set for Pakistan’s region by official broadcaster of the Asia Cup based in India plus the uncertainty prevailing over the pinnacle clash of the event between Pakistan and India, the chances are bleak that any sports channel in Pakistan could buy the broadcasting rights for the continental showpiece.
The Asia Cup is scheduled to be held from Sept 9 to 28 at its new venue — the United Arab Emirates (UAE) — where it was shifted from original hosts India, due to Pakistan-India political tensions and also due to stra­ins between India and Bangladesh.
According to well-informed sources, Asia Cup’s official broadcaster has set significantly higher rate for Pakistan’s region. It is learnt that the broadcaster, having secured Pan-Asia broadcast rights in a $170 million deal valid until 2031, is now demanding that Pakistan broadcasters pay a staggering 25% of the total broadcasting rights value whereas the country has been contributing no more than 10% of the event’s regional broadcast worth.
“A 10 to 12 per cent value rate for Pakistan’s region is decided in the books of the ICC and the ACC but the Indian broadcaster is demanding a very high rate from Pakistan’s sports channels that are interested in covering live matches.
“It ultimately may force all Pakistan-based channels, either to make a joint consortium to buy the rights or to quit the race altogether,” one of the officials closed to the situation told Dawn on the condition of anonymity.
“They [Indian broadcasters] are over-leveraged and gambling with market stability. If this backfires, the repercussions could destabilise the entire ecosystem,” the official added.
He continued: “The consortium [of Pakistan sports channels] may agree to pay higher rate but there is no clarity if an Indo-Pak match will be played [during the Asia Cup].”
With television advertising revenue in Pakistan down more than 22% year-on-year, and corporate sponsorship budgets in freefall, these inflated demands from the (Asia Cup) broadcaster appear not only unrealistic, but dangerously detached from commercial reality, sources are claiming.
Another point of worry for Pakistan sports channels has also increased to manifold as the Indian broadcasters had sold out the Asia Cup digital rights to a Pakistan-based consortium for approximately $4.3 million.
In case India and Pakistan reach the Asia Cup final, they will have played three matches against each other in the event — a big deal for broadcasters.
“[The] Indian cricketers are facing pressure from their fans at home creating a situation which may compel India’s top players to refuse to play the Asia Cup or even the BCCI to quit as hosts,” the source added.
“In such a negative situation prevailing [currently] while time is running short to meet the Indian broadcasters’ demand, it does not seem possible for a single sports channel in Pakistan to strike the [broadcasting] deal on these [higher] rates.
“While the negotiations are on with the Asia Cup’s official broadcaster, it is not ready to demand less from Pakistan’s region even in case there is no Pakistan-India clash in the continental event,” the source revealed.
In the past, when a Pakistan-India bilateral series was part of ICC’s decided schedule of activities the PCB had to sign a deal with broadcasters for the entire calendar for two different likely scenarios — first if India-Pakistan play in a bilateral series and second if they do not face each other.
Also a Pakistan Television (PTV) official, on the condition of anonymity, told Dawn that uncertainty was prevailing for Pakistan over the Asia Cup broadcasting rights.
“In negotiations with the official broadcasters, we are trying to resolve the matter to ensure Pakistan fans watch live matches of the Asia Cup. However, the situation is tricky and no one can say what will happen in the end,” the PTV official said.
PAKISTAN TEAM’S FEEBLE SHOW
Moreover, another source said that Pakistan’s sports channels are also concerned about the national team’s below-par performance in international events during the past two years.
“The factor of Pakistan team’s poor performance is also having impact on the market rate of TV commercials,” the source said.
“When your team look strong contenders, the enthusiasm of fans is always high that also attracts commercial market to invest. But ironically this is not the situation [currently] and Pakistan are facing one defeat after the other; they could not excel even in the [2025] Champions Trophy as hosts.”
Pakistan’s 2-1 T20 series loss in Bangladesh last month has further dented the team’s market price that could be further damaged if the Green-shirts lose the T20 series in West Indies, starting on Friday (in Pakistan wee hours).
“In the home leg [June 2025], most local broadcasters participated and saw modest returns. But come July, for the away matches in Bangladesh, only PTV Sports [channel] stepped in to secure exclusive rights. It proved to be a pyrrhic victory — revenues nosedived by nearly 50%, and with Pakistan losing the series, fan engagement cratered,” another official of a sports TV channel told Dawn on the condition of anonymity.
“Despite these warning signs, PTV has doubled down. In a bold — and some say baffling — move, the state broadcaster has tabled a hefty bid for non-exclusive rights to the upcoming Pakistan vs West Indies series in August. The series is scheduled for early mornings, traditionally a commercial dead zone. A couple of other major TV channels have quietly exited the race, citing poor return on investment,” he further said.
Other sources watching the situation closely said that there were still chances that the BCCI will bow to pressure of the hostile Indian public – which campaigned even against the online participation of its officials in the Asian Cricket Council’s annual general meeting held in Bangladesh on July 24.
Due to that campaign, the Indian team also refused to play the semi-final against Pakistan at the World Championship of Legends in Birmingham on Wednesday.
The same pressure from Indian public may force the BCCI to leave the Asia Cup hosting rights and ask the ACC to give the event to any other member, and also withdraw their team from the event.
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi is also the incumbent head of the ACC. Though Mohsin is getting the credit of holding successfully the recent ACC meeting in Dhaka, he may now face a significant challenge of holding the Asia Cup successfully.

The West Texas Intermediate light crude cargo will be loaded from Houston this month and is expected to arrive in Karachi in the second half of October, Qureshi said.
“This is a test spot cargo under our umbrella term agreement with Vitol. If it is commercially viable and available, we could import at least one cargo per month,” he said, adding that the shipment was not meant for resale.
The deal follows months of multiple negotiations, which first began in April, he said, after US President Donald Trump threatened to impose 29pc tariffs on imports from Pakistan.
On Thursday, Pakistan hailed a trade deal struck with the US, its top export market, and said the agreement would increase investments. The White House said on Thursday the US will charge a 19pc tariff on imports from Pakistan.
Qureshi said Pakistan’s finance and petroleum ministries encouraged local refineries to explore US crude imports after the April tariff announcement.
Vitol did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside of office hours.
A key China ally, Pakistan has been warming up to Trump after he threatened tariffs. It has credited US diplomatic intervention for ending recent hostilities with neighbouring India and nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Oil is Pakistan’s biggest import item, and its shipments were valued at $11.3 billion in the year ended June 30, 2025, accounting for nearly a fifth of the country’s total import bill.
The import deal will help Pakistan diversify its crude sourcing and reduce reliance on Middle Eastern suppliers, who account for nearly all of its oil imports.
“Gross refining margin is on par with Gulf grades, and no blending or refinery tweaks are required,” Qureshi said.
Cnergyico can process 156,000 barrels of crude per day and operates the country’s only single-point mooring terminal near Karachi, enabling it to handle large tankers, unlike other refiners in Pakistan.
The company plans to install a second offshore terminal to allow larger or more frequent shipments, and to upgrade its refinery over the next five to six years, Qureshi said.
The refiner, which has been operating at an average refinery run rate of 30 to 35pc due to tepid local demand, is betting on growth in demand for oil products.
“We expect run rates to rise as domestic demand strengthens and local production is prioritised over imported fuels,” Qureshi said.
Trump said on Wednesday the US would also cooperate with Pakistan to develop the South Asian country’s “massive oil reserves”, without providing further details.</p><small>2025-08-01 06:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/011046529b325e1.jpg?r=105108' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927894/man-arrested-for-posting-sacrilegious-content-in-mansehra' target='_blank'><strong>Man arrested for posting ‘sacrilegious’ content in Mansehra</strong></a><br><p>MANSEHRA: The police on Thursday arrested a man who allegedly posted sacrilegious content on social media.
“We have arrested an accused under the blasphemy law and started investigation,” Iftikhar Khan, the sub-inspector, told reporters.
A group of people lodged the FIR with the city police, stating that an accused who belonged to the city area had posted sacrilegious content on social media.
 
 

“We have lodged an FIR against the accused under sections 295a and 298a by the order of the district police officer, Shafiullah Khan Gandapur, and arrested him from his residence,” he said.
Mr Khan said that following the arrest of the accused, the team, which also collected the evidence, had started investigation. “The police have also seized the record for forensic analysis,” Mr Khan added.
FUNDS SOUGHT FOR LOCAL GOVTS: The Pakistan Muslim League (N) on Thursday demanded of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to empower and release development funds to local governments or wrap this system.
“This system has become a financial liability on the government and a headache for its members as successive governments during the last three years neither accepted its members as the public representatives, nor released development funds,” Babu Ashraf, the district information secretary of PML-N, told a presser here.
Flanked by other officer-bearers, he said that his party’s chairmen Sheikh Mohammad Shafee, Sardar Shah Khan, and Ibrahim Shah from Mansehra, Baffa-Pakhal and Balakot tehsils respectively and around 100 village and neighbourhood councils had jointly demanded of the government to release development funds and devolve administrative powers to them under LG Act 2013 or else do away with this system.
“The chairmen of tehsils, village and neighbourhood councils and local government’s employees at their offices have been receiving around Rs2 billion in salaries annually, while sitting idle at their offices,” Babu Ashraf said.
“We have 4200 village and neighbourhood councils across the province and their employees and chairmen were receiving huge amounts under non-developmental budget annually,” Mr Ashraf said.
“Without funds and administrative powers to local governments, a huge amount under non-development expenditure is being wasted,” he added.

The alliance was forced to move its conference to a private farmhouse after authorities placed barriers at its intended venue, Tulip Banquet Hall, organisers said
TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar said that when he and other leaders, including Mehmood Khan Achakzai, arrived at the Tulip Banquet Hall, the venue management was absent.
“Barriers were placed there and it was made impossible to go there,” Mr Khokhar said. “We held a press conference there and then we decided to move the venue to my farmhouse located in Tarlai.”
 







Urges ‘democratic’ forces to unite and draft a new charter to restore democracy

The conference, attended by opposition parties, lawyers, and media figures, criticised what speakers called the “undemocratic behaviour” of the government.
Speaking to the participants, Mr Achakzai said the group gathered for the supremacy of the constitution, freedom of the judiciary and media, and restoration of the ‘stolen’ public mandate from Feb 8 elections.
“As everyone knows, on the night of February 8, a brazen robbery of the public mandate took place through money and coercion,” Mr Achakzai said. “Whoever paid the highest price was awarded victory with a check mark. What followed was the auction of the entire state apparatus — consciences, government jobs, and public resources were all put up for sale.”
Mr Achakzai argued that “powerful undemocratic forces have treated the Constitution as nothing more than a piece of paper”.
 






He claimed that after the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) party was stripped of its electoral symbol, voters still overwhelmingly chose its candidates, only to have their mandate “snatched at gunpoint” by the night of Feb 9.
He asserted the country was engulfed in corruption, with 45 per cent of the population living below the poverty line, and questioned military actions in certain regions.
“Areas in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and other Pashtun and Baloch regions are routinely subjected to bombardment and shelling,” he said. “What was the fault of the unarmed people of Tirah and the innocent children of Bajaur who were riddled with bullets?”
Mr Achakzai appealed to all “democratic” forces to unite and formulate a new consensus charter and social contract.
In a warning to the international community, he said any agreements made by the current government regarding national resources have no legal legitimacy because the government does not represent the people.
A formal resolution from the conference is expected to be released Friday.

BANNU: Smoke billows from an alleged terrorist hideout, which was destroyed by security personnel during an intelligence-based operation.—Dawn

LAKKI MARWAT: At least six law enforcement personnel were injured in a quadcopter attack on Miryan police station in Bannu district on Thursday amid an ongoing operation against terrorists in the Nurar area.
A police official said a joint intelligence-based operation was launched by police, security forces and Counter-Terrorism Depar­tment (CTD) commandos targeting terrorists in the Miryan police station area. The operation followed intelligence about the presence of “Fitna al-Khawarij” — the state’s term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) — in the region.
“During the aerial att­a­ck, a quadcopter dropped explosives on the police station, causing an explosion that left two army soldiers, three CTD personnel and one police constable inju­red,” the police official said.
The wounded officers were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital and the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu.

Miryan police station targeted by aerial strike

The official said the ongoing security operation has resulted in the destruction of several terrorist hideouts. Law enforcement personnel have set up barriers and cordons at various points in the area, carrying out raids and strikes on terrorist hideouts.
The operation came after the presence of over 200 terrorists in the Miryan police station area had caused panic among residents of Nurar five days ago. Armed groups of Fitna al-Khawarij militants roamed the streets, forcing local businesses to shut down and prompting civilians to stay indoors, halting all business activity.
 
 

“The timely and effective actions of law enforcement have forced the terrorists to flee the area,” the police official said, adding that targeted operations continue to ensure the terrorists are arrested and eliminated.
Residents of the area described the situation as curfew-like, with business activities halted as a result of the security operation. Bazaars and markets were closed and many villagers stayed indoors.
Reports indicated that loudspeakers in local mosques issued warnings in the early hours of Thursday, urging residents to stay at home and cooperate with the security forces conducting the operation.
 
 

Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan confirmed that the region would be purged of terrorists at all costs. He emphasised the police’s commitment to taking firm action against anti-law elements to restore peace to the area. He said terrorists have suffered heavy casualties during ongoing operations.
RPO Khan also visited the hospital to check on the injured personnel and praised their bravery.
The RPO directed the hospital management to ensure high-standard treatment for the inju-red officers.

The assessment came in the thirty-sixth report of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, which was submitted to the UN Security Council Committee earlier this week.
The report, covering January to June 2025, warned that terrorist groups were increasingly likely to exploit regional tensions between India and Pakistan to expand influence and carry out attacks.
After the Pahalgam attack that killed 26 people, Pakistan and India engaged in a brief but inte­nse conflict in May, trading heavy fire and missiles for several days.

Says TTP given ‘permissive environment’ by Kabul; has ties with IS-Khorasan, Al Qaeda, Baloch insurgents

The Resistance Front (TRF) initially claimed the attack but later withdrew its claim. The incident reignited debate over TRF’s alle­ged ties to Lashkar-i-Tayyiba (LeT).
“One member state said the attack could not have happened without Lashkar-i-Tayyiba (LeT) support, and that there was a relationship between LeT and TRF,” the report said.
“Another member state said that the attack was carried out by TRF, which was synonymous with LeT. One member state rejected these views and said that LeT was defunct.” The member states with diverging views were not named.
‘Substantial logistical and operational support’
It also said that the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) continued to receive “substantial logistical and operational support” from Afghanistan’s de facto authorities and maintained tactical ties with Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), Al Qaeda, and Baloch separatist groups.
The report said that the TTP, operating under a “permissive environment” inside Afghanistan, has access to a range of weapons that have enhanced the lethality of its operations. “TTP had approximately 6,000 fighters and continued to receive substantial logistical and operational support from the de facto authorities,” it said.
 
 

The report said that in Central and South Asia, various groups, including the TTP, acquired weapons (including Nato-standard) and equipment through cross-border smuggling and black-market trade.
“Member states reported that some of these groups employed “asymmetric” unmanned aerial vehicle attacks on Pakistani military installations in Sibi, Balochistan Province, and Machi, Punjab Province,” the report added.
Despite internal debates within the Taliban leadership about the need to distance itself from TTP to improve regional ties, member states assessed that the group’s operational capabilities remain robust. The report also cited instances of TTP training separatists in Balochistan and sharing facilities with Baloch separatists in southern Afghanistan.
“One member state reported that, in January 2025, TTP provided training to terrorists in Balochistan,” the report said, adding that “they (TTP and BLA) shared four training camps, including ones in Walikot and Shorabak and that Al Qaeda provided ideological and weapons training”.
However, others, who disagreed with the assessment about the TTP-BLA nexus, suggested that their coordination could be tactical at best in the shape of a non-aggression pact rather than a formal alliance. It added that the TTP also maintained tactical-level connections with IS-K. “Some member states reported that [the] TTP maintained tactical-level connections with [IS-K],” indicating operational coordination that enhances TTP’s capabilities in carrying out high-profile attacks in the region. Additionally, TTP shared training facilities with Al Qaeda.
Afghanistan’s Taliban regime was once again accused of enabling terrorist groups present on its soil. “The de facto authorities in Afghanistan continued to maintain a permissive environment for a range of terrorist groups, including Al-Qaeda and its affiliates, posing a serious threat to the security of Central Asian and other countries,” the report warned.
Rising IS-K threat
Islamic State-Khorasan (IS-K), more commonly known as ‘Daesh’, was identified as the most significant current terrorist threat in the South and Central Asian region, with an estimated 2,000 fighters. The report used the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) to refer to the terrorist group.
The group, led by Sanaullah Ghafari, as per the report, continues to recruit across Afghanistan, Central Asia, and the Russian North Caucasus, while targeting Shia communities, foreign nationals, and Taliban officials.
The report also noted IS-K has been indoctrinating children for suicide missions. “In North Afghanistan and areas close to the Pakistani borders, IS-K indoctrinated children in madrassas, establishing a suicide training course for minors aged approximately 14 years old,” the report said.
Although Taliban crackdowns have weakened IS-K’s capabilities, it continues to operate with “relative impunity,” leveraging a diverse base of fighters, including Central Asians and female supporters.
Al Qaeda’s diminishing strength
The report said Al Qaeda’s footprint in Afghanistan has diminished significantly, with limited resources and reduced numbers, largely confined to six provinces: Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, Kunar, Uruzgan, and Zabul. However, the group retains aspirations for a global resurgence.
“Member states assessed that Al Qaeda in Afghanistan did not present an immediate threat for regional states since it possessed limited resources and had been drastically downsized,” the report noted.
The global network remains operational. Sayf al-Adl, believed to be the group’s de facto leader, has reportedly tasked senior operatives with reactivating cells in Iraq, Syria, Libya, and parts of Europe. Meanwhile, Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) has grown more confident under Osama Mahmoud, who was formally named emir in March 2025. “There were concerns that the confidence and ambition of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) were increasing,” the report said.

The case, registered by the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), Makran, accuses a seven-year-old boy of sharing the video of a speech by human rights activist Gulzar Dost in Turbat.
The boy was presented in a court on Thursday.
Officials said the controversial speech delivered by Mr Dost was shared on TikTok by the minor, which was a crime under the Anti Terrorism Act, since the orator was placed in the Fourth Schedule by the provincial government.
Mr Dost has been in detention for the last two weeks.
HRCP ‘appalled’
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has condemned the action.
In a statement, the commission said it was “appalled” by reports that a minor has been presented before an anti-terrorism court on charges of “terrorism” for allegedly sharing the speech of a rights activist on social media.
The “misuse” of anti-terror laws reflected a “gross violation of child rights and due process”.
“We demand the immediate withdrawal of charges, a thorough review of the FIR and accountability for the officials responsible for this alarming overreach,” the HRCP statement added.

The bodies of Abdul Majeed, 40, his wife Mrs Sakeena, 28, and their three-year-old son, Abdul Nabi, were recovered from their home near Ghaghar Phatak on Wednesday.
The couple had married of their own freewill about seven years ago. The police believed that the gruesome incident was linked with their marriage. The victims bore multiple injuries apparently caused with sharp-edged weapon, like axe.
The couple hailed from Lasbela where coffins were taken to but the relatives of the woman did not allow the burial in their area. Eventually, the bodies were brought back and laid to rest near Ghaghar Phatak, according to police and rescue services officials.
An Edhi Foundation spokesperson said in a statement that they had transported the bodies by ambulances to Lasbela but the couple’s relatives resisted their burial there. The bodies had to be brought back to the Edhi morgue at Sohrab Goth, he said.
Steel Town SHO Aslam Billu said that Imam Bakhsh, the brother of the deceased Abdul Majeed, had come to Karachi from Lasbela on Wednesday night to lodged an FIR against the deceased woman’s brother Shahzad alias Raja in the triple murder case.

ISLAMABAD: A Pakistani satellite has been successfully launched from China’s Xichang Satellite Launch Center, the national space agency announced on Thursday.
The Pakistan Remote Sensing Satellite-1 (PRSS-1), aboard a Kuaizhou-1A carrier rocket, was launched at 10am (GMT+8) on Thursday.
It has successfully entered its preset orbit, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has said.
The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said the new Remote Sensing Satellite will be a major milestone in Pakistan’s space exploration efforts and strengthen its position in Earth observation capabilities.

Celestial object to help in urban planning, disaster management, food security, ecology protection

“The Remote Sensing Satellite will provide imaging capabilities to revolutionise urban planning, disaster management, food security, and environmental protection. It will also greatly aid in monitoring climate change, managing water resources, mapping agricultural patterns and tracking deforestation,” said the space agency.
 
 

The launch was a result of the collaboration between Suparco, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation and MICROSAT China.
The satellite will support precision agriculture to boost crop yields, monitor infrastructure growth and urban expansion, and enable more effective regional planning.
It will also enhance disaster management efforts by providing timely warnings for floods, landslides, and earthquakes, while tracking glacier recession and deforestation.
Suparco Chairman Muhammad Yousaf Khan said the satellite would support national priorities across multiple sectors and will contribute towards sustainable socio-economic development.
It will contribute to national development initiatives such as CPEC by mapping transportation networks and identifying geohazard risks, Suparco said.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who witnessed the launch ceremony as the chief guest, said the event was not only a technological milestone, but a “moment that lifts our national spirit and elevates our friendship with China”.
The Chinese embassy in Pakistan congratulated the country on the satellite’s launch.
In a post on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Suparco on the successful launch and thanked Chinese partners for their contributions to the project.

• Medvedev brushes aside Trump’s attack
NEW DELHI: By declaring the Indian economy as dead in the water on Thursday, President Donald Trump has put Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his party in a bind. Until recently, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was canvassing support for the US president’s election. Its supporters were holding special prayers and muttering mystical chants for Trump’s victory. There was at least one temple created where a sculptured image of Trump was worshipped.
But Trump has ignored the lavish praise and called out India’s energy imports from Russia and its tariff regime as non-negotiable.
 
 

The Indian government said it was trying to figure out a response by consulting all the “stakeholders”, a euphemism for angry businesses whose hopes were riding on Mr Modi’s daring ability to play both sides of the street.
That appears to have hit a dead-end. Encouraging words have come from former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev who poohpoohed Mr Trump’s vitriol and continued to see a world in good cheer despite the US president’s hissed warnings.
On the other hand, opposition leader Rahul Gandhi was sanguine that Trump was right at least about the state of the Indian economy. “He [Trump] is right. Everybody knows that the Indian economy is a dead economy, except the prime minister and the finance minister. I am glad that President Trump has stated a fact.
“The whole world knows – India’s economy is a dead economy and the BJP has destroyed the economy. Why did they destroy it? To help Adani,” said Mr Gandhi while speaking to reporters outside the parliament on Thursday.
Mr Gandhi was carefully silent about India’s Russia ties. The reference to tycoon Gautam Adani seemed more severe as the billionaire businessman close to Mr Modi is facing a corruption case in the US.
Rahul Gandhi’s statement came hours after Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that a 25 per cent tariff, plus a penalty, will be imposed on India starting Aug 1. The Modi government has responded to it saying that it “will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest”.
Later on Wednesday, Trump mou­nted a sharp attack and said: “I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Medvedev’s ‘unmoved’
In Moscow, Mr Medvedev responded to Trump’s comments with studied calm, saying they were “nervous reaction” and are evidence that Moscow is pursuing the right path.
The US president had described Medvedev as a “failed” former leader and warned him to “watch his words”, adding that Medvedev was “entering very dangerous territory”.
Medvedev was unmoved. “If some words from the former president of Russia trigger such a nervous reaction from the high-and-mighty president of the United States, then Russia is doing everything right and will continue to proceed along its own path,” Medvedev, who currently serves as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council, wrote on social media.
He also ridiculed Trump’s claim that the Russian and Indian economies were “dead” and going “down together” due to lack of cooperation with the US.
Medvedev had earlier dismissed Trump’s demands for Moscow to swiftly end its military campaign against Ukraine, calling the threats of secondary sanctions against Russian energy customers “theatrical” and ineffective.
Trump previously criticised the BRICS group of nations, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and several other states, for pursuing a new multipolar world order. The US president claimed proposed tariffs on countries doing business with BRICS members could cripple the organisation.
Trump’s statement regarding India and Medvedev followed New Delhi’s refusal to accommodate US demands on trade.
Mr Gandhi said that the Modi government had “destroyed India’s economic, defence and foreign policy. They are running this country into the ground”.

According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), the heavy rainfall led to flooding in Khatam village in Ghizer’s Gupis Valley, blocking the Ghizer-Shandur Road and damaging agricultural land and private properties.
The floodwaters also caused significant damage to the irrigation channel in Ghalapan village in Gojal, upper Hunza, which provides water for over 50,000 forest trees, according to residents.
The Gilgit-Baltistan government has declared 37 villages across the region as calamity-hit areas. According to a notification issued by the GB Home and Prisons Department, the affected areas include 12 villages in Diamer, nine in Gilgit, five in Ghizer, four each in Skardu and Shigar, two in Ghanche, and one each in Nagar and Kharmang.
 
 

GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement that the recent floods across Gilgit-Baltistan have caused an estimated Rs20 billion in damages. The floods have destroyed infrastructure, homes, agricultural land and public utilities.
Mr Faraq added that 22 vehicles were swept away by the floods, while 10 people, mostly tourists, have lost their lives. Four individuals have sustained injuries and between 10 and 15 tourists are still missing. Search operations are currently underway.
Over 500 homes and agricultural land, crops, roads, bridges and both public and private infrastructure have been significantly damaged.
The Gilgit-Baltistan government has initiated emergency and rehabilitation operations across the affected areas.
Pakistan has been grappling with severe flooding caused by cloudbursts, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and intense monsoon rains since June. These extreme weather events have resulted in several deaths and injuries across the country, with the Gilgit-Baltistan region among the hardest hit.

The plan was approved at a meeting of the civil and military leadership on Thursday.
The meeting of the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ (Harden the State) was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. It was also attended by the chief of army staff, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
A source privy to the meeting told Dawn the prime minister addressed the meeting, which was covered by the media, and followed by a closed-door session.

High-level meeting finalises strategy to eliminate threat posed by terrorists

“The meeting decided how the next phase of the National Action Plan can be implemented,” the source said, while referring to the counterinsurgency plan made after the horrific attack on Peshawar’s Army Public School in 2014 in which over 140 children were killed.
Under the strategy, people from all segments of society will be taken on board to play their role in eradicating terrorism and extremism.
The meeting also discussed the repatriation plan for Afghan refugees and decided to expedite the process, the source added.
According to an official press release, PM Shehbaz said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to “completely eliminate” the threat posed by menace posed by the proscribed Fitna al-Khawarij — the official term for the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan — and other militant outfits.
“Pakistan is working on a comprehensive, effective and workable strategy to completely eliminate Fitna al-Hindustan, Fitna al-Khawarij and other such anti-social elements,” the prime minister said.
 
 

The prime minister said the state had adopted a “multi-pronged strategy” to use ground operations, legislation and meaningful public communication discouraging extremist thinking.
The prime minister directed the committee to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments and strictly implement the recommendations.
PM Shehbaz lauded the role of security personnel and law enforcement agencies who have taken “very effective steps” in the war against terrorism.
“With the joint actions and cooperation of all the relevant institutions, effective actions were taken against smuggling, which made it possible to prevent it,” he said.
The prime minister said only a peaceful and strong state structure free from terrorism could restore the confidence of investors at the international level.
