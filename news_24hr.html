The petition was filed after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, along with several other PTI members, staged an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi, where Imran has been imprisoned since 2023. The sit-in was staged as CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the eighth time on Thursday.
Previously, Imran’s sisters, including Aleema, had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI ended its latest sit-in on Friday morning, with the KP CM announcing that they would be approaching the IHC, where Aleema has now filed a contempt plea.
Apart from Adiala Jail Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum, Saddar Beroni Station House Office Raja Aizaz Azeem, Federal Interior Secretary Capt (retd) Muhammad Khurram Agha and Punjab Home Department Secretary Noorul Amin have been named as respondents in the plea.
The plea, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated that Aleema had “remained deeply concerned about the well-being, legal rights, and humane treatment of her brother during his ongoing incarceration”.
The petition referred to the IHC’s March 24 order, in which the court had reinstated the twice-a-week meeting schedule for Imran. It said Aleema sought the initiation of contempt of court proceedings “on account of the wilful non-implementation of the orders passed by this honourable court, particularly with respect to the authorities’ failure to allow” her meetings with Imran, in line with the court’s directives in March.
It further stated that “due to the persistent non-cooperation” of the Adiala jail superintendent and “ongoing political victimisation”, Imran and others were “constrained” to file writ petitions before the IHC, seeking the enforcement of visitation rights.
“However, despite the clear and unequivocal directions of this honourable court, the respondents have failed to comply and have repeatedly denied access to the legal counsel, family members, and associates” of Imran on multiple occasions, it added.
The plea further recalled that in line with previous court orders, the respondents had devised on March 28, 2024 standard operating procedures (SOPs) for meeting Imran. According to those SOPs, Tuesdays and Thursdays were “designated for interviews with Imran by his family/ lawyers and friends, respectively”.
Despite directions for allowing visits to Imran on Tuesdays and Thursdays, “the respondents did not comply with or implement the same”, the plea said.
It recalled that the Adiala Jail superintendent had also submitted an undertaking to the IHC on November 8, 2024 that Imran’s friends would be allowed to meet him on Tuesday the following week and his family and lawyers would be permitted to meet him on Thursday, according to the list provided by the ex-premier.
But when several PTI leaders went to Adiala Jail to meet Imran on November 11, 2024, the superintendent “caused them to wait for several hours and thereafter unlawfully detained them in police custody”.
The plea alleged that the respondents were “wilfully flouting” the court orders and the undertaking submitted to it, and “conducted themselves to ridicule the authority” of the IHC.
It said their actions were an “apparent activity of serious contempt of this honourable court, for which they are liable to be dealt with under criminal proceedings”.
The plea sought the initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondents for not complying with the IHC’s March 24 order and urged the court to punish them in accordance with the law “to meet the ends of justice”.
It also sought the court’s directives for the respondents to comply with its March 24 order.
‘Was told CJ did not want to meet us’
Aleema, along with KP CM Afridi, had reached the IHC in the morning, where the two intended to meet the IHC chief justice.
However, while speaking to the media at the IHC, CM Afridi said that they were informed that the high court chief justice “did not want to meet them”.
The provincial chief executive lamented that no one had been allowed to meet Imran or his wife, Bushra Bibi, since October 27. “We know nothing about his condition,” he said.
“Neither his sisters are allowed to meet him, nor his [party’s] leadership, nor lawyers, nor doctors.”
He also recalled a sit-in staged by Imran’s sisters outside Adiala Jail on November 19. The PTI has alleged that police had manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion.
“The whole nation saw what happened. Imran Khan sahib’s sisters were dragged along the road by their hair, pushed down and disrespected. Even though they have no connection with politics; they just go to see their brother.”
The KP CM said he, along with six other people, had asked jail authorities yesterday to allow them to speak to Imran for “just two or three minutes”.







“We also assured them that we will not talk about politics or administrative matters. We said we just wanted to find out about his health.
“But we were still not allowed to meet.”
CM Afridi alleged that the KP and its government were facing discrimination, saying that “in other provinces, Pakistan Air Force planes were used for the chief minister’s travel”.
“By such actions, you are creating division. You are causing resentment and distances to grow,” he said.
He alleged that efforts were being made to “put Pakistan’s strongest political party against the wall” with its leader being discriminated against and his family, party and government in KP being targeted.
“You are worsening the situation yourselves,” CM Afridi said, warning that if it worsened further, “neither side would be able to bring it under control”.
He announced that the PTI had also decided not to let National Assembly and Senate sessions scheduled for today proceed “because we want our leadership and Imran Khan sahib’s sisters to be allowed to meet him”.
The legislatures were not of any use if they could not deliver justice to their representatives, he decried.
“Business as usual will not go on after this” until the PTI founder was allowed to meet his sisters and party leadership, he added.
The KP chief minister said that they had called on “all parliamentarians, from all over Pakistan”, to gather and protest peacefully outside the high court on Tuesday before proceeding to Adiala Jail.
“The Constitution and the law give us the right to protest,” he said. “We will definitely use this option,” he said, adding that if their constitutional right to meet Imran was granted, the PTI would not turn to protest.
‘Entire focus on one illegal demand’
Meanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar accused the PTI, including KP CM Afridi, of adopting an approach in which governance for the people was pushed to the back burner.
“And the entire focus is on one illegal demand that political guidance is to be taken only from the [party] founder serving a sentence in Adiala jail in a corruption case,” he added. “This is against jail rules,” he claimed.







Highlighting the importance of KP in the context of the fight against terrorism, he said: “Instead of the provincial government prioritising peace, progress and relief for the public, the party leadership kept itself busy in Islamabad by centering its politics on this illegal narrative”.
Continuing his accusations, he added: “Allegedly, a woman politician from the PTI […] ran a vile campaign regarding Khan sahib through anti-Pakistan accounts operating from Afghanistan and on the Indian media. This was an attempt to defame Pakistan worldwide.
“This approach is open enmity against Pakistan […] The PTI should abandon the anti-Pakistan narrative and [its] wrong priorities and now give preference to the interests of the people and the state.”
Failed efforts
Imran’s family and the PTI have repeatedly accused prison authorities of “sabotaging” meetings with him.
Among them, KP CM Afridi has been seeking a meeting with the former prime minister since his election on October 13.
He had taken his oath as the provincial chief executive on October 15 and gone to Adiala jail to meet Imran the very next day after getting protective bail from the Peshawar High Court. However, he was turned away after a wait of two hours.
On Oct 17, he moved the IHC, seeking a meeting with Imran, and wrote a letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi with the same request.
The plea was taken up on October 23 along with several other similar ones by an IHC bench, which directed the Adiala jail superintendent to implement the high court’s March 24 order.
However, Afridi’s attempts to meet the PTI founder have failed so far.
Yesterday was the eighth time that he was denied a meeting with Imran since becoming the provincial chief executive.
Visuals reposted by the PTI on X showed CM Afridi, along with other party workers, offering Fajr prayers outside the jail on Friday morning before they ended the sit-in. Other images showed Afridi and others huddled around a fire.
Earlier, on November 19, the PTI had held a protest outside the jail as the jail administration did not allow party leaders and the PTI founder’s family to meet him. The party alleged that police manhandled and “violently detained” Imran’s sisters on the occasion.
An hours-long sit-in was also held more recently on November 25 and was wrapped up at the request of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir.
Concerns about Imran’s health
Meanwhile, the PTI had expressed concern over Imran’s health while incarcerated, as he has been barred from seeing his family and lawyers for over three weeks.
Former PM’s aide Zulfi Bukhari said no one has seen Imran since November 4 and no reason has been given for denying meetings.
“His health is our concern. We are worried about his illegal isolation,” Bukhari told Reuters, demanding the government give Imran’s family immediate access to him.
A jail official told Reuters that the former premier was in good health and that he was not aware of any plans to move him to any other facility. He spoke on the condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.
The Interior Ministry did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment.
Amid media reports that the 73-year-old former international cricketer might be moved to a high-security prison to make meeting him more challenging, international media outlets such as Japan’s Nikkei and the BBC also covered the concern over his status. His well-being became a talking point on social media with the trend ‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trending on X in the morning. The interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
But yesterday, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah and senior PTI leaders dismissed reports of former premier Imran Khan’s ill health, with both sides stating that the PTI founder is ‘fine and nothing is wrong with him’.

Earlier this week, Dr Ali Mohammad Mir, Senior Director of the Population Council, outlined decades of haphazard, poor planning and misplaced policy directives on the part of successive governments that have led us to the dismal point we have reached today, where if nothing is done, Pakistan’s population is set to reach 385 million by 2050.

         View this post on Instagram            

While most of the concern about this rapid growth rate is framed in purely economic terms, very little attention is given to the actual women who bear the burden of both childbirth and childcare.
It is also not a coincidence that Pakistan is regularly placed at the bottom of international indices related to women’s rights, appearing at 148 out of 148 countries in the Global Gender Gap Report in 2025.
The persistence of patriarchy is fundamentally linked with Pakistan’s unsustainable population growth rate. Hence, any effective population policy must place women’s well-being and autonomy at the centre of planning.
The dismal state of women’s rights
In terms of women’s economic participation, Pakistan has been among the bottom ten worst-performing countries in the world, according to the World Economic Forum. Only about 25pc of women are engaged in paid employment, and only 18pc of labour income goes to women. The higher birth rate, linked to the idea that a woman’s primary role is as a mother, is one of the reasons behind a low rate of economic participation.
Women in Pakistan perform the vast bulk of unpaid labour within the home. According to UN Women’s ‘Progress of the World’s Women 2019-2020’ report, for every one hour a man spends on unpaid care and domestic work, Pakistani women spend 11 hours doing the same.

Of course, a higher birth rate means a higher amount of unpaid labour for women who are most often the primary caregivers for children.

In terms of financial security, women are in an extremely poor position, with only three per cent of women as compared to 72pc of men owning a house and two per cent of women as compared to 27pc of men owning any land, according to the National Institute of Population Studies.
This also means women are more dependent on producing male offspring as a form of security, which would incentivise having more children in the hopes of having a son. There is a clear link between the desire for more sons and a higher birth rate.
The Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey (PDHS) 2012-2013 found that 60pc of women with three sons did not want any more children, while only 21pc of women with three daughters felt the same.
When it comes to health and survival for women and girls, Pakistan ranks 149 out of 153, according to the World Economic Forum, which includes a measure for reproductive rights and accounts for a worrying sex ratio of 92pc (as opposed to the naturally occurring rate of 94pc) of girls born as compared to boys.
A skewed sex ratio is an indication of the practice of son preference; this has direct links with higher fertility rates overall.
Pakistan has one of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the region, with 11,000 maternal deaths occurring annually, and with underdeveloped parts of the country, such as Balochistan, showing some of the highest rates of maternal mortality in the world. If contraceptive use rises from 34pc to 52pc, 3,800 mothers’ lives could be saved annually.

It is telling that Aurat March’s slogan ‘mera jism, meri marzi’ was met with severe backlash across the country, underlying the anxiety surrounding women’s bodily autonomy.
This is reflected in statistics related to women’s decision-making surrounding their own health. In Pakistan, 41pc of women reported making decisions about their own health with their husbands, 37pc of women reported that these decisions were made primarily by their husbands, and only 10pc of women reported taking these decisions themselves, according to the National Institute for Population Studies.
This has direct implications for women’s ability to engage in decision-making regarding their reproductive health, as women who report higher decision-making capacity within the family are much more likely to engage in reproductive health-seeking behaviour.

While many may oppose the use of contraceptives for religious reasons, the idea that this is the main reason for the low uptake of contraceptives is largely untrue. In fact, many people would like to use modern methods of contraception,~~ but simply do not have access. The contraceptive prevalence rate in Pakistan is 35,~~pc while the overall demand is 55pc. The overall fertility rate could be decreased to 3.1 births per woman if this need was met.
A lack of female empowerment in terms of education and decision-making is one of the main reasons for such a low contraceptive usage rate, combined with a basic failure in terms of service provision. Because of the high rate of unwanted pregnancies, Pakistan also has one of the highest abortion rates in the world, many of these conducted in extremely unsafe and unhygienic conditions.

 

One of the factors contributing to high birth rates is the continued practice of early marriage amongst women and girls. According to the PDHS 2017-2018, young women aged 15-19 are more likely than young men to be currently married (14pc versus three per cent), which means both that their childbearing years are extended and that they are less likely to be able to assert any kind of authority over their reproductive choices, according to the National Institute for Population Studies.
Hence, all available evidence points to a clear link between a prevailing lack of gender equality and a continuously high population growth rate.
Empowering women and girls: A virtuous cycle
The long-term success of any family planning policy depends on the empowerment of women and girls, and the empowerment of women and girls can only take place if fertility levels are reduced.

Policies, therefore, must keep women and girls’ empowerment at the centre of planning efforts. This means moving away from blunt targets and focusing instead on improving the economic and educational opportunities for women and girls, along with improving access to quality healthcare overall.

This also requires an overall change in social attitudes, particularly amongst men, who often stand in the way of women’s empowerment.
Pakistan clearly has a long way to go both in terms of the achievement of gender equality and sustainable population growth, but the future need not be so grim. While the indicators may be far from ideal, the last four decades have shown some promising trends.
The fertility rate has declined significantly, even if progress is slow, and the number of women and girls who are gaining formal education and engaging in paid employment is also steadily increasing.
This is the time when policymakers should be making a coordinated push towards accelerating these processes by focusing their attention and investing resources in promoting an approach to family planning that centres the empowerment of women and girls.
Such efforts would spark a virtuous cycle—both helping to stabilise the currently unsustainable population growth rate and moving Pakistan closer to fulfilling its commitment with regard to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls.

The move has prompted an outcry from residents, who have planned a demonstration in front of the Bahria Town offices after Friday prayers.
Muhammad Ramzan Butt, the chief executive officer of the Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco), said that Bahria Town had defaulted on its payments.
“They have failed to pay a total of Rs682m on four bulk power supply connections,” he told Dawn.
“We will not restore the power supply till the bills have been paid,” he asserted.
According to him, the initial deadline for paying the bills was November 21, which was then extended to November 23 at the request of the Bahria Town officials. However, they continued to file for extensions till November 26 (Wednesday), he said.
The Lesco official said that the last deadline was November 27. “Instead of paying the bills, they have reportedly approached the court,” he said.
“However, before the court could intervene, we disconnected the power supply to four projects,” Butt said.
According to the bills — copies of which are available with Dawn — Bahria Town (M/S Bahria Town PVT LTD) has to pay over Rs530m, followed by Bahria Orchard, which has to pay Rs137m to the power utility.
Meanwhile, Bahria Education City has to pay Rs5.465m, while another Bahria town project, by M/S Kingrete Associates, has to pay Rs2.70m.
“As soon as they clear the outstanding dues, our teams will immediately restore the power supply,” the Lesco CEO pledged.
On the other hand, residents criticised the Bahria Town administration as well as Lesco for not taking action to restore the power supply.
“Since yesterday evening up until now, we are functioning without electricity,” Fayyaz Ahmad, a resident of Bahria Town, told Dawn.
“The food in the refrigerator has also gone bad,” he said.
“It seems as if we are living in a jungle — no electricity and no warm water to take a bath either,” he said, adding he had decided to temporarily move to his brother’s house in light of the current situation.
In 2024, Lesco had disconnected the power supply to Bahria Town over the non-payment of more than Rs762m in electricity bills.
The real estate company has come under scrutiny before as well for power issues. In June last year, scores of residents in Bahria Town’s operations in Islamabad petitioned against overbilling and deductions by the management on electricity generated through solar power.</p><small>2025-11-28 10:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/281031271bbf668.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957715/rising-uae-visa-rejections-leave-pakistani-travellers-in-limbo' target='_blank'><strong>Rising UAE visa rejections leave Pakistani travellers in limbo</strong></a><br><p>When 28-year-old Nadeem, a marketing professional from Lahore, planned his first leisure trip to Dubai this year, he never imagined it would turn into a months-long ordeal. He applied for a visit visa through a travel agency, confident it would be a “routine process”. Instead, his application was rejected twice: first in January, then again at the beginning of November.
The agency handling his case told him the reason was simple: he was “under 40”, and younger applicants were facing higher scrutiny. For Nadeem, who chose to be identified by his first name only, the explanation only added to the confusion already circulating among frustrated travellers.
“I don’t understand it. What does my age have to do with anything? I’m employed full-time, and I submitted my bank statement. My friend, a freelancer, got it on the first attempt. I have applied for a third time, so I’m keeping my fingers crossed, but it’s exhausting,” he told Dawn.
Visa rejections have recently become a recurring issue for Pakistanis travelling to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), despite the Gulf country’s close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties with Pakistan. Abu Dhabi is Islamabad’s major trading partner in the Middle East and a key source of remittances, hosting a large Pakistani expatriate population.
On Thursday, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry told the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights that the UAE had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis, though he clarified there was no formal ban on Pakistani passports. Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who heads the committee, told Dawn that the restrictions were imposed due to concerns about travellers “getting involved in criminal activities,” and said very few visas had been granted lately, “after much difficulty.”
The issue has persisted for months. In January 2025, the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis was informed that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”. Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig said the UAE had reservations about Pakistanis on visit visas potentially “resorting to begging”.
The following month, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the UAE, Faisal Niaz Tirmizi, described the Gulf country’s refusal of visas to Pakistani nationals as a “serious and significant” issue. In comments to Arab News, he said Emirati authorities had raised concerns about the authenticity of documents, including educational credentials, as well as cases involving applicants with criminal records. “If they find a dichotomy somewhere, even if the document is genuine but the attestation either in Pakistan or in the UAE is not genuine, it could cause major rejections,” Tirmizi said, adding that AI-based verification systems were now being used.
In April, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa.
Despite these assurances, early July saw renewed problems. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi raised the issue with his UAE counterpart, and during a July 11 meeting, UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured full support in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens.
Yet, travellers continued to face obstacles.
Fatima Attarwala, a journalist, recalled her attempts to cover Gulfood, a major event in Dubai: “My visa got rejected twice. First, we went through one agency, then to the official agency coordinating the event, but every visa application for those under 45 was rejected. Even company directors’ visas weren’t approved in the first round. The second round only granted visas to applicants over 45 years of age. It’s not a Pakistan-only problem — people from Africa and other countries also faced the same.”
Syed Abbas Raza Naqvi, 25, who works for an American company, said he received repeated rejections despite corporate sponsorship. “I started trying in September last year for a conference in January. My company provided the invitation and all the supporting documents, but it still didn’t work. I tried three times. Eventually, a ‘guaranteed visa’ was issued at a higher fee, but the process remains opaque and stressful.”
Abbas applied for a five-year, multiple-entry visit visa in September this year, only to be rejected again.
“The visa cost $1,200 (Rs 339,000). I was refunded $650, but it was still a significant loss. Luckily, my company covered the expense, but overall, it was a disheartening experience,” he lamented.
A tech entrepreneur from Karachi, 36, who also had their visa rejected, told Dawn on the condition of anonymity that they had tried in September this year. “I then applied for a fresh visa rather than through my first application. Surprisingly, it was then granted in the same month.”
Muzamil Asif, a sports journalist assigned to cover the Asia Cup in Dubai, was unable to travel after his visa was rejected, despite having the necessary accreditation and documentation.
“Our travel agent said ‘100 per cent rejection’ for Dubai visas. Every agency refused to apply. The Pakistan Cricket Board advised applying via Abu Dhabi, but even then, the process was uncertain. In the end, my visa was rejected because I’m a single man under 35. The ticket and hotel bookings were already done, and my news outlet lost nearly Rs100,000.”
Travel agencies corroborated the trend.
Saher Nazeer, the customer services representative at Visa Express Karachi, told Dawn that “first-time and single-entry visa applications for Dubai face 70 to 80pc rejections, while family ties improve chances”.
A manager at Trips Travel & Tours, speaking anonymously, added that single visas had an approval rate of just 20pc, whereas family visas see around 80pc acceptance.
Ubaid Sajjad, a travel agent at AEG-Visa, cited strict financial requirements to get a visa. “You have better chances if you provide a six-month bank statement with around Rs3 million,” he said. “Insufficient funds are the major reason for single visa rejections.”
Meanwhile, Quratulain, an agent at Premio Travel & Tours, said “previous overstaying and unclear financial documentation” were the causes for rejection.
Discussions on Pakistani social media reveal wider frustration. Reddit users described blocked transit visas and contradictory messages from agencies like VFS Global, with one user noting that professional status or age often determined whether a visa would be approved. Some users said there was effectively a “ban on visit visas for Pakistanis in Dubai” due to concerns over alleged illegal migration.
However, a senior diplomat at the UAE embassy, who wished not to be named, dismissed the speculation, telling Dawn that “there is no ban on UAE visas for Pakistani citizens”.
“The UAE government issues visas daily to various categories of applicants. However, some Pakistani travel agents had tampered with applicants’ data in the past, leading to issues, after which a centralised visa system was introduced,” he said.
He added the UAE had set up three biometric desks at the embassy to ensure transparency in the application process.
“There are 2.27 million Pakistanis residing in the UAE, who can sponsor their families under the new law. However, those with criminal records — those who have tampered with their data — are being asked to correct their records,” the diplomat said.
On the other hand, UAE Ambassador Zaabi shared major visa facilitation reforms with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Thursday, including online processing, e-visas without passport stamping, and faster system-to-system linkages. According to a post on the Ministry of Finance’s X account, nearly 500 visas are processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan.







Despite the diplomatic assurances and recently announced reforms, the experiences of Nadeem and other Pakistani visa seekers show how uncertainty still hovers over the process.
“It feels like you’re playing a lottery with your plans, your work commitments, and your money,” a dejected Nadeem told Dawn over the phone. “I just want to know if I can go or not and be done with it.”

“One in six people worldwide experience infertility during their lifetime,” said Pascale Allotey, the global health body’s head of sexual and reproductive health.
“The condition affects individuals and couples across all regions and income levels.
“And yet access to safe and affordable care remains highly inequitable.”
Allotey told reporters that the issue of infertility had been neglected “for far too long”.
The new guide would provide a “unified, evidence-based foundation” to ensure care is safe, effective and accessible for all, she added.
According to the WHO, infertility is a condition of the male and female reproductive system, defined as the inability to achieve pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual relations.
The situation can lead to major distress, stigmatisation and financial difficulties.
In several countries, most of the cost of infertility tests and treatment is borne by patients, which often leads to “catastrophic financial expenditures”.
“In some settings, even a single round of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) can cost double the average annual household income,” the WHO said.
The guide, published on Friday, sets out 40 recommendations and calls for the integration of fertility in national health funding, services and strategies.
It also wants to see steps for effective clinical management, in both diagnosis and treatment.

Justice Najafi — a member of the three-judge bench of the Supreme Court that had upheld the death penalty awarded to Noor’s murderer — attributed the ghastly 2021 murder to what he described as a vice prevalent in society.
In his additional note, which surfaced on Wednesday, Justice Najafi upheld the sentence handed to Zahir and observed that “the present case is a direct result of a vice spreading in the upper society which we know as ‘living relationship’ [sic]”. It appeared the judge was referring to a live-in relationship, where two unmarried individuals in a romantic relationship cohabitate.

 

The jud­ge also observed that societal compulsions in such non-marital long-term relationships were ignored to defy not only the law of the land, but also personal law under Islamic Sharia which, he regretted, amounted to a direct revolt against Islam.
In a statement issued today, the NCSW said it “strongly condemns” the “misogynistic and irresponsible remarks” made by Justice Najafi.
“Such statements constitute clear victim-blaming and reflect a harmful mindset that shifts responsibility away from the perpetrators of violence and onto women themselves,” the commission said.
“No woman’s choices, real or perceived, can ever justify or explain brutality, murder or any form of gender-based violence,” it added.
The commission further said that the remarks were also in contradiction of a previous judgment by Justice Ayesha Malik, where she emphasised that the language used for victims must be “sensitive, respectful and free from the personal biases of judges”.
According to NCSW, Justice Malik’s judgment clearly called on the judiciary to avoid moralising and stereotyping narratives that shame or blame women.
“The comments made in this case disregard that judicial responsibility and risk undermining public trust,” the statement stressed.
“The NCSW calls on all members of the judiciary to uphold constitutional values, maintain impartiality and ensure that courts remain spaces where survivors and victims are treated with dignity and respect,” the commission stated, adding that justice must be based on facts and law, “not personal judgment or bias”.
The NCSW was established by a presidential ordinance in July 2000 and is a statutory and autonomous body mandated to examine the policies and programmes for women development and gender equality. It also reviews laws, rules and regulations affecting the status and rights of women and suggests repeal, amendment or new legislation essential to promote the interests of women.
The judge’s observations, which surfaced just a day after the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, had triggered criticism from many on social media, including lawyers and journalists.
A day earlier, during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, Justice Najafi’s remarks were deemed “ridiculous”, with the committee questioning what would happen to the conviction rate in cases against women if a judge himself had made such remarks.</p><small>2025-11-28 09:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28121006b6072b4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957894/pti-mpa-anwar-zeb-khan-says-one-injured-after-his-bajaur-home-targeted-in-drone-attack' target='_blank'><strong>PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan says one injured after his Bajaur home targeted in ‘drone attack’</strong></a><br><p>PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan has said that one person has been injured after his home in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Bajaur district was targeted in a “drone attack” last night, it emerged on Friday.
In a video statement posted on his social media account on Thursday, the provincial lawmaker said, “My house in Raghagan, Khar tehsil, was targeted by a drone (quadcopter) attack by unknown individuals tonight, injuring one of my security guards.”
Khan, who said he was in Peshawar at the time of the incident, strongly condemned the incident. He also identified the injured as Zair Muhammad, saying he was rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital in Khar.
Following the incident, police personnel arrived at the scene and initiated an investigation. However, local police have not yet released any official statement regarding the nature of the incident and those responsible.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in a statement, condemned the incident, terming it an act by “anti-peace elements”.
As per the statement, CM Afridi directed police and the relevant authorities to provide an immediate report on the incident.
“The provincial government stands with the people and its elected representatives during this challenging time and will not tolerate such terrorist incidents,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-11-28 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28123311e1a0ad4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957896/shooting-of-national-guard-soldiers-in-washington-heralds-troubling-resurgence-of-terrorism-globally-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Shooting of National Guard soldiers in Washington heralds ‘troubling’ resurgence of terrorism globally: FO</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Friday strongly condemned the shooting of two soldiers of the United States’ National Guard in Washington, DC, saying that the incident “heralds a troubling resurgence of terrorism on a global scale”.
Two National Guard soldiers were critically wounded on Wednesday after being shot a few blocks from the White House, with US President Donald Trump terming the incident an “act of terror”. Trump has since announced that one of the soldiers had died.
In a press release, the FO said, “Pakistan strongly condemns the shooting incident in Washington DC, reportedly involving an Afghan national.
“Our thoughts and prayers are with the departed soldier, and (we) wish the injured a swift and complete recovery,” it said. It also extended sympathies to the families affected, as well as to the government and people of the US.
The FO said the attack was “undoubtedly an act of terrorism and a heinous assault on US soil”.
“For the past two decades, Pakistan has endured countless similar terrorist incidents, with clear linkages to Afghanistan,” it said.
“This incident signifies the challenges posed by transnational terrorism and underscores the need for enhanced global cooperation to confront this menace,” it said.
“The incident heralds a troubling resurgence of terrorism on a global scale. The international community must take note and reinvigorate collective efforts in counter-terrorism,” it said.
“Pakistan remains committed to working with the US and the wider international community to address the shared challenge of terrorism,” it said.







National Guard member dies
Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died of her wounds and her fellow Guardsman Andrew Wolfe, 24, was “fighting for his life,” Trump said on Thursday, as investigators conducted what officials said was a terrorism probe.
The FBI searched multiple properties in a widening investigation, including a home in Washington state linked to the suspect, who officials said was part of a CIA-backed unit in Afghanistan before coming to the US in 2021 under a resettlement programme.
Agents seized numerous electronic devices from the residence of the suspect, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, and interviewed his relatives, FBI Director Kash Patel told a news conference.
US Attorney for Washington, DC Jeanine Pirro said the suspect drove cross-country and then ambushed the Guard members while they were patrolling near the White House on Wednesday afternoon.
“I want to express the anguish and the horror of our entire nation that the terrorist attack yesterday in our nation’s capital, in which a savage monster gunned down two service members in the West Virginia National Guard, who were deployed as part of the DC Task Force,” Trump said in a Thanksgiving call with US military service members.
Casting blame on the administration of his White House predecessor, Joe Biden, Trump said the alleged gunman, who he described as having gone “cuckoo,” was among thousands of Afghans who came in unvetted as the US carried out a chaotic withdrawal in 2021. He provided no evidence to support his assertion.
Trump said the suspect’s “atrocity reminds us that we have no greater national security priority than ensuring that we have full control over the people that enter and remain in our country”.
Armed with a powerful revolver, a .357 Magnum, the gunman shot the two National Guard members before being wounded in an exchange of gunfire with other troops. He was in hospital in serious condition, Trump said.</p><small>2025-11-28 07:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28111211c6aaeb4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957890/hong-kongs-deadliest-blaze-in-decades-kills-at-least-128-scores-missing' target='_blank'><strong>Hong Kong’s deadliest blaze in decades kills at least 128, scores missing</strong></a><br><p>The death toll in a fire that ripped through a Hong Kong residential estate this week has risen to 128, the city’s security chief said on Friday.
Dozens were still missing, Secretary for Security Chris Tang told a press conference, adding that he sent his condolences to those affected.
Flames had moved quickly through the Wang Fuk Court housing estate in Tai Po district on Wednesday afternoon, spreading through the eight high-rises and transforming the densely packed complex into an inferno.
After burning for over 40 hours, the blaze was “largely extinguished” by 10:18am local time on Friday, the fire services said, announcing the end of its operations.
Authorities are investigating what sparked the fire, including examining the bamboo scaffolding and plastic mesh wrapped around the complex as part of a major renovation.
At the charred apartment blocks, workers searched for survivors and pulled out bodies in black bags, with an AFP reporter counting four in one 15-minute period.
Vehicles unloaded corpses at a mortuary in nearby Sha Tin, another reporter saw, with families expected to arrive in the afternoon for identification.
Many remain unaccounted for, although the exact number of missing people has not been updated since early Thursday.
On Friday, authorities said more than 50 people were still hospitalised, with 12 in critical and 28 in serious condition.
At one hospital in Sha Tin, a woman surnamed Wong was looking for her sister-in-law and her sister-in-law’s twin, with no luck.
“We still cannot find them. So we are going to different hospitals to ask if they have good news,” the 38-year-old told AFP in tears.
“We were already waiting at the Prince of Wales Hospital on the first day but there was no news. We also came here yesterday.”
The last contact anyone had with the twins was on Wednesday afternoon, said Wong, around the time the fire was reported.
“One building went up in flames and it spread to two more blocks in less than 15 minutes,” a 77-year-old eyewitness surnamed Mui told AFP.
“It was very quick. It was burning red, I shudder to think about it.”
Investigations begin
The fire was Hong Kong’s deadliest since 1948, when an explosion followed by a fire killed at least 135 people.
Lethal blazes were once a regular scourge in densely populated Hong Kong, especially in poorer neighbourhoods, but improved safety measures have made them far less common.
Hong Kong’s anti-corruption body said on Thursday it had launched a probe into renovation work at the complex, hours after police said they had arrested three men on suspicion of negligently leaving foam packaging at the fire site.
Residents of the estate told AFP that they did not hear any fire alarms and had to go door-to-door to alert neighbours to the danger.
Hong Kong authorities will immediately inspect all housing estates undergoing major work following the disaster, with an emphasis on shifting the sites to metal scaffolding.
Of the 94 people confirmed dead as of 6:00am (3:00am PKT), one was a 37-year-old firefighter and two were Indonesian domestic workers.
Hong Kong’s government announced a HK$300 million ($38.5m) fund to help victims of the fire.
City authorities said they had opened nine shelters and were organising temporary accommodation and emergency funds for those who had lost their homes.
Activities around Hong Kong’s legislative elections, on December 7, have been suspended.
‘Everyone lends support’
Some of the residents in adjacent blocks who had been evacuated as a precaution were allowed back into their homes on Thursday afternoon.
A spontaneous community effort to help firefighters and those displaced had by Friday become a well-oiled machine.
At a public square, separate supply stations for clothes, food and household goods had been set up, as well as booths providing medical and psychological care.
So much was donated that organisers put out a call on social media saying there was no need for more.
“It’s truly touching,” said 38-year-old Stone Ngai, one of the organisers of an impromptu aid station, on Thursday.
“The spirit of Hong Kong people is that when one is in trouble, everyone lends support… It shows that Hong Kong people are full of love.”</p><small>2025-11-28 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636091-india-pulls-out-of-oxford-union-debate-hands-walkover-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>India pulls out of Oxford Union debate, hands 'walkover' to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

“I will permanently pause migration from all third world countries to allow the US system to fully recover. This is necessary because unchecked migration has weakened American society and strained its resources. Until the system stabilises, no new immigrants from these countries will be allowed entry,” Trump wrote.
He did not identify any countries by name or give any specifics about what he meant by “permanently pause”. However, his posts signal a sweeping crackdown that could affect millions of residents from Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean, and which could also alter refugee, Green Card, and other immigration programmes.
The development comes a day after the US government abruptly halted the processing of all immigration requests from Afghan nationals, following the shooting of two National Guard soldiers near the White House. Trump had earlier announced that Sarah Beckstrom, one of the two National Guard troops shot, had died, while the other soldier was “fighting for his life”.
In his posts, he also declared he would denaturalise migrants who “undermine domestic tranquillity, and deport any foreign national who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western civilisation.
Trump argued that US immigration policies had weakened the country despite technological progress and said the nation needed time “to fully recover” from what he called an immigration onslaught.
His posts outlined measures to terminate “millions” of admissions granted under his predecessor Joe Biden, including those signed by “sleepy Joe’s autopen”. He further said he would remove anyone he deemed “not a net asset” to the US or “incapable of loving our country”.







“Those who fail to contribute positively or respect American values will not be allowed to remain. The goal is to ensure that only individuals who strengthen the nation are permitted to live and work here,” he said.
Trump stressed that these reforms would not stop there.
“Only reverse migration can fully cure this situation. Individuals who have entered the US illegally or disrupted American society will be encouraged to return to their home countries. This step is presented as the only way to restore law, order, and stability in the US,” he said.
He also pledged to end all federal benefits for non-citizens, in an effort to ease the financial burden on American taxpayers.
“All federal benefits and subsidies for non-citizens of our country will be ended. This includes welfare, health care, and other support programmes that previously went to migrants. The policy is meant to stop the financial burden on American taxpayers and prioritise citizens first,” he said.
In one post, Trump attached a picture of Afghans being airlifted and wrote: “This is part of the horrendous airlift from Afghanistan. Hundreds of thousands of people poured into our country totally unvetted and unchecked. We will fix it, but will never forget what crooked Joe Biden and his thugs did to our country!”







The US president added that “these goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations”.
On Thursday, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Director Joseph Edlow announced that the president had ordered a “full-scale, rigorous reexamination” of every Green Card issued to immigrants from 19 countries listed in a June presidential proclamation.
These countries include Afghanistan, Haiti, Iran, Somalia, and Venezuela — but not Pakistan.
“The protection of this country and of the American people remains paramount, and the American people will not bear the cost of the prior administration’s reckless resettlement policies,” Edlow wrote on Truth Social.
Millions of Green Card holders and permanent residents from these countries could face scrutiny, even if they have lived in the US for years.
Trump had immediately linked the shooting of the two National Guard soldiers to immigration, stating that the shooter, identified as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, had been flown into the US in September 2021 and later had his status extended under Biden-era policies.
CIA Director John Ratcliffe confirmed that Lakanwal had worked with US forces in Kandahar and was admitted as part of partner forces, but described the admission as part of “the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan”.
The Pentagon confirmed the deployment of an additional 500 National Guard personnel to Washington, adding to the 2,200 already stationed in the capital.
USCIS also suspended all immigration requests from Afghan nationals pending a review of vetting and security procedures, leaving roughly 200,000 Afghans in limbo.
In his posts, Trump also framed immigration as “the single greatest national security threat,” asserting that the previous administration had admitted “20 million unknown and unvetted foreigners from all over the world.”
“Any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefit to our country… If they can’t love our country, we don’t want ’em,” he said, signalling that his administration intended to pursue aggressive enforcement measures.
The combined directives point to an unprecedented federal review of immigrants, refugees, and Green Card holders from third world countries, potentially affecting millions of families abroad who seek to migrate or are already in the United States.

The uptick in Pakistan’s fuel oil exports has added to supply in Asia, weighing further on prices in a market that is already well-supplied, traders and analysts said.
Fuel oil exports from Pakistan reached a fresh high this year, shipping data from Kpler and LSEG showed.

 

Exports so far this year have breached 1.4 million tonnes (about 8.9m barrels), up over 16pc from the full-year volume in 2024, the data from Kpler showed, with most of these exports ending up in Sou­th­­east Asia and the Mid­dle East. LSEG data sho­w­­ed exports at 1.33m tonnes so far in 2025, up from 1.11m tonnes last year.
The cargoes were most­­ly high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) and added mainly to marine fuel supply, while some volumes went to refineries as feedstock, market sources said.
“Pakistan primarily ex­­ports HSFO to Asia which have been seeing an exc­e­­ss in supply post-summer season and have depressed cracks in the region,” said Valerie Panopio, vice president for oil commodity markets at Rystad Energy.
Pakistani refiners sold more fuel oil via tenders this year after the government raised taxes for domestic fuel oil consumption, while power generators gravitate towards alternatives such as coal and solar.
The leading Pakistan fuel oil exporter was Pak-Arab Refinery, according to traders, while other ex­­p­orters included Cnergyi­­co, Attock Refinery, Natio­nal Refinery and Pakistan Refinery.
Cnergyico, which is the country’s largest oil refiner, has said it aims to boost exports. The company exported about 247,000 tonnes of fuel oil in 2024-25, its vice-chairman Usama Qureshi said.
Mr Qureshi added that he expects at least 50pc growth this fiscal year, supported by increased use of light-sweet crude that lifted its output of very low sulphur fuel oil.
The company has partnered up with global trading house Vitol to supply more low-sulphur marine fuel from Pakistani ports.
“The trend in furnace oil exports is only going to increase going forward in 2026,” said Syed Nazir Abbas Zaidi, secretary general of Pakistan’s oil companies advisory council. “Fuel oil is no longer viable in electricity generation, and no longer profitable to sell in the domestic market, following the last budget,” he said.

At the conclusion of the three-day 10th Pakistan-Russia Intergovernmental Commi­ssion (IGC) on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation, the two sides also signed three memoranda of understanding (MoUs) for cooperation in quality standards, anti-monopoly regulation and the media sector.
The Nov 25-27 IGC was co-chaired by Energy Minister Awais Leghari and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Tsivilev.







“The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to a broad, forward-looking partnership that supports the socio-economic development of Pakistan and the Russian Federation and contributes to regional stability and connectivity,” an official statement said.
Both sides expressed satisfaction with the constructive discussions on enhancing bilateral trade, diversifying export portfolios and strengthening business-to-business engagement.

At 10th Intergovernmental Commission, both sides agree to boost cooperation in trade, business and education

They reiterated the importance of continued cooperation to facilitate trade fairs, exchanges between business communities and improved market access for key Pakistani products, including textiles, sports goods, IT services, engineering items and agricultural commodities.
The two delegations also acknowledged the significance of advancing the pilot cargo movement along agreed corridors and confirmed their intention to operationalise a pilot train, marking a tangible step towards improving regional logistics and connectivity.
Energy cooperation remai­ned a central element of the dialogue, with both sides noting positive engagement in the oil and gas sectors, opportunities in LNG and LPG supply frameworks, and the importance of technical collaboration.
They also emphasised the potential for renewable energy, hydropower development, and water-related technologies, including hydrological monitoring and flood resilience.
In the industrial and technology sectors, discussions covered pharmaceutical cooperation, including insulin localisation, modernisation of the Pakistan Steel Mills’ metallurgical capacity, and possible ventures in heavy machinery, mining, and advanced manufacturing.
The two sides underscored the importance of scientific, academic and technological collaboration and reiterated plans to finalise intergovernmental agreements on higher education, the mutual recognition of degrees and scientific cooperation, alongside expanding scholarships, joint research and academic mobility in engineering, medical sciences, IT and space technology.
In this regard, both sides welcomed initiatives to establish Rus­s­ian language centres in Islamabad and Karachi. A special ceremony was hosted by the Federal Directorate of Educa­tion (FDE) at the Islamabad Model College for Boys I-8, where a centre for Russian language learning is being launched.
The delegations also expr­essed appreciation for expanding cultural, educational and people-to-people exchanges, including school partnerships, youth programmes and cultural outreach efforts.
During the session, the Russian delegation met survivors of the 2005 earthquake, highlighting the humanitarian solidarity between the two nations, and a cultural performance by Russian artists was held at the PNCA.
Pakistan acknowledged the installation of the Yuri Gagarin statue in Islamabad as a symbol of friendship and scientific coope­ration between the two nations.
The session also discussed avenues for cooperation in hum­anitarian and disaster management. The National Disa­ster Mana­gement Autho­rity (NDMA) of Pakistan and the Ministry of Emergency Situa­tions of the Russian Federation agreed to explore collaboration on early warning systems, emergency response training, and resilience-building measures.
The two sides also discussed opportunities in sports cooperation, tourism promotion and strengthening media and cultural linkages to support grea­ter public understanding bet­ween the peoples of both countries.
The three MoUs signed at the end included one between the Pakistan Standards and Qua­lity Control Authority (PSQCA) and Russia’s Federal Agency for Technical Regulation and Met­ro­logy to strengthen collaboration in standardisation, metrology, and conformity assessment.
The second MoU was between the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) and the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia to support cooperation in competition law, exchange of expertise and capacity building.
The third MoU was signed by the state-run news agencies — Associated Press of Pakistan and Russia’s Sputnik — to enhance media cooperation and professional exchanges.
The two sides also decided to hold the 11th session of the Pak­is­tan-Russia Inter­gove­rnmental Commission in the Russian Federation in 2026 on mutually convenient dates.

Sources told Dawn that Justices Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar and Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had packed their personal effects and shifted them back to their respective residences over the past week.
According to court officials, the judges instructed their staff to separate all books, documents, decorative pieces, and other personal effects that they had brought to the IHC after their elevation. The staff completed the packing earlier this week, and the material was quietly moved out of the high court building.

 

Sources said that the directions to pack up their chambers were issued shortly after the 27th Amendment came into force. The amendment has fundamentally altered the judicial structure by creating the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) and enabling the transfer of high court judges without their consent.

Insiders say three judges have moved out their personal belongings

Two of the three judges — Justice Sattar and Justice Jahangiri — were appointed on Dec 30, 2020, and would remain entitled to pension and post-retirement benefits if they submit their resignations after Dec 31. Justice Sardar Ejaz, appointed on Dec 17, 2021, does not qualify for such benefits under the current rules unless the president exercises discretionary authority to relax the criteria.
The three judges are among the six IHC judges who last year wrote a letter to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) alleging interference of intelligence agencies in judicial affairs. The letter had triggered a debate over the independence of the judiciary and prompted calls for an inquiry from various quarters. Following this, five of the judges — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz, and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — challenged the transfer of three judges to the IHC earlier this year.
The transferred judges — Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro, and Justice Mohammad Asif — were moved from the Lahore, Sindh and Balochistan high courts in February.
Justice Dogar later became the chief justice. The transfer orders were contested before a constitutional bench of the Supreme Court, which dismissed the petition on June 19. The judges then filed an intra-court appeal before the newly established FCC, which also rejected their plea.
Separately, four of the five judges — excluding Justice Jahangiri — attempted to challenge the 27th Amendment before the Supreme Court under Article 184(3). However, the Supreme Court’s registrar’s office refused to entertain their petition, advising them instead to approach the FCC, which now holds exclusive jurisdiction over constitutional matters under the amendment.

What they rarely acknowledge is something far more hopeful — this region is, quite literally, one of the world’s great democratic zones. One, 40 per cent of the world’s democracy lives in South Asia. Second, all eight countries have some positive or unique features that others can learn from.
That is the central argument of my new book, Democracy’s Heartland: Inside the Battle for Power in South Asia. Based on decades of engagement with elections at home and across the region, the book looks at Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka not only as theatres of crisis, but as a laboratory of democratic experiments — some successful, some deeply flawed, but all instructive.
For readers in Pakistan, this regional lens matters. Too often, India and Pakistan are compared only to score points. My aim, instead, is to ask what Pakistan has done that others can learn from, what India has done that Pakistan might adapt, and how both fit into a wider South Asian democratic story.
Pakistan’s recent constitutional history offers one of the region’s most striking examples of political self-correction. After years in which parliamentary practice became distorted, the 18th Am­­endment of 2010 restored a genuinely parliamentary system. It strengthened the office of the pri­me minister, reduced the scope for personalised discretion at the top and showed that constitutions can also be instruments of democratisation.

South Asia must see itself as a community of democratic practice.

Equally important was the federal dimension of that reform. The 18th Amendment did not simply rearrange powers in Islamabad; it pushed authority outward to the provinces. It recognised a basic truth many South Asian capitals resist: a diverse country cannot be run indefinitely from one centre. Provinces need real control over key subjects and resources, not symbolic recognition. Pakistan’s bicameral parliament, with its Senate built on provincial equality rather than population, reflects the same federal instinct.
Pakistan’s electoral framework also contains features comparatively advanced for the region. The National Assembly blends directly elected constituencies with reserved seats for women and non-Muslims, allocated through party lists. This ensures that groups often marginalised in majoritarian systems are present in the legislature by constitutional design rather than party goodwill. In a region where representation of women and minorities remains weak, Pakistan’s embedded guarantees merit serious study.
There is also a quieter story of democratic resilience that is easy to miss from the outside. Parties sidelined at different moments have repeatedly returned to the arena through elections. Civil soc­iety, lawyers and a vigorous media have pushed back whenever civic space narrowed. Voters have never abandoned the idea that elections are the only legitimate route to power. That stubborn commitment to the ballot is, in itself, a democratic resource.
At the same time, the fragility of these gains cannot be ignored. The recent 27th Amendment, passed in November 2025, has triggered a heated debate by reshaping Pakistan’s institutional balance. It grants lifetime legal immunity to certain office-holders and creates a new Federal Constitutional Court to take over constitutional cases from the Supreme Court. Critics fear this may weaken judicial independence and concentrate power in new ways. My purpose here is not to analyse one amendment, but to note what it underscores: democratic advances require constant vigilance. The same Pakistan that produced the 18th Amendment and deepened federalism now faces new tests in protecting those gains.

 

Just as other South Asian states can learn from Pakistan’s constitutional rebalancing, devolution and inclusive electoral design, Pakistan can also draw lessons from India’s experience. The first is the value of uninterrupted constitutionalism. In­­dia’s constitution, despite many amendments and a dark chapter during the Emergency, has happily survived. Institutions have had time to acquire habits; citizens have developed expectations about how power should change hands. Pakistan’s 1973 Constitution has now lasted longer than any previous charter. Protecting its continuity, rather than reinventing the state every decade, is essential for entrenching democratic reflexes.
A second area is election management. As former chief election commissioner of India, I have seen how much difference a credible election commission can make. For most of the republic’s life, the election commission of India has enjoyed cross-party legitimacy as a neutral arbiter. Pakis­tan’s Election Commission has been strengthened over time, but it operates in a more demanding environment. Further insulating it from day-to-day pressures, investing in a professional election machinery down to the polling station and allowing it to speak confidently in the public sphere are reforms that can draw on regional experience, while remaining Pakistani in design.
A third lesson is the normalisation of alternation in power. India has seen long periods of dominance, followed by coalitions and then by the rise of a new national formation. Governments have risen and fallen; leaders have lost and returned. Losing an election has become part of political life, not an existential crisis. Pakistan is already moving in this direction, with different parties and coalitions forming governments in Islamabad and the provinces over the last decade and a half. Consolidating that habit — accepting that no leader or party is permanent, only the rules are — may do more for democratic stability than any single constitutional clause.
In Democracy’s Heartland, I argue that South Asia must see itself as a community of democratic practice. Instead of treating each other only as cautionary tales, our eight countries should treat each other as case studies. Pakistan’s constitutional self-corrections, devolution of power and inclusive electoral design should be part of that shared learning; so should India’s constitutional continuity, large-scale election management and culture of alternation.
If Pakistani readers take away one message from my book, I hope it is this: South Asia is not just a region of crises. It is also a reservoir of democratic imagination. Whether we are prepared to learn from each other’s experiments — and mistakes — will determine whether this region can truly live up to its role as the heartland of democracy.

A key part of the new regulation makes the asset declarations of public servants accessible to the public. This will allow citizens to review a complete trail of an officer’s holdings from the point they join government service onward. The decision was announced on Thursday through an income tax not­i­fication SRO2263 that amends the ‘Sharing of Declaration of Assets of Civil Servants Rules, 2023’.
It significantly broadens the definition of a term “public servant” to include a wider range of government employees under the disclosure framework.
The term now includes officers in BPS-17 and above working for federal or provincial governments, as well as personnel in autonomous bodies, state-owned corporations and firms .
The only officials not covered by the new rule are those protected under an exemption listed in the National Accountability Ordinance of 1999.
Previously, the requirement was limited to a narrow definition of officials serving under the Civil Servants Act of 1973, which left a large number of public sector officers outside the reporting structure.
By bringing personnel across multiple layers of government and SOEs into a single disclosure structure, the authorities intend to create a more uniform standard of accountability.

Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” — Aristotle
WHY nations fail is the sum total of why humans fail. Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson, in their seminal work Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty, focus on why people with the same geography, the same genetics and the same culture, sometimes living in neighbouring countries, can prosper or decline remarkably differently. Few books have captured my interest as strongly as this one. The authors rightly got the Nobel Prize in 2024.
The rise and fall of nations depends upon collective attributes which lead to the creation of different organisational systems and practices in societies. The collective attitude of a nation begins with the individual. Indeed, individuals in a society demonstrate all kinds of qualities but the character of a nation is determined by the predominant attitudes and behaviour of individuals.
What then makes individuals different? From where do these differences come and how do some develop qualities that take them far in life while others do not change throughout their life? And how so? This is an important question and has bothered many for long. Stephen R. Covey, a big name in leadership and management and the author of global bestsellers (the best known is his classic The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People) also started his professional life with this fundamental question and spent a lifetime researching, writing and explaining the origins of human effectiveness.
He explains in the beginning of this book what he learnt while reviewing literature on human success spanning over 200 years in the US since 1776. He underlined the key emphasis by all writers on character ethic as the foundation of success. Character ethic is made up of characteristics such as integrity, humility, fidelity, temperance, courage, justice, patience, industry, simplicity, modesty, and the golden rule of ‘do unto others as you would have them do unto you’. The teaching of the character ethic is that people can only experience true success and enduring happiness as they learn and integrate these principles into their basic character.
His seven habits were eventually a precipitate of all that he learnt from writers on character ethic over centuries, as well as world religions, not just in America but globally. He referred to these habits as the principles of effectiveness — and principles, unlike values, are timeless truths.

The rise and fall of individuals and nations is not a coincidence.

The essence of these principles begins with the recognition of our life paradigm, that is, our invisible glasses through which we look at the world — in other words, our worldview. It is only when we become mindful of our paradigm that we can realise the importance of paradigm change. The power of paradigm change is also the basis of human conflict resolution.
The other important insight he shares is the framework of human effectiveness that begins inside-out. A personal victory — that is a victory within oneself — is an absolute precondition for any private victory — that is a manifest success. There is no shortcut to this route. No one can positively change the world, nobody ever has or ever will, without first changing oneself. This is a timeless fundamental truth.
In Covey’s framework, there are three habits which need to be developed to change ourselves and three others to be effective outside and then a seventh one to renew.
For inner world change, the first habit to develop is to learn how to be proactive. Rather than reacting to everything all the time, we have to learn how to take things in our own hands by taking initiative. We should inspire the change rather than wait to be inspired. We should select our response to stimuli rather than predictably react to everything. This gives us control rather than being remotely controlled by others.
The second principle is to develop a vision, that is, to develop a habit to begin with an end in mind and then to work towards it. The destination should be clear so that one can travel towards it, rather than feeling lost.
After developing a vision, one can manage oneself better to work towards it by prioritising urgent and important tasks. Most of our time should be spent on important tasks instead of exhausting ourselves with urgent but useless things. This is all about effective time management.
It is only when humans learn to change the lens through which they view the world, become proactive, set a vision and efficiently work towards it that they can affect change in the outside world. The first thing to accept in this context is that interdependence is a higher value than independence. By accepting this, we can work with others in a more respectful and productive way.

 

The first habit in this regard is to create win-win conditions by developing a mental state of abundance, instead of always complaining about scarcity. Others don’t have to fail for you to win. Both parties can win.
The second principle is to listen to others first rather than insisting that others should understand you. Once you have demonstrated empathetic listening you can expect others to listen to you. This is the basis of effective communication.
And the last principle of public victory is to learn to synergise. This is the art of making one plus one eleven rather than two. When this happens in human relationships and in teams, astounding results are achieved.
Renewal, the seventh habit, is all about refreshing and rejuvenating oneself by creating a work-life balance. Even if you have a Rolls-Royce it cannot be run indefinitely without regular fuelling. Humans are same. Four areas need to be regularly nourished: physical, mental, social and spiritual. This makes us ready to take on the world.
These time-tested and timeless habits make a difference at the individual, family and national level. The rise and fall of humans, and that of nations, is hence not just a coincidence.

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi arrives at Adiala jail in Rawalpindi.—Reuters

• Clarification follows concerns expressed by Imran’s son Kasim; Rana Sanaullah also dismisses reports of ex-PM’s transfer to another prison• KP CM Afridi stages sit-in outside jail after eighth snub at Adiala
ISLAMABAD: As reports about PTI chief Imran Khan’s ill health swirled on social and foreign media, both government and PTI figures dismissed such speculation on Thursday, saying the former prime minister — currently held in isolation — was doing well.
The clarification came when PTI activists staged a sit-in outside Adiala jail after authorities did not allow Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi to meet the incarcerated party leader for the eighth time since he assumed office. His sisters and legal team were not allowed to meet Imran, either.
The lack of access to Mr Khan also gave rise to unconfirmed reports about his ill health and transfer to a high-security prison — which were picked up by a Japanese newspaper and the BBC.
‘Where is Imran Khan?’ also trended on X on Thursday morning.
In a statement shared by the PTI, Imran’s son Kasim Khan also called on the international community and global human rights organisations to intervene and “demand proof of life, enforce court-ordered access, end this inhumane isolation” faced by his father.







Against this backdrop, Rana Sanaullah, who advises the PM on political affairs, told ARY News that Mr Khan was fine and his health was being taken care of. “There is a team of doctors that checks him on a weekly and daily basis [and looks after his] medicine, diet, facilities [and] exercises.” He said Mr Khan was getting everything befitting his position and status, adding that the PTI chief was still present in Adiala jail.
PTI leader Ali Zafar also dismissed reports about Imran Khan’s health in a DawnNewsTV show. “Thank God, the news is baseless, but it is even more important after this report that the government immediately allow us the opportunity of a meeting so we can go and see ourselves,” said the PTI leader, adding that once a meeting was held, they could come out and tell everyone that everything was fine. “We think it is very necessary that a meeting is facilitated with Imran; it’s been a month,” he added.
“There were news reports about Imran Khan, news from India and Afghanistan, attempts were made to spread discord; these reports have been denied. The government cannot harm Imran Khan,” said PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram while talking to Dawn.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry, in an appearance on Geo News, stated that jail officials had already provided information on Imran’s health.
Senate protest
On the other hand, the PTI staged a noisy protest against the alleged mistreatment meted out to the former prime minister. The issue was raised in the House by PTI lawmaker Faisal Javed soon after the question hour. He claimed that Mr Khan had been kept in solitary confinement and regretted that nobody, including his family members, lawyers and doctors, was allowed to see him. “This is against basic human rights, court orders, the jail manual and prison rules,” he remarked.







Minister of State for Interior Talal Cha­udhry, in his response, described Imran Khan as a VIP prisoner enjoying the facilities of exercise machines and a personal cook. He said meetings with a prisoner are regulated under the jail manual.
CM stages sit-in
Meanwhile, a sit-in led by KP CM Afridi continued outside Adiala jail. Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Mehmood Khan Achakzai also joined the protest on Thursday night to show solidarity with the CM.
Mr Achakzai said more sit-ins would be held across the country and “after that people will govern the country”. “It is unfortunate that the CM of a province is sitting outside the jail. MNAs and senators were not being allowed to meet Imran Khan,” he said.
The KP chief minister, who replaced Ali Amin Gandapur last month, had arrived in Rawalpindi in the morning to meet Imran Khan, but the jail administration did not allow him to proceed. The CM and party supporters originally intended to march to the prison, where Imran Khan is incarcerated, but were stopped by a heavy contingent of police officials at the ‘factory naaka’.
The CM asked the officials to inform him in writing regarding the decision to bar him from meeting the incarcerated former premier despite the court orders, but his request was declined.
Amid uncertainty surrounding the health of Mr Khan, CM Afridi later told reporters that he wanted to meet Mr Khan to get “actual information” from him and share it with the nation. He said he had exhausted all legal and political avenues in his attempts to gain access to the PTI leader.

Justice Ali Baqar Najafi’s additional note, published on Wednesday, attributes the ghoulish crime to the “vice” of live-in relationships. At a time when the court ought to speak with moral clarity about violence, accountability and justice, the focus appears to have been shifted to policing personal conduct. Such observations diminish the gravity of the crime and echo the logic often used to excuse violence in our society.
Noor was murdered in cold blood. There is no ambiguity in this. But the note appears to treat the murder as the “horrible consequence” of societal vice. When conclusions shift responsibility away from the perpetrator, it implies that the victim’s choices created the conditions for her own death.
For decades, our society has justified so-called honour killings, domestic abuse and even sexual violence by employing a similar reasoning: that the victim behaved in a way that offended norms, and therefore, suffered the ‘consequences’. For anyone to be seen to employ such reasoning in a case as horrifying and clear-cut as this, is unsettling.

 

Courts do not merely determine guilt, they signal values. When a private relationship is described as a “revolt” against religion and seen to be linked to murder, the takeaway for society is that the victim asked for it. Such a narrative emboldens those who seek to rationalise violence. It also distracts from the fundamental failures the case revealed, such as delayed interventions, passive bystanders and a perpetrator whose privilege enabled impunity until the final act was committed.
Justice was ultimately upheld and that is crucial. But justice must also be accompanied by reasoning anchored in law, not finger-wagging. At a time when gender-based violence remains rampant, especially among the married and those who don’t ignore “societal compulsions”, the principle should be reinforced that no woman invites harm by her choices.

According to statements issued by the High Commission, the debate centred on the motion “This House Believes India’s Policy Towards Pakistan is a Populist Strategy Sold as Security Policy” had been confirmed weeks in advance. It is scheduled for 12:30am PKT.







Pakistan’s delegation, comprising former Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee chairman Lt Gen (R) Zubair Mahmood Hayat, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar and former diplomat Dr Mohammad Faisal, was already in London for the event.
The High Commission claimed that India’s originally announced speakers, General M.M. Naravane, Dr Subramanian Swamy and politician Sachin Pilot, “withdrew at the eleventh hour”, leaving the event without its opposing panel.
It further alleged that India later proposed “obscure and low-profile replacements” that did not match the level of the Pakistani delegation and “undermined the credibility and balance of the debate.”







“The collective retreat of the Indian delegation amounted to an unchallenged victory for Pakistan,” the High Commission stated, adding that India’s withdrawal “exposed the weakness of its narrative on a neutral academic platform”.
Sources familiar with the matter told Dawn that the last-minute shift was “very bizarre”, noting that such debates were typically finalised far in advance and that delegations typically agreed knowing who they were debating.
While the High Commission criticised what it described as India’s reluctance to face open questioning, many on social media questioned the reason behind India’s withdrawal, speculating that it may have been pressure from the Indian government on the panellists.</p><small>2025-11-28 02:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28074431a42c802.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957846/fo-says-use-of-drones-in-attack-on-chinese-workers-in-tajikistan-underlines-gravity-of-threat-emanating-from-afghanistan' target='_blank'><strong>FO says use of drones in attack on Chinese workers in Tajikistan underlines ‘gravity of threat emanating from Afghanistan’</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) has condemned the attack which claimed the lives of three Chinese workers in Tajikistan, saying that the use of armed drones in the incident underlined the “gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it”.
Tajik authorities said on Thursday that three Chinese workers in Tajikistan were killed in an attack launched from Afghanistan near the border. The foreign ministry said a drone and firearm attack hit workers of a Chinese company in the country’s south.
“The attack, carried out with firearms and a drone loaded with grenades, claimed the lives of three employees of Chinese nationality,” it said in a statement. Dushanbe rarely comments officially on such incidents, and it did not say who it suspects carried out the attack.
Subsequently, the FO, in a statement issued early on Friday, expressed Pakistan’s condolences and solidarity with China and Tajikistan over the lives lost in a “heinous terrorist attack in Tajikistan near its border with Afghanistan”.







“Pakistan unequivocally condemns this cowardly attack on Chinese nationals. The use of armed drones in the incident underlines the gravity of the threat emanating from Afghanistan and the brazenness of those behind it,” the FO said.
“As a neighbour that has repeatedly suffered terrorist attacks orchestrated from Afghan soil, the people of Pakistan fully understand and share the grief and anguish of our Chinese friends and Tajik partners,” it said.
“Pakistan has consistently stressed that Afghan territory must not be used for terrorism against its neighbours or any other country. The repeated use of Afghan soil by terrorist elements and their continued presence under the patronage of the Afghan Taliban regime, is a matter of serious concern for the entire region and the wider international community,” it said.
It added that concrete and verifiable action against the perpetrators, abettors, facilitators and financiers of terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil was the only way to address “this growing menace”.
“Pakistan will continue to work closely with China, Tajikistan and other regional partners to promote peace, stability and security in our shared neighbourhood,” the FO said.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned terrorist Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) group remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
Last week, Denmark, in the capacity of the chair of the UN Security Council ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, pointed to the “serious threat” posed by the TTP in Central and South Asia and said that the terror outfit was receiving “logistical and substantial support” from the de facto Afghan authorities.
Meanwhile, Muslim-majority Tajikistan, one of the poorest countries in the former Soviet Union, has been concerned about possible flare-ups in extremism since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.
Militants are active in the mountainous border region, which spans around 1,350 kilometres between the two countries.
Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon, in power since 1992, is openly critical of the Taliban and urged the group to respect the rights of ethnic Tajiks, estimated to make up around a quarter of Afghanistan’s 40-million population.
At the same time, Tajikistan has cautiously engaged in some areas, including through diplomatic meetings, the opening of markets in border towns and supplying electricity.
Tajikistan’s foreign ministry said on Thursday, “Criminal groups located in the neighbouring country (Afghanistan) continue to commit acts aimed at destabilising the situation in the border regions.”</p><small>2025-11-28 02:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2807324292a640f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957806/federal-constitutional-court-moved-against-law-that-created-it' target='_blank'><strong>Federal Constitutional Court moved against law that created it</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: A plea asking the Federal Cons­titutional Court (FCC) to strike down the very law that brought it into being, i.e. the 27th Constitutional Amen­dment, was filed before the newly established court on Thursday.
“It is most respectively prayed that this petition may kindly be accepted and the 27th Amendment passed with ‘malicious design’ may kindly be struck down in the larger interest of justice,” read the petition, which was moved by Advocate Muhammad Shoaib in person.
Earlier on Nov 11, former chief justice Jawwad S. Khawaja challenged the 27th Amendment before the Supreme Court, seeking a direction that the court retains exclusive jurisdiction to determine the vires and constitutionality of the proposed amendment.
At the time, the FCC did not exist as the amendment in question had not yet been approved by parliament.
Similar pleas have been filed before high courts and the Federal Shariat Court, but this is the first time the FCC has been approached to strike down the law that created it in the first place.
‘One-man rule’
Filed under Article 175E of the Constitution, the fresh petition argued that the 27th Amendment was allegedly passed by a “puppet regime” with a “malicious design to establish one-man rule” in Pakistan by undermining the Constitution.

 

“When the country was passing through a constitutional crisis with the law and order situation deteriorating day by day, the government tabled the 27th Amendment in parliament with the objective of undermining the independence of the judiciary in a mala fide manner,” the petitioner claimed.
The petition said that the establishment of the FCC, by allegedly curtailing the powers of the SC under the garb of the 27th Amendment, was against the fundamental principles enshrined in the original provisions of the 1973 Constitution.
It further claimed that the federal government was being exploited by certain individuals for the purpose of their vested interests, whereas parliament had been used as rubber-stamp just to implement the whims of powerful.
It contended that the country was going through a “power-sharing crisis”, where one institution was overwhelming the powers of the others.
It added that the country was being governed through an indirect martial law, which had camouflaged the entire system and thus “disgracing the green book”.
‘Constitutional crisis’
The petition pleaded that the amendment would create institutional incoherence amounting to a constitutional crisis, as all powers would be concentrated in the hands of a single individual.
“This flagrant violation of the constitution by the government amounted to mockery of the parliament and the judicial system of the country,” the petition argued.
It added that granting immunity to the highest officials of the country from all criminal liability was a clear violation of Article 227 of the Constitution, which ordains that no law will be enacted in contravention of the injunctions of the Holy Quran and Sunnah.
Likewise, the introduction of Articles 175E and 185 of the Constitution would create a clash, as a parallel appellate system has been introduced, with one set of appeals to be filed before the SC and another before the FCCP, the plea read.
The petition argued that this amounted to a violation of natural justice, adding that the judiciary was the custodian of the rights of the people. “Therefore, the FCCP should play its role by striking down the 27th Amendment in the interest of justice,” it added.

ISLAMABAD: The Lah­ore High Court Bar Asso­ciation (LHCBA) on Thur­sday filed an application before the Federal Consti­tution Court (FCC), requ­esting that the pending intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the May 7, 2025 judgement on military trials of civilians be returned to the Supreme Court.
The application has been moved under Order 35, Rule 6 of the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, which the FCC has adopted for the time being until it frames its own rules.
On June 13, the LHCBA and the Lahore Bar Asso­ciation filed ICAs before the SC, seeking to revisit and set aside the May 7, 2025 judgement on the military trials of civilians.
These appeals were filed through senior counsel Hamid Khan.
In addition, former chief justice of Pakistan (CJP) Jawwad S. Khawaja and senior lawyer Barr­ister Aitzaz Ahsan also filed similar ICAs, highlighting that if the May 7 verdict was not overturned, it would serve as a constant reminder of the judiciary ceding its space to the executive by accepting that the latter could act as judges to try civilians in criminal cases.
On May 7, a five-judge Constitutional Bench of the SC restored key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) that allow for the trial of civilians in military courts.
The court ruled by a five-two majority in favour of overturning its earlier decision on Oct 23, 2023, in which a previous five-judge bench had held that the military trials of civilians involved in the May 9, 2023 acts of arson and attacks on military installations was illegal and unconstitutional.
Except for Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail and Naeem Akhtar Afg­han, who dissented from the majority verdict, the detailed reasoning of the majority judgement has yet to be issued.
‘Without lawful authority’
The fresh application pleaded that the pending appeals should be retu­r­ned to their original forum — the SC — as both the purported transfer and the 27th Consti­tutional Amen­dment itself were without lawful authority, unconstitutional, and non-est.
The application contended that the 27th Ame­ndment was in violation of the salient and essential features of the Constitution, stating that the 1973 Constitution defined the powers of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary.
“While parliament possesses the power to amend the Constitution, it does not function as a constituent assembly and is subject to both express and implied limitations,” it added.
The application pointed out that the jurisprudence of the SC — most recently the authoritative 17-member judgement in the Rawalpindi District Bar Association case — had affirmed that parliament could not, through any amendment, alter or abrogate the salient or essential features of the Constitution, including the independence of the judiciary.
The application pleaded that both the 26th and 27th amendments impermissibly encroached upon judicial independence and restructured the constitutional architecture in a manner inconsistent with these unamendable features. Therefore, they constituted an invalid exercise of amendatory power.

 

It argued that a constitutional amendment, which undermined judicial independence while simultaneously divesting pre-existing constitutional courts of jurisdiction to examine its validity, violated fundamental constitutional principles.
“If permitted, parliament can abolish or replace the forum for constitutional adjudication at will, thereby insulating unconstitutional amendments from judicial scrutiny,” the plea feared.
The application further noted that the SC had consistently distinguished betw­een “jurisdiction” and “judicial power”.
“Even where parliament modifies jurisdiction, judicial power — i.e. the authority to determine whether jurisdiction exists — remains inherent in the superior judiciary,” it read.
“Accordingly, notwithstanding the 27th Amendment, it lies within the judicial power of the SC to determine whether it has been validly divested of jurisdiction. The subject appeal must therefore be restored to the SC for that purpose.”
The application maintained that the FCC could not adjudicate upon its own validity, since it was a creation solely of the 27th Amendment.
“It is therefore legally precluded from pronouncing upon the validity of the amendment, as such adjudication would determine the legality of its own existence,” it added. “This principle is affirmed in the Sabir Shah case and earlier jurisprudence, which hold that a forum cannot declare unconstitutional the very instrument that constitutes it.”
The application also highlighted that the pending appeals did not fall within Articles 175E or 175F, as they were filed under Section 5 of the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
“The 27th Amendment neither amends that statute nor addresses statutory appeals filed thereunder,” it added.
“Article 175F(2) applies only to proceedings ‘falling under this Article’. Since the present appeal was not instituted under Articles 175E or 175F, its transfer to the FCC is without legal effect.”

Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being offloaded from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. The actions came after a crack down on migrant smuggling after last year’s Greece boat tragedy that claimed several Pakistani lives. Earlier this month, FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar acknowledged that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.
According to sources, more than 15 such social media accounts have initially been found to be involved in spreading baseless propaganda and hatred against provinces.
It has been learned that the FIA has initiated action by identifying social media accounts spreading fabricated information. Legal action is being taken through the NCCIA under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, against those involved in the baseless propaganda.

 

According to FIA officials, some elements were sharing fake and misleading posts regarding the offloading of passengers, aimed at damaging the institution’s reputation and creating concern among the public. They added that the FIA Immigration Wing does not offload passengers who have complete documents and a legitimate reason for travel at any airport in the country.
Passengers with incomplete or fake travel documents are offloaded. Those who provide suspicious or unclear information, as well as those suspected of being influenced by human traffickers or illegal agents, are also offloaded. In the past, strict action was taken against individuals with a history of illegal activities or problematic travel records, added the officials.
The FIA officials made it clear that the public should not be overly concerned about the matter. Rather, they should stay away from illegal agents and always travel with complete and verified documents.
They advised that in case of a complaint, the public should contact the deputy director of the FIA Immigration Wing or its helpline at 1991.
Earlier today, the agency clarified that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.
In a video statement shared today, FIA Lahore Zone Director Captain (retired) Muhammad Ali Zia addressed the recent issue of “misleading AI-generated videos and false information circulating on social media regarding alleged offloading incidents at airports”.
“All these rumours have no connection with reality,” Zia said, referring to reports of people being offloaded “for no reason”.</p><small>2025-11-28 02:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2723401293eee57.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957739/gen-mirza-bows-out-as-last-cjcsc-chief-of-defence-forces-yet-to-be-notified' target='_blank'><strong>Gen Mirza bows out as last CJCSC; chief of defence forces yet to be notified</strong></a><br><p>The most sweeping transformation of the higher defence organisation took effect at midnight on Thursday with the abolition of the post of chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) under the 27th Constitutional Amendment, even as the government had yet to notify the appointment of the country’s first chief of defence forces under the new structure.
The operationalisation of the amendment to Article 243 of the Constitution, passed by parliament on November 13 and signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari, was timed to coincide with the retirement of the last CJCSC, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza.
With his departure, the tri-service coordinating post created in 1976 stood dissolved, ending nearly five decades of institutional representation for the navy and air force at the apex of military decision-making.
Gen Mirza retired as the 18th and final occupant of the CJCSC office, a position which critics argued never fully realised its intended role of ensuring robust coordination among the three services.
Under the restructured command architecture, oversight of joint operations, multi-domain planning and inter-service integration has been consolidated in the newly created chief of defence forces (CDS), who will simultaneously serve as chief of the army staff (COAS), thus merging operational, administrative and strategic authority into a single dual-hatted role.
Although the government had not notified the CDF-cum-COAS appointment by Thursday evening, no surprises were expected.

 

Current COAS Field Marshal Asim Munir is set to assume the role, which resets his tenure to a fresh five-year term with the possibility of another five-year extension. This would keep him in command until at least 2030, and potentially through 2035.
Insiders say the delay in the notification stemmed from final work being done on the finer details of the appointment.
Field Marshal Munir’s anticipated elevation comes with a significant expansion of authority, including enhanced influence over nuclear command structure through the creation of a new four-star post, the Commander of National Strategic Command (CNSC).

 

The CNSC will oversee unified strategic operations now spread across the services. The appointment, reappointment and extension of the CNSC are tied solely to the CDF’s recommendation and shielded from judicial review through a sweeping exclusion clause that legal experts describe as unprecedented.
The overhaul of the armed forces’ hierarchy is anchored in the amendment to Article 243, which governs command and control of the military. Parallel revisions to the Army, Navy and Air Force Acts have eliminated the CJCSC office, redefined internal hierarchies and strengthened the CDF’s role, expanding the army chief’s influence across joint and strategic domains.
However, the National Command Authority Act has not yet been amended to reflect the new constitutional reality.
Despite the abolition of the CJCSC post, the future structure of the Joint Services Headquarters remains uncertain, with details still being finalised.
“I extend my best wishes and prayers for all the three services and in particular the tri-services headquarters, whatever form and demeanour it takes, for fulfilling the renewed responsibilities with dedication and commitment,” Gen Mirza said in his farewell remarks.



Supporters of the restructuring argue that a higher defence organisation had long been “anachronistic” and ill-suited to modern warfare spanning cyber, space, information and unmanned systems. They say eliminating duplication and empowering a single “strategic integrator” was essential for efficiency.
“I see tri-services synergy, jointness and coordination as a compulsion rather than a choice, with much-needed organisational reform to meet these futuristic challenges,” Gen Mirza said, defending the overhaul.
Critics, including former service chiefs and defence scholars, warn that the model centralises unprecedented authority in one office while diminishing the roles of the air force and navy, precisely when maritime competition, airspace threats and technological integration require their heightened relevance.</p><small>2025-11-28 02:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636052-achakzai-slams-authorities-for-blocking-kp-cms-visit-to-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Achakzai slams authorities for blocking KP CM's visit to Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that the operation was conducted based on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian Proxy Fitna al Khwarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the ISPR stated.
“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as the relentless counter-terrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” the statement read.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation.







On Tuesday, 22 terrorists were killed during an IBO in Bannu, the ISPR said in a statement.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-11-27 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/271538592f03306.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957713/uae-not-issuing-visas-to-pakistanis-interior-ministry-official-tells-senate-body' target='_blank'><strong>UAE not issuing visas to Pakistanis, interior ministry official tells Senate body</strong></a><br><p>Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chaudhry said on Thursday that the United Arab Emirates had not been issuing visas to Pakistanis.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties. The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners in the Middle East and a major source of remittances, with a large Pakistani expatriate population living and working there.
The secretary made this revelation during a meeting of the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights, further stating that Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”.
“If a ban is imposed, getting it removed would be difficult,” he warned.
The official said that currently, the UAE was only issuing visas to blue and diplomatic passport holders.
Separately, Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, who heads the Senate committee on human rights, also confirmed that the interior ministry official’s remarks to Dawn. She said the bar was attributed to concerns about people travelling to the UAE and “getting involved in criminal activities”.
The committee was told that the UAE was not issuing visas to Pakistanis and that very few had been issued in the recent past “after much difficulty”, she said.
Meanwhile, a senior diplomat in the UAE embassy, who wished not to be named, dismissed social media speculation that there was a ban on visas for Pakistanis. Answering a question related to the purported “ban”, he told Dawn that “there’s no ban on visas for Pakistani citizens.”
UAE envoy shares steps to facilitate visa processing
On the other hand, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Salem M. Salem Al Bawab Al Zaabi shared “major UAE visa facilitation reforms for Pakistanis” with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb today, the latter’s ministry said.
The reforms discussed during their meeting in Islamabad included online visa processing, e-visas without passport stamping, and faster system-to-system linkages, the finance ministry said on X.
Nearly 500 visas were being processed daily at the newly launched UAE Visa Centre in Pakistan, the statement added, further outlining reforms shared by the envoy.







Ambassador Al Zaabi emphasised boosting bilateral cooperation in trade, investment and cultural ties, while “appreciating the longstanding contributions of Pakistanis working in the UAE”.
Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen the fraternal, strategic, and economic partnership between their countries, the statement said.
They also reviewed ongoing defence cooperation and agreed to continue working closely to unlock new opportunities in trade, investment, technology, people-to-people ties and other areas, it added.
Past UAE visa issues
Visa rejections were also faced by Pakistani citizens in early July, which prompted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to raise the issue with his UAE counterpart.
In a meeting on July 11, UAE Lt Gen Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens as the Pakistani minister sought “relaxation in visa policies”.
In April, UAE Ambassador to Pakistan Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al-Zaabi announced that visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could now avail a five-year visa.

 

This came after the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, in January, was told that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”.
Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig had said the above, adding that the UAE government had reservations that Pakistanis on “visit visas, not work visas”, resort to begging in the country.
However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the Gulf country.</p><small>2025-11-27 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636011-security-forces-gun-down-22-terrorists-in-di-khan-ibo' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces gun down 22 terrorists in DI Khan IBO</strong></a><br><p>

“We are fully investigating that aspect of his background as well to include any known associates that are either overseas or here in the United States of America, that is what a broad-based international terrorism investigation looks like,” Patel said at a news conference.
The suspect worked with “the US government, including CIA, as a member of a partner force in Kandahar,” during the US war in Afghanistan, CIA Director John Ratcliffe told the New York Times and Fox News.
The two soldiers, part of a militarised law enforcement mission ordered by President Donald Trump months ago and challenged in court by Washington DC officials, were hospitalised and had come through surgery, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.
The suspect, who was wounded in an exchange of gunfire before he was arrested, was identified by the Department of Homeland Security as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national.
Bondi told Fox News on Thursday that the two wounded soldiers were a man and woman.
She said the US government planned to bring terrorism charges against the gunman and seek a sentence of life in prison “at a minimum.”
Investigators seized numerous electronic devices from the suspect’s house in Washington state, including cellphones, laptops, and iPads, Patel said at the news conference.
US Attorney for Washington, D.C. Jeanine Pirro identified the two wounded Guardsmen as Sarah Beckstrom, 20, and Andrew Wolfe, 24. She said they had been sworn in as National Guard members fewer than 24 hours before the shooting.
Pirro said the suspect ambushed the two while they were patrolling near the White House. Armed with a powerful handgun, a .357 Magnum, he shot one Guardsman who fell and then shot again before firing multiple times at the second Guardsman.
Processing of Afghan immigration requests halted
Trump, who was at his resort in Florida at the time of the attack, released a prerecorded video statement late on Wednesday calling the shooting “an act of evil, an act of hatred and an act of terror.” He said his administration would “re-examine” all Afghans who came to the US during Joe Biden’s presidency.
The US Citizenship and Immigration Services agency later said that it has halted processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals indefinitely, “pending further review of security and vetting protocols.”
According to the DHS, Lakanwal entered the US in 2021 under Operation Allies Welcome, a Biden-era program to resettle thousands of Afghans who assisted the US during the Afghanistan war and feared reprisals from Taliban forces who seized control of their homeland after the US withdrawal.
NBC News, citing an interview with an unnamed relative of the suspect, reported early on Thursday that Lakanwal served in the Afghan army for 10 years alongside US Special Forces troops and was stationed in Kandahar for part of that time.
The relative also said Lakanwal was working for online retail giant Amazon.com the last time they spoke several months ago, according to NBC News.
The DHS did not include other details of his immigration record, but a Trump administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Lakanwal applied for asylum in December 2024 and was approved on April 23 of this year, three months after Trump took office.
Lakanwal, 29, who resided in Washington state, had no known criminal history, the official said.
The shooting unfolded at midday outside a subway station in a bustling commercial area within a few blocks of the White House. Secret Service agents placed the presidential mansion under a security lockdown immediately after the shooting as a precaution.
In response to Wednesday’s shooting, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the president had asked to send another 500 National Guard troops to join the more than 2,000 Guard soldiers previously mobilised in the nation’s capital.
Vice President JD Vance, who was in Kentucky on Wednesday, said in a post on X that the shooting proved that the Trump administration’s immigration policy was justified.“We must redouble our efforts to deport people with no right to be in our country,” he said.







Critics of the Trump administration’s immigration policy say it has employed illegal harsh tactics and swept up immigrants indiscriminately, including some with no criminal history and others in the United States legally.

Attack outside subway station
Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has clashed openly with Trump over the deployment of Guard troops in her city, told reporters hours after the incident, “this is a targeted shooting.”
At the same news briefing, Jeff Carroll, executive assistant chief of the Washington Metropolitan Police Department, said the two Guard soldiers were “ambushed” and that the known assailant appeared to have acted alone.
The two soldiers, members of the West Virginia National Guard, were on a “high-visibility patrol” outside the entrance to a subway station when the suspect “came around the corner,” drew a weapon and immediately fired at the pair, Carroll said.
After an exchange of gunfire, other National Guard troops subdued the suspect, he said.
Trump said in August he was ordering the National Guard deployment to fight crime in a city he said had become unsafe, despite objections from District of Columbia officials who challenged the move in court as an infringement on local government control.</p><small>2025-11-27 16:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635988-rana-sanaullah-blames-past-establishment-for-destruction-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Rana Sanaullah blames 'past establishment' for destruction in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>
