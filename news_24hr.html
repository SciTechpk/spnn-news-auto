Judge Muhammad Naeem Sheikh dir­ected the Mianwali police chief to ensure the arrest all 51 fugitives of law within a month and produce them in the court.
The ATC in Sargodha handed down a rigorous life sentence to Mr Ismail for his role in the May 9, 2023 riots, which saw attacks on a judicial complex and other government installations in Mianwali.
The verdict, delivered by Judge Muhammad Naeem Sheikh, also declared 50 other PTI leaders and workers as proclaimed offenders.

Warrants out for arrest of 18 party leaders in Nov 26 protests case

Among those named as fugitives are prominent figures such as former Punjab opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar and sitting MNAs Ahmad Chatha and Bilal Ijaz.
Omar Ayub, the opposition leader in the National Assembly, had previously been declared a fugitive by the court.
Three cases were registered at City Police Station Mianwali against hundreds of PTI leaders and workers for rioting, attacking a Pakistan Air Force base, and damaging public property, including setting fire to court records.
Most parliamentarians and workers were nominated in the FIRs months after the incidents.
Malik Shafqat Abbas Awan, a PTI MNA and counsel for one of the accused, condemned the judgment, calling it “a black spot on the face of the judiciary.”
He noted that Ismail and others had previously been acquitted in two related cases, and accused the court of relying on evidence that had already been rejected.
According to the court’s order, Ismail was convicted under multiple sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and the Anti-Terrorism Act, receiving three life terms, a collective 15 years of rigorous imprisonment, and fines totaling over Rs3.5 million. The court also ordered the forfeiture of his property.
Warrants out for 18 PTI leaders
Separately, an ATC in Rawalpindi issued arrest warrants for 18 senior PTI leaders in a case linked to the Wah Cantt protest on Nov 26, 2024.
Those named include Khyber Pakh­tu­nkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Ganda­pur; Aleema Khan, the sister of jailed ex-premier Imran Khan; former provincial minister Ijaz Khan Jazi; former federal minister Sheikh Waqas Akram; and former MNA Kanwal Shozab.
The court ordered police to apprehend the accused and present them on Aug 8, also summoning the investigating officer with the complete case record.
 
 

Prosecutors told the court that the accused were “deliberately evading arrest and ignoring repeated court summons, thereby obstructing the
legal proceedings.”
Prosecutor Zaheer Abbas argued that the accused’s continued absence was “affecting the judicial process and undermining the rule of law.”
The court also took up an application seeking cancellation of bail for 68 accused in a related case, issuing notices to their sureties and adjourning proceedings until August 5.
The ATC warned that legal action would be taken not only against absconding individuals but also against those who provided bail sureties if the accused fail to appear.

“We have received directives from the home department to launch a fresh drive to repatriate all Afghans… in a respectful and orderly manner,” Meharullah, a senior government official in Quetta, the capital of Balo­chistan province, told AFP.
On Friday, there were “around 4,000 to 5,000 people at the Chaman border” waiting to return, said Habib Bingalzai, a senior government official in Chaman.
Abdul Latif Hakimi, the head of Refugee Registration in Afghanistan’s Kandahar province across the border, said they were aware of an increase in returning Afghans on Friday.
 
 

Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the past several decades, fleeing successive wars, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrived after the return of the Tali­ban government in 2021.
A deportation drive first launched in 2023 was renewed in April when the government rescinded hun­dreds of thousands of residence permits for Afghans, warning them of arrests if they did not leave.
Analysts say the expulsions are designed to pressure the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to control militancy in the border regions.
In total, more than a million Afghans have left Paki­stan since 2023, incl­uding more than 200,000 since April this year.
The campaign targeted the more than 800,000 Afghans with temporary residence permits, some of whom were born in Pakistan or have lived here for decades.
However, many Pakistanis have grown weary of hosting a large Afghan population as security and economic woes deepen, with the result that the deportation drive has widespread support.
Pakistan’s security forces are under enormous pressure along the border with Afgh­anistan, battling a growing insurgency in parts of Khy­ber Pakh­tunkhwa and Balochistan.
Last year, Pakistan recorded the highest number of deaths from attacks in a decade and the government frequently accuses Afghan nationals of taking part in attacks.
Iran has launched a similar large-scale deportation campaign of Afghans, which has seen more than 1.5 million sent back across the border.

The Punjab government did not specify where these meetings took place, but a source said both the ambassadors met them at their residence in Murree.
Both Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz have been camping in Murree for the last several days to discuss “important legislation”.
 






They discussed with Am­­bassador Al-Zaabi on how to expand bilateral co­­op­e­ration in fraternal relatio­­ns, economic partnership, education, science and sustainable development.
“Relationship between Pakistan and UAE is not just diplomatic but a bond of hearts. Bilateral relati­o­ns between Pakistan and UAE have always sto­od the test of time and circumstances,” Mr Sharif said.
Maryam Nawaz said: “We are keen to further expand cooperation with the UAE in fields of education, research and environment. Visa-free entry for official and diplomatic passport holders between Pakistan and UAE is commendable,” she said, highlighting the need for increase in bilateral trade volume.

In this regard, he also stressed the need for streamlining government support to bar associations for maximum impact and cost-efficiency.
The CJP, while presiding over a meeting in Peshawar, reviewed institutional linkages between bar associations and the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) and shared insights from recent visits to remote districts across the country, where he assessed judicial infrastructure and identified implementation gaps caused by poor coordination.
 
 

CJP Afridi also highlighted the need to include bar associations in judicial development efforts, especially regarding judicial complexes.
The meeting was attended by senior judicial and government officials, including Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah, Pakistan Bar Council Vice Chairman Tahir Warraich, KP Bar Council Vice Chairman Ahmed Farooq Khattak, and representatives from the Supreme Court, high courts, law and justice commission, the provincial government, and the Ministry of Law and Justice.

Meets PHC chief justice, KP lawyers

To bridge coordination gaps, the LJCP will post senior representatives in each province, based at high courts, to serve as liaisons with district bars. Their responsibilities would include raising awareness about justice sector initiatives, identifying local priorities, and overseeing grassroots reforms. Bar associations will be invited to submit development proposals to district development committees (headed by district and sessions judges), ensuring federal and provincial departments participate in planning and avoid resource duplication.
 
 

The CJP urged provincial departments to remain engaged with designated officers for timely execution of justice-related projects. Highlighting persistent issues such as poor infrastructure, unreliable power, and limited digital access in remote districts, he called for targeted interventions.
Provincial governments were instructed to integrate these initiatives into their annual planning and prioritise gender-sensitive facilities such as shelters for female litigants.
He also encouraged bar associations to take full advantage of Continuing Legal Education (CLE) programmes offered by the judicial academy. He called for wider dissemination of the training calendar and appointment of focal persons within bars to coordinate participation.
Bar representatives appreciated the inclusive approach and thanked the CJP for acknowledging the difficulties faced by both litigants and lawyers. Federal and provincial stakeholders pledged full support in realising the goal of accessible, efficient, and citizen-centric justice delivery.
Separately, CJP Afridi and the PHC chief justice met a delegation of lawyers from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the Supreme Court registry in Peshawar.
The delegation included representatives from the KP Bar Council, High Court Bar Association, and 35 district bar associations.
The CJP briefed them on ongoing justice reforms under LJCP, noting that, for the first time, Bar representatives have been included as members of the Commission to foster participatory decision-making in legal policy.
He also shared key outcomes from the recent meeting of the National Judicial Policy-Making Committee (NJPMC), including addressing enforced disappearances through a dedicated response committee; directives to high courts to protect judicial officers from external interference; establishment of commercial litigation corridors and model criminal trial courts and time-bound adjudication in 13 case categories; piloting of a double-docket court regime; introduction of court-annexed mediation and a professional excellence index; standardisation of district judiciary appointments and training; biometric case verification and video link attendance for under-trial prisoners and witnesses; ethical guidelines for AI use in judicial settings; and improved welfare measures for judicial officers.
Expressing concern over inadequate infrastructure in underdeveloped regions — particularly the lack of solar power and digital connectivity — the CJP reiterated the need for targeted reforms to bridge regional disparities.
In a major move towards inclusive justice, he announced a new legal aid initiative to ensure no litigant is left unrepresented. Under this initiative, financially distressed litigants will be entitled to state-funded legal representation from magistrate courts to the Supreme Court, while bar associations will be allowed to nominate competent lawyers for this purpose.
Reiterating the importance of CLE programmes, the CJP urged lawyers to make full use of training opportunities at the Federal Judicial Academy. He listened attentively to the delegation’s concerns and assured them of his commitment to addressing these issues in coordination with relevant institutions. He reaffirmed the judiciary’s resolve to promote transparency, access to justice, and collaborative reform.

Their groundbreaking research, independent thinking, open dialogue, innovation and prestige elevated them to dizzying heights.
Although a hard crash landing is now imminent, young people everywhere still keep hoping and dreaming of admission into one.
The rise of US universities was rapid. When Nobel Prizes began in 1901, German universities grabbed the lion’s share while Oxford and Cam­bridge garnered just a few. America was then better known for its fun ‘cow colleges’ with their ice-cream and football jocks. Few cared about books and learning. But, after 1939, European academics fleeing Hitler’s wrath brought to the land of cowboys a mature university culture.
A decade later, Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Stanford, and other big schools were scooping up most Nobel Prizes, Fields Medals, Turing Awards, Pulitzer Prizes and other accolades. America’s economy skyrocketed as universities spun off enterprises like Google, Intel, Koch and Dell.

Just one word tells why there cannot be a Pakistani Harvard now, or in the foreseeable future.

And then came a felon, convicted under American law, currently president of the United States, who decided his country must be shot in the foot to Make America Great Again (MAGA). Behind him stand millions of Bible Belters, pot-bellied Budweiser-drinking football watchers, and assorted white American losers who blame Mexicans, Muslims, and black ‘welfare mothers’ for their long downward slide.
 
 

In 2024, J.D. Vance, now vice president, declared “Professors are the enemy”, adding, “We have to honestly and aggressively attack the universities in this country”.
MAGA’s White House crew forbade universities from discussing equity, diversity, race, affirmative action, climate change, vaccine efficacy, wildlife protection or anything considered ‘woke’. Criticism of Israel is tantamount to antisemitism, now punishable under the law. Should you see images of starving Gaza children being shot in the face by the IDF, you may not mutter “genocide”.
A vengeful throng is sadistically savouring the dismantling of the hated Eastern ‘liberal establishment’. Three-quarters (75 per cent) of US scientists are considering leaving the country, according to a March 2025 survey conducted by the prestigious science journal Nature.
Once-proud Columbia University has eaten humble pie, agreeing to pay $220 million dollars in damages to the US government plus $21m to Jewish employees who “were unlawfully targeted and harassed”. Pro-Palestinian protests are banned, the curriculum changed, and new faculty members in the Middle Eastern Studies department must be affiliated with the Institute for Israel and Jewish Studies. In return, the US government will release $400m in federal research funding.
 
 

Columbia’s shameful capitulation to MAGA’s extortion put Harvard next in the line of fire. Trump ordered withholding of $9 billion in government funds from Harvard and revoked its eligibility to host international students. Students panicked and Harvard responded by filing multiple challenge lawsuits. Hundreds of less well-endowed universities nervously await the court decisions knowing the axe could fall on them.
Harvard is certainly no paragon of virtue and has a chronically weak spine. Back in the 1970s, many a-times we students at MIT joined students at Harvard — a scant 15-minute walk up Massachusetts Avenue — to protest Harvard’s supportive role in the Vietnam War. Harvard also has the well-known proclivity to admit children of the rich and powerful, even the unqualified ones. The progeny of Gen Ayub Khan and Z.A. Bhutto were among such beneficiaries.
Still, to be fair, Harvard has been largely mindful of its motto, ‘Veritas’ (Latin for ‘truth’). Veritas guided, albeit imperfectly, the institution’s mission even before the United States was born. An institutional ethos, steeped in European Enlightenment ideals, enabled ground-breaking work whether in cosmology and biology or the rigorous analysis of human behaviour and society.
What makes a modern university like Harvard so very special?
 
 

The answer is academic freedom, essential for exploring fundamental truths about the natural world and human society. This means professors are provided resources to research their subject, and students are encouraged to sha­re educational spaces with classmates from diver­­se disciplines, ideologies, faiths, genders, nationalities and social classes. In a university’s busy marketplace of ideas uncomfortable truths may emerge, but intellectual rigour is strengthened.
For authoritarian leaders like Trump, Putin, Xi Jinping, and Modi, academic freedom is a nuisance, a roadblock to be cleared. Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi was the closest South Asia ever got to Harvard. When I lectured there in 2005, as a Pakistani I was amazed by the degree of open discourse I was permitted. But today’s JNU is an empty husk, a grim portent of what Harvard may become.
The story of academic freedom in Pakistan is far bleaker. For the universities of British India, Veritas was never the goal. Although formally modelled after Oxford and Cambridge, they aimed at cultivating a loyal, English-speaking class familiar with the machinery of government, primarily catering to the Indian urban middle class seeking government jobs. Post 1947, India inherited 16-17 such universities whereas Punjab University in Lahore was then Pakistan’s sole university.
Punjab University’s education quality, although fairly decent by the academic standards of those times, spiralled down as Hindu professors fled to India and English professors sailed back home. In just a few years, religious extremists engulfed the university where, to this day, they remain firmly in charge, silencing every slight whisper of opposition.
Today, Pakistan has hundreds of so-called universities. But in reality these are dark dungeons that contain and stifle thought. Even personal attire is regulated. Never in my 47 years of teaching at Quaid-e-Azam University did I ever hear from a teachers’ body there — or elsewhere in Pakistan — a call for academic freedom or better standards. All they wanted then — and now — are salary increases and easier promotions.
 
 

Veritas! This one word tells why there cannot be a Pakistani Harvard now or in the foreseeable future. A security state, obsessed with maintaining absolute control over its people, seeks only propaganda machines and technical institutes. It cannot tolerate a free-thinking Harvard-like university.
Most Pakistani professors are quite comfortable with the present rot; they see Veritas as a hindrance, not a help. As for the real Harvard: how much survives by the time Trump exits remains to be seen.

Yet despite these operations, terrorist groups, particularly the banned TTP, have yet to be completely defeated. For example, in Tirah, local tribes have apparently asked TTP fighters to leave the region. As per reports, the militants said they would ‘consult’ their leadership in Afghanistan regarding their withdrawal from the area.
This shows how entrenched the terrorists are in parts of KP, besides highlighting the fact that the TTP command structure remains intact in Afghanistan. It is because of the continued militant presence in parts of KP that the military has yet again launched an operation in parts of Bajaur tribal district.
 
 

With the launch of Operation Sarbakaf, the local people once again find themselves caught in the crossfire between the terrorists and the military. Bajaur’s people had staged protests against the latest military campaign, with the tribal population saying they were not given advance warning of the operation and the related curfew. Fear of more death and displacement haunts them.
The PTI government in KP had initially criticised the campaign, but the chief minister, in an apparent U-turn, backed the action. However, the PTI continues to oppose military action in KP’s affected areas. The tribal people’s reservations about repeated operations are understandable, and there have been large demonstrations against both militancy and military campaigns after terrorism resurfaced in KP following the Taliban’s return to power in Afghanistan in 2021. They rightly ask why terrorism has still not been eliminated after decades of counter-insurgency campaigns.
Perhaps the main issue with counterterrorism operations in KP is that while security forces have fought hard and given sacrifices — succeeding in the ‘clear and hold’ phases — the ‘build’ phase of CT campaigns has failed to deliver. For this, both the civilian and security leaderships are responsible; the former for not building the capacity of civilian LEAs, and the latter for not completely stopping infiltration attempts from Afghanistan.
 
 

However, during a meeting of the ‘Harden the State’ committee on Thursday, the PM discussed a multipronged strategy involving operations, legislation and public outreach to combat extremism. While the issue of terrorism must be taken up with Afghanistan, local responses should ensure that this time, CT actions are thorough, so that KP’s people do not suffer endlessly.
The state must establish its writ across the country, and there can be no fiefdoms where terrorists dominate. All points highlighted in the revised NAP need to be implemented, as kinetic action alone is not enough. Moreover, CT operations should ensure that there is minimum collateral damage and that terrorist groups such as the TTP are uprooted permanently.

“Iran is our close friend and a brotherly neighboring country. We remain committed to making positive contribution to bring the tensions down and promote diplomatic solutions to problem. We are open to play that role, and we will continue to play that role,” Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at the weekly media briefing.
His comments came just a day before Pezeshkian is due to arrive in Pakistan for a two-day state visit from Aug 2-3, his first to Islamabad as president. The trip comes amid a quiet but growing Pakistani role in facilitating indirect US - Iran engagement, according to diplomatic sources.
Islamabad’s acknowledgement of the role comes after US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said Secretary of State Marco Rubio appreciated Pakistan’s “continued willingness to play a constructive role in mediating conversations with Iran” during his recent meeting with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
 



FO says BLA, TTP are ‘Indian proxies’ working on agenda of de-stabilising Pakistan

Pezeshkian’s visit will include meetings with President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, as well as delegation-level talks. The Iranian leader will be accompanied by Foreign Minister Seyyed Abbas Araghchi and a high-level delegation of senior ministers and officials.
 
 

Mr Shafqat said the discussions would cover “the entire agenda of the bilateral relations” and would be held in a “spirit of cooperation, amity and friendship”.
While Pakistan lacks the diplomatic clout of regional heavyweights like China, officials say it has been quietly facilitating the exchange of messages between Washington and Tehran. This role is largely being carried out by the military and intelligence establishment, with limited involvement from Dar.
According to diplomatic sources, Pezeshkian’s trip may also be seen as recognition of Pakistan’s behind-the-scenes efforts to maintain dialogue amid fraught US-Iran ties, especially after the 12-day Iran-Israel war.
Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir had offered to play the role during his meeting with President Trump at the White House, days before US jets bombed Iranian nuclear sites.
 
 

Responding to a question about a recent UN Security Council report mentioning the growing cooperation between terrorist groups, Baloch Liberation Army and Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the spokesman said both BLA and TTP were Indian proxies, whose goal was to destabilise Pakistan.
“All of them do enjoy sanctuaries inside Afghanistan,” he said.
Mr Shafqat recalled that the issue had been under discussion with Afghanistan and lately “better receptivity” of Pakistani concerns was seen in Kabul.

• Elders assure army, FC of full support for anti-militancy efforts
BAJAUR / NORTH WAZIRISTAN: A complete curfew was imposed across North Waziristan in view of the security situation, while a peace jirga tried to prevail upon local militant leaders to leave Bajaur.
The moves were part of efforts to restore peace to these merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which have witnessed a spike in militant activity of late, especially along the border with Afghanistan.
On Friday, a peace march was held in the Shewa tehsil of North Waziristan district against the deteriorating law and order situation in the area.
Tribal elders, representatives of all political parties, the Utmanzai Jirga, Youth of Kabul Khel, and activists of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) attended the gathering.
Addressing the participants, Utmanzai jirga spok­esman Mufti Baitullah and other speakers expressed concern over rising lawlessness across the district.
 
 

The speakers emphasised that people were living in constant fear, primarily due to the re-emergence of militant elements and poor government strategies, and called upon state institutions to ensure immediate and sustainable peace in the region.
Following the imposition of curfew in the area, the district administration has advised people to stay indoors and avoid travelling on roads.
Jirga efforts
In Bajaur, where ‘Opera­tion Sarbakaf’ was laun­c­hed earlier this week to clear the area of militants, a peace Jirga met local militant leaders to convince them to return to Afghanistan.
But sources said that the local leadership of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have sought another day’s time to consult with their leaders in Afghanistan.
 
 

The meeting, held at a mosque in the Lar Kalan area of Lowi Mamund teh­sil, was attended by a 50-member delegation of the Bajaur Peace Commi­ttee and a group of TTP leaders.
Sources said that Jirga members, led by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and consisting of local PTI MPAs Dr. Hamidur Rehman, Anwar Zeb Khan, and former PTI MNA Gul Zafar Khan — among others — presented a two-point agenda to the TTP leaders.
The delegation asked the militants to either return to Afghanistan, or go into the mountains rather than staying among the local population, as their presence posed a serious threat to locals, Dr Khailur Rehman, a PTI senior leader who was also a part of the delegation, told Dawn.
He said that the TTP leaders had sought time until noon on Saturday to respond to the Jirga’s demands.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid also confirmed this, telling reporters after the meeting that the next round of talks would be held today (Saturday).
The meeting with militant leaders followed a similar engagement in Khyber’s Tirah valley, where a Jirga from the Bar Qambarkhel tribe had called upon TTP commanders to quit the area.
That meeting had also had a similar outcome — with the militants seeking time to consult their leadership in Afghanistan.
Bajaur scouts
A separate Jirga held at the Bajaur Scouts headquarters in Khar, said the peace-loving people of Bajaur stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistan Army and Frontier Corps to restore peace in the region.
According to the statement issued by the Bajaur Scouts, local lawmakers and senior officials of the security forces, district administration, and police were also in attendance in the jirga, which aimed to finalise a result-oriented strategy to establish durable peace and stability in the district.
Addressing the participants, Frontier Corps (North) Inspector General Major General Rao Imran Sirtaj said that anti-terrorism operations are aimed at establishing long-lasting peace and normalcy in the district, with the goal of enabling the people of the region to live in a peaceful environment conducive to progress and prosperity.

In a detailed report released by the Senate Secretariat, the Senate Standing Committee on Economic Affairs “uncovered significant concerns” regarding NXCC’s (one of the contractors) prior disqualification, arbitration conflicts, payment discrepancies, document manipulation, and collusive bidding practices.
The meeting presided over by Senator Saifullah Abro discussed serious allegations of irregularities, collusive practices, and potential corruption in the awarding of contracts for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) Tranche-III corridor project by the NHA.
 






The panel chief said contracts were initially awarded based on auditor sheets without verifying the credentials of M/s Dynamic Constructors, M/s Rustam Associates, and M/s Ningxia Commun-ications Construction Co., Ltd (NXCC).

Senate panel finds ‘collusive bidding, conflicts of interest, manipulation of documents’ in road projects

“The committee maintained that M/s NXCC is a non-performing firm and is currently involved in litigation related to the Multan-Lodhran project”, the report said. “Surprisingly, NHA proposed Mr. Zafar Hussain Siddiqui as an arbitrator, despite his past association with the first lowest bidders M/s Dynamic Constructors and M/s Rustam Associates construction companies”, it added.
Mr Abro presented a money trail with bank statement that “clearly indicated Zafar Hussain Siddiqui’s prior affiliation with the JV partners of M/s NXCC”. However, NHA officials said that it had no prior knowledge of the arbitrator’s connection with either party.
 
 

After thorough discussion, the chairman of the committee recommended that NHA file a petition in the Supreme Court against the award, as the circumstances strongly suggest official malafide intent to clear M/s NXCC from litigation and non-performance issues, ultimately facilitating the award of the ADB CAREC Tranche-III (Rajanpur-D.G. Khan-D.I. Khan) Project.
“The secretary of Ministry of Communications also questioned the concerned NHA officials on how such a situation was allowed to develop,” the report said.
Mr Abro told the committee NHA had submitted incomplete papers. They submitted only the auditor reports of M/s Dynamic Constructors and M/s Rustam Associates, he siad. He alleged the auditor reports prepared by A.B.M & Co. reflected irregularities and signs of collusive practices in ADB CAREC Tranche-III project.
The panel also held a detailed discussion on the Gilgit- Shandur Joint Venture Motorway Project. It noted, according to the auditor’s statement, there were several irregularities and signs of collusive practices in the project. In the Gilgit-Shandur project, M/s Dynamic Constructors and M/s Rustam Associates are partnered in JV with M/s NXCC and NLC serving as the lead partner.
“Surprisingly, the record showed that contractors received payments exceeding their quoted share which was evident from the payment details.” The committee also noted clear signs of document manipulation.
In several cases, the recorded payments were higher than the amounts mentioned in the corresponding work orders“, said the report, adding the panel expressed serious concern over the lack of verification within the NHA, especially for such a large-scale project.
The committee was shocked to learn that contractors had claimed experience and submitted payment documents for work done with FWO, HSSR, and various building and real estate companies.
Referring to the “Hanzol Hydropower Project,” he revealed that the work order was issued on May 7, 2024, and the work completed on May 7, 2025. However, the bid documents for the project were submitted in September 2024 and the same project was included in the audit reports for the financial year 2023–24.

• HRW says Israel using starvation as a weapon of war
• Author David Grossman calls Israel’s Gaza campaign ‘genocide’
GAZA CITY: President Donald Trump’s special envoy inspected a US-backed food distribution centre in war-torn Gaza on Friday, as the UN rights office reported that Israeli forces had killed hundreds of hungry Palestinians waiting for aid.
Meanwhile, award-winning Israeli author David Grossman called his country’s campaign in Gaza “genocide” and said he was using the term with a “broken heart”.
The visit by Steve Witkoff came as a report from global advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) also accused Israeli forces of presiding over “regular bloodbaths” close to the US-backed aid points.
 


The UN’s rights office in the Palestinian territories said at least 1,373 people had been killed seeking aid in Gaza since May 27 — 105 of them in the last two days of July.
“Most of these killings were committed by the Israeli military,” the UN office said, breaking down the death toll into 859 killed near the US-backed food sites and 514 along routes used by UN and aid agency convoys.
The US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, posted on X that he and Witkoff had visited Gaza “to learn the truth” about the private aid sites run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is supported by the United States.
“We received briefings from IDF (the Israeli military) and spoke to folks on the ground. GHF delivers more than one million meals a day, an incredible feat!” Huckabee said.
 






The foundation, on its own X account, posted that it had been a “privilege and honor” to host Witkoff and Huckabee as the group delivered its 100-millionth meal in Gaza, fulfilling Trump’s “call to lead with strength, compassion and action”.
Gaza’s civil defence agency said 11 people were killed by Israeli fire and air strikes on Friday, including two who were waiting near an aid distribution site run by GHF.
‘Beyond imagination’
In its report on the GHF centres on Friday, Human Rights Watch accused the Israeli military of illegally using starvation as a weapon of war.
“Israeli forces are not only deliberately starving Palestinian civilians, but they are now gunning them down almost every day as they desperately seek food for their families,” said Belkis Wille, associate crisis and conflict director at Human Rights Watch.
 






Witkoff meets Netanyahu
After arriving in Israel, Witkoff held talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over how to resolve the ongoing war, feed desperate civilians and free the remaining Israeli prisoners.
In a recent video, German-Israeli prisoner Rom Braslavski, 21, while watching recent news footage of the crisis in Gaza pleaded with the Israeli authorities to secure his release.
‘Genocide’
In the meantime, award-winning Israeli author David Grossman called his country’s campaign in Gaza “genocide” and said he was using the term with a “broken heart”.
 
 

“For many years, I refused to use that term: ‘genocide’,” the prominent writer and peace activist told Italian daily La Repubblica in an interview published on Friday.
“But now, after the images I have seen and after talking to people who were there, I can’t help using it.” Grossman told the paper he was using the word “with immense pain and with a broken heart.”
He also won Israel’s top literary prize in 2018, the Israel Prize for Literature, for his work spanning more than three decades.

Addressing Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) delegates from across the country, gathered here for the three-day platinum jubilee celebrations, the PPP chairman acknowledged the persistent challenges facing Balochistan “are often not fully understood at the federal level”, stressing that resolving them required consistent hard work, meaningful engagement and sustained investment.
“While there may be a need for kinetic action in certain situations, such measures alone cannot resolve Balochistan’s problems,” he said.
“The provincial government is striving to introduce initiatives that go beyond that. We are bringing projects aimed at winning the hearts and minds of the people of Balochistan. That’s the real battle we are trying to fight and win in Balochistan.”
Earlier, he recalled how the Pakistani Air Force defeated Indian aggression, while Pakistani journalism countered Indian media’s disinformation campaigns. “Our journalists prioritised credibility, truth, and verified news over sensationalism. This commitment is commendable,” he said.

PPP chief praises role of media during recent escalation with India

“The recent conflict made it clear how essential digital platforms are as national assets,” he said.
“Digital media played a critical role, and its freedom proved beneficial. We must now safeguard and empower it. I am grateful that the government lifted the ban on digital media during the war — and that it has not been reinstated since. I sincerely hope it remains that way.”
 
 

Addressing the spread of disinformation by hostile elements, including India, the PPP chairman stressed that misinformation targeting regions like Balochistan, Sindh, and Kashmir was part of a larger campaign.
He vowed to collaborate with PFUJ to introduce legislation to combat disinformation and protect journalism. He expressed hope that the federal government would reconsider some policies towards the media.
“We will do everything we can to implement laws designed to protect journalists. We also ask journalists to work with us in this effort,” he said.

• Four jump into river to rescue family member, three missing
• 295 dead, over 700 injured nationwide in monsoon-related disasters
• Corruption alleged in GB early warning, protection projects
ISLAMABAD / GILGIT: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday reaffirmed the federal government’s full support for relief and recovery efforts in flood-hit Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
Chairing a high-level meeting to review the monsoon damage, the prime minister ordered an urgent overhaul of the Pakistan Meteorological Department’s early warning infrastructure to make it more proactive and effective.
He also directed authorities to restore and repair road and communication networks on an emergency basis to ensure timely aid delivery and mobility in affected areas.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the meeting focused on immediate relief efforts, future disaster preparedness and federal assistance to the affected regions.
 






Expressing sorrow over the loss of lives and widespread destruction caused by torrential rains, PM Shehbaz reiterated his government’s solidarity with the people of GB and AJK.
“The federal government stands shoulder to shoulder with the administrations and citizens of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir in this hour of grief,” he said. “I will soon visit Gilgit-Baltistan to express solidarity with the victims and a comprehensive federal relief package will be announced to support recovery and rehabilitation efforts.”
The prime minister directed all federal departments to coordinate with regional authorities to conduct swift damage assessments and prioritise life-saving interventions. He stressed the need for a coordinated and rapid response to minimise further losses and ensure timely assistance to those affected.
During the briefing, National Disaster Manag­ement Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik informed the premier that monsoon-related disasters had caused 295 deaths and over 700 injuries nationwide. More than 1,600 homes have been destroyed and 376 livestock lost.
He also warned of continued flood threats in rivers and streams, noting potential minor flooding at Tarbela, Chashma, Taunsa and Kalabagh, and moderate flood levels at Head Marala and Guddu on the Chenab River. He cautioned that monsoon activity is expected to intensify towards the end of August.
The meeting was attended by AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Minister for Climate Change Dr Musadik Malik and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, among others.
Separately, Minister for National Health Services Syed Mustafa Kamal called on PM Shehbaz on Friday to brief him on ongoing projects and reform efforts in the health sector. The meeting also covered other matters related to the Ministry of Health, according to a statement from the PM’s Office.
 






Tragedies mount in GB
In Gilgit-Baltistan’s Haron area, four members of a family drowned in the Ghizer River while trying to rescue a man reported to be mentally unwell, who had jumped into the water. Rescue 1122 officials said that one family member was rescued, while two women and a man remain missing.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered all available resources to be deployed in the search and rescue operation.
 
 

In a separate incident, a glacier burst in Bagrot Valley on Friday led to the death of a 12-year-old boy, while his father was injured. The pair had been crossing the glacier in Barchi village on foot when it collapsed.
The GB spokesperson confirmed they fell into a ravine and were buried under debris. The father was rescued after several hours by locals and Rescue 1122.
While a billion-rupee early warning system had been installed in the area under the UNDP-funded Glof-II Project, it failed to function during the incident.
Opposition leader from the constituency, Syed Sohail Abbas Shah, alle­ged large-scale corruption in the implementation of early warning and protection projects, accusing both the government and international organisations.
Emergency declared
Spokesperson Fai­zullah Faraq announced that an eme­rgency has been imp­osed across GB. He urged the federal government to step in and assist with flood relief and the rehabilitation of affected people.
Fresh flash floods have struck the Khanbari area of Diamer district, dest­roying standing crops, farmland and irrigation infrastructure. The search continues for the 11th day for missing tourists along the Babusar Highway.
PM Shehbaz is expected to visit GB soon.

“The decisions by France, the United Kingdom and Canada reinforce the trend towards recognising Palestine as part of efforts to breathe new life into the peace process,” Stubb said in a post to X.
“If I receive a proposal to recognise the Palestinian state, I am prepared to approve it,” Stubb said, deploring an “inhumane” situation in Gaza.
Finland’s Prime Minister Petteri Orpo on Friday reiterated Helsinki’s support for a two-state solution, without specifying whether the government was ready to recognise a Palestinian state.

However, the detailed road map for the service is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.
On Friday, Minister for Mari­time Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry called for the swift launch of Pakistan’s first ferry service, stressing the need for immediate reforms to licensing procedures and financial facilitation for operators.
 
 

These reforms aim to ensure affordable sea travel, support pilgrims and boost maritime connectivity.
In a meeting with Shipping and Ports Director General Alia Shahid, the minister highlighted the benefits of sea travel, pointing out that ferry services could offer a reliable and cost-efficient travel option for Zaireen heading to Iran and Iraq.
“Beyond tourism and business, this service can greatly facilitate religious travel. We can offer pilgrims a secure, affordable and efficient option for their journeys,” said Mr Chaudhry.
He also emphasised the potential economic benefits of the service, noting that every year, between 700,000 and one million Pakistani Zaireen travel to Iran and Iraq. If 20 per cent of these pilgrims opt for ferry services in the first three years, it could result in 140,000 to 200,000 passengers annually, representing significant economic potential.
The meeting also revealed that stakeholder consultations, including with private operators and regional maritime authorities, are underway. Feasibility studies and regulatory frameworks are being finalised, with a pilot lau­nch expected in the coming weeks.
“If implemented effectively, this service could become a vital new transport link across the region,” the minister said.
To streamline the process, the minister instructed that the ferry licensing process be fully digitalised and integrated into the Pakistan Single Window platform, similar to the existing ship registration process. He specifically ordered that the current six-month licensing period be reduced to just one month.
“There’s no justification for a half-year delay,” he said. “We must eliminate red tape and act decisively.”
In an effort to attract private sector participation, the minister also called for exploring flexible financial models for ferry operators.
“Our aim is to support, not hinder, entrepreneurs who wish to invest in this sector,” he added.
The Ministry of Maritime Affairs has proposed a hybrid financial model, where the country’s financial management system relies on bank and insurance guarantees to support the venture.
Deadlock over land travel ban
Meanwhile, the deadlock continues between the federal government and political groups representing the Shia community over the ban on land travel for pilgrims.
The negotiation team, which included Nasir Shirazi, Allama Ahmed Iqbal Rizvi and Asad Naqvi from Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM), and Allama Shabbir Meesami, Allama Arif Wahidi and Zahid Akhunzada from the Shia Ulema Council (SUC), submitted a written proposal to the Ministry of Interior on Thursday.
 
 

The proposal called for the immediate reversal of the government’s decision to ban land travel to Iran for the pilgrims.
The government has been urged to facilitate the movement of around 80 buses stranded in Quetta to reach the Gabd-Rimdan border crossing. However, the government’s response was delayed, as key officials were occupied with security meetings ahead of the Iranian president’s arrival on Saturday (today).
As a result, neither the Minister of State for Interior nor any senior official from the Ministry of Interior could meet with the joint delegation from MWM and SUC.
One member of the negotiating team said they were awaiting the government’s response and would announce their future strategy after the government’s decision.
“The government must take this matter seriously. We want the issue to be resolved through dialogue, so that the pilgrims may travel to Karbala,” said Nasir Shirazi, secretary general of MWM.
“But it seems the authorities are not understanding the pressure we are under, with many pilgrims also belonging to the Ahle Sunnah school of thought.”

The incident occurred within the limits of Haripur’s City Police Station on Wednesday, and a first information report (FIR) was lodged upon the victim’s complaint under Sections 355 (assault or criminal force with intent to dishonour a person) and 375A (gang rape) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
Shaukat Ali, a muharrar at the police station, told Dawn.com: “One suspect has been arrested and raids are underway to apprehend the other two.
“The victim said in his statement that he had struck up a friendship with a girl, who called him from Abbottabad to meet her in Haripur.”
The FIR said that when the young man reached the location where he was called, “three men caught me and beat me up. They took me to one side of the orchard by gunpoint and then forcibly took off my clothes, forcing themselves upon me turn by turn while the third person was recording videos of the ordeal.”
The complainant said the culprits also took away his mobile phone, gifts he brought for the girl and Rs35,000 in cash.
Earlier this week, Bahawalnagar police claimed to have busted a honey-trap gang allegedly involved in the kidnapping, torture, extortion and murder of teenagers by misusing TikTok profiles of female university students and arrested three of its members.
The investigation team told Dawn.com that a 19-year-old boy was lured and later killed by the gang. The investigation led to the arrest of the gang’s suspected ringleader.
The gang reportedly used the TikTok IDs of various university girls to lure young victims. Investigators said the suspects first gained the trust of these students and then misused their social media identities.</p><small>2025-08-01 19:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/012328203ba953c.jpg?r=232831' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928066/kasim-says-trump-can-make-a-difference-on-imrans-situation' target='_blank'><strong>Kasim says Trump ‘can make a difference’ on Imran’s situation</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan’s sons on Friday said that United States President Donald Trump was a figure who “can make a difference” in their incarcerated father’s situation.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim Khan, 26 called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Last month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khanum said they would go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and engaged US lawmakers on the issue of their father’s incarceration.
In an interview on ‘Piers Morgan Uncensored’ aired today, Kasim was questioned on whether he had any message for Trump, to which he said: “If anyone can make a difference, he (Trump) can.”
Kasim said the two had met Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell — known for publicly calling for Imran’s release on X.
“We know that Trump has a great relationship with our father and vice versa.  They had great conversations when they were both in office and they seem to have mutual respect for one another.
“If Trump was able to make a statement or in any way speak to the establishment over there [in Pakistan] to get our father released, I know he’s one of the few people who can, so of course we would love to kind of have a conversation with him or hope for some help from him or support.”
 


Sulaiman said it had been three years since he last met his father and four months since he spoke to him. Kasim said the experience had been “brutal” for the two since they used to regularly speak to him.
Kasim said the two were not ones to publicly speak out, but were now getting “desperate” after having gone so long without any contact with their father.
“When we floated the idea of going, we were told by people in the Pakistani government that we would be arrested and from other people, we heard, you know, we had warnings from family members, inside sources, all sorts of people saying similar [things]. So we’ve still tried to get our visas. We are still looking to go at some point. We’ve applied for our visas but we haven’t had our responses yet. We’ll see what happens.”
Sulaiman said the two were “doing everything we can” to help their father from abroad if they could not go to Pakistan. He added that the two had not yet spoken to anyone in the UK government on the matter.
In their message to state authorities, Sulaiman said: “ Respect democracy, first of all. Respect the will of the Pakistani people which was clear despite huge rigging in the general election in February last year and respect the rule of law and give him a proper, fair trial.“
Kasim said the two were prepared for being arrested upon going to Pakistan. “We’ve been attempting to go for a little while. We’re looking through whatever we can. So what will be, will be. We’ll see what happens. But we 100 per cent will be going at some point, whether he likes it or not,” he added.
Aleema had previously said that the sons would “definitely” come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicop) and they were “citizens of Pakistan”. “If anything were to happen to Imran’s sons, it would become an international matter,” she had told reporters.
Earlier this week, the PTI swiftly rubbished media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.
Although the government has not officially commented on the matter of Imran’s sons, Chaudhry previously questioned what, if any, role they would be able to play, adding that they were welcome to visit Pakistan and there would be no obstacle for them. He continued that visas would be issued to them “in less than 24 hours”, provided they stayed within the law.
Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik had told Dawn.com that Article 16 of the Constitution, which grants the right to gather, was applicable to citizens and foreigners are not allowed to assemble in Pakistan.
Malik also said that the two brothers could not legally participate in local political activity as they were British nationals, and that if they “violate the visa conditions, the visa can be cancelled”.
There were conflicting statements from PML-N leaders as well on whether the duo would be allowed entry into Pakistan, with Senator Irfan Siddiqui saying they should be allowed to come and “carry out their activities”, but within the limitations of the law.
Visa applications awaiting interior ministry’s approval
Earlier, Aleema said the two had applied for their Pakistani visas and were awaiting approval from the interior ministry ahead of their visit to the country.
In a post on X, she said: “A few days ago, Suleiman and Kasim applied for their visas with the Pakistan High Commission in London. The ambassador has intimated that he is awaiting approval from the Ministry of Interior in Islamabad.”
 






Responding to Aleema’s post, Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry called her out for her previous assertion that the siblings had a  Nicop, questioning why they would need visas if that was the case.
“If they do need visas, that means they are not ‘Pakistani nationals’. What is the real truth behind it all?”

South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the firing took place after a funeral prayer at a mosque in DHA Phase 6.
“As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG said. “Both father and son were shot and transported to a private hospital in Clifton, where Islam succumbed to his injuries.”
The DIG added that during the preliminary investigation, it transpired that a complainant nominated the slain advocate in a murder case, while in a later incident, Islam sustained injuries in Clifton.
Elaborating on the cases, DIG Raza recalled that in 2021, the complainant filed a first information report (FIR) with Boat Basin police against six to seven unidentified suspects for allegedly killing his father.
“The complainant also attempted to nominate Khawaja Shamsul Islam, but he failed to provide evidence. Thus, the case was disposed of as ‘A’ Class (untraced) by Investigation DSP Clifton division Jahanzaib Khan,” the DIG told Dawn.com.
Regarding the second incident, which occurred in 2024, the DIG said that the complainant, another advocate, filed an FIR alleging that while heading for Isha prayers with Khawaja Shamsul Islam in Zamzama neighbourhood of Karachi, they were “ambushed by the complainant in the first case along with 15-20 armed accomplices”.
“The attackers used firearms, iron rods and sticks, injuring Khawaja Shamsul Islam,” he alleged, adding that the attackers had gathered outside the mosque.
DIG Raza pointed out that a preliminary investigation of last year’s attack was conducted by Inspector Maqbool Meher and some suspects were also arrested by the police. However, the case was later transferred to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU)/Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Karachi as an “extortion matter”.
The official elaborated that one police security guard had been provided to Islam.
“Incidentally, the poilce guard was outside the mosque at the time of the attack. The lawyer and his son were targeted inside the mosque.”
The DIG added that the private security guards of the mosque have been detained for questioning.
The body of the slain lawyer was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities. Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the advocate sustained “firearm injury to his chest, damaging vital organs and leading to irreversible hemorrhagic shock”.
The DIG has constituted a special team under the supervision of the South SSP to arrest the people, who murdered the advocate and injured his son.
The official said the prime suspect was the son of a police constable deployed for Islam’s security in the past as witnesses heard him saying that he had taken “revenge” for the murder of his father.
In a statement issued today, the Karachi Bar Association condemned the murder of Islam and announced that its members will not appear before any court on August 2 (Saturday) to express their solidarity with the slain senior laywer.
In April this year, a judge and a lawyer were shot dead in an armed attack on the motorway in Nowshera district.
Nowshera Deputy Commissioner Irfanullah Mehsud told Dawn.com that one of the slain, Mohammad Hayat, was working as a civil judge in Mardan and belonged to the Swat district.
“The other person was identified as Khalid Khan, a lawyer, belonging to Rustam area of Mardan, who was accompanying the judge.”
Mehsud said that they died on the spot and the bodies were moved to Qazi Hussain Ahmed Medical Complex.</p><small>2025-08-01 18:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0121473840daac7.png?r=214914' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928087/at-least-29-hurt-as-islamabad-express-derails-near-kala-shah-kaku-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>At least 29 hurt as Islamabad Express derails near Kala Shah Kaku: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>At least 29 people were injured as the Islamabad Express passenger train derailed near Kala Shah Kaku in Punjab’s Sheikhupura district on Friday, with rescue services completing their search operation.
According to Punjab Rescue 1122, five bogies of the train were derailed near a chemical plant in the Kala Shah Kaku area, with the control room receiving reports around 7:32pm.
The rescue service later said that 22 people were administered first aid at the scene of the incident, while seven were transported to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Muridke for treatment.
“Two people were trapped in the bogies, but they have been rescued and moved to the hospital,” the statement read. “One of them sustained hip injuries.
“The initial rescue operation has been completed and there is no information about anyone being killed in the accident yet,” it added.
An earlier statement quoting Punjab Rescue Spokesperson Farooq Ahmed read: “Six emergency vehicles and 25 rescuers were immediately dispatched to start the rescue operation. Most of the passengers suffered scratches, bruises and skin injuries.”
 






On July 28, three coaches of the Jaffar Express train were derailed near Shikarpur following an explosion on the tracks, leaving one person injured.
Sukkur Railways Divisional Superintendent Jamshaid Alam said that the Jaffar Express was travelling from Peshawar to Quetta when it was caught in the explosion near Sultanpur.
“Following the blast, train operations have been suspended,” Alam said, adding that passengers “faced serious difficulties due to the train’s derailment”.
The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that Railways Minister Muhammad Hanif Abbasi took notice of the derailment and directed the Railways CEO and the divisional superintendent to reach the scene and oversee the situation.
The minister also ordered a detailed inquiry into the accident and instructed that a report be submitted within seven days.
On July 29, the Ministry of Railways said that the train was derailed due to a technical fault and not an explosion, adding that local residents thought the sound of the derailed train was an explosion.
It said an unfamiliar terrorist outfit “took advantage of the incident” and falsely labelled it as an “armed attack” and claimed responsibility. “This claim is not only baseless, but also tantamount to an example of opportunism and irrelevance.”</p><small>2025-08-01 18:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01204751df181e4.png?r=211144' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928075/opposition-alliance-calls-for-grand-national-dialogue-between-political-parties-new-charter-of-democracy' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition alliance calls for grand national dialogue between political parties, new charter of democracy</strong></a><br><p>The opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Friday called for a grand dialogue between all political parties of the country and a new charter of democracy between them.
The TTAP had held its multi-party conference on Thursday, appealing for a new social contract to restore the Constitution and democracy, claiming that government officials had blocked access to the original venue in Islamabad, forcing them to relocate. The alliance was forced to move its conference to a private farmhouse after authorities placed barriers at its intended venue, Tulip Banquet Hall.
The coalition of six opposition parties formed last year, had formalised its organisational structure last month and declared blanket support for all anti-government protests.
Addressing a press conference today on the second day of the conference held at his farmhouse, TTAP leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar presented the alliance’s resolution.
“The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” the resolution read, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
 


“As a result of the constant attacks of the hybrid system, the Constitution of Pakistan, the human rights given in it from Articles 8 to 11, and the parliamentary democratic system have become meaningless and today the social contract between the people and the state has been shattered.
“Therefore, for the new charter, a complete consensus should be reached among all the political forces in the country after a national dialogue.”
The TTAP said that political consensus was needed on the following aspects: supremacy of the Constitution and Parliament, rule of law, independence of the judiciary, appointment of a free and independent Election Commission and fair elections, the situation in Balochistan, the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the former tribal areas, the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission, inter-provincial relations and water distribution, inter-relations of political parties and investigation of all illegal administrative actions, freedom of the media, rights of women and minorities and international relations.
 






Criticising yesterday’s events, the TTAP strongly condemned the conference’s cancellation at the Islamabad hotel by the administration and declared that this action was a blow to the constitutional and legal rights of citizens.
“The APC expressed deep concern over the current constitutional, political and economic situation of the country. Today, no class or nationality living in the country is satisfied, the farmers are devastated, the salaried class is under the burden of taxes and the business class is leaving the country and transferring its capital abroad.
“The poverty rate in the country has increased to an alarming level and currently about 45 per cent of Pakistan is forced to live below the poverty line and the purchasing power of the middle class has decreased by 58pc. The unemployment rate has reached an alarming level of 22pc, while the same rate among the youth is more than 30pc.
“This has never been the case in the history of Pakistan. All the participating parties of the conference decided that a comprehensive and common strategy is needed to bring the country out of the current channels,” the resolution stated.
The alliance demanded an end to the “wave of fascism and political manipulation” in the country.
It also condemned the “unjust imprisonment” of PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi, demanding their early release and immediate appointment of their pending cases in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) and the Supreme Court for immediate hearing.
The opposition moot also lashed out at the recent sentencing against scores of PTI leaders and workers, including the National Assembly and Senate opposition leaders, saying yesterday was a “dark day in the political and democratic history of Pakistan in this regard and it once again shows that this hybrid system wants the complete elimination of the opposition in the country”.
On constitutional supremacy, the alliance criticised the recent amendments made to the Constitution and called for their removal. The moot also called for the dismantling of the Special Investment Facilitation Council, alleging that the rights and resources of the provinces were usurped through it.
Regarding the rule of law, the TTAP said that corruption in civil institutions and “undue and illegal interference by political and defence institutions” had led to a loss of public trust and undermining of professional capabilities, which was causing a deterioration in the situation of law and order in the country.
“While the justice system needs reforms, the concept of the rule of law has been severely shaken as a result of interference in the justice system, which needs to be corrected and the public’s trust restored.”
In particular, the moot said that the independence of the judiciary was reduced to a mere slogan after the 26th amendment and “kangaroo courts are now busy only in the work of cleaning up the houses of the powerful”.
The TTAP said there was an urgent need to completely abolish the 26th amendment, take direct steps to prevent all interference in the judiciary and devise an uncontroversial system of appointment of judges to purify the judiciary and restore the reputation of the institution.
“The letter of six judges of the Islamabad High Court has opened the floodgates for the demands of judicial independence in Pakistan. These judges are the heroes of the Pakistani people and we strongly condemn the actions taken against them and fully support their stand,” the alliance said, referring to the letter written by six IHC judges alleging institutional interference and pressure in judicial work.
On the security situation in Balochistan and KP, the moot said the prevailing conditions in the former were a wound for the country that needed to be urgently addressed.
“The first right to the province of Balochistan and its resources belongs to its residents … We demand that the illegally missing persons across Pakistan and especially in Balochistan be immediately brought to justice. The illegal private militias present across Pakistan, especially in Balochistan and KP, who are backed by the authorities, should be immediately dismantled and the policy of extrajudicial killings should be immediately stopped and the right to a fair trial given in the Constitution should not be deviated from in any way.
“Political prisoners, including Dr Mahrang Baloch, should be released in full. Only civil law enforcement agencies should be given responsibility for maintaining law and order. Also, immediate steps should be taken to eliminate the harassment of Baloch students studying in educational institutions across Pakistan in the name of law and order and to eliminate the hateful prejudice against them,” the resolution said.
Responding to the conference, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar dismissed it as a rote development to sabotage the economy whenever important diplomatic events were due, such as the upcoming visit of the Iranian president.

“I have ordered two nuclear submarines to be positioned in the appropriate regions, just in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social.
“Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances.”
 


Trump did not say whether he meant nuclear-powered or nuclear-armed submarines. He also did not elaborate on the locations, which are kept secret by the US military.
The United States and Russia control the vast majority of the world’s nuclear weaponry, and Washington keeps nuclear-armed submarines on patrol as part of its so-called nuclear triad of land, sea and air-launched weapons.
Trump and Medvedev, who is deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, traded taunts in recent days after Trump on Tuesday said Russia had “10 days from today” to agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine or be hit, along with its oil buyers, with tariffs.
Moscow, which has set out its own terms for peace in Ukraine, has shown no sign that it will comply with Trump’s deadline.
Medvedev on Monday accused Trump of engaging in a “game of ultimatums” and reminded him that Russia possessed Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort after Trump told Medvedev to “watch his words”.
 






In response to a post by US Senator Lindsey Graham reiterating America’s seriousness to reach a peace deal, the former Russian president wrote: “It’s not for you or Trump to dictate when to ‘get at the peace table’. Negotiations will end when all the objectives of our military operation have been achieved.
“Work on America first, gramps!”
 






Medvedev has emerged as one of the Kremlin’s most outspoken anti-Western hawks since Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in 2022. Kremlin critics deride him as an irresponsible loose cannon, though some Western diplomats say his statements illustrate the thinking in senior Kremlin policy-making circles.
Earlier today, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow hoped for more peace talks with Ukraine but that the momentum of the war was in its favour, signalling no shift in his stance despite a looming sanctions deadline from Washington.
Trump has said he will impose new sanctions on Moscow and countries that buy its energy exports — of which the biggest are China and India — unless Russia moves by August 8 to end the three-and-a-half-year war.
Trump has expressed mounting frustration with Putin, accusing him of “bullshit” and describing Russia’s latest attacks on Ukraine as “disgusting”.
Putin, without referring to the Trump deadline, said three sessions of peace talks with Ukraine had yielded some positive results, and Russia was expecting negotiations to continue.

“As for any disappointments on the part of anyone, all disappointments arise from inflated expectations. This is a well-known general rule,” he said.
“But in order to approach the issue peacefully, it is necessary to conduct detailed conversations. And not in public, but this must be done calmly, in the quiet of the negotiation process.”
He said Russian troops were attacking Ukraine along the entire front line and that the momentum was in their favour, citing the announcement by his defence ministry on Thursday that Moscow’s forces had captured the Ukrainian town of Chasiv Yar after a 16-month battle.
Ukraine denied that Chasiv Yar was under full Russian control.
Kyiv has, for months, been urging an immediate ceasefire, but Russia says it wants a final and durable settlement, not a pause. Since the peace talks began in Istanbul in May, it has conducted some of its heaviest air strikes of the war, especially on the capital Kyiv.
The Ukrainian government has said the Russian negotiators do not have the mandate to make significant decisions and that President Volodymyr Zelensky has called on Putin to meet him for talks.
“We understand who makes the decisions in Russia and who must end this war. The whole world understands this too,” Zelensky said on Friday on X, reiterating his call for direct talks between him and Putin.
“The United States has proposed this. Ukraine has supported it. What is needed is Russia’s readiness.” Russia says a leaders’ meeting could only take place to set the seal on agreements reached by negotiators.
 






Ukraine and its European allies have frequently said they do not believe Putin is really interested in peace and have accused him of stalling, which the Kremlin denies.
“I will repeat once again, we need a long and lasting peace on good foundations that would satisfy both Russia and Ukraine, and ensure the security of both countries,” Putin said, adding that this was also a question of European security.
Putin was speaking alongside his ally Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, at talks on an island in Lake Ladoga that is the site of a famous Russian monastery.
Russian TV earlier showed the two men greeting monks at the Valaam Monastery, where they have met several times before, and holding candles during the chanting of prayers.
Ukrainians mourn 31 killed in Russian strike on Kyiv
Meanwhile, Ukrainian rescuers recovered more than a dozen more bodies from the rubble of a collapsed apartment block in Kyiv overnight, bringing the death toll from Russia’s worst air strike of the year on Ukraine’s capital to 31.
A two-year-old was among the five children found dead after Thursday’s sweeping Russian drone and missile attack, Zelensky said on Friday, announcing the end of a more than 24-hour-long rescue operation.
A total of 159 people were wounded in the multi-wave strike, in which Russia launched more than 300 drones and eight missiles early on Thursday, the latest in a campaign of fierce strikes on Ukrainian towns and cities.

The worst damage was to an apartment building that partially collapsed in the Sviatoshyn district in western Kyiv. Damage was also reported in at least three other districts of the capital.
Natalia Matviyenko, 65, sitting near the damaged apartment building, said she did not place much faith in Trump’s tough rhetoric.
“Trump just says, ‘I’m upset with President Putin’s behaviour.’ And what? No results,” she said.
The US leader, who returned to power on a pledge to swiftly end the war, has in recent weeks rolled back his earlier conciliatory approach toward Moscow and signalled openness to arming Ukraine.
But a diplomatic effort to end the war has stalled, with Moscow not backing down from what Kyiv and its allies describe as maximalist demands.
‘Will Putin listen?’
On Friday, mourners laid flowers and lit candles at the wrecked apartment block, where rumbling excavators hoisted heavy pieces of rubble. The makeshift shrine included brightly coloured stuffed animals.
Oksana Kinal, 43, who was placing flowers to honour a co-worker who had been killed alongside a son, said she hoped Trump would follow up on his threat but also expressed doubt.
“I think America has a lot of points of leverage that can be used against Russia,” she said. “But will Putin listen to this? I don’t know.”
Kyiv’s air force said on Friday that Ukrainian air defences had destroyed more than 6,000 drones and missiles across the country in July alone.
“The world possesses every instrument required to ensure Russia is brought to justice,” Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on X on Friday. “What is lacking is not power but will.”

In June, there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.
These attacks injured 189 people, comprising 126 security personnel and 63 civilians — marking an eight per cent decrease in attacks, a 12pc drop in fatalities, and 4pc increase in injuries compared to May 2025.
Friday’s report documented 82 militant attacks across the country during July, resulting in 101 fatalities and 150 injuries. According to a Picss statement, those killed in militant attacks included 47 civilians, 36 security personnel, and 18 militants. Among the injured were 90 civilians, 52 security personnel, seven militants, and a member of a peace committee.
“Security forces intensified their counter-militancy operations, killing 106 militants and arresting 69 suspected operatives during the same period,” the statement read, noting that these operations also claimed the lives of seven civilians.
Picss noted that the country saw the lowest monthly toll in actions initiated by security forces, with only one of them losing their life. However, 36 security personnel were killed in militant attacks in July.
“In total, militant attacks and subsequent security operations accounted for 215 deaths in July, comprising 124 militants, 54 civilians, and 37 security personnel, while 199 people were injured, including 107 civilians, 56 security personnel, 35 militants, and one peace committee member,” the think tank said.
“The militants also kidnapped at least 14 individuals during the month.”
A comparative analysis by Picss showed a 5pc rise in militant attacks compared to June 2025. However, fatalities among security forces dropped by 32pc, while civilian deaths increased by 21pc. Militant casualties surged by 49pc.
The report highlighted that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, including its tribal districts, remained the epicentre of militancy, accounting for 53 of the 82 attacks recorded nationwide.
Balochistan followed with 28 attacks, while no militant incidents were reported from Punjab, Sindh, Azad Kashmir or the Islamabad Capital Territory. However, one attack was recorded in the Diamer district of Gilgit-Baltistan.
Pakistan has seen a surge in terrorism since the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire deal with the government in November 2022, vowing to increase attacks.
The government labelled the TTP as Fitna-al-Khawarij and directed the use of the term khariji for attackers. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
A day earlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the government was implementing a comprehensive and effective strategy to “completely eliminate” the menace posed by the proscribed Fitna-al-Hindustan, Fitna-al-Khawarij and other terrorist outfits to the country.
According to a statement from his office, the prime minister said the state had adopted a “multi-pronged strategy” in the war against terrorism and made “full and effective use” of important elements such as ground operations, legislation, meaningful public communication and discouraging extremist thinking.
He directed the Steering Committee on Counter-Terrorism and Establishment of the State Writ to ensure effective coordination between the federal and provincial governments against terrorism and to strictly implement their recommendations.
In March, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45pc from 2024 to 1,081.</p><small>2025-08-01 15:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/0120014396c5692.jpg?r=200208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928071/pakistan-afghanistan-uae-to-play-t20i-tri-series-in-sharjah' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Afghanistan, UAE to play T20I tri-series in Sharjah</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan, Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will participate in a tri-series of Twenty20 international matches to tune up for next month’s Asia Cup, followed by the Twenty20 World Cup next year, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Despite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation have slowed progress.
A press release by the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme confirmed that a 10-month-old boy from Union Council Mullazai in Tank district was confirmed as the 11th polio case from KP this year, bringing the country’s total number of cases in 2025 to 18. Last year, 74 cases were reported nationwide.
“The continued detection of polio cases underscores the persistent threat to children, particularly in areas with low vaccine acceptance,” the press release said. “It is crucial for communities to understand that poliovirus can re-emerge wherever immunity gaps persist.”
It added that every unvaccinated child remained vulnerable and could also contribute to the spread of the virus.
The press release pointed out that the only effective protection for polio — a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis — was through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.
Despite “significant improvements” in the quality of polio vaccination campaigns nationwide, the laboratory said that southern districts of KP remained a key area of concern due to restricted access and operational challenges in house-to-house vaccination, leaving “thousands of children unvaccinated”.
According to the press release, six campaigns, including four nationwide, have each reached over 45 million children since September 2024.
It added that the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) plans to conduct two nationwide and one sub-national campaign between August and December this year, as well as targeted campaigns in selected high-risk districts, to help stop transmission and protect children from the virus.
 
 

As part of intensified efforts to eradicate polio in South KP, the prime minister’s Focal Person on Polio Eradication, Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq and NEOC Coordinator retired Captain Anwarul Haq held a meeting with KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah in Peshawar on Tuesday to review ongoing initiatives in the province.
The meeting focused on “campaign performance, current challenges, and targeted strategies to interrupt poliovirus transmission”, particularly in high-risk southern districts of KP, including Tank.
Farooq emphasised the need to “resolve persistent access barriers and ensure the uninterrupted presence and performance of frontline vaccinators in high-risk union councils”.
Meanwhile, Anwarul Haq presented a targeted strategy to improve the quality of campaigns and strengthen routine immunisation, particularly in southern KP.
 






The press release added, “A special planning meeting focused on South KP is scheduled to be held at the chief secretary’s office on August 2-3.”
The programme called polio eradication “a collective responsibility that requires unified efforts at all levels”.
“While dedicated frontline polio workers continue to deliver life-saving vaccines, it is equally critical for parents and caregivers to ensure their children receive every dose of the polio vaccine,” it said.
“Communities must play an active role by supporting vaccination efforts, dispelling misinformation, and encouraging others to protect their children through timely immunisation.”
It directed citizens to the Sehat Tahaffuz Helpline at 1166 for information, as well as the Polio Helpline on WhatsApp at 0346-7776546.
Last Saturday, the NIH had confirmed three new polio cases in the country in KP and Sindh.
In June, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal claimed that Pakistan has witnessed a decline of over 99 per cent in polio cases, saying that polio eradication remains a top priority of the government.</p><small>2025-08-01 14:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616868-opposition-warns-of-shrinking-political-space-demands-fresh-charter-of-democracy' target='_blank'><strong>Opposition warns of shrinking political space, demands fresh 'charter of democracy'</strong></a><br><p>

A day prior, the ombudsman ordered the removal of KE CEO Alvi after finding him guilty of workplace harassment.
Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company’s former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, read the order issued by provincial ombudsman retired Justice Shahnawaz Tariq.
According to a petition Alvi filed with the SHC today — available with Dawn.com — his lawyers argued that Khan has neither levelled any allegations of “harassment of a sexual or physical nature” before the ombudsman, nor presented any evidence of gender discrimination within KE.
“There was no allegation that the petitioner, being in a position of authority, sought out any sexual favour, nor any gender based discrimination was alleged or could be made out as several women are holding high-level positions within the organisation,” the petition read.
“In the circumstances, the findings in the impugned order are flimsy, not sustainable and completely disproportionate. No hostile work environment was alleged or proved as a result of gender based discrimination nor as a result of harassment.”
The plea also noted: “The learned provincial ombudsman did not have jurisdiction over the affairs of a trans-provincial organisation such as KE and so also did not have jurisdiction to take cognisance on a complaint filed by an ex-employee.”
In a court order issued today and seen by Dawn.com, the SHC said that as per the petitioner, KE was a “trans-provincial entity/establishment” and the provincial ombudsman had no jurisdiction to act upon the complaints, which should instead be addressed by the federal ombudsman.
The order said the “contention raised requires consideration” and said that notices be issued to the respondents, as well as the Sindh advocate general and deputy advocate general for August 8.
“Till the next date of hearing, [the] operation of the impugned decision will remain suspended,” the order read. It, however, ordered Alvi to deposit the Rs2.5 million penalty with the court’s nazir.
In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, KE Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security retired Colonel Wahid Asghar and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of “causing harassment, intimidation and mental agony”.
The ombudsman’s order said that Alvi had “committed harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team”.
Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which would be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.</p><small>2025-08-01 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01171652e2b9a53.png?r=171950' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928037/rescue-officials-recover-retired-colonels-car-swept-away-in-last-weeks-pindi-downpour' target='_blank'><strong>Rescue officials recover retired colonel’s car swept away in last week’s Pindi downpour</strong></a><br><p>Rescue officials recovered the car of retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi that was swept away by an overflowing rainwater drain along with him and his daughter last week in Rawalpindi, an official said on Friday.
The car, a grey Honda City vehicle, was recovered from the Kak Bridge. Search teams found Qazi’s body last Friday, who was aged approximately 62–64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) Phase 5.
The body of the colonel’s daughter, Muneba, however, has not been found yet. “The body of the girl who drowned in the floodwater will also be found soon,” District Emergency Officer (DEO) Sibghatullah told Dawn.com.
The retired colonel and his daughter headed to the gate in their car, despite heavy rains and waterlogged streets.
According to a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station, “Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain.”
With the onset of the monsoon season in Pakistan, which typically lasts from late June to September, different parts of the country witness heavy rainfall and a heightened risk of extreme weather events like flash floods and landslides, especially in northern and western regions.</p><small>2025-08-01 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01163714f0b9872.png?r=164654' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928039/enduring-pak-china-partnership-to-keep-playing-pivotal-role-in-regional-stability-coas' target='_blank'><strong>Enduring Pak-China partnership to keep playing pivotal role in regional stability: COAS</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday stressed that the “enduring partnership” between Pakistan and China will continue to play a pivotal role in regional stability.
Pakistan and China share a longstanding strategic partnership rooted in mutual trust, economic cooperation and regional connectivity. Over the decades, ties have expanded across different sectors — including trade, energy, defence and infrastructure — with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) symbolising a shared vision for development.
The army chief made the remarks at the 98th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) of China, which was commemorated at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today, according to a press release by the military’s media affairs wing.
“He emphasised that their enduring partnership will continue to play a pivotal role in promoting regional stability and safeguarding shared strategic interests,” said the statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
China’s Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong graced the occasion as the chief guest, while Defence Attaché Major General Wang Zhong, Chinese Embassy officials and senior military officers from the Pakistani tri-services were also present.
COAS Munir extended a warm welcome to the Chinese guests and congratulated the PLA on its 98th founding anniversary, lauding the army’s “pivotal role in China’s defence, security and nation-building”, the ISPR said.
 


The army chief emphasised that “despite shifting strategic dynamics, the friendship between the two nations has remained steadfast and unshakable”, according to the press release.
“The COAS underscored the strength and strategic significance of Pakistan-China relations, emphasising that the bond between the two nations is unique, time-tested, and exceptionally resilient amid evolving regional and global challenges.
“The Field Marshal highlighted that the Pakistan-China strategic relationship exemplifies mutual trust, unwavering support, and shared commitment,” the statement added.
Concluding his address, COAS Munir “reaffirmed that the Pakistan Army and the PLA are true brothers-in-arms”, the ISPR stated.
Addressing the gathering, Ambassador Zaidong expressed his sincere gratitude to the army chief for hosting the event commemorating the PLA’s 98th anniversary.
He acknowledged the steadfast role of the armed forces in the “fight against terrorism and reaffirmed China’s unwavering support for and commitment to its strategic partnership with Pakistan”, according to the ISPR.
 
 

Today’s renewed affirmation of the strong bilateral ties comes just a week after COAS Munir paid an official visit to China, where he met with Vice President Han Zheng and Foreign Minister Wang Yi.
During the visit, the Chinese leadership hailed the Pakistan Army as a “cornerstone of resilience and a vital contributor” for peace in the region.
Earlier this month, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and his Chinese counterpart reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral cooperation and promoting regional peace, stability, and development.
In recent weeks, both countries have strengthened their cooperation in maritime, agriculture, media, disaster management and various other fields.</p><small>2025-08-01 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/01164349b9ca8ce.jpg?r=164831' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928045/annual-inflation-accelerates-to-41pc-in-july-on-back-of-rising-food-fuel-costs' target='_blank'><strong>Annual inflation accelerates to 4.1pc in July on back of rising food, fuel costs</strong></a><br><p>Data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) on Friday showed that consumer inflation accelerated to 4.1 per cent year-on-year in July, up from 3.2pc in June, driven by rising prices for food items, fuels and medicines.
July’s consumer price inflation month-on-month was 2.9pc, the bureau said.
The finance ministry on Monday had projected consumer inflation for July to remain in a range of 3.5-4.5pc, citing stable prices and improved supply conditions, as price pressures ease further after the previous fiscal year’s sharp decline.
The higher inflation reading follows the State Bank of Pakistan’s assessment of a deteriorating inflation outlook, leading it to leave the key interest rate unchanged at 11pc.
The bank’s monetary policy committee said on Wednesday that energy prices, particularly for gas, had risen more than expected, and it considered the real policy rate should be adequately positive to keep inflation in the 5-7pc target range.
Short-term inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index, had risen by 4.07pc week-on-week ending July 24, driven primarily by a sharp uptick in the retail prices of vegetables and petroleum products.
It marked the steepest weekly increase in recent times, primarily attributed to the surge in petroleum prices and their cascading impact on domestic costs. The government has significantly increased petroleum rates over the past month, which, alongside elevated transport fares, has escalated the cost of transporting perishable goods.
Pakistan is pushing through a series of economic reforms under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund programme, including a contractionary government budget passed in June that slashed spending to curb the fiscal deficit.</p><small>2025-08-01 11:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616832-indias-operation-mahadev-holds-no-significance-for-pakistan-fo' target='_blank'><strong>India's Operation Mahadev holds no significance for Pakistan: FO</strong></a><br><p>
