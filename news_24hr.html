• Rights groups, UN agencies slam US-backed food distribution system; UNRWA calls it ‘abomination’
• UN rights office says weaponisation of food constitutes war crime
GAZA CITY: Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed another 46 people waiting for aid in the Palestinian territory on Tuesday as rights groups and UN agencies slammed the US-backed food distribution system.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that 21 people were killed and around 150 wounded by Israeli fire near an aid point in central Gaza early Tuesday, and that another 25 were killed in a separate incident in south Gaza.
“Every day we face this scenario: martyrs, injuries, in unbearable numbers,” paramedic Ziad Farhat told AFP at Nasser Hospital in southern Gaza.
“Hospitals cannot accommodate the number of casualties arriving,” he said.
The latest deaths came as Israel’s opposition leader and the families of Israeli prisoners called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to widen a ceasefire with Iran to include the Palestinian territory.
Pressure also grew on the US- and Israeli-backed privately run aid group Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which was brought into the Palestinian territory at the end of May to replace United Nations agencies.
The head of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) called the system an “abomination” while a spokesman for the UN human rights office, Thameen Al-Kheetan, condemned the “weaponisation of food” in Gaza.
According to figures issued on Tuesday by the health ministry in the Gaza Strip, at least 516 people have been killed and nearly 3,800 wounded by Israeli fire while seeking rations since late May.
The territory of more than two million people is suffering from famine-like conditions after Israel blocked all supplies from early March to the end of May and continues to impose restrictions, according to human rights groups.
‘Tank shells’
Gaza civil defence spokesman Bassal reported a first deadly shooting “with bullets and tank shells” near the Netzarim corridor in central Gaza where thousands of Palestinians gather each night for rations from a nearby GHF distribution point.
France condemned what it called deadly “Israeli fire” against civilians in a statement from the foreign ministry apparently referring to the Netzarim corridor incident.
Witness Ribhi Al-Qassas told AFP that troops had “opened fire randomly” at a crowd he estimated at 50,000 people.
The second incident took place in south Gaza about two kilometres from another GHF centre in Rafah governorate, Bassal said. “Israeli forces targeted civilian gatherings near Al-Alam and Al-Shakoush areas with bullets and tank shells,” he told AFP.
“The weaponisation of food for civilians, in addition to restricting or preventing their access to life-sustaining services, constitutes a war crime,” Al-Kheetan said in Geneva.
UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with GHF over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.
In a statement on Saturday, GHF said it was “delivering aid at scale, securely and effectively”, but it acknowledged it “cannot meet the full scale of need while large parts of Gaza remain closed”. GHF has denied responsibility for deaths near its aid points.
On Monday, more than a dozen human rights organisations called on the organisation to cease its operations, warning of possible complicity in war crimes.
Ceasefire calls
After Israel agreed to a ceasefire with Iran on Tuesday after a 12-day war, Netayahu faced renewed calls to agree a ceasefire with Hamas after more than 20 months of war in Gaza.
“And now Gaza. It’s time to finish it there too. Bring back the hostages, end the war,” opposition leader Yair Lapid of the centre-right Yesh Atid party wrote on X.
Netanyahu said on Sunday that Israel’s war against Iran was “contributing to the successes in Gaza, but it will still take a bit more time”.
Israel’s retaliatory military campaign since October 2023 has killed at least 56,077 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, according to the Gaza health ministry. The United Nations considers its figures reliable.

The urgent meetings, held in Islamabad, followed directives from the Lahore High Court (LHC) to address flaws in the marital contract that have led to property disputes, particularly affecting women.
Participants requested the official version of the Nikahnama from all provinces to identify any discrepancies and to solicit proposals for streamlining issues concerning matrimonial assets.
However, they were surprised to learn that no official Urdu translation of the Nikahnama could be found, according to sources familiar with the discussions.
“In some areas of Punjab, Sindh, and Khyber Pakhtu­nk­hwa, the Nikahnama is being registered in local languages without any lawful backing,” the source added.
The lack of a standardised Urdu version has led to inconsistencies in translation, which officials say is fuelling a rise in disputes over dower and property rights.
 
 

A separate high-level meeting, chaired by the Federal Law Secretary, also examined issues related to matrimonial assets and sought proposals from stakeholders to streamline the resolution of marital disputes.
The LHC has tasked an eight-member committee with reviewing proposed amendments to Pakistan’s Muslim Family Laws Ordinance, focusing on the contentious Section 10A regarding matrimonial property rights.

Power was fully restored to all three districts at 1am on Tuesday through the 132-KV Pishin-Mand and Polan-Jiwani transmission lines, according to Qesco.
Electricity has now returned across the Makran Division, with regular supply restored to grid stations in Mand, Tump, Turbat, Hoshab, Panjgur, Jiwani, Gwadar Door, Gwadar Deep Sea Port, New Gwadar International Airport, Pasni and Ormara.
The power utility said the electricity was suspended on Sunday at around 2:30pm, plunging the entire Makran Division and districts of Gwadar, Kech and Panjgur, into darkness
“Power suspension caused difficulties for people in 50C temperature which persisted throughout the last week,” a spokesman for Qesco said.
 
 

The company responded by connecting affected grid stations to the national grid to maintain electricity supply during the outage, the spokesman added.

It all sounds so surreal. The dramatic escalation and de-escalation signify Trumpian brinkmanship. His actions and contradictory pronouncements over the last few days have left the world in a spin. After claiming to have obliterated Iran’s nuclear facilities following intense American bombardment, and hinting at regime change in Tehran, he appears to have turned peacemaker.
A tentative ceasefire, reportedly brokered by Qatar, is now in effect between Israel and Iran. The tit-for-tat strikes left hundreds dead. But the conflict is far from over. The 12-day war the Zionist state initiated has cost both countries heavily.
While there are no winners, the confrontation has broken the myth of Israeli invincibility. Tehran continued to fire missiles deep inside Israel. It was America’s direct military intervention that changed the balance of force. That too did not lead Iran to surrender, as demanded by Trump. The ceasefire is not one-sided. Tehran’s consent came after Israel agreed to pull back. Never before has the Zionist state appeared so vulnerable despite US military backing, with Iranian missiles penetrating its most powerful air defence system. Israeli attacks may have crippled Iran’s military capabilities but could have never stopped Tehran from retaliating.
America’s military intervention was reportedly limited to bombing Iran’s underground nuclear facilities. In a post on social media, Trump said the Iranian sites had been “totally destroyed”. But the claim has been disputed by nuclear experts. The UN nuclear chief, Rafael Grossi, said: “At this time, no one, including the IAEA is in a position to assess the underground damage at Fordow.” Fordow is Iran’s largest underground nuclear facility.
Some top nuclear experts claim that Iran still has a stockpile of enriched uranium that could easily be turned into weapons grade. This raises questions about America’s claim of the destruction at Fordow and other nuclear sites that forced Tehran to agree to a ceasefire and come to the negotiating table.

Many analysts say that regime change in Iran is still on the Israeli-Trumpian agenda.

In fact, Iran had never refused to negotiate and was engaged in nuclear dialogue with the Trump administration before Israel’s attack derailed the process. It has been Tehran’s position that it was willing to return to the negotiating table once Israel stopped its strikes. Trump’s reckless move to join hostilities complicated the situation. He called on Iran to surrender, but that won’t happen.
Nevertheless, the actual damage to the nuclear facilities would be an important question as the two sides, according to reports, get ready to resume talks in a few days. The US delegation will presumably be led by Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff.
Trump’s decision to directly enter the war against Iran threatened to destabilise the entire region, with serious consequences for global security. Even America’s Western allies see Washington’s joining Israel’s war as exacerbating an increasingly chaotic world order. It was obvious that Israel’s pressure led the Trump administration to jump into the fray despite strong opposition among its own supporters at home. It was seen as a negation of the president’s long-standing pledge not to get America involved in a war abroad. Washington called it a one-off strike, but strong apprehension remained that the US could get sucked into a wider conflict with no quick exit options.
However, matters took a dramatic turn soon after the US air strikes on Iran. Trump announced a ceasefire following a choreographed retaliatory strike by Iran on a US military base in Qatar. It was a deliberately weak strike of which Iran had already informed the Americans and the Qatari government. Trump’s remarks also reinforced the perception that the Iranian response was carefully coordinated to allow both Tehran and Washington some face-saving.
Most importantly, Israel, though reluctantly agreeing to the ceasefire, said it had achieved its objectives. Yet it did not clearly define what its objectives were when it launched its unprovoked war against Iran. It was not just Iran’s nuclear programme and military power that Israel saw as a threat; Israel has also long sought regime change in Iran. But it could not get the support of previous US administrations for its belligerent plan. The Zionist regime, however, has been encouraged by Trump’s social media post: “It’s not politically correct to use the term, ‘Regime Change,’ but if the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn’t there be a Regime change???”
It’s not clear whether the regime change plan has been relegated to the back-burner for now. But many analysts believe the issue is still very much on the Israel-Trump agenda. Any such move will be highly disastrous for regional and international security.
True, the US has been responsible for scores of instances of regime change globally, through both covert operations and direct military intervention. But these came at a huge cost for America and the affected countries. Most of the latter suffer from chronic instability, chaos and economic impoverishment, recent examples being Iraq, Libya, Syria and Afghanistan. Israel cannot manage a regime change without American support.
The ceasefire between Israel and Iran and the reported resumption of nuclear negotiations between Washington and Tehran are a positive development. But much scepticism remains about Israel’s belligerent impulses and whether these can be contained.

• Party decries ‘miscarriage of justice’ by Lahore High Court
ISLAMABAD: As the Khyber Pakht­unkhwa government passed the budget for the upcoming financial year without the approval of PTI’s patron-in-chief, Imran Khan, his sister Aleema Khan claimed on Tuesday that a “minus Imran” formula was now in effect.
Separately, the party’s Punjab chapter has expressed strong disappointment over the Lahore High Court’s (LHC) decision to deny bail to Imran Khan in the May 9 cases.
Speaking to the media outside Adiala Jail, Aleema said that if KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur lacked the courage to stand his ground, he should have resigned.
The KP chief minister had earlier said that the budget would be discussed with Imran Khan before its passage.
Aleema Khan claimed the authorities had made it routine to deny meetings with her brother but vowed she would not relent and would continue visiting him in line with court orders, which allow family meetings on Tuesdays.
Responding to a question on the budget approval, she said Imran Khan had made it clear that the people of KP had voted for him and he wanted to personally allocate funds to ensure they were used appropriately.
“We are not aware of what is in this budget. They should have waited. Salman Akram Raja had informed us that, according to his information, the budget would be passed on June 27,” she said.
Aleema questioned why the KP government had not waited and discussed the budget with Imran Khan. She said the budget’s passage could have been delayed by two weeks and alleged that the KP government must be hiding something.
When asked why Imran Khan had not issued a strong statement against Israel, she said her brother’s message was for unity. “However, we don’t know what may happen tomorrow; Iran and the US might strike a deal. Those who are polishing boots want Imran Khan to speak out so they can complain (by saying that he is against the interest of Pakistan).”
Aleema added that Imran Khan was fully aware of the Iran-Israel situation and had predicted the conflict would not last long, as talks would inevitably resume due to the prevailing geopolitical situation.
Meanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared unaware that the KP Assembly had already passed the budget. Speaking to journalists, he said he believed the budget would be passed after one week but was informed on the spot that it had already been approved.
However, he maintained that if Imran Khan directed it, the KP government and all party legislators would resign immediately.
Reaction to LHC decision
PTI expressed strong disappointment over the LHC’s decision to deny bail to Imran Khan in the May 9 cases.
In a statement, the party said that despite months of proceedings, no credible evidence had been presented in these “politically motivated” cases.
“Today’s ruling amounts to a blatant miscarriage of justice,” the statement read, alleging that “politically controlled” courts continued to deliver verdicts while failing to uphold the principles of justice.
The party claimed that it remained resilient despite enduring extreme repression over the past three years. “We will continue to fight our legal battles in the courts while simultaneously preparing to launch a peaceful protest movement to demand justice,” it said.

THE Government of Pakistan’s choice for the Nobel Peace Prize is a person who has bombed Iran’s nuclear sites while pretending to negotiate peace with it. This is a violation of international law, the UN Charter, the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the IAEA Statute, and the US constitution itself. He has also comprehensively facilitated Israel’s criminal invasion of Iran — a Muslim neighbour of Pakistan that has supported it on Kashmir and in conflicts with India.
Israel’s invasion of Iran is the culmination of its century of genocide against the Palestinian people, which today forms part of a larger US project of multiple regime changes in the heart of the Muslim world. This in turn is part of a still larger project to eliminate China — Pakistan’s proven friend — as a global rival.
The so-called ceasefire announced on June 24 and the wretched games of war and peace that Trump plays in no way diminish his responsibility for the death, damage and suffering wantonly inflicted on civilians in Iran and several Muslim countries. Accordingly, all self-respecting Pakis­tanis were hugely embarrassed by this decision.
Earlier, there were reports that the field marshal made this decision. These were quickly downplayed and largely unreported in Pakistan. They were not officially denied because the White House appeared to confirm them. However, the prime minister has now made the decision.
Trump is as entitled to a Nobel Peace Prize as is India’s Butcher of Gujrat, Modi, and Israel’s Genocidal Exterminator, Netanyahu! Perhaps Trump, who believes he is entitled to several Nobel Peace Prizes, did not take kindly to Pakistan’s apparent backsliding. Amends have now been made and we have learnt there is no free lunch. However, in view of the outrage caused in Pakistan and the Muslim world, this decision has again become moot.

All self-respecting Pakistanis were embarrassed by the government’s decision.

In 1972, Zulfikar Bhutto told an ambassadors’ conference in Izmir that smaller countries could not rely on realpolitik alone for their security. Ultimately, they had to rely on international law, morality and norms.
The UN Charter states its determination to “to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war”. Earlier, the Nuremberg War Crimes tribunal recognised that initiating a war of aggression was the “supreme international crime” because it encompassed all the evil that could follow, including genocide.
The crime of aggression today is investigated by the International Criminal Court. Trump, however, has threatened to bomb the ICC if any American soldier is ever brought before it on war crime charges. Needless to note, no country since World War II has committed more international war crimes than the US.
According to Noam Chomsky, every US president since World War II has been guilty of unauthorised aggression against other countries without Congressional authorisation. These are capital crimes according to the US constitution.
More recently, Trump placed a travel ban on four judges of the ICC who had the temerity to charge US soldiers with war crimes. The fact that the US has not ratified the ICC in no way exempts it from its jurisdiction, as it pursues ICC-charged individuals of countries it does not like which have similarly not accepted its jurisdiction.
In the case of the Middle East, Israel, for all its alleged ‘chutzpah’, ie, impudence has been little more than the attack dog of the US ‘deep state’ that also ultimately controls Trump and his antics. Once out office, both Trump and Netanyahu may well end up in jail on several corruption charges. Accordingly, an extended peace does not suit them.
Israel claims it faces an ‘existential threat’ from Iran’s development of a nuclear bomb. This is an outright lie known to all the foreign offices of the world. Israel feels ‘existentially threatened’ because it knows its creation was itself a crime against the Palestinians and the people of the region.
Today, Israel is an existential threat to several regional countries in accordance with a Pentagon plan approved immediately after 9/11 — as disclosed by retired US Gen Wesley Clark, former supreme commander of Nato in Europe — to bring about regime change in seven regional countries, culminating with Iran. When all seven are done, can Turkey and Pakistan be far behind?
Iran accepted an Arab proposal for a nuclear weapons-free zone in the Middle East, which would have ended any nuclear weapons programme it may have had. The US, however, aborted the proposal because it wanted Israel to remain the only, if undeclared and illegal, nuclear weapons power in the region. Later, Iran in 2015 negotiated a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) with the P5 plus One countries, ie, the UNSC permanent members and Germany.
In return for sanctions relief, Iran agreed not to enrich its uranium beyond 3.7 per cent. Only after Trump reneged on the JCPOA, for which he was criticised by his European and Nato allies, did Iran raise its uranium enrichment to 60pc, which was still far from the 90pc plus enrichment required for nuclear weapons development. Although the IAEA criticised Iran, neither the Agency nor US intelligence ever confirmed Iran had actually developed a nuclear bomb which Iran consistently denies.
But with the return of Trump, the moral credibility of the European and Nato countries evaporated, clearing the way for US wars in the Middle East. Unfortunately, regional ruling elites have sought survival and class security through playing double games.
In conclusion, Pakistan earned a significant measure of international respect in its recent conflict with India, not least due to indispensable technical training and assistance from China. What will China now make of Pakistan’s apparent, if hesitant, pandering to its arch foe? Can it continue to trust a soft state seeking to ‘balance’ relations between China’s self-declared enemy and China itself? Sooner or later, it may despair of us.

The US-Israeli hostilities against Iran have subsided.
It appeared that a larger clash was brewing when Iran hit a major US airbase in Qatar on Monday night in retaliation against America’s bombing of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear facilities on Sunday.
But this turned out to be a largely symbolic and telegraphed attack, as only a few hours after the Iranian salvo, US President Donald Trump announced that a ceasefire had taken effect. Doubts about the truce dissipated when both Iran and Israel confirmed that the ceasefire had taken effect on Tuesday.
 
 

However, the fragility of this arrangement was clear to all as Israel claimed Iran had violated the truce, and threatened to hit Tehran. The Iranians denied the violation, and claimed their attacks had been launched before the truce took effect. Later in the day, Mr Trump would return to social media to tell the world that the ceasefire was intact, while asking Israel to “not drop those bombs”. Despite the strong warning, Israel went on to strike Iran after the ceasefire.
While the cessation of attacks is indeed welcome, questions swirl about how long — hours, days, weeks? — this truce will last. The main reason for this scepticism is that Israel has proved to be a belligerent, destabilising state that scuttles its commitments on the flimsiest pretext. It is also a fact that Mr Trump’s mood and policy decisions change frequently, though his latest comments indicate that his appetite for war with Iran has reduced considerably. Iran has said it will respond to truce violations, but the ‘measured’ response targeting the US base in Qatar shows that the Islamic Republic, too, is uninterested in escalation.
Now, it is up to America to rein in Israel if Mr Trump is serious about winding down this conflict. Angry social media posts will not make Tel Aviv come to its senses. The US needs to stop its flow of funds and arms to Israel if it really wants lasting, substantive peace in the Middle East.
Over 600 Iranians, including civilians, have been killed in the Israeli aggression. Assuming this is not a tactical move on the part of the US and Israel, all efforts must be made to make the ceasefire hold and prevent a further flare-up in the region. Moreover, Israel’s genocidal campaign in Gaza must also be brought to a halt.
While attacking Iran, Israeli forces have continued their murderous assault on the occupied Palestinian territory, with the result that over 56,000 people have been slaughtered in the Strip since Oct 7, 2023. Israel must immediately cease its criminal actions both in regional countries, as well as the occupied territories.

A two-judge bench comprising Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi and Justice Tariq Mahmood Bajwa announced a short order, which had been reserved the previous day, on the former prime minister’s bail petitions. The bench will issue a detailed verdict later.
The other cases involve attacks on Askari Tower at Liberty, PML-N offices in Model Town, Shadman police station, the burning of police vehicles near Jinnah House and violence at Sherpao Bridge.
On Nov 27 last year, an anti-terrorism court had denied bail to the former PM in these eight cases.
The bail petitions, filed through Barrister Salman Safdar, argued that the prosecution had failed to establish any connection between the petitioner and the incidents mentioned in the FIRs.

Prosecution claims PTI founder instructed party leaders, workers to attack military installations

They claimed that Imran Khan had been implicated in the May 9 cases as part of a well-orchestrated plan aimed at harassing and humiliating him for political reasons, despite the fact that he was in NAB custody at the time.
The petitions further stated that the only allegation against the petitioner was of “abetment,” which the prosecution had presented in vague terms. It was also argued that the trial court overlooked the fact that similar allegations had already been dismissed due to inconsistencies in the investigating agency’s narrative.
The petitions requested the LHC to overturn the trial court’s decision and grant bail to the former premier in all eight FIRs.
Opposing the bail, the prosecution told the court that the PTI founding chairman had instructed party leaders and workers to attack military installations.
It said an audio recording allegedly of the PTI founder had been forensically examined and was to be matched with his voice. However, the accused had refused to undergo a voice-matching test.
The prosecution maintained that the Jinnah House attack case was distinct from the others as Imran Khan had been specifically nominated in the FIR. It added that substantial evidence existed against him, making him ineligible for bail.

• Questions linger over terms of ceasefire, future of Tehran’s nuclear ambitions
DOHA / WASHINGTON: Iran’s ‘strike’ on the US military base in Qatar was carefully calculated to provide an exit from hostilities with Washington and set up a truce with Israel, according to analysts and officials with knowledge of the matter.
The missile launches were signalled well in advance, minimising the risk of injury and giving every opportunity to shoot down the projectiles — resulting in a fireworks display of booms and flashes above Doha.
They followed heavy US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities at the weekend, a sudden escalation that raised concerns about how Tehran would respond after more than a week of exchanges with Israel.
It would seem that Qatar, located across the Persian Gulf, held the answer in the form of Al Udeid, the Middle East’s biggest US base and headquarters of its regional command.
Targeting a US base, rather than inciting fury, triggered a calm reaction from President Donald Trump, who thanked Iran for giving “early notice”.
Qatar condemned the strikes — Iran’s first on a Gulf country’s territory — but its prime minister said the response would be diplomatic and legal, rather than military.
Then, hours after the attack, Trump announced a ceasefire that both Israel and Iran later said they would accept.
A source with knowledge of the talks said Doha had spoken to Tehran and “persuaded” it to stop fighting.
Trump spoke directly to Netanyahu, and Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff were involved in the direct and indirect communications with Iran, the official said.
But it was Qatar that helped broker contacts with Tehran. According to a source with knowledge of the talks, Qatari PM Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani spoke to the Iranians at Washington’s request after the strikes.
Trump told Qatar’s emir that Israel had agreed to a ceasefire, before US Vice President JD Vance spoke to the prime minister “who persuaded Iran to agree to the proposal in a call with the Iranians”, the source said.
Will it last?
A long list of big unanswered questions remains, not least whether any ceasefire can actually hold between two bitter foes, whose years-long rivalry turned into an air war when Israel launches strikes against Iran. This fierce fighting marked the past 12 days of strikes on each other’s territory.
The concerns were underscored on Tuesday as Trump accused both Israel and Iran of violating the fragile truce within hours after it was due to take effect.
Questions also remain about what has actually been agreed to, even as Trump’s declaration raised hopes for the end of a conflict that has prompted fears of a broader regional war.
For example, will the US and Iran revive failed nuclear talks; what will be the fate of Iran’s stockpile of enriched uranium, which many experts believe may have survived the US and Israeli bombing campaign.
Signalling a difficult path ahead, it took hours for Israel and Iran to even acknowledge that they had accepted the ceasefire that Trump said he had brokered.
“Now that Trump has declared ‘world peace’, it will be hard for Netanyahu to publicly contradict him,” said Laura Blumenfeld, a Middle East expert at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies in Washington.
“Can the ceasefire hold?” asked Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator for Republican and Democratic administrations. “Yes, the Iranians need it and the Israelis have largely now acted against the [Israeli Defence Force’s] target list.”
‘Calibrated response’
Trump administration officials deemed Iran’s response to have been calibrated to avoid further escalation with the US, according to sources familiar with the matter.
Ali Vaez, senior advisor at the International Crisis Group said said the “good relationship between Iran and Qatar is the reason that Iran opted to strike… the Al Udeid base in Qatar”.
“I see this as a continuation of Qatar’s mediation between Iran and the United States, that it has taken this punch as a means of trying to prevent further escalation,” Vaez added.
Wealthy Gulf states in Iran’s immediate neighbourhood, which host a number of US military sites, had been preparing for days for a possible strike.
Last week, dozens of US military aircraft disappeared from the tarmac at Al Udeid, according to satellite images published by Planet Labs PBC and analysed by AFP.
In the hours before the attack, the US embassy in Qatar advised Americans there not to go out, with some other Western embassies echoing the warning.
Shortly before the strikes, air traffic was suspended over Qatar “as part of a set of precautionary measures”, the country’s foreign ministry said.
Chatham House geopolitics specialist Neil Quilliam said the attack was “clearly limited” and “intended to satisfy Iran’s population that its leadership responded forcibly to the US air strikes on Saturday”.
“The Israelis have accomplished much of their objectives … and Iran was looking for an off-ramp, said Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy US national intelligence officer for the Middle East.
“The US hopes this is the beginning of the end. The challenge is whether there is a strategy for what comes next.”

The KSE-100 index climbed by 6079.16 points, or 5.23 per cent, to close at 122,246.63 points.
Earlier in the day, shares at the PSX had climbed by 5,878 points a few hours after it opened. It reached an earlier intraday high of 122,045.62 from the last close of 116,167.47 yesterday, before a market halt was initiated.
Yousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, attributed the rise to the overnight announcement of a ceasefire, with broad-based gains across sectors.
Farooq said, “The Pakistan market rallied earlier today following the overnight announcement of a ceasefire.
“However, reports during the day of Israeli claims that Iran has violated the ceasefire dampened sentiment, pulling the market down from an intraday high of 122,045.62 to 121,926.63 currently. Despite the pullback, local fundamentals remain intact, and the rally could resume if the ceasefire holds. Geopolitical developments will continue to drive market direction in the near term.
Global shares rallied and the dollar extended declines as a ceasefire to end a 12-day war between Iran and Israel came into effect, while oil prices dived to nearly two-week lows on easing concerns about supply disruptions, Reuters reported.
At 11:26am, a PSX notice informed that due to a 5pc increase in the KSE-30 index from the previous trading day close of the index, a market halt had been triggered as per PSX regulations and all equity and equity-based markets have been suspended accordingly.
The market reopened after a gap of an hour at 12:31pm.
Farooq explained, “If the KSE-30 Index moves ±5pc from the previous day’s close and remains at that level for five consecutive minutes, trading is stopped for 60 minutes.”
He added that this mechanism kicks into action whether the index rises by 5pc or falls by that margin to help cool the market down.
The PSX had endured a sharp sell-off on Monday, as escalating geopolitical tensions in the Middle East — sparked by reported US airstrikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Tehran’s threat to close the Strait of Hormuz — sent shockwaves through global markets, triggering panic selling and wiping out more than 3,800 points from the benchmark KSE-100 index.
The Israeli government said it had achieved all its objectives in the war with Iran, and that it had agreed to the US-proposed ceasefire after removing the “dual existential threat” of Tehran’s nuclear programme and ballistic missiles.
Israel nonetheless warned it would “respond forcefully” to any Iranian violation of the truce.
Oil prices fell 5pc after Israel agreed to the proposal.
The ceasefire agreement, as outlined by Trump on social media in a surprise late-night post, would see the arch enemies stop firing in staggered phases.
According to Trump, Iran would unilaterally halt all operations beginning 4am GMT (9am PKT) on Tuesday, with Israel following suit 12 hours later.
After Trump’s announcement, Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on social media that “as of now, there is no ‘agreement’ on ceasefire or cessation of military operations”.
However, he added that if Israel stopped “its illegal aggression”, Tehran would have “no intention to continue our response afterwards”.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari calls on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.—APP

ISLAMABAD: Hours after a ceasefire between Iran and Israel, brokered by US President Donald Trump, Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif on Tues­day reiterated Paki­stan’s unwavering support for Iran at all diplomatic for­ums, including the United Nations.
Welcoming the ceasefire, the Foreign Office also pledged to support all efforts to bring peace and stability in the region, in line with the principles of the UN Charter.
The prime minister spoke with the leaders and ambassadors of Iran, Saudi Arabia, China and Qatar and expressed solidarity and support against the backdrop of the Iran-Israel conflict.
According to the PM’s Office, he spoke on the phone with Iranian Pres­ident Dr Masoud Pezes­hkian on Tuesday afternoon. During the call, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed Paki­stan’s commitment to supporting Iran at international platforms, including the UN Security Council and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
The prime minister emphasised the need for all parties involved to adhere to international law and the principles outlined in the UN Charter. He said Pakistan was  closely following the rapidly evolving situation in the Middle East and reiterated Pakistan’s call for restoring peace through dialogue and diplomacy.
President Pezeshkian thanked Pakistan for its consistent support, acknowledging Pakistan’s constructive role in promoting a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The two leaders also discussed the importance of unity among the Ummah in these challenging times and agreed to stay in close contact.
The Iranian president appreciated Pakistan’s consistent and principled support to Iran throughout the crisis and acknowledged its constructive role in promoting a peaceful resolution to the conflict.
The two leaders agreed on the importance of unity among the Ummah during this most challenging time and agreed to remain in touch.
Meetings with envoys
Earlier, the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia and Qatar called on PM Shehbaz on Tuesday and discussed the Middle East situation, particularly after the Iranian attack on the US military base in Qatar.
During the meeting with Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to Pakistan, Ambassador Nawaf bin Said Al-Malki, the prime minister assured that Pakistan would continue to work closely with Saudi Arabia for peace in the region through dialogue and diplomacy.
In the meeting with Ambassador of Qatar Ali Mubarak Ali Essa Al-Khater, the prime minister expressed solidarity with Qatar’s emir and the people following Monday night’s attacks on a US military base. “We pray for the safety and security of our Qatari brothers and sisters, and the entire region,” he added.
The prime minister said that Pakistan had always advocated dialogue and diplomacy as the only path to lasting peace in the Middle East.
The Qatari ambassador thanked the prime minister for immediately reaching out to him after this “most unfortunate development” as well as for the expression of solidarity at that critical time.
Meanwhile, Ambassador of China to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong on Tuesday lauded the proactive and positive role being played by Pakistan at every diplomatic forum, including at the United Nations Security Council, for a peaceful settlement of the regional security situation through dialogue and diplomacy.
The Chinese ambassador called on Prime Minister Shehbaz and discussed the regional security situation, particularly recent developments in the Iran-Israel conflict, and other bilateral issues.
The prime minister extended his best wishes for the successful holding of the upcoming SCO Summit and acknowledged the ongoing consultations between the two sides concerning his visit to China to attend the event.
Call with MBS
Prime Minister Shehbaz also held a telephone conversation with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, congratulating him on the successful completion of Haj and thanking the Kingdom for its hospitality towards Pakistani pilgrims.
The premier thanked Saudi Arabia for its support to Pakistan during the recent standoff with India. He said Pakistan was ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with India on all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir, water, trade and terrorism.
Both leaders also exchanged views on the Middle East crisis and agreed on the need for de-escalation of the Iran-Israel conflict.
According to the Prime Minister’s Office, the crown prince thanked PM Shehbaz for the telephone call and appreciated Pakistan’s expression of solidarity and support for the Kingdom.
He acknowledged Pakistan’s constructive role in promoting a peaceful resolution to the Iran-Israel conflict. The crown prince said Saudi Arabia was fully committed to efforts aimed at fostering lasting peace and stability in the Middle East.
Banquet for Bilawal-led delegation
On Tuesday night, Prime Minister Shehbaz also hosted a dinner in honour of the Pakistani delegation, led by PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, for their successful diplomatic efforts in countering Indian propaganda globally during their visits to the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe.
Other delegation members included Sherry Rehman, Dr Musadik Malik, Hina Rabbani Khar, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt, Senator Faisal Sabzwari, Engineer Khurram Dastagir, Jalil Abbas Jilani and Tehmina Janjua.
“You fought Pakistan’s case with the national spirit and returned successfully,” the premier told the delegation during the dinner at the PM House.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari briefed the prime minister on the meetings held by the Pakistani diplomatic delegation abroad.

While exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka recorded notable growth — buoyed in part by changing political dynamics in the region — the overall trade gap continued to expand due to surging imports, particularly from China, India and Bangladesh.
The most concerning trend for policymakers remains the sustained decline in exports to China, Pakistan’s largest trading partner in the region, despite imports from the country surging. This has further deepened the bilateral trade imbalance, with similar patterns observed in trade with India and Bangladesh.
In FY24, Pakistan’s trade deficit with these nine neighbours stood at $9.506bn, reflecting a 49pc increase from $6.382bn in FY23.

Surge in imports from China, India deepens regional trade imbalance

According to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan, exports to the region in July-May FY25 edged up 0.98pc to $4.085bn from $4.045bn in the same period last year. In contrast, imports jumped 22.52pc to $15.255bn from $12.451bn a year ago.
A deeper analysis reveals that imports from China surged 22.59pc to $14.890bn in July-May FY25 from $12.146bn. In FY24, imports from China had already risen 39.78pc to $13.506bn from $9.662bn the previous year. China accounts for the bulk of Pakistan’s regional imports, followed by India and Bangladesh.
 
 

Exports to China, however, fell 11.18pc to $2.270bn in the first 11 months of FY25, down from $2.556bn in the same period last year.
Imports from India rose 11.82pc to $211.42m during July-May FY25, compared to $189.07m a year earlier. In FY24, these imports totalled $206.89m, up from $190.04m in FY23. Meanwhile, exports to India remained negligible at $0.51m in 11MFY25, compared to $3.43m last year. In FY24, Pakistan’s exports to India stood at $3.669m, having risen sharply from $0.329m in the preceding year.
Exports to Afghanistan grew significantly by 41.39pc to $723.44m, up from $511.63m in the previous year. Imports from Afghanistan also increased sharply by 142pc to $24.72m from $10.18m. Pakistan’s main export to Afghanistan during FY25 was sugar, with over 700,000 tonnes exported over the past four months alone.
Exports to Bangladesh rose by 21.45pc to $728.31m from $599.65m. Imports from Bangladesh climbed 41.95pc to $73.55m from $51.67m. This boost in trade followed political upheaval in Dhaka and the resumption of rice exports to Bangladesh. Exports to Sri Lanka declined slightly by 3.02pc to $352.37m, compared to $363.36m last year. The drop was attributed to recessionary pressures in Sri Lanka. Imports from the island nation remained unchanged at $54m.

PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan.

• PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan asks whether decision had cabinet nod  • Demands parliament be briefed on Trump-COAS meeting
• Sibghatullah criticises Trump’s role in Israel’s war on Palestine  • NA approves demands for grants of Rs51.6tr for various ministries
ISLAMABAD: Opposition lawm­akers on Tuesday strongly condemned the government’s decision to nominate US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, demanding an explanation for the controversial move.
The government recently posted on X that Mr Trump deserved the award “in recognition of his decisive diplomatic intervention and pivotal leadership during the recent India-Pakistan crisis”.
 






Opposition members questioned the basis of the nomination and sought clarification on what led to such a decision.
Meanwhile, in a significant development towards the passage of the upcoming fiscal year’s budget, the National Assembly approved 108 demands for grants for various ministries and divisions, amounting to over Rs51.6 trillion. The government rejected all 405 cut motions moved by opposition lawmakers, clearing a path for the passage of the budget.
The National Assembly also approved 29 demands, totalling over Rs81.75 billion, for the Cabinet Division for the upcoming fiscal year, dismissing 112 cut motions from the opposition.
During the debate on the cut motions, opposition lawmakers raised the issue of the US president’s Nobel nomination.
PTI leader Ali Muhammad Khan asked if the decision had been approved by the cabinet. Referring to the recent meeting between Mr Trump and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir at the White House, he said the cabinet and parliament should be briefed on what was discussed during that meeting.
Mr Khan also took the opportunity to clarify the issue of Taliban resettlement in Pakistan, which had been the subject of much controversy. He denied the notion that the repatriation was ordered by Imran Khan during PTI’s tenure, explaining that the matter had been discussed in a 2021 cabinet meeting attended by key federal ministers, and the then army chief and ISI director-general.
He asserted that the proposal was opposed by cabinet members and no decision had been made before the “regime change”, following which Shehbaz Sharif and Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari became the prime minister and foreign minister, respectively.
Sahibzada Sibghat Ullah also demanded that the people of Pakistan want to know if the decision to nominate Mr Trump for Nobel Peace Prize had been taken by the cabinet or an individual. He questioned the rationale behind the nomination, insisting that Israel devastated Palestine “at the behest of Donald Trump” and also attacked Iran.
Jamshed Dasti also raised the issue, asking if the government had any shame in nominating Mr Trump for the peace prize.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif briefly attended the session but left during Mr Dasti’s speech.
‘Bloated cabinet’
Aliya Kamran of JUI-F pointed out that under Article 92(1) of the Constitution, the number of cabinet members cannot exceed 11 per cent of the total strength of parliament, meaning the limit should be 48 members.
However, she noted that the current cabinet had over 80 members, which she said violated the spirit of the 18th Amendment. She called for a reduction in the cabinet’s size and suggested that the savings should be directed towards public welfare.
Ms Kamran also claimed that the Special Investment Facilitation Council and the Board of Investment were doing overlapping job and funds were being allocated to both. “This anomaly should be removed,” she stressed.
 
 

Winding up the discussion on the cut motions for the Ministry of Commerce, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan said the government planned to increase exports to $60bn over the next four years, nearly doubling the current $30.3bn.
He said the government was introducing the Strategic Trade Policy Framework (STPF) 2024-30 to boost exports. “We identified challenges in each sector, proposed legal and institutional reforms and created a clear roadmap,” he said.
Mr Khan also emphasised the importance of agro-food and food technology exports, saying the government was incorporating food tech into export policies to meet global market demands.
Energy sector
Responding to the opposition’s criticism of the energy sector, Minister for Power Awais Leghari defended the government’s energy policies, claiming that the current administration had reduced electricity prices for 20 million of the 30 million metered consumers. He said that tariffs for consumers using up to 200 units had been reduced by 58pc.
Mr Leghari criticised the previous PTI-led government’s energy deals, particularly those with independent power producers (IPPs). “We have reversed plans that would have burdened consumers with Rs4,500 billion over the next six to seven years,” he claimed.
He also pointed out that losses in power distribution companies (Discos) had decreased by Rs180bn within 11 months under the current administration.
About circular debt, Mr Leghari said the government had developed a six-year plan to eliminate the Rs1.26tr debt and that Rs110bn in overbilling had been refunded to consumers. He also vowed to rationalise the net metering system.

• Salman Akram Raja ‘blindsided’; Saif claims Imran okayed budget from Adiala
PESHAWAR: The midnight passage of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa budget has exposed deep divisions within the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur claiming that any delay could have paved the way for the imposition of governor’s rule in the province.
The KP Assembly approved the budget around midnight on Monday, bulldozing cut motions on demands for grants, prompting opposition lawmakers to boycott the proceedings.
On Tuesday, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja expressed his surprise at the move. “Passing of the KP budget yesterday has come as a complete surprise to me. On June 22, the Political Committee of the PTI endorsed the decision of the KP parliamentary party to pass the budget, if no meeting with (Imran) Khan Sb is allowed, by the latest date possible to prevent financial chaos,” he wrote on X.
 






Mr Raja said that a meeting with Mr Khan was scheduled on Monday. “The outcome of this meeting and further possible meetings before the 30th should have been awaited before the passing of the KP budget,” he said.
Former KP finance minister Taimur Saleem Jhagra said in a X post that the party needed to put its house in order, adding that the mishandling of the issue had harmed both the party and Imran Khan.
 






“The political committee meeting was called at the last minute, and on Iran. Many of us weren’t able to attend it, including me, and were even surprised that the budget was put up for discussion. Many individuals I heard from later told me they were blindsided by the discussion,” he said.
Mr Jhagra noted that the budget was presented as late as June 18 and that KP was the only government so far to have passed its budget, while Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan and the federal governments were yet to do so.
“The passage of the budget could easily have been extended till the 26th and 27th, and space made to get instructions from Imran Khan today,” he said, adding that the budget needed to be passed before June 30 to prevent the federal government from having an excuse to impose an emergency.
‘Minus-one campaign’
On the other hand, KP Chief Minister Gandapur, in a video message posted on social media, accused unnamed people of conspiring to weaken Imran Khan and his agenda.
He said there was a conspiracy to impose governor’s rule in the province in case of the non-passage of the budget. He alleged that some party members also became part of this plan and ran a “minus one” campaign. “Those people are supporting someone else’s agenda,” Mr Gandapur said.
He said the provincial government had the authority to incorporate the party founder’s direction into the budget. However, he said that the budget must be passed according to a schedule.
He said Imran Khan had made it clear on Monday that he was okay with the provincial government’s decision to pass the budget.
KP government spokesperson Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif, who met the party’s incarcerated founder in Adiala Jail on Monday, said in a statement that they discussed the provincial budget and other issues in detail.
Barrister Saif said he informed Imran Khan about the legal and constitutional issues related to the budget. He stated that failing to pass the budget on schedule would have resulted in a serious legal and constitutional crisis, leading to the non-payment of salaries and other government expenditures.
He claimed Imran Khan had consented to the budget’s passage and that following further discussions with the chief minister and finance adviser, amendments could still be made. However, he alleged that these officials were not being allowed to meet Mr Khan.
In a jibe directed at Barrister Saif, Mr Jhagra posted on social media: “On a lighter note, everyone should go to Adiala with a Barrister Saif mask on. Maybe that will help.”
A KP cabinet member told Dawn that although the budget had to be passed on Monday as per the official schedule, the Assembly secretariat’s agenda indicated that voting on demands for grants and consideration of Finance Bill amendments was scheduled for Tuesday.

He also said that relations with Iran were scarred by an Iranian missile volley at a United States airbase in the Gulf Arab state, but added that he hoped ties would eventually “come back to normal”.
Iran responded to US participation in Israel’s air war against Iran by firing missiles on Monday at the Al Ubeid air base, but no one was hurt after Tehran gave warning, and a ceasefire was announced hours later by Washington.
Qatar, situated just across the Gulf from Iran, has often acted as a mediator in regional conflicts, including between Iran and the US and between Israel and Hamas in the continuing Gaza conflict.
“What happened will definitely have its scar on the relationship [with Iran], but I hope by the time everyone learns the lesson that this kind of neighbourhood relationship should not be violated and should not be undermined,” Qatar’s prime minister, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, told a press conference with his Lebanese counterpart in Doha.
The prime minister described the attack as “unacceptable” but said Qatar’s response would be “diplomatic and legal”.
“The attack on the State of Qatar is an unacceptable act, especially that the State of Qatar has been making great diplomatic efforts in order to have the situation de-escalated,” he said.
“The partnership between Qatar and the US is just growing stronger … and I hope the good relationship with Iran comes back to normal as soon as possible,” he said.
 


Al Thani added that Qatar had liaised with Iran at Washington’s request to help facilitate the ceasefire.
“We hope the ceasefire will continue as agreed upon, and we urge both the US and Iran to return to the negotiating table with the aim of reaching a comprehensive diplomatic solution, something that Qatar has consistently sought,” he said.
He added that Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian expressed regret in a phone call with Qatar’s ruling Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani that Tehran’s target in retaliating for US airstrikes was a military base in Qatar.
Sheikh Mohammed also urged Washington and Tehran to resume Oman-mediated talks on Iran’s nuclear programme that were frozen when Israel began striking Iran.
He said that Qatar, a key mediator between Israel and Hamas, was working on resuming talks for a fresh ceasefire in the Gaza conflict.
“We are still continuing our efforts, and God willing, we will try to look for an opportunity during the next two days for having indirect negotiations between the two parties,” he said.
“We hope that the Israeli side will not exploit the ceasefire with Iran to unleash what it wants to unleash on Gaza and continue its bombing of” the strip, Sheikh Mohammed added.
Qatar PM persuaded Iran to accept ceasefire, says source with knowledge of talks
Separately, a source with knowledge of the talks said Qatar’s prime minister persuaded Iran to agree to the US-proposed ceasefire with Israel after Iranian missiles targeted the American base near Doha.
Sheikh Mohammed spoke to the Iranians at Washington’s request following Monday’s unprecedented attack on Qatari soil, the source told AFP.
“In the aftermath of the strikes on Al Udeid [military base], President [Donald] Trump told the Emir of Qatar [that] Israel had signed off on an American ceasefire proposal,” the source said.
“The US president then asked that Qatar help get Iran to agree to a deal,” the source added, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.
US Vice President JD Vance spoke to the Qatari prime minister, “who persuaded Iran to agree to the proposal in a call with the Iranians”, the source said.
Israel said today it had agreed to the ceasefire, which is now “in effect”, according to Trump.
Iran has yet to formally accept the truce, but its top security body said the Islamic Republic’s forces had “compelled” Israel to “unilaterally” cease fire.</p><small>2025-06-24 16:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24210127dcabd90.jpg?r=211208' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919801/two-soldiers-martyred-11-terrorists-killed-in-south-waziristan-ibo-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Two soldiers martyred, 11 terrorists killed in South Waziristan IBO: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Two soldiers were martyred and 11 terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said on Tuesday.
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On June 24 2025, security Forces conducted an IBO in the general area Sararogha, South Waziristan District, on [the] reported presence of Khwarij belonging to Indian Proxy, Fitna-al-Khwarij.”
In July last year, the government designated the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) as Fitna-al-Khawarij, while mandating all institutions to use the term khariji (outcast) when referring to the perpetrators of terrorist attacks on Pakistan
The statement said that the troops effectively engaged the terrorists’ location and “11 Indian sponsored khwarij were sent to hell, while seven khwarij got injured”.
“However, during the intense fire exchange, Major Syed Moiz Abbas Shah (age: 37 years, resident of District Chakwal), a brave officer who was leading his troops from the front, fought gallantly and paid the ultimate sacrifice along with another brave son of soil Lance Naik Jibran Ullah (age: 27 years, resident of District Bannu),” it added.
The ISPR said that Major Moiz was known for “his courage and daring actions in numerous operations conducted against the khwarij”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored khariji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR added.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid rich tribute to the martyred soldiers for bravely fighting against the enemy during the operation.
“Major Syed Moiz Abbas and Lance Naik Jibranullah sacrificed their lives for the secure future of the nation. They are true heroes who thwarted the malicious plans of Indian-backed terrorists and eliminated 11 militants,” Naqvi said in a statement.
The interior minister added that “these martyrs gave their lives to deliver a strong message to the enemy and are a proud example of bravery for the nation. Their heroic sacrifice will always be remembered by the people.”
Earlier this month, five terrorists were killed during operations in KP’s Peshawar and North Waziristan districts, with the military terming them “Indian-sponsored” ones.
ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had also accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.</p><small>2025-06-24 16:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610758-i-think-minus-imran-khan-has-happened-says-aleema-on-passage-of-kp-budget' target='_blank'><strong>'I think minus Imran Khan has happened', says Aleema on passage of KP budget</strong></a><br><p>

Fatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure.
Mansehra Rescue 1122 spokesperson Amir Khadam said, “A car with three family members aboard fell into a ravine, resulting in the death of the couple,” adding that the three-year-old son remained safe in the incident.
He said that the family had come to Kaghan from Punjab’s Attock district for a picnic.
“Local people and rescue teams reached the spot as soon as the incident was reported, Khadam said. “The bodies were recovered from the car and immediately taken to the Kaghan Rural Health Centre for first aid.”
He added that the bodies were sent to their native area of Hazro in the Attock district.
On March 5, three employees of a Chinese company working on the Dasu hydropower project were killed when a truck plunged into the Indus River in Upper Kohistan district.
Last month, eight members of a family died when a Rawalpindi-bound Suzuki car plunged into a deep ravine in the Matta Banda area of KP’s Lower Kohistan district.</p><small>2025-06-24 15:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610763-two-army-officers-martyred-11-indian-sponsored-terrorists-killed-in-kps-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>Major among two soldiers martyred, 11 Indian-sponsored terrorists killed in KP's South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>

Fatal road accidents on highways occur frequently in Pakistan, mainly due to overspeeding, hazardous overtaking and disregard for traffic rules.
According to Shalkot Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Athar Rashid, “In the tragic incident, five passengers on the bus were killed and seven others were injured.”
He said that the bodies of the deceased had become unrecognisable due to the burns.
“The injured were taken to the Bolan Medical Complex and Civil Hospital, and two of them are in critical condition,” he said.
DSP Rashid added that the local bus was going from Nawan area to Hazarganji when the accident occurred at the Raisani area on the Western Bypass, adding that the bus caught fire after colliding with a petrol-laden loader rickshaw.
In a statement, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind expressed sorrow over the incident.
“We express our heartfelt sympathy to the families of the passengers who died in the tragic accident,” he said. “The injured are being provided with immediate and the best medical assistance. Treatment and facilities are being ensured for them.”
Rind said that an investigation was launched into the incident, stating, “Strict action will be taken against those responsible once the investigation is completed.”
He also said that all possible help and support will be provided to the affected families.
Separately, Adviser on Local Government Hamza Zehri also extended condolences to the bereaved families, directing authorities to provide facilities to the injured.
He said, “No one will be allowed to play with the lives and property of citizens. [The] Metropolitan Corporation should seize mini petrol pumps and installations established in densely populated areas of the city.”
“Those responsible for the Western Bypass incident will be identified and punished,” he added.
In April, a bus driver was burnt alive and seven passengers were injured as their bus caught fire after hitting a mini-truck laden with pesticides at Gojra on the M-4 motorway near Nawan Lahore interchange.
Earlier this year, a fatal collision between two cars near Dhabeji on the Karachi-Thatta section of the National Highway claimed four lives, among them a newly-wed man and his mother, and left six injured when the vehicles caught fire following the accident.</p><small>2025-06-24 14:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/241853074317bff.jpg?r=185525' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919787/novo-nordisk-launches-weight-loss-drug-wegovy-in-india-to-compete-with-lillys-mounjaro' target='_blank'><strong>Novo Nordisk launches weight-loss drug Wegovy in India to compete with Lilly’s Mounjaro</strong></a><br><p>Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk on Tuesday launched its blockbuster weight-loss drug Wegovy in India, three months after Eli Lilly began marketing its rival product Mounjaro in the world’s most populous nation.
Wegovy is already under distribution and is expected to be in pharmacies by the end of the month, Novo Nordisk India Managing Director Vikrant Shrotriya said at a briefing.
Lilly and Novo have been part of obesity awareness programs in India in the lead-up to their drug launches there. The market potential in India, a nation of more than 1.4 billion, is significant, with obesity and diabetes rates steadily climbing.
Sales of Lilly’s weight-loss drug Mounjaro jumped 60 per cent between April and May, industry experts said.
Analysts said Wegovy, a once-a-week injection, had been priced competitively to Mounjaro in India, and that is likely to encourage wider adoption of those drugs.
Global demand for both Mounjaro and Wegovy has skyrocketed in recent years, with supply limited, leading to shortages in countries such as the US.
Novo said in a separate statement to Reuters that it is not anticipating any supply constraints in India.
Wegovy will be available in five dose strengths in India, with 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg and 1 mg versions priced at Rs4,336.25 ($50.71), the company said. The monthly cost would be Rs17,345, similar to Mounjaro. Its 1.7 mg dose will be priced at Rs24,280, and the 2.4 mg version at Rs26,015 for a month’s supply.
Mounjaro, also a once-weekly injection, is priced at Rs3,500 for a 2.5 mg vial and 4,375 rupees for a 5 mg vial, its lowest doses, the company said in March. Its highest dose is 15 mg.
Shrikant Akolkar, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Nuvama Institutional Equities, said the pricing is “a little aggressive”, as Wegovy’s active ingredient semaglutide goes off patent next year in India.
“Generic drugmakers will surely launch the generic injection at a steep discount to these prices,” Akolkar said.
India’s generic drugmakers, including Sun Pharma, Cipla, Dr. Reddy’s and Lupin, are racing to produce cheaper copies of Wegovy.
Vishal Manchanda, an analyst at Systematix Institutional Equities, expected Wegovy prices “can correct 60pc to 90pc” once generics enter the market.
About 24pc of women and nearly 23pc of men aged 15 to 49 were either overweight or obese in India, a government survey conducted between 2019 and 2021 showed, up from 20.6pc of women and 19% of men in 2015-2016.
Novo’s Shrotriya said that with the higher dose of Wegovy, “one in three patients achieves 20pc weight loss”, adding it had conducted late-stage trials of injectable semaglutide on 3,500 individuals in India.
Wegovy has helped people lose an average 15pc of their body weight, compared with nearly 23pc achieved by Mounjaro, combined with a healthy diet and exercise, the company has said.
Both Mounjaro and Wegovy belong to a class of therapies known as GLP-1 receptor agonists that help control blood sugar and slow digestion, making people feel fuller for longer.
Wegovy in India will be available in a “pen device”, unlike conventional vials and syringes, the company said.
Novo’s launch in India comes more than a month after the then-CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen was ousted over concerns the company was losing its first-mover advantage in the highly competitive market. Novo is yet to name a replacement.

Asif earlier stressed that Pakistan stood in “complete solidarity” with Iran amid Israel’s unprovoked and “unjustified aggression” against Tehran, which began on June 13 and escalated over 12 days. The conflict intensified after the US intervened by striking three of Iran’s nuclear sites. Tehran first responded by launching missiles at Tel Aviv, then targeted US bases in Qatar following the American strikes. On Tuesday morning, US President Donald Trump announced that Iran and Israel had reached a “ceasefire”.
Israel, without evidence, claimed that its initial strike on Iran was “preventive”, meant to address an immediate, inevitable threat from the Islamic Republic’s part to construct a nuclear bomb. Tel Aviv also suggested that the IAEA report released on June 12, which condemned Iran for material violations of its Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) commitments until the early 2000s, constituted such an emergency. However, the IAEA also seemed to reject that claim, since there was nothing in the report that was not already known to the relevant parties, according to Al Jazeera.
In an interview with an Iranian state-run news agency IRNA in Islamabad, Asif said, “Unlike Iran, the Westerners have destroyed the opportunity for diplomacy and are the cause of the beginning of the aggressions of the Zionist regime and the United States.”
The defence minister emphasised that Iran’s approach had been “very constructive’ and Tehran never sought confrontation, adding that Israel wanted to “overshadow the region to push the situation towards war”.
He added that “a regime that is not even a member of the NPT and there is no monitoring and inspection of its nuclear arsenals, can do anything and has the authorisation to carry out any aggression and attack on Palestine, Gaza, Yemen and now against Iran.”
“All these countries are the targets of these deliberate and reckless actions of Tel Aviv, which is not held accountable by the IAEA,” Asif further said.
He condemned Israel’s “terrorist attacks and the US aggressive crime against Iran’s nuclear facilities”, considering these actions contrary to international law, the UN Charter and humanitarian norms.
“I think the situation has escalated to a dangerous level, especially over the past few weeks when Iran continuously emphasised the need for negotiations and participation in this entire process, and that the Iranians have never left the negotiating table,” he was quoted as saying by IRNA.
“Iran has never initiated the war, but both the destruction of diplomacy and the initiation of the war were carried out by the other side (America and Israel), which led to the illegitimate aggression of Israel against the nation,” he added.
Asif further said, “It is ridiculous that the West always wants Iran to return to the negotiating table, because the Iranians did not leave the negotiating table, but have always demanded interaction and negotiations.”
He noted that even when Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was negotiating with the Europeans, another aggression against the country took place.
Asif said Israel’s “continued aggression against Palestinians had now reached Iran”, calling it a “conspiracy planned and implemented by the Zionist regime”.
“Iranians stand with Palestine, and this is never a crime. Human dignity and the defence of religious values must be followed by the international community, and they must stand against Israeli aggression and rush to help the Palestinians,” he reaffirmed.
He added that the US and Israel were trampling on all international laws, human values and traditions, and “massacring children, women, old and young in Gaza”.
The defence minister told the people of Iran to stand firm and steadfast because “God is with them and all nations in the world feel the pain of the Iranian nation because this is a crime and a clear aggression against Iran, and these crimes will definitely be responded to.”</p><small>2025-06-24 13:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/241802269fa3ae9.jpg?r=180231' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919782/india-aviation-regulator-says-multiple-defects-reappearing-on-aircraft' target='_blank'><strong>India aviation regulator says multiple defects reappearing on aircraft</strong></a><br><p>India’s aviation regulator said on Tuesday it had found multiple instances of aircraft defects reappearing “many times” at Mumbai and Delhi airports, two of the country’s busiest, indicating what it said were inadequate checks on jetliners.
The findings were part of a special audit being carried out by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to strengthen safety in the wake of a deadly Air India crash that killed 271 people earlier this month.
The regulator did not name the airlines where the defects were found or detail the type of defects. The two airports in the world’s third-largest aviation market serve major Indian airlines such as IndiGo, Air India and Air India Express, as well as many international carriers.
The repeated instances of defects indicated “ineffective monitoring and inadequate rectification action”, the DGCA said.
The government body also found other violations such as an aircraft maintenance engineer not taking prescribed safety precautions, not addressing defects in some places and work order not being followed in jet maintenance.
At one airport that the DGCA did not name, the regulator found no survey had been conducted despite new construction around the vicinity, an issue now under scrutiny after the Air India jet crashed into a doctors’ hostel, killing dozens.
The findings have been communicated to the concerned operators so they can take corrective measures within seven days, the DGCA said.
The shortcomings were found as part of a “comprehensive surveillance” during night and early morning hours at major airports including those at Delhi and Mumbai.
After the June 12 crash, the regulator ordered renewed checks on Air India’s Boeing 787 fleet, but it said these did not reveal any major safety concerns.
Reuters reported, citing sources, that the DGCA cancelled its planned visit to Air India headquarters on Tuesday for an annual regulatory audit as the airline was tackling the fallout from several Middle Eastern countries temporarily closing their airspaces due to the Israel-Iran conflict.</p><small>2025-06-24 13:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2417572600ec9fd.jpg?r=175900' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919777/whatsapp-banned-on-us-house-of-representatives-devices-memo-shows' target='_blank'><strong>WhatsApp banned on US House of Representatives devices, memo shows</strong></a><br><p>Meta Platforms’ WhatsApp messaging service has been banned from all United States House of Representatives devices, according to a memo sent to all House staff on Monday.
The notice said the “Office of Cybersecurity has deemed WhatsApp a high risk to users due to the lack of transparency in how it protects user data, absence of stored data encryption, and potential security risks involved with its use.”
The memo, from the chief administrative officer, recommended using other messaging apps, including Microsoft Corp’s Teams platform, Amazon.com’s Wickr, Signal, and Apple’s iMessage and FaceTime.
Meta disagreed with the move “in the strongest possible terms”, a company spokesperson said, noting that the platform provides a higher level of security than the other approved apps.
In January, a WhatsApp official said Israeli spyware company Paragon Solutions had targeted scores of its users, including journalists and members of civil society.
The House has banned other apps from staff devices in the past, including the short video app TikTok in 2022, due to security issues.</p><small>2025-06-24 13:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24174539d0ee4f2.jpg?r=175556' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919778/gates-foundation-to-commit-16bn-for-gavi-vaccine-alliance' target='_blank'><strong>Gates Foundation to commit $1.6bn for Gavi vaccine alliance</strong></a><br><p>The Gates Foundation said on Tuesday it will commit $1.6 billion over the next five years to support Gavi, a public-private partnership that helps buy vaccines for the world’s poorest children.
The number of kids dying around the world will likely go up this year because of the massive cuts to foreign aid, foundation chair Bill Gates said in a statement, adding that funding Gavi was the single most powerful step to stop it.
“The legacy of our generation cannot be that we looked away as millions of poor children died of preventable causes,” said Gates.
“The world now has affordable, effective, proven tools that save lives. Wealthy nations should fully fund Gavi and the Global Fund, the organisations created to get those products to the people who need them.”
The vaccine alliance is looking to raise $9bn for its work from 2026 to 2030 at a pledging event to be held in Brussels on Wednesday. It is co-hosted by the European Union and the Gates Foundation.
The Trump administration had previously indicated that it planned to cut its funding for Gavi, representing around $300 million annually.
Losing US funding could lead to around 1.2m additional deaths over the next five years, Gavi CEO Sania Nishtar had said.

The two-wave strike killed seven in the regional capital of Dnipro, said governor Serhiy Lysak, where the blast wave also shattered train carriage windows and showered passengers with broken glass.
Nearly 70 people, including 10 children, were injured, he said, adding the numbers could still rise. Two people were also killed in the town of Samar, around 10 kilometres from Dnipro, the state emergencies service said.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha called on Kyiv’s Western partners to respond to the attack. Nato leaders are currently in The Hague for an alliance summit, where President Volodymyr Zelenskiy hopes to secure more military support against Russia’s full-scale invasion, launched in 2022.
“It is a matter of credibility for allies to step up pressure on Moscow,” Sybiha wrote on X.
He added that schools, kindergartens and a hospital were also damaged in Dnipro. Officials did not provide details of the damage in Samar.
 






Russia has stepped up air strikes on Ukraine in recent weeks, particularly on its capital Kyiv, where 28 people were killed on June 17 in the deadliest such attack this year.

The statement came in response to reports of multiple such attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan over the past year. In March, at least 11 people were killed in Mardan in what locals insisted was a drone strike, while in May,  a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Last Friday, a child was killed and five others were injured after a suspected drone hit South Waziristan District, prompting condemnations from KP politicians.
“Pakistani authorities have failed to take action to protect the lives and property of civilians in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa who continue to pay the price of an escalating number of drone strikes in the province,” today’s statement by Amnesty said, quoting the group’s South Asia Deputy Regional Director Isabelle Lassée.
“Use of drones and quadcopters to conduct attacks resulting in the unlawful killing of civilians violates international law. Reports that the strikes have hit homes and volleyball games indicate a reckless disregard for civilian life.”
The statement added that Friday’s drone strike was part of an “alarming series of attacks” which have escalated since March of this year.
 






“While Pakistani authorities have often denied responsibility for these attacks, they are obligated to conduct prompt, independent, transparent and effective investigations into these attacks and bring all those responsible to justice through fair trials.”
Last month, 22 civilians, including children and youth, were injured when a suspected quadcopter dropped munitions in the Birmal tehsil of Lower South Waziristan district, officials confirmed.
The incident occurred near Karmazi Stop on the Wana-Azam Warsak Road.
In October of last year, as many as 13 civilians, mostly children, who received injuries when a quadcopter allegedly dropped explosives on a marketplace in Tirah valley here on Monday, were brought to hospitals in Peshawar for treatment, local sources had told Dawn.</p><small>2025-06-24 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/24144522a78f334.jpg?r=144622' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1919725/ke-served-show-cause-notice-over-not-complying-with-orders-to-restrict-loadshedding-to-pmt-level' target='_blank'><strong>KE served show cause notice over not complying with orders to restrict loadshedding to PMT level</strong></a><br><p>The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has issued a show cause notice to K-Electric (KE) after the power distribution company failed to submit a satisfactory reply over discriminatory policies over loadshedding in Karachi.
Nepra had earlier taken serious notice of alleged excessive and persistent loadshedding during summers, and directed KE to end consumers’ miseries.
In a letter to the KE chief executive officer, the regulatory body stated that it had received a large number of complaints regarding persistent and excessive loadshedding across various areas of Karachi.
In a notice issued on June 23, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the power regulatory said the power distribution companies are obligated to supply electricity on a “non-discriminatory” basis to all consumers, and shall have schedules to shed up to 30pc of its load on instructions of the NTDC.
When instructed, power distribution companies (Discos) can announce loadshedding in the order namely: supply to rural areas, residential consumers in urban area, agriculture consumers, industries, school and hospitals, and defence installations.
The regulator said power companies should prepare loadsheding schedules in a non- discriminatory manner.
Nepra sought on explanation from KE on January 8, 2025, for non-compliance of the of the authority’s orders, and carrying out loadshedding in violation of Nepra Act.
In this regard, a feeder containing commercial losses (theft and non-payment of dues by some consumers) is completely switched off for some hours a day despite the fact that some consumers are regular paying consumers.
“This establishes that compliant consumers are unnecessarily being punished due to some defaulters,” it added.
Nepra said the power company can carry out load shedding at pole-mounted transformer (PMT) level on the instructions of the regulator or in case of generation shortage and transmission constraints.
It said KE has installed AMI/AMR meters to identify specific energy losses at transformer level and could remotely disconnect the supply. However, despite achieving commercial benefits, it is “not ready to provide relief to the people of Karachi”.
It added that during public hearings regarding Fuel Cost Adjustment (FCA), the “people of Karachi largely complained about excessive loadshedding”.
Nepra has issued directives KE to start loadshedding on PMT level instead of feeder level, but noted a serious non-compliance which has led to “undue suffering of good paying consumers and faced discriminatory behaviour in terms of receiving electric power supply which (is) their basic right.”
KE submitted in response on January 27, 2025, and after detailed deliberation, Nepra concluded that the power company failed to provide a satisfactory explanation.
Nepra served a show cause notice to the power company and instructed to submit a reply within fifteen days.
It warned that failure to comply could lead to a maximum penalty of Rs200 million and further penalty of Rs100,000 per day.</p><small>2025-06-24 10:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/610747-senior-uae-official-mohamed-saif-al-suwaidi-receives-pakistans-prestigious-hilal-e-quaid-e-azam-award' target='_blank'><strong>Senior UAE official Mohamed Saif Al Suwaidi receives Pakistan's prestigious Hilal-e-Quaid-e-Azam Award</strong></a><br><p>
