Bajaur District Police Officer Waqas Rafique confirmed the incident to Dawn.com in Khar tehsil’s Kausar Cricket Ground and said the blast was carried out through an improvised explosive device.
“It appears to be a targeted attack,” he added.
Last Saturday, two people, including a police official, were wounded after terrorists attacked a police station in the district’s Laghari area of Lowi Mamund tehsil through a quadcopter.
Sources said police constable Mohammad Habib and civilian Najeeb Khan were injured in the attack, which also damaged a vehicle parked on the premises.
Israr Khan, a public relations officer of the district police, had told Dawn that the injured were immediately shifted to the district headquarters hospital in Khar.
He also said terrorists launched another attack on the police station through a quadcopter but it missed the target.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack. However, police officials blamed it on terrorists in light of Operation Sarbakaf launched by security forces against them a couple of weeks ago.</p><small>2025-09-06 15:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/061057276f80490.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940142/civil-military-leadership-pay-tributes-to-soldiers-and-martyrs-as-nation-observes-60th-defence-day' target='_blank'><strong>Civil, military leadership pay tributes to soldiers and martyrs as nation observes 60th Defence Day</strong></a><br><p>The country’s top military brass, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari have paid glowing tributes to soldiers and martyrs from the armed forces as the nation observes the 60th Defence Day today.
The Defence Day is observed every year on September 6 to commemorate the legacy of the 1965 War, “when the Indian forces crossed international border in the darkness of night to attack Pakistan but the nation foiled [the] nefarious designs of the enemy,” a report by the state broadcaster Radio Pakistan recalled.
The report said the commemoration began with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salute in provincial capitals.
“Special prayers were offered in mosques for the progress and prosperity of the country, and independence of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir from the clutches of India,” it added.
Karachi marked Defence Day with a changing of the guard at Quaid-i-Azam’s mausoleum, performed by a contingent from the Pakistan Air Force.
DawnNewsTV broadcast images showing personnel marching, performing elaborate display drills, singing the national anthem and hoisting the flag at the Karachi landmark.
Air Vice Marshal Shehryar Khan also attended the ceremony.

In his address broadcast on DawnNewsTV, he said: “The people and protectors of Pakistan, whether they are on the battlefield, the frontiers or in the streets of our cities, are always prepared.
“The recent operation Bunyanum Marsoos brought back the memory of September 6, 1965. It proved that if our armed forces and brave people stand together, then no power can defeat us
“… Any act of aggression against Pakistan will be met with a befitting response. The score will not be 6-0, but, with the help of God, 60-0,” he added.
 


During a brief military confrontation with India in May, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians. In retaliation, the Pakistan Air Force downed six Indian planes in air-to-air combat on May 7.
In Lahore, a changing of the guard ceremony took place at Mazar-i-Iqbal, with Lahore Corps Commander Lieutenant General Fayyaz Hussain Shah attending as the chief guest, according to state broadcaster PTV News.
“The corps commander visited Iqbal’s mausoleum, where he laid a wreath of flowers and recited the fatiha,” the report read.
PTV News added that the occasion was commemorated with a 21-gun salute, as well as a gun salute by a contingent from the Pakistan Army.
‘Courage of fearless heroes continues to inspire future generations’
A statement issued by the military’s media affairs wing in relevance to the day said that on behalf of the armed forces, Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf and Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu paid tributes and “offered their deepest respect to the valiant martyrs and their families on the 60th Defence and Martyrs’ Day”.
“September 6, 1965, epitomises the unflinching resolve and unshakeable spirit of the Pakistani nation. On this historic day, our brave soldiers, with the support of nation, stood like an insurmountable wall against blatant aggression, thwarting the nefarious designs of an enemy far superior in arms and numbers.
“The feats of heroic valour and sacrifice left an indelible message on the sands of time, that a united nation can never be defeated,” it added.
The statement further stated that the “courage of our fearless heroes continues to inspire future generations and their legacy shall live on forever”.

“Today, the nation honours and salutes its martyrs, its ghazis and their resilient families who have offered unparalleled sacrifices for the security of this great country,” it said.
Recalling that the armed forces had stood resolutely against external aggression and terrorism and “have always supported the people of Pakistan in calamities and natural disasters”, it expressed their resolve to extend all-out support to people affected by the recent floods.
Referring to the calamity, it said the Defence Day would be observed with “utmost humility”.
The statement further read: “Today, we reaffirm our pledge to uphold the sacred responsibility entrusted to us by the nation. Pakistan’s armed forces remain ever vigilant and prepared to defend the country against all kinds of threats. Any attempt to disrupt our hard-earned peace will be met with a befitting and decisive response.”
Messages from political leadership
In separate messages ahead of Sept 6, PM Shehbaz and President Zardari reaffirmed the nation’s commitment to safeguarding its sovereignty, countering external threats, and building a united, prosperous future.
They also recalled the 1965 War with India, noting that Pakistan’s valiant armed forces, with the full support of the people, had thwarted enemy aggression, proving that the country possesses the will and capacity to defend its independence and integrity.
Highlighting the recent Oper­ation Bunyanum Marsoos, Marka-i-Haq, PM Shehbaz lauded the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Air Force for their unmatched professionalism and combat skills under the strategic leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir.
He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peace and constructive international engagement but war­ned against ignoring the reality of continuous Indian provocations and shifting regional dynamics.
Expressing solidarity with the oppressed people of occupied Kashmir, the prime minister reiterated unwavering support for their struggle for self-determination, stressing that it cannot be suppressed by force.
He also strongly condemned ongoing Israeli aggression in Palestine and urged the international community to ensure the protection of civilians and uninterrupted humanitarian aid to Gaza.
In a separate message posted on X today, the premier said Pakistan’s policy of peaceful coexistence and constructive engagement with the world, as well as the nation’s commitment to strengthening and modernising defence capabilities.
He asserted that Pakistan remained committed to the policy of peaceful coexistence and constructive engagement with the world.
“Yet, we cannot be oblivious to the reality of persistent Indian provocations and the changing regional environment. We shall continue to strengthen and modernise our defence capabilities, while also confronting the twin menace of state-sponsored terrorism and foreign proxies operating within our borders,” he added.
 






Earlier, President Zardari, in his message, paid tribute to the valiant sacrifices of the nation’s armed forces and reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to its defence and sovereignty.
He described September 6 as a glorious chapter in the country’s history and emphasised that the spirit of sacrifice from the 1965 War continued to serve as a guiding light for future generations.
The president highlighted the significance of this year’s Defence Day in light of the recent Operation Bunyanum Marsoos conducted in May 2025 against India.
“Just as our courageous forces demonstrated extraordinary valour and dedication in 1965, our sons once again proved their unmatched bravery during this year’s operation,” he said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that Sept 6 was a “historic day of courage and bravery, when the martyrs, the veterans and the nation together made Pakistan invincible”.
Naqvi said that from Kasur to Lahore and from Sialkot to Kashmir, the Pakistan Army had given a “befitting response to the enemy at every front with unmatched courage and unwavering resolve”.
He underscored that Sept 6 was the renewal of the pledge that the country’s sanctity would never be compromised.
 






In his message today, PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari posted on X that on Defence Day, “we honour our martyrs, their families, our ghazis, and the resilient people of Pakistan whose sacrifices shaped our destiny.”
He added, “Our people have stood the test of time, weathering aggression, terrorism, and calamities with courage and integrity. This legacy of sacrifice and resilience continues to guide our unity and confidence in Pakistan’s future.”

Muslims around the world celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), known in Arabic as the Mawlid al-Nabawi holiday, on the 12th of Rabiul Awwal — the third month of the Islamic lunar calendar. The nation also celebrated Defence Day today with the two events coinciding on the same date.
State-run Radio Pakistan reported that the day — a public holiday announced by the government — began with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and a 21-gun salute in all provincial capitals.
It added that special prayers were also offered after the Fajr prayer for the unity of the Muslim world and Pakistan’s progress and prosperity.
 






The people celebrated the day with religious fervour and devotion, as mosques, streets, and public spaces across the country were adorned with colourful lights, green flags and decorations.
 


Special prayers, Seerat conferences and processions were held to mark the birth anniversary of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) with citizens participating in large numbers to pay tribute.
Markets and neighbourhoods glowed with festive lighting, and vendors displayed stalls offering badges, banners, and flags to mark the occasion. Community events, including food distribution and gatherings, were also organised nationwide.
 


 


The federal and provincial governments had made special arrangements to ensure peaceful and smooth observance of the occasion, with security and facilitation measures in place for devotees.
Religious leaders, scholars and government representatives at the 50th International Seerat-un-Nabi Conference also emphasised the need for responsible use of social media in line with Islamic teachings, while reaffirming Pakistan’s solidarity with the people of Palestine and occupied Kashmir.
The conference, organised by the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony at the Convention Centre, was held under the theme ‘State’s Responsibilities in Educating for the Beneficial Use of Social Media in the Light of Holy Prophet’s Life (Peace Be Upon Him)’.
PM Shehbaz vows to rebuild Pakistan on principles of Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) life
In his message for the day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called upon the nation to renew its commitment to build Pakistan in line with the teachings of the life of the Holy Prophet, emphasising unity, justice, compassion and peace.
He noted that this year, Pakistan and Muslims around the world were celebrating the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) 1,500th birth anniversary.
“This historic milestone is being observed in accordance with the resolutions passed by both the National Assembly and the Senate, reflecting a collective national resolve to make the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings an integral part of the country’s Constitution, legal framework and public life,” he added.
“The life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) is a complete and comprehensive model for all aspects of life governance, justice, economics, trade, and social values,“ the prime minister said.
He stressed that the youth must be taught to embrace the eternal values of morality, kindness and truth as taught by the Holy Prophet and become ambassadors of his message of love, peace, and brotherhood.
PM Shehbaz underscored that the real strength of Pakistan lay in unity, tolerance and inclusivity.
“To overcome the challenges facing our nation, be they economic or social, we must integrate the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings into our national character,” he asserted.
PM Shehbaz also called for rejecting all forms of prejudice, sectarianism, extremism and hatred, and instead promoting empathy, solidarity, and harmony among all citizens.
The premier urged every Pakistani to reaffirm their pledge to establish Pakistan as a true Islamic welfare state based on the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) model of compassion, social justice and equality.
He said the government’s core priorities include eradicating poverty, promoting education and research, and ensuring equal opportunity for all.
Similarly, President Asif Ali Zardari greeted the entire nation and Muslim world on the day of 1212 Rabiul Awwal and urged the people to pledge to mould individual and collective lives in accordance with the Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings.
“This historic and memorable occasion is a source of joy and devotion for the Muslim ummah,” he said adding, “Besides this 12 Rabiul Awwal, the joy of completing the 1,500th anniversary of the birth of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) brings us the message that we should implement the Prophet Muhammad’s (PBUH) universal principles of justice, mercy, brotherhood and peace in our social, political and cultural structures.“
He added that the day “unites Muslims all over the world in a relationship that is based on faith and whose focus is solely and exclusively the noble personality” of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).
President Zardari said the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) taught that justice, fairness, compassion, kindness, brotherhood, equality and respect for humanity were the foundations of a pious society.
“Today, when the world is faced with challenges such as extremism, injustice, social unrest, and uncontrolled trends of digitalisation, we need to find solutions to these problems in the light of the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH),” he stressed.
“The solutions to the challenges that the Muslim ummah and Pakistan are facing today lie in the teachings of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). He taught us unity, love, and brotherhood, and these are the principles that can take us out of social and economic problems. Let us take this opportunity to pledge that we will put our differences behind us and work together for the development of our country and nation.
“The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) always taught us to help the weak, orphans, and the needy,” he continued, adding, “It is our responsibility to adopt the examples set by the Holy Prophet (PBUH).“
Addressing the current issues arising from the effects of climate change, he said joint efforts were being made by the government, local administration and relief organisations to ensure the safety and rehabilitation of the affected as early as possible.
“This is the time when we, while learning from Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), should help our people with open hearts and ensure their rehabilitation as soon as possible, because Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) also strived for the welfare of others in every situation,” he added.</p><small>2025-09-06 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06191433ed04082.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940199/us-navy-seals-botched-secret-2019-mission-in-north-korea-report' target='_blank'><strong>US Navy SEALs botched secret 2019 mission in North Korea: report</strong></a><br><p>Elite United States Navy SEALs launched an audacious operation in 2019 to plant a listening device in North Korea to spy on the country’s reclusive leader, Kim Jong Un, The New York Times (NYT) reported on Friday, but the mission quickly unravelled and culminated in the deaths of multiple civilians.
The operation came in the first administration of US President Donald Trump during sensitive nuclear talks with Kim, whom the US leader met three times.
The mission was considered so risky that it required direct presidential approval, the NYT said, but Trump insisted on Friday he had no knowledge of the operation.
“I don’t know anything about it. I’m hearing it now for the first time,” the president told journalists.
Despite months of practice, the mission still went horribly wrong, the *
NYT* reported.
The SEALs — from the same unit that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 — approached North Korea in mini-submarines that exposed them to frigid water for hours, then swam ashore, according to the newspaper, which interviewed two dozen people to piece together the account.
The special forces personnel thought they were alone, but didn’t see a small boat in the area. The boat later approached the mini-subs, with the crew carrying flashlights. One person jumped into the water.
Thinking the mission was compromised, the senior enlisted SEAL ashore opened fire on the boat, as did the others with him. When they reached the boat, they found two or three bodies, but no guns or uniforms: the dead were apparently civilians who were diving for shellfish.
The SEALs used knives to puncture the lungs of the boat’s crew so the bodies would sink, and were able to escape unharmed.
The NYT said the operation prompted a series of military reviews that found the killings were justified. The results of the reviews were classified, and key congressional leaders were kept in the dark.
While the failed mission did not create a major international crisis, it easily could have, and the incident highlights both the impunity and secrecy under which America’s elite forces operate around the globe.</p><small>2025-09-06 14:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/061657015dfc9f3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940184/pakistan-to-witness-lunar-eclipse-tomorrow-night-suparco' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to witness lunar eclipse tomorrow night: Suparco</strong></a><br><p>A total lunar eclipse will be visible over Pakistan on the night of September 7 (Sunday), according to the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco).
According to Suparco, a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth comes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting its shadow across the lunar surface. Unlike solar eclipses, lunar eclipses are completely safe to observe with the naked eye, binoculars or telescopes.
In a press release on Saturday, the space agency said that the eclipse will be visible in Asia, Africa and parts of Europe, with clear visibility expected in most regions of Pakistan if the weather permits.
“The event will start at 8:30pm and reach its maximum at 11:57pm,” the press release read, stating that the eclipse will conclude at 1:55am.
“This is a great chance for people, especially students and astronomy enthusiasts, to connect with science and explore the wonders of our universe,” a Suparco spokesperson was quoted as saying.
Sunday’s eclipse is also known as a “blood moon”, due to its red hue during the event. When the Sun, Earth and Moon line up, the shadow cast by the planet on its satellite makes it appear an eerie, deep red colour that has astounded humans for millennia.
The Moon appears red during lunar eclipses because the only sunlight reaching it is “reflected and scattered through the Earth’s atmosphere”, said Ryan Milligan, an astrophysicist at Northern Ireland’s Queen’s University Belfast.
The last total lunar eclipse was in March this year, while the one before that was in 2022. A rare total solar eclipse, when the Moon blocks out the light from the Sun, will be visible in a sliver of Europe on August 12, 2026.</p><small>2025-09-06 11:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622243-heroes-of-marka-e-haq-recount-days-under-fire-at-loc' target='_blank'><strong>Heroes of Marka-e-Haq recount days under fire at LoC</strong></a><br><p>

In a press release, the PCB said that Pakistan’s new cycle of the ICC World Test Championship will begin with this visit by the Proteas, with the first test starting on October 12 in Lahore.
“The first Test will be played at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium from October 12-16, which will also be the first five-day match at the stadium since its complete renovation earlier this year to host the ICC Champions Trophy 2025,” the PCB stated. “The second Test match is scheduled to take place at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium from October 20-24.”
According to the press release, this will be the visitors’ first tour to Pakistan since 2021, where they lost a test series 2-0.
 






“At the conclusion of the red-ball matches, both sides will feature in three T20Is from October 28 to November 1, with the first T20I taking place at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, while the remaining two T20Is will be hosted at the Gaddafi Stadium,” the press release read.
“The series will conclude with three ODIs taking place from 4 to 8 November at the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad.”
The PCB stated that this will be the first ODI played at Iqbal Stadium in 17 years, with the last match having been held on April 11, 2008, when Pakistan defeated Bangladesh by seven wickets.
PCB Chief Operating Officer Sumair Ahmed Syed said that he was looking forward to hosting South Africa, adding that hosting the World Test Champions “will provide quality cricket for our players and fans”.
“The return of ODI cricket to Faisalabad after 17 years is a special moment,“ he was quoted as saying in the press release. Iqbal Stadium holds a proud place in our cricketing history and we are excited to bring international cricket back to this part of the country.”
Pakistan is currently participating in a tri-series tournament with Afghanistan and hosts the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where they reached the finals by defeating the hosts by 31 runs.
The tournament precedes the Asia Cup 2025 — also held in the UAE from September 9 to 28 — where the Green Shirts are expected to clash with arch-rivals India.</p><small>2025-09-06 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/061402099e9d859.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940163/trump-signs-order-offering-some-tariff-exemptions-to-countries-with-us-trade-deals' target='_blank'><strong>Trump signs order offering some tariff exemptions to countries with US trade deals</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump signed an executive order offering some tariff exemptions as soon as Monday to trading partners who strike deals on industrial exports such as nickel, gold and other metals, as well as pharmaceutical compounds and chemicals.
Trump has spent his first seven months in office building up massive tariff increases to reorder the global trading system, cut US trade deficits and extract concessions from trading partner countries in negotiations.
His latest order identifies more than 45 categories for zero import tariffs from “aligned partners” who clinch framework pacts to cut Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs and duties imposed under the Section 232 national security statute.
Friday’s order brings US tariffs in line with its commitments in existing framework deals, including those with allies such as Japan and the European Union.
The exemptions for countries with US trade deals are set to begin at 12:01 a.m. EDT/0401 GMT on Monday, it said.
Pakistan is also among the countries that have signed trade deals with the US. Islamabad successfully negotiated a reduction in reciprocal tariffs — from 29 per cent to 19pc — after the two nations concluded a trade deal in July.
This was after Trump announced that the US had concluded a deal with Islamabad that would allow the two allies to work together on developing Pakistan’s vast oil reserves.
However, it is not clear yet that whether Pakistan would benefit from Trump’s latest order or not.
In the order, Trump says his willingness to reduce tariffs depends on the “scope and economic value of a trading partner’s commitments to the United States in its agreement on reciprocal trade” and US national interests.
The cuts cover items that “cannot be grown, mined, or naturally produced in the United States” or produced in sufficient volume to meet domestic demand.
A White House official said it also creates new carveouts for some agricultural products, aircraft and parts, and non-patented articles for use in pharmaceuticals.
In situations where a country has struck a “reciprocal” trade deal with the United States, this will allow the US Trade Representative, the Commerce Department and customs to waive tariffs on covered imports without a new executive order from Trump, the official said.
The zero-tariff items identified in the order include graphite and various forms of nickel, a key ingredient in stainless steel manufacturing and electric vehicle batteries.
Also covered are compounds used in generic pharmaceuticals, including the anesthetic lidocaine and reagents used in medical diagnostic tests.
The order encompasses various types of gold imports, from powders and leaf to bullion, a key import from Switzerland, which is struggling with US tariffs of 39 per cent as it has not yet reached a trade deal.
The order also permits tariffs to be scrapped on natural graphite, neodymium magnets, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and eliminates previous tariff exemptions on certain plastics and polysilicon, a key component of solar panels.</p><small>2025-09-06 10:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06145523b5a1ef7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940167/thailands-next-pm-reaffirms-fresh-polls-promise' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand’s next PM reaffirms fresh polls promise</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s next prime minister on Saturday pledged to make good on his promise to lead the fractured interim government to new polls.
Conservative tycoon Anutin Charnvirakul was confirmed by parliament on Friday, ending a week-long power vacuum following the ouster of his predecessor Paetongtarn Shinawatra.
The construction magnate cobbled together a coalition of opposition blocs to shut out Pheu Thai, the electoral vehicle of the once-dominant Shinawatra dynasty’s patriarch Thaksin.
Anutin received the backing of the People’s Party, which holds a plurality of seats, on conditions that he recommitted to on Saturday.
“I think we are clear in terms of politics that we are going to dissolve the parliament in four months,” he said during a meeting at his party headquarters broadcast by Thai media.
“I will try to form my cabinet as soon as possible,” he said, adding that the foreign minister and energy minister were already confirmed.
Thaksin unexpectedly left the kingdom before the parliamentary vote, bound for Dubai where he said he would visit friends and seek medical treatment.
The Supreme Court is due to rule on Tuesday in a case over a hospital stay following his return from exile in August 2023, a verdict some analysts say could see him jailed.
“There will be no favouritism, no persecution, and no revenge,” Anutin told journalists on Friday.
Anutin’s right-wing Bhumjaithai party went into coalition with Pheu Thai in 2023, but pulled out in June over Paetongtarn’s alleged misconduct in a leaked phone call with Cambodian ex-leader Hun Sen.
The Shinawatras have been a mainstay of Thai politics for the past two decades, sparring with the pro-monarchy, pro-military establishment that views them as a threat to the kingdom’s traditional social order.
But they have faced a series of setbacks, including Paetongtarn’s removal last week.
Anutin previously served as deputy prime minister, interior minister and health minister, but is perhaps most famous for delivering on a promise to decriminalise cannabis in 2022.
His elevation to the premiership still needs to be endorsed by Thailand’s king to become official.</p><small>2025-09-06 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06112354702bd4b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939935/not-just-a-sea-journey-former-ji-senator-details-risks-of-humanitarian-mission-to-gaza' target='_blank'><strong>‘Not just a sea journey’: Former JI senator details risks of humanitarian mission to Gaza</strong></a><br><p>Despite almost two years of what has now been dubbed a “genocide” in the Gaza Strip, Israel continues to bomb, starve and torture more than a million Palestinians in the besieged enclave.
After blocking aid from entering Gaza, Israel established the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) in collaboration with the United States, which set up food distribution sites, luring starving civilians and then allowing them to be shot by Israeli forces. The GHF sites have been slammed by humanitarian organisations as ‘killing fields’.
Attempting to break the blockade and put pressure on Israel to end its onslaught is a fleet of boats with participants from over 44 countries, including Pakistan. The movement, known as the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), will embark on its journey to Gaza in the early morning hours of Sunday, September 7.
The GSF is made up of four coalitions: the Sumud Nausantara, Maghreb Sumud Flotilla, Freedom Flotilla Coalition and Global March to Gaza.
A five-member Pakistan delegation led by former Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan will set sail from Tunisia aboard the Sumud Nausantara, which also includes participants from Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh, the Maldives and the Philippines.
 






“This is not just a sea journey, it’s not an adventure, but rather it is a task that is extremely dangerous,” the former senator Khan said while speaking to Dawn.com.
“There are three things we are trying to achieve through this humanitarian mission to Gaza: To end the genocide, to establish a humanitarian corridor and to end the blockade and siege.”
Stressing the legality of this mission, Khan detailed that after the ships leave Tunisian waters, they will sail to Gaza through international waters.
“When governments have failed, international rights bodies such as the UN have failed, world order has failed, the people have risen and taken it upon themselves to transport aid to Gaza,” he said.

On the training given to participants, the former senator said that the volunteers have been instructed on how to behave during the journey, to remain peaceful, what to do in case of an emergency or an attack by Israeli forces and what role each individual has on board.
“Given that this is a very dangerous undertaking, we received two days of training,” he explained.
“We were taught about the salient features of a nonviolent movement, as well as how to maintain discipline on the boat and what to do in the event of an emergency — be it interception or attack.”
 






Dawn.com was told that before boarding, every member of the flotilla has to record an ‘SOS’ video, which is to be uploaded to social media in the event of their detention by Israeli forces.
Former senator Khan also mentioned some of the aid the delegation will be carrying, including “baby formula for the infants that are starving to death … food and water for the malnourished civilians in Gaza … [and] medicine for them”.
The flotilla, departing from North Africa, is in touch with the vessels that departed Spain earlier this week, according to the former senator.
Some of the participants in the journey are notable rights activists, such as Nelson Mandela’s grandson Nkosi Zwelivelile and Greta Thunberg. Lawyers and journalists are also in the mix of volunteers.
 
 

The flotillas were originally supposed to head to Gaza on September 5; however, weather conditions forced the boats sailing from Barcelona to divert to Menorca.
“Unfortunately, they ran into a storm, so they might be delayed in getting to Tunis. They should arrive in Tunis by September 5 and need to refuel and perform any necessary repairs, but we expect to collectively leave on September 6.”
Since the conversation with the former senator, the departure date for the vessels has changed once again and they are now expected to head to Gaza on September 7. The ex-senator also confirmed this in a voice note sent to Dawn.com.
Meanwhile, a new development has emerged. Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir has branded the Global Sumud Flotilla volunteers as “terrorists” and threatened to seize their boats should they head to Gaza.
The coalition, in a statement posted to X on Thursday, slammed the Israeli minister and urged the UN and world governments to take note and guarantee safe passage to the besieged enclave.
 






“The Global Sumud Flotilla strongly condemns threats by Israeli National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir in an attempt to intimidate our participants and falsely brand them as ‘terrorists’. Such threats are not only baseless and unjust but constitute a blatant violation of international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions.”
When asked about what they will do if Israeli forces intercept and board their flotilla, the former senator asserted that the participants will remain ‘non-violent’.
“We are not an army or a military force; we are civilians looking to confront and break the siege. In case the Israeli forces attack, we have been told to embody peaceful resistance, stand against oppression and break the blockade peacefully. To put our lives in danger while establishing a humanitarian corridor.”
In earlier comments made to Dawn.com, Khan had highlighted three possible outcomes of the journey to Gaza.
“There are three options. One is that we reach Gaza successfully and are able to break the blockade and show the world what is taking place there,” Khan said. “Another possibility is that they (Israel) could arrest and deport us. The third is that we are attacked by Israel and killed.“
As has been witnessed in the Freedom Flotilla’s previous attempts, the journey to reach Gaza’s shores is far from easy. Those aboard the Handala and then later the Madleen were detained and deported after Israel intercepted the vessels.
Obstacles did show for the Pakistan delegation in the path to answer the GSF’s humanitarian call, as procuring visas proved difficult for Khan’s delegation.
In social media posts, the former senator had appealed to authorities to facilitate visas for his delegation. Fortunately, the four other members were able to receive their visas on time and arrived in Tunis on Thursday.
The senator, who clarified that, as a lawmaker, he has a special passport and does not require a visa, added that the Pakistani government offered no assistance.

“The Pakistani government has not provided any aid to us,” Khan noted. “[Malaysian Prime Minister] Anwar Ibrahim is patronising the Sumud Nausantara, which we are a part of.
“If Anwar Ibrahim can do this, why can’t the Pakistani government?” the ex-senator asked.
Khan noted that he entered an agreement with the government six months ago, under which Islamabad would send an aid flotilla to the Gaza Strip. The agreement was reached after a Palestinian solidarity sit-in ended with force at the hands of the authorities.
“[Interior minister] Mohsin Naqvi said this on record,” Khan recalled. “One of the conditions of ending my sit-in was sending the flotilla.
“I said that if funding is difficult, then I will pay for it out of my own pocket. I will sail on it with my family. But give me state ownership. The government did not fulfil even one part of the agreement.”
When asked, the ex-senator said that he is paying to board the ship and perform the journey.
“People travelling on the Global Sumud Flotilla have to pay beforehand, including travel expenses and the cost of the boat,” he stated. “I am paying for my work here.
“We made a payment for the aid supplies, but those are provided by the GSF central body.”
Reiterating the three possible outcomes mentioned earlier, the former senator who is acting as a coordinator aboard the flotilla said that he and his delegation are prepared, come what may.

The company is currently importing completely built units (CBUs) under the normal duty regime.
Hubco is setting up a completely knocked down (CKD) assembly plant in Gharo with an annual production capacity of 25,000 units.
According to a report by Asad Ali of Topline Securities, based on the company’s analyst briefing, financial close is expected in the last quarter of 2025. The project carries an estimated cost of $150 million, structured on a 60:40 debt-to-equity ratio.
 
 

Both foreign and local lenders are on board, with a term sheet already signed. Hubco expects CKD production to begin within 24 months.
Regarding ownership, the company clarified that the project is a 50:50 joint venture between Hub Power Holding — a wholly owned Hubco subsidiary — and Mega Conglomerate.
BYD has not taken an equity stake in the venture. Globally, BYD has pursued 100pc ownership in markets such as Thailand and Brazil, making this its first global partnership without equity participation.
On EV charging, the company noted that while chargers were initially sourced from Europe, Chinese suppliers have now made them more affordable. It added that EV charging stations become financially viable with usage of three cars per day.
Hubco plans to install chargers every 150-200 kilometres along the Karachi-Peshawar motorway over the next six months.
Separately, Sazgar Engineering Works Ltd plans to roll out CKD models of the TANK-500 and CANNON plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs) by March 31, 2026. The company had earlier launched its first CKD PHEV — the Haval H6 1.5L — on Aug 16, 2025, according to its FY25 annual report.

In a statement shared on X, the telecom giant said the submarine cable cuts near Saudi capital Jeddah had impacted the partial bandwidth capacity SMW4 (South Asia-Middle East-West Asia) and IMEWE (India-Middle East-Western Europe) networks.
“Internet users in Pakistan may experience some service degradation during peak hours,” the PTCL statement read. “Our international partners are working on priority to resolve the issue while our local teams are actively arranging alternative bandwidth to minimise the impact.”
 






The Ministry of Information Technology has not issued any statement on the development yet.
This is not the first time that damage to undersea internet cables has affected services in Pakistan.
Internet users across Pakistan complained of slow internet and hindered access to services throughout 2024. On January 3 this year, PTCL said teams were “diligently” working to resolve the matter of disruptions faced by users after a fault in the AAE-1 subsea internet cable connecting Pakistan slowed down the network speed in the country.
On January 16, PTCL announced that internet services were “now fully operational” after the complete restoration of the Asia-Africa-Europe-1 (AAE-1) undersea internet cable.</p><small>2025-09-06 08:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/622229-in-pictures-streets-shine-bright-across-country-on-eid-milad-un-nabi-pbuh' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Streets shine bright across country on Eid Milad un Nabi (PBUH)</strong></a><br><p>

The exchange comes amid strains after Washington imposed tariffs of up to 50 per cent on Indian imports, accusing New Dehli of fuelling Moscow’s deadly attacks on Ukraine by purchasing Russian oil.
But Trump and Modi, both right-wing populists, have shared a strong bond since the US president’s first term.
“Deeply appreciate and fully reciprocate President Trump’s sentiments and positive assessment of our ties,” Modi wrote on X, adding that India and the United States shared a “very positive and forward-looking comprehensive and global strategic partnership”.
 






Earlier, Trump told reporters that he “will always be friends with Modi”.
“India and the United States have a special relationship. There is nothing to worry about,” Trump said, downplaying his earlier remarks about “losing India” to China.
Last week, Modi visited China to attend a gathering of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, his first visit to the country in seven years signalling a thaw between the two Asian powers.
Trump has appeared irritated at New Delhi as he seeks credit for what he said was Nobel Prize-worthy diplomacy for brokering peace between Pakistan and India following the worst conflict in decades between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
India, which adamantly rejects any third-party mediation on the Kashmir issue, has since given the cold shoulder to Trump.</p><small>2025-09-06 07:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/061027337d2c592.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940140/alcaraz-downs-djokovic-to-set-up-blockbuster-us-open-final-with-sinner' target='_blank'><strong>Alcaraz downs Djokovic to set up blockbuster US Open final with Sinner</strong></a><br><p>Carlos Alcaraz overpowered Novak Djokovic in straight sets on Friday to set up a blockbuster US Open final showdown against world number one and defending champion Jannik Sinner.
Spanish second seed Alcaraz produced a ruthlessly efficient display to end Djokovic’s latest bid for a record 25th Grand Slam title, winning 6-4, 7-6 (7/4), 6-2 in two hours and 23 minutes.
Alcaraz was then followed into the final by arch-rival Sinner, who was forced to work hard by Canadian 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime before wrapping up a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court.
It means that Alcaraz and Sinner will collide in a third consecutive Grand Slam final this year on Sunday, where United States President Donald Trump will be among a 23,000 crowd to watch the latest instalment of the gripping “Sincaraz” rivalry.
Alcaraz won the duo’s first meeting in an epic five-hour 29-minute tussle at the French Open in June before Sinner dethroned the Spaniard in the final at Wimbledon the following month.
Alcaraz’s victory over Djokovic suggested though that he is more than capable of ambushing Sinner in a match where the winner will be assured of the world number one ranking on Monday.

‘Beating Novak is special’
The 22-year-old five-time Grand Slam winner has not dropped a set en route to the final but still believes he has room for improvement.
“Beating Novak is always special. But I don’t feel like I’ve won anything more than a Grand Slam semi-final,” Alcaraz said after downing the 38-year-old Djokovic.
“It was an important match, but it was just a ticket to the final.”
Djokovic said he plans to chase more Grand Slams next year, but admitted he was no longer physically capable of matching Alcaraz and Sinner.
“I’m happy with my level of tennis, but you know, it’s just the physicality of it,” Djokovic said after his exit. “That’s something I, unfortunately at this point in time in my career, can’t control.”
 


Sinner meanwhile appeared to be readying another quickfire win as he sprinted through the opening set of his clash with the rangy Auger-Aliassime.
But the Canadian leveled by taking the second set only for Sinner to respond to claim the next two and a return to the final.
‘An amazing season’
Sinner, who also won the Australian Open in January, is now only the fourth man in history to reach the finals of all four Grand Slams in a single season, joining an exclusive club whose other members are Rod Laver, Roger Federer and Djokovic.
“It’s been an amazing season. The Grand Slams are the most important tournaments we have throughout the year,” Sinner said.
The Italian’s date with Alcaraz is also a rematch of their famous 2022 US Open quarter-final five-setter, which finished at around 2:50am and remains the latest finish in tournament history.
“Sunday is a very special day and an amazing final again. I feel like our rivalry started here playing an amazing match,” Sinner said in a nod to their 2022 classic.
“We are two different players now, with different confidence too. Let’s see what’s coming. We’ve played each other a lot, we know each other very well.”

Sunday’s final meanwhile will have a rare visit from a sitting US President after confirmation earlier on Friday that Trump plans to attend the tennis showpiece.
Trump’s visit, confirmed to AFP by a White House official, is the latest appearance by the US leader at a major sporting event following trips to the Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.
“For me, playing in front of him… I will try not to think about it,” Alcaraz said of Trump’s presence. “I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it, but I think, attending the tennis match, it’s great for tennis to have the president (at) the final.”
Today, the women’s singles final will be decided when defending champion and world number Aryna Sabalenka faces American eighth seed Amanda Anisimova.
In the women’s doubles final on Friday, Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe won their second US Open women’s doubles title in three years after beating Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova 6-4, 6-4.</p><small>2025-09-06 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/0610370368be602.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1940010/ncsw-calls-for-standardising-minimum-marriage-age-across-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>NCSW calls for standardising minimum marriage age across Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW), in collaboration with UNFPA and Legal Aid Society, convened a consultation on Friday to address the pressing issue of child marriage in Pakistan.
Opening the session, Ume Laila Azhar, who is NCSW chairperson, stressed the urgent need to standardise the minimum age of marriage across Pakistan, highlighting persistent gaps in the implementation despite Sindh pioneering law.
 
 

Key insights were shared by government representatives, law enforcement, civil society and community stakeholders emphasising on more female station house officer (SHOs) and specialised training for handling child marriage cases.
Reforms in nikah registration through digitisation and mandatory CNIC verification were also emphasised by participants. Among other demands was on strengthening Sindh Child Protection Authority’s role with resources and awareness. Participants also emphasised on government ownership to ensure sustainability and real improvements.
 
 

Shaheena Sher Ali, who is Minister Women’s Development Department Sindh, reaffirmed strong government commitment, stating, “We have been personally taking on cases of child marriage, abuse, and abduction, and we know firsthand challenges survivors face.”
The consultation concluded with a joint call to action on strengthening CMRA implementation, scaling up community awareness, engaging religious leaders, and ensuring coordinated government and civil society efforts. Participants stressed on wearing team jackets to protect the rights of girls and ensure a safer future for every child.

PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari meets flood-hit farmers in Kasur.—Dawn

• Seeks loan, electricity bill waivers for flood-hit farmers
• Says PM has assured him of help for affected people
• Accuses India of violating Indus treaty by withholding flood data
KASUR: As floods continue to batter Punjab and severely impact farmers, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Thursday urged both the federal and provincial governments to declare an agricultural emergency in the province.
The PPP leader visited the flood-hit Talwar Post in Kasur, on the border with India, met affected families and later spoke to the media.
According to statement, Mr Bhutto-Zardari also telephoned Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and briefed him on the problems being faced by farmers across Punjab.
He told the premier that the floods had caused severe damage to the agriculture sector and said the Centre must play its role in helping farmers.
According to a readout of the call issued by the PPP, PM Shehbaz assured Mr Bhutto-Zardari that the government would take all possible steps to help the disaster-stricken farmers of Punjab.
 


The PPP leader also demanded that electricity bills of farmers in disaster-hit  districts be waived, while the repayment of agricultural loans should  either be delayed or written off.
He also proposed cash transfers  to the affected farmers through the Benazir Income Support Programme  (BISP), as was done in the wake of previous floods.
In the aftermath of the catastrophic floods in 2010 and 2011, the government  had partnered with international donors to roll out cash grant  programmes through the Watan Card and Pakistan Card schemes.
Their  success was eventually replicated with the BISP programme, which has  since won international acclaim for its effectiveness in augmenting  poverty alleviation efforts.
In Kasur, the PPP chairman heard the grievances of farmers and stressed that the federal and provincial governments should work together to provide relief to the affected people.
The PPP will stand with the provincial government during the relief  and reconstruction phases, he said, adding that no single government  can cope with a calamity of this scale. Speaking at Talwar Post, Mr Bhutto-Zardari accused India of violating the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and withholding flood-related information from Pakistan.
He said that in doing so, India had forgotten basic humanity.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari praised Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for making efforts to provide relief to people displaced by the floods, and stressed the need to stand shoulder to shoulder with farmers.
 
 

The PPP chairman also directed his party workers to take an active part in relief activities and assured the affected families that his party would not abandon them.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari was received by senior PPP leader Chaudhry Manzoor Ahmed during his visit to Kasur. The PPP chairman was accompanied by Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider, former National Assembly speaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Hasan Murtaza, Nadeem Afzal Chan and Qamar Zaman Kaira.

In a letter dated Thursday, seen by Dawn.com, Justice Shah said he was reluctantly writing it in “discharge of an unavoidable institutional duty”, adding that what compelled him was “your (CJP’s) persistent and complete indifference”.
The judge wrote that his “repeated letters and written communications to you (CJP) on the undermentioned issues have gone unanswered and undiscussed; not once have I received a reply-neither in writing nor verbally”, adding that such silence from the chief justice to the senior puisne judge was “not merely discourteous; it undermines the collegial traditions of this court and violates the institutional courtesy without which a constitutional court cannot function”.
Justice Shah said that with the new judicial year commencing from Monday, CJP Afridi had convened a judicial conference to review the reforms undertaken under his leadership and to lay down priority areas for the coming year.
“It is therefore both timely and opportune that the institutional concerns I raise in this letter be addressed squarely by you in that forum. By doing so, you will not only respond to the questions that remain unanswered but also reassure the judges of this court, the bar and the public we serve that your vision of reform is grounded in collegiality, transparency, and fidelity to the Constitution.”
The questions the judge asked the CJP to answer were:

Why has the Practice and Procedure Act Committee never been convened
to carry out its statutory responsibilities?
Why was the revision of the Supreme Court Rules 1980 approved by circulation rather than after discussion and deliberation in a Full Court meeting?
Why was the policy on releasing dissenting opinions adopted by soliciting individual opinions of the judges — saying it was a process “unheard of” — rather than an open deliberation in a Full Court meeting?
Why was a General Standing Order (GSO) on leave issued that subjects judges to controls inconsistent with judicial independence and the Presidential Order of 1997?
Why have the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment not been fixed before the original Full Court?
If CJP Afridi was nurturing independence among judges or “enforcing compliance to turn this court into a regimented force rather than a constitutional court of free and equal judges?”

Justice Shah said the letter must not be construed as a “personal grievance”.
“The concerns I now raise do not come from indolence or neglect, but from a judge who has consistently and conscientiously performed his duty. They are, therefore, institutional concerns borne of experience and responsibility rather than personal complaint,” he explained.
Justice Shah said that he trusted CJP Afridi to use the judicial conference as a “moment of institutional renewal by answering these questions and reaffirming the principles of collegiality and constitutional fidelity”.
Justice Shah said the questions were those that struck at the “heart of independence” and not only the apex court judges, but also the nation, were looking towards CJP Afridi “not for silence but for clarity”.
Concerns about PaPA Committee
Elaborating on his questions, Justice Shah said the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023, was enacted by the apex court to put an end to the “one-man show” in the formation of benches.
He pointed out that it required that all causes, matters, petitions, appeals or reviews be placed before benches constituted by a committee under the act, adding that its purpose was “clear”: to review pending cases, devise a transparent case-management plan, categorise cases intelligently and allocate them to benches through collective deliberation.
“Yet, since your assumption of office in October 2024, not a single official meeting of the PaPA Committee has been convened. Bench formation and cause lists are being issued unilaterally, without any committee deliberation. Rosters are circulated for signatures, expecting members to endorse them blindly without discussion of case allocation or categorisation. As a senior member of the committee, I have had no opportunity to participate in its work as mandated by law.
“This is a direct violation of the act and raises serious concerns. Why are junior judges regularly assigned to three-member benches while senior judges are confined to two-member benches? Why are matters of national importance with far-reaching policy implications not fixed before senior benches? The pattern suggests that independent judges are being sidelined, not for reasons of efficiency, but for reasons of control.”
Justice Shah said that minutes of five “committee meetings” displayed on the court’s website could not “cure this defect”, arguing that “they were not committee meetings within the meaning of the act but mere discussions about the chief justice’s travel schedule. Even then, their minutes were uploaded in violation of a binding majority decision of the committee. I had recorded my dissent on that occasion, arguing for transparency, but it was disregarded. This is symptomatic of a mindset averse to collegiality and inclined towards dictation.”
 
 

The judge rued that “the genie of the ‘one-man show’, which Parliament sought to bury through legislation, has been released once again”, adding that that was the reason why he had ceased signing the rosters circulated without any meeting.
“By sidelining the committee and withholding even basic information (such as the number of cases to be dealt with or those fixed before larger benches), you have reduced a statutory mechanism of collective decision-making into a façade.
“The result is evident: despite the increase in the number of judges, the court’s pendency remains at 57,455 cases. The very purpose of enhancing the court’s strength — reducing backlog — stands defeated. The unavoidable inference is that enlargement of the court was less about addressing pendency and more about altering its internal balance, thereby diluting the independence and standing of existing judges.”
Revision of court rules
Regarding the revision of the apex court’s rules, Justice Shah said they were a constitutional document that governed the institution’s functioning and their first revision in four decades was an event of “historic significance”.
He argued that such a process required a Full Court meeting on the administrative side. “Instead, you chose to approve the draft rules by circulation — a process suited to routine matters, not to reshaping the court’s constitutional framework.
“By avoiding deliberation, you deprived the court of collective wisdom and diminished judicial dialogue. This course reflects a lack of collegiality and a preference for unilateral authority.”
Policy on dissenting opinions
Regarding dissenting opinions, Justice Shah said the court’s recent policy on releasing them with the majority judgment was approved through a unique process of soliciting the views of individual judges by the registrar.
He said there was no “legal or institutional basis for individual opinion-gathering on such critical matters”, unless specifically authorised by the Full Court, and even then, only for matters that were procedural or minor in nature.
Justice Shah said the above exercise could not be treated as a substitute for Full Court deliberation, nor could responses to this letter be used to formulate policy in isolation.
“A matter of jurisprudential weight was reduced to a secretive tick-box exercise and the court was denied the richness of open deliberation.
“A Full Court meeting is not merely a procedural formality — it is the bedrock of judicial collegiality. It allows all judges of this court to come together, to deliberate, to exchange ideas and, through open dialogue, to persuade or be persuaded. In such a forum, a judge may revise or refine their view after hearing their colleagues, or may help develop a collective wisdom that is far more robust than isolated responses. This essential element of judicial democracy is entirely lost when opinions are sought in writing and in silos.”
General Standing Order on leave
Justice Shah said that the GSO dated July 29, 2025, was the “first time” in the court’s history that something had dictated that judges were “whole-time” at the state’s disposal, adding that this was language “wholly alien” to a constitutional court.
“Judges are not regimented officers; their independence is constitutionally entrenched.”
The judge said the GSO had confined foreign leaves to five categories, but this was a restriction not envisaged in Presidential Order No. 2 of 1997.
“In principle, leave can, if at all, only possibly be considered for refusal where: (i) a part-heard case cannot be adjourned; (ii) urgent administrative duty demands presence; or (iii) a judge is negligent in work and seeks leave to evade it. Yet, in practice, leave is being denied even when none of these circumstances exist-apparently to enforce compliance and control, and to prevent independent judges from speaking at international forums. Such arbitrary denials betray a deep institutional insecurity.”
Justice Shah further railed that the newly introduced requirement under the GSO that a judge must disclose his residential address and contact details was “alien” to the practice of constitutional courts worldwide.
“It borrows from the ethos of civil-service bureaucracy and attempts to transplant it into the judiciary, with deeply corrosive consequences. A judge of this court is not a supervised functionary of the state but a constitutional actor whose independence is both decisional and personal. To compel disclosure of a judge’s private residence is not administration — it is surveillance. It reduces the dignity of the office to that of a monitored employee and cloaks an instrument of control in the garb of procedure.
“No constitutional court of repute — the US Supreme Court, the UK Supreme Court, or the Constitutional Court of South Africa — has ever imposed such a condition. You may not realise it, but by imposing it here, you are striking at the very independence of this court. A judiciary under watch ceases to be a judiciary; it becomes an extension of bureaucracy. Kindly note that no apex court of repute across jurisdictions mandates such disclosure, precisely because the ethos of independence demands institutional courtesy, not surveillance.”
The senior puisne judge pointed out that the GSO had been “weaponised to create a judicial ‘exit control list’”.
He noted that leave was no longer a matter of “respect and consultation but of bureaucratic obstruction”, adding that it was an “authoritarian impulse that undermines judicial independence”.
The judge further pointed out that “disturbingly, these rigid policies bear the imprint of the civil bureaucracy. The registrar — a retired civil servant — appears to be driving an agenda alien to the ethos of a constitutional court. Judges are not governed by the logic of command and control but by independence and collegiality. Judges are not mere agents of government; they are guardians of the people’s liberties.”
Supreme Court’s legitimacy
Lastly, Justice Shah said the apex court and CJP Afridi’s legitimacy “hangs in the balance” in the pending petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.
He pointed out that the petitions remained unheard for nearly a year, though they concerned the Supreme Court’s independence.
“They must be heard by the original Full Court, excluding judges elevated after the amendment. Until then, any initiative under your leadership remains institutionally fragile, for its foundation is constitutionally suspect. True leadership lies not in managing compliance but in ensuring that the court rises above suspicion as the fearless guardian of the Constitution,” the senior puisne judge concluded.</p><small>2025-09-06 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/06021403f355615.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1939991/can-icc-use-indias-own-policy-to-revive-pakistan-india-tests' target='_blank'><strong>Can ICC use India’s own policy to revive Pakistan-India Tests?</strong></a><br><p>DUBAI: Could the Indian government’s own sports policy hold the key to reviving the most watched, most lucrative and most emotionally charged rivalry in Test cricket — Pakistan versus India?
Upon reviewing India’s Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports’ policy on international events, a key clause stands out: “Indian teams and individual players will take part in international events that also have teams or players from Pakistan. Similarly, Pakistani players and teams will be able to participate in such multilateral events hosted by India.”
Another important line states: “About international and multilateral events, in India or abroad, we are guided by the practices of international sports bodies and the interest of our own sportspersons.”
Taken together, the policy is clear: bilateral series remain off-limits, but participation in international and multilateral events is allowed, and India defers to the practices of international sports bodies — in this case, the International Cricket Council (ICC).
This is why the two sides still face each other in ICC World Cups, ICC Champions Trophy, and ACC Asia Cups. So why not in the ICC World Test Championship (WTC)?
Currently, the ICC WTC league stage is organised on a bilateral basis, with each of the nine participants choosing six opponents over the two-year cycle — three at home and three away — subject to agreement between boards. Each board arranges fixtures, hosts matches and retains all revenues. The ICC’s role is limited to providing the points system, playing conditions, rules, branding and appointing match and anti-corruption officials.
While this flexibility gives members freedom to shape their calendars, it also means India can simply omit Pakistan from its selection, keeping the rivalry outside the Championship.
Because the ICC WTC fixtures are scheduled and commercialised bilaterally — even though they sit inside an ICC competition — India can contend these are not “multilateral” under its policy.
Unlike the ICC WTC final, the solution does not require the ICC to take over complete match operations or host revenues. The ICC should formally designate the WTC league stage as an ICC event for governance and compliance purposes — competition regulations, branding and non-negotiable fixture obligations — while leaving match operations and all host-board revenues untouched.
Once that happens, matches would not only be classified as ICC events but India’s sports policy would apply, obliging participation. Also, host boards will continue to stage matches and retain revenues while the the ICC enforces compliance and safeguards the competition.
India’s policy — which explicitly defers to international sports bodies — places the onus on the ICC. If the ICC defines the WTC as a true multilateral event, India would be obliged under its own stated policy to participate, including fixtures against Pakistan. Ownership here is administrative and legal, not operational or financial.
The absence of India-Pakistan Tests has left the ICC WTC lopsided and deprived the format of its most compelling contest. A revival would not only balance the competition but also electrify the Championship for fans; in turn, lifting global viewership and sponsorship. Moreover, it will give players a stage to compete in the traditional format and strengthen the ICC’s credibility and reputation in protecting and promoting Test cricket.
The precedent already exists. The Ashes is protected within every ICC WTC cycle, guaranteeing that Australia and England meet home and away regardless of scheduling pressures. There is no structural reason why the same principle could not apply to India and Pakistan once the WTC is elevated to a fully recognised ICC event.
Some will argue that politics, not policy, has always dictated whether India and Pakistan play. True — but the same policy also states that India will take part in international events that include Pakistan. Once the ICC WTC league is formally designated as an ICC event with non-negotiable fixtures, the default is participation; any deviation would require an explicit policy exception rather than ambiguity.
Series logistics are manageable, even if at present the environment is not conducive for the two to host each other. Neutral venues such as the UAE or England have successfully hosted both nations, and several boards have publicly expressed interest in staging Pakistan-India Tests.
The ICC has already branded, officiated and regulated the WTC. It does not need to organise or run matches — it simply needs to make the league stage a fully recognised ICC event under its authority.
Every ICC leader has left a mark: David Richards started the ICC Champions Trophy (previously known as the ICC Knock-Out); Malcolm Speed launched the T20 World Cup; Haroon Lorgat introduced technology in world cricket; David Richardson standardised technology and planted the ICC WTC seed; and Geoff Allardice put wheels to the ICC WTC and spearheaded cricket’s return to the Olympics.
Sanjog Gupta, the ICC’s new Chief Executive, now has the chance to build his own legacy by ensuring the Pakistan-India Test rivalry is restored under ICC authority, without disrupting host boards’ operations or revenues.
The bottom line remains that India and Pakistan haven’t played a Test since the 2007 three-match series in India. However, if these two powerhouses of cricket can generate millions in revenue by playing in ICC-organised ODIs and T20Is, there is no logical reason to deny them a Test series — the game’s purest format.
The ICC World Test Championship is the perfect stage to finally deliver the ultimate India-Pakistan series. To secure the survival and growth of Test cricket, and protect the integrity of its marquee competition, the ICC must think boldly, own the WTC and act decisively.

Following the boycott, the main opposition party held a ‘people’s assembly’ outside the Parliament House and urged the judiciary to take up PTI’s appeals against the passage of 26th Constitutional Amendment. They termed the ame­ndment “a tool to suppress and und­ermine the judiciary”.
“The people’s assembly backs shu­tter-down strike call of BNP chief Akhtar Mengal and PkMAP Pre­s­ident Mehmood Achakzai to be obs­erved on Sept 8 in Balochsitan,” said a resolution passed by the gathering.
The resolution, presented by PTI Chairman Barrister Ali Gohar, rej­ected what it called “hybrid regime” and demanded lifting of curbs imp­osed on judiciary so that it could hear appeals filed against 26th Con­stitutional Amendment.
 
 

It also demanded suspension of Afghan refugees’ repatriation process in view of prevailing instability in neighbouring Afghanistan. The resolution further endorsed the recent speech of Supreme Court judge Justice Athar Minallah.
Former NA speaker Asad Qaisar said no people-friendly legislation was being carried out in the parliament.

A situation report of the UNHCR released on Friday said that in August alone, returns increased by 254 per cent, while deportations rose by 191pc as compared to July, coinciding with the start of the third phase of the ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’ (IFPR).
The report says 531,700 Afghans have returned from Pakistan,as of September 4.
 
 

Since April, more than 483,700 Afghans have returned from Pakistan to Afghanistan, including 145,200 in August alone, with some 55,000 making the journey in just the final four days of the month.
The proportion of Proof of Registration (PoR) card holders among returnees has steadily increased, rising from 6 per cent in April to 21–23 per cent between May and July.

UNHCR report reveals that as of Sept 4, around half a million refugees have returned

In August, this share grew sharply, with PoR cardholders accounting for 54pc (77,700 individuals) of all returns recorded to date, the UNHCR data shows.
Some 57,300 individuals have been arrested and detained since April, including PoR card holders. In August alone, some 9,000 arrests were recorded, compared to some 3,400 in July. The top three districts for arrest and detention are Chaghi (Balochistan), Islamabad and Pis­hin (Balochistan).
 
 

In Afghanistan, the UNHCR continued to biometrically process and provide cash assistance to PoR card holders and their nuclear family members, UNHCR slip holders, asylum seeker certificate holders and other protection referrals.
This support aimed at alleviating the difficulties faced by Afghans who have returned home hastily, and often largely unprepared due to the circumstances in Pakistan, the report says.

• High alert along Sutlej as official warns of more flows from India
• PDMA estimates over 3m people displaced; minister announces Rs2m compensation for families of the slain
• PM orders climate change ministry to start preparing for next monsoon
LAHORE: Although a major surge, exceeding 600,000 cusecs in the River Chenab, has crossed Multan and Muzaffargarh without incident, the threat from surging waters has not yet subsided, as more rains are expected to disrupt rescue and rehabilitation work, and bring more water to Punjab’s already swollen rivers.
A major wave crossed the Head Muhammadwala and Sher Shah Bridges and is now advancing towards Panjnad Headworks, where it is expected to peak at 600,000 cusecs by tonight (Saturday), a senior irrigation department official told Dawn.
The episode reveals the complex interplay of Punjab’s river systems. In the River Ravi, water levels at Sidhnai Headworks only began receding after the flood pressure in the Chenab subsided near their convergence point at Abdul Hakeem.
For a tense 36 hours, Sidhnai faced one of its most severe tests as the extremely high flood in the Chenab created a virtual wall of water, blocking the Ravi’s flow and causing it to flow backward, dramatically increasing pressure on the headworks.
 
 

To avert a disaster, the government was forced to carry out a strategic breach at the Mai Safura embankment three days ago to relieve this pressure.
The river flow report released by PDMA Punjab shows that while overall water levels are high, but flows have generally stabilised.
Multan Deputy Commissioner Wasim Hamid Sindhu said that the intensity of floodwaters in the Chenab was decreasing.
He said that water levels reaching Head Muhammad Wala Bridge, Basti Jhagunwala, Akbar embankment, Sikanderi Nallah and Sher Shah were decreasing and the reading on the emergency gate at Akbar embankment had falled from 414 to 413.5.
He said that the water level in the Chenab was expected to decrease over the next 12 hours, adding that Head Muhammad Wala or the Sher Shah embankment would not be bre­ached.
Threat from impending rain
Addressing a press conference in Gujranwala, Provincial Disaster Man­agement Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that another incoming rain spell was expected to disrupt ongoing rescue operations across flood-affected regions. He said that after yet another high-flood warning from India at the Harike location, the government had placed all districts along the Sutlej River on high alert.
DG Kathia warned that fresh rainfall would create additional difficulties for those already affected by the floods.
The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has already warned officials in Punjab, Sindh and Islamabad to remain alert for a spell forecast from Sept 7-9. According to the NDMA, a low-pressure system is currently located over Madhya Pradesh (India) and likely to move west-northwest, may reach Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Sindh today. Under the influence of this weather system, Punjab, Sindh and Islamabad may face heavy to very heavy rains.
Damages
Speaking at the tail-end of the National Assembly sitting on Friday, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said that so far, 2.1 million people had been displaced by the floods.
He termed it a massive disaster that was not easy to cope with, adding that meteorological predictions had been correct with a 92pc accuracy rate.
He revealed that the families of those who lost their lives due to the floods would be given Rs2m in compensation, adding that Rs680m had been paid to families of those killed and injured so far.
 


Separately, PDMA Punjab issued a report on damages caused by flooding in Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers, which stated that over 3,900 villages had been affected. The report put the figure of those affected by the floods at 3.89m.
Around 1.84m people trapped in floodwaters have been relocated to safety, while 1.34m animals had been relocated.
According to Punjab Relief Com­missioner Nabil Javaid, the reservoirs at Mangla and Tarbela are at 87pc and 100pc capacity, respectively. Meanwhile, India’s Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River is at 84pc, the Pong Dam is at 98pc, while the Thein Dam is 92pc full.
PM orders prep for next monsoon
Separately, chairing a high-level review meeting to assess the damage, as well as the ongoing rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts underway across the country, PM Shehbaz Sharif ordered the Ministry of Climate Change to begin immediate preparations for the 2026 monsoon season and present a comprehensive climate resilience action plan within two weeks.
 






The plan, he said, must address Pakistans growing vulnerability to climate change. The PM stressed the need for real-time monitoring of evacuation and relief operations to ensure that timely assistance reaches those in need. He instructed the establishment of a special committee to facilitate financial assistance for flood victims who are not currently registered with Nadra.
The meeting was informed that compensation for deceased persons, the injured, and property damages was being processed through Nadra, with priority being given to those most affected.

GAZA CITY : The Israeli military intensified its bombardment in Gaza City on Friday, demolishing a high-rise building it claimed was used by Hamas, as part of a its campaign to take over control of the area.
In a statement, the military said it had “identified significant Hamas terrorist activity within a wide variety of infrastructure sites in Gaza City, and particularly in high-rise buildings,” adding it would target those sites “in the coming days”.
Less than an hour later, it announced it had struck one such building, accusing Hamas of using it “to advance and execute attacks against troops in the area.”
 


19 killed in Gaza
Israeli strikes killed at least 19 people in and around Gaza City, an area the Israeli military is planning to conquer.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal said that attacks targeted buildings and tents sheltering displaced Gazans in various neighbourhoods and city outskirts.
Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to intensify operations, with Israeli military spokesman Nadav Shoshani saying on Thursday that the start of the campaign to seize Gaza City will not be announced in advance to “maintain the element of surprise”.
Hamas video release
Also on Friday, Hamas released a video of two Israeli prisoners, with one captive saying he was being held in Gaza City. The edited video featured an exhausted-looking Guy Gilboa-Dalal, 24, who said he feared being killed by Israel’s offensive.
Gilboa-Dalal and Alon Ohel, who is also seen briefly in the video, is among 48 people still held by Hamas in Gaza, with 20 of them thought to be alive.
 


US sanctions
On the diplomatic front, the United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on three leading Palestinian human rights organisations.
The US State Department designated Al-Haq, Al Mezan Center for Human Rights, and the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, stating they “have directly engaged in efforts by the International Criminal Court to investigate, arrest, detain, or prosecute Israeli nationals, without Israel’s consent”.
The decision drew swift condemnation. UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk called the move “completely unacceptable,” saying the sanctions would have a “chilling effect”.
WHO appeal
The World Health Organisation (WHO) chief on Friday urged Israel to stop the “catastrophe” of people starving to death in Gaza, saying at least 370 people have died from malnutrition since the war began.
 






“This is a catastrophe that Israel could have prevented, and could stop at any time,” WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebr­eyesus told reporters. “Starvation of civilians as a method of war is a war crime that can never be tolerated.”
Israel has denied famine, insisting the territory was suffering from a “man-made shortage engineered by Hamas”.

The house also passed a resolution “condemning in the strongest words” the recent suicide bombing at the public meeting of the BNP-Mengal in Quetta and “demanding of the provincial government to bring the perpetrators to justice.”
The resolution, read out by Pullain Baloch of the National Party (NP), said that 15 people died and more than 75 people were injured in the incident.
The blast took place near Shahwani Stadium in Quetta’s Sariab area on Tuesday night, shortly after the conclusion of the public meeting of the BNP-M held to mark the death anniversary of late Sardar Attaullah Mengal.

Lawmakers slam govt’s handling of situation in the province; cite ongoing ‘military ops’, failure to address missing persons’ issue

BNP President and MNA Akhtar Mengal, who presided over the gathering, remained unhurt as the blast occurred when he was leaving for home. PkMAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, Asghar Khan Achakzai of the ANP, and former senator Mir Kabeer Muhammad Shai of the National Party were also present, but escaped unhurt.
 
 

Speaking in the NA, Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri of the JUI-F said that since he was a child, he had been witnessing “military operations” in the province. He alleged that the government was not ready to pay heed to the genuine grievances of the people of Balochistan, and was unable to satisfy the family members of the missing persons.
“Instead of stopping the [military] operations, lawlessness and cruelty, the rulers are unfortunately sprinkling salt on the wounds of the people,” said Mr Haideri while referring to a reported statement of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in which he had stated that the Balochistan issue could be handled even by a police official of the rank of station house officer (SHO).
 


The JUI-F leader cited a number of recent terror attacks in the province, including the one on his own convoy, claiming that over 1,000 people and security personnel had so far lost their lives in these incidents. He asked the government to convene an all parties’ conference on the Balochistan issue.
The JUI-F lawmaker regretted that some 40 relatives, mostly woman and children, had been staging a protest sit-in outside the press club in Islamabad, but the government had not sent any delegation or team to hear their grievances. Instead, he regretted, the authorities were bent upon declaring them “traitors”.
“How can you call these people traitors and rebels when they have been sitting in the capital right under the nose of the parliament and the judiciary” requesting the government to tell them the whereabouts of their missing family members.
Another JUI-F MNA Usman Badini in his speech hit out at the opposition PTI over the party’s alleged silence on the issues of Balochistan.
“On one hand, the PTI people are making Mehmood Khan Achakzai their head and on the other hand, they are not ready to talk about the suicide attack in Balochistan,” he said.
Responding to the speeches of Balochistan MNAs, State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry reaffirmed the government’s readiness to engage with Balochistan’s leadership and political representatives to find practical solutions to the province’s issues.
About the ongoing protest outside the NPC in Islamabad, the minister said the authorities had been providing security and necessary facilitation to them despite the fact that they had been staging protest on a road inside the Red Zone. He claimed that the government as well as the district administration officials had been in continuous contact with the protesters, and “trying to address their concerns through proper channels.”
He alleged that some individuals were exploiting the ongoing protest for their personal gains or political point-scoring.
The minister informed the house that nearly 2,000 missing person cases had been registered and the relevant commission had been monitoring these matters according to rules.
Interestingly, the minister indirectly put the blame of the Quetta blast on the organisers of the public meeting, stating that holding political gatherings without proper clearance created soft targets.
 


PTI’s walkout
At the outset of the sitting, PTI Chairman Gohar Ali Khan regretted that the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) was not helping the flood-affected people in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Mr Khan announced that the PTI members had decided to boycott the NA sitting, stating they could not be a part of the “unco­nstitutional proceedings”.
The PTI members staged a walkout from the assembly after making a failed attempt to disrupt the proceedings by pointing out quorum.
 


Speaker Ayaz Sadiq declared the house in order following a headcount and continued proceedings without the PTI members.
The speaker castigated them for boycotting the NDMA briefing and offered them that he could arrange a separate briefing of the NDMA officials for the PTI members.
He said after staging a walkout from the house, the PTI members would now tell the press outside the Parliament House that they were not being given opportunity to speak. The PTI members held a “public assembly session” outside the Parliament House.
The NA session, which began on Monday, has been prorogued for an indefinite period.

• Says no pause in expulsion of Afghans after deadly earthquake
• Spox avoids addressing Trump’s remarks, says SCO promotes multilateralism, peace
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Friday emphasised the seriousness of the threat posed to regional peace and stability by Afghanistan-based terrorist groups, calling it a common challenge that required collaborative efforts.
“Groups like Fitna Al-Khwarij represent a common threat to the peace and stability of our region, necessitating collective action to counter their malign influence,” Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan said at a weekly media briefing.
The government uses the term to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) terrorist group.
The spokesman was responding to questions about reported Pakistani strikes across the border and comments by Taliban acting Defence Minister Mullah Yaqoob, who accused Pakistan of blaming Afghanistan for its own security shortcomings.
 
 

Pakistan has long maintained that it faces a persistent threat from militant groups operating out of Afghanistan, including the TTP and the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). Multiple United Nations Security Council reports have noted the presence of sanctuaries for these groups in Afghanistan, which Islamabad says enable cross-border attacks.
Taliban officials, however, deny the allegations. In a recent media interview, Mullah Yaqoob said Pakistan’s security apparatus was to blame for failing to prevent militant infiltrations.
“If they cross into Pakistan from Afghanistan and travel deep inside Pakistani territory, why aren’t they stopped there? Instead of addressing this, Pakistan unjustly accuses Afghanistan,” he said.
Shafqat Ali dismissed the Taliban defence chief’s remarks as “an exercise in irony”. “It cannot mask the seriousness of this issue,” he said, adding: “The enormity of the matter cannot be diminished by whatever number of statements you issue.”
The FO spokesman said security forces and law enforcement agencies conduct “targeted operations in border regions to safeguard our citizens from terrorist threats”.
“These operations are meticulously planned based on credible and actionable intelligence and executed with precision,” he said, adding that Pakistan respects Afghanistan’s sovereignty and remains committed to dialogue and cooperation.
Expulsion of Afghans
FO spokesman rejected calls to pause the expulsion of Afghans following last weekend’s deadly earthquake in Afghanistan, insisting that deportations would continue and urging Germany to show seriousness in relocating vulnerable refugees.
“This is the global norm, and this is our sovereign decision regarding who we allow to enter or stay in our country. So, any person who’s illegal, we will repatriate that person,” Shafqat Ali said.
He was responding to an appeal by UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi, who earlier this week urged Pakistan to suspend its ‘Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan’ because of the humanitarian crisis triggered by the earthquake.
“Given the circumstances, I appeal to the government of Pakistan to pause the implementation,” Grandi had said.
Shafqat Ali suggested there would be no extension of the Sept 1 deadline for Afghans to leave, noting that Pakistan already maintains a generous visa policy.
“We are issuing a large number of visas to Afghans under different categories, including visit, business, family, education and medical visas,” he said.
“For Afghanistan, we have a special category under which on-arrival visas are granted for certain medical emergencies. So, what I want to emphasise is that we already have a very liberalised visa regime in place.”
The FO spokesman also pressed Germany to accelerate the relocation of Afghans promised after the Taliban takeover. “We hope that they take it seriously. There is a large group of Afghans in Pakistan which the German side had committed to take to Germany. A number of deadlines have passed,” he said.
Trump’s criticism of SCO summit
The FO spokesman, while sidestepping direct comment on US President Donald Trump’s criticism of the gathering, said this week’s Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Tianjin promoted multilateralism and the pursuit of peace and prosperity.
 
 

“The recent Heads of States meeting and then in the expanded format meeting were very successful. The key message was of multilateralism, common prosperity, peace, security and development,” he noted.
He maintained that the SCO was not designed to work against any country.
