In applications, filed under Section 561-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the couple sought an urgent hearing for their pending criminal revision petitions. The filings highlight a critical disparity between the pace of the trial court and the high court.
The petitioners argued that their pleas against the dismissal of acquittal pleas have been pending since January 2024, while the trial court is proceeding with “unprecedented and extraordinary speed,” conducting hearings on a strict day-to-day basis.
This “breakneck pace” of trial, presided over by the Special Judge Central in Islamabad, is severely prejudicial to their rights to a fair trial and due process, they contend.
They expressed a “grave and well-founded apprehension” that the trial court may conclude the case even before the IHC hears their challenge, which they said would render their legal right to revision “infructuous, nugatory, and a mere academic exercise.”

Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mini Mazda Truck Owners Association President Latif Gul said Afghan authorities have not allowed the trucks to return, leaving hundreds of Pakistani drivers and conductors stuck across the border in difficult conditions.
“Our drivers have been away from their homes for a month, while truck owners have already exhausted their earnings to meet daily expenses,” he added.
Latif Gul said that delays at the border have increased operational costs, resulting in higher fares for vehicles travelling to Afghanistan. He warned that under such conditions, truck owners and drivers would no longer be willing to transport passengers to Afghanistan.
He further cautioned that if the issue is not resolved immediately, the association would be compelled to block Ring Road in Peshawar and halt the movement of all containers bound for Afghanistan.
He urged both the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan to ensure the immediate repatriation of stranded vehicles and drivers.

Earlier, Additional District & Sessions Judge Yalmaz Ghani conducted the proceedings, with the prime minister appearing via a video link.
During the hearing, PM Shehbaz’s counsel Mustafa Ramday objected to several questions posed by Advocate Muhammad Hussain Chotia, the counsel for the defendant.
At the outset, the prime minister objected to the late arrival of the defendant’s lawyer, saying he had returned from an official visit to Qatar for the case. He asked the judge to proceed strictly in accordance with law.

Meetings on ongoing flood situation cited as reason for the request

Later, PM Shehbaz took oath to speak the truth and admitted that the receipts of the legal notice bore the name of his lawyer but did not specify who received them.
He maintained that the legal notice had been issued on his instructions, although he could not recall the complete text of the notice. The prime minister read the legal notice aloud in the court.
The defendant’s counsel pointed out that the defamation suit mentioned the Panama Papers but the legal notice did not.
However, PM Shehbaz said that he had repeatedly clarified that he had no connection to the Panama Papers.
“It is very clear in the suit and there is no need for further questions on this point,” he pressed.
Advocate Ramday also objected, calling the questions posed by the defendant’s counsel irrelevant and meaningless.
The judge adjourned further hearing till Sept 16 to continue the cross-examination of the prime minister.
In his suit filed in 2017, PM Shehbaz said Imran Khan levelled baseless allegations against him.
He sought a decree for recovery of Rs10bn as compensation from the defendant for publication of defamatory content.
The former prime minister had filed his reply to the suit with a delay of four years in 2021, saying one of his friends told him that someone known to him and the Sharif family had approached him with an offer to pay billions of rupees if he could convince him (Mr Khan) to stop pursuing the Panama Papers case.
The former prime minister said he disclosed the incident for the consumption of the public at large and an act in the interest of the public good does not constitute any defamation. Mr Khan said he did not specifically attribute any statement to the plaintiff (PM Shehbaz) while narrating the incident.

• Suspends eight cash and support centres due to Taliban ban on female staff
• Appeals for $259m to sustain life-saving assistance
ISLAMABAD: The top official of the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Afghanistan has called on Pakistan to uphold its long-standing humanitarian approach towards Afghan refugees and extend the legal stay of those still in need of international protection, particularly groups at heightened risk if forced to return.
In a statement issued from Geneva on Friday, UNHCR Representative to Afghanistan Arafat Jamal said the agency stood ready to support Pakistan in developing practical mechanisms to identify vulnerable individuals and expand regulated migration pathways for Afghans.
He also urged regional countries to ensure that all returns remain voluntary, safe, dignified and sustainable, stressing that no one should be forced back to danger or to a country already stretched to absorb new arrivals.
“Without additional funding, we will not be able to sustain life-saving assistance for Afghan families facing these overlapping crises. We have updated our regional appeal for returns in light of recent events and are calling for $258.6 million,” Mr Jamal said.
As Pakistan resumes implementation of its “Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan”, more than 554,000 Afghans have returned since April, including 143,000 in August alone.
In recent weeks, the pace has surged further: in the first week of September alone, nearly 100,000 people crossed back from Pakistan, stretching capacities to the limit.
Together with partners, UNHCR is providing returnees with immediate assistance — cash support, protection and other essential services — both at border points and in their areas of return, to help families begin rebuilding their lives.
However, in recent days, UNHCR has been forced to temporarily suspend operations at its cash and support centres across Afghanistan, as the de facto authorities have been preventing national female UN staff members from entering UN compounds.
“This is a problem affecting the entire UN, including UNHCR, and any agency head would tell a similar story. It is not possible to serve women without female staff. We reiterate our call for the immediate lifting of these restrictions and for an urgent solution to be found,” the statement said.
Mr Jamal said the agency closed eight centres providing cash and other support to returnees on Sept 9 because of the ban on female aid workers.
“This was an operational decision. It is not a decision taken to punish anyone or to make a statement, but it simply demonstrates that we cannot work without female workers in certain circumstances,” he told a Geneva press briefing by video link from Kabul, according to Reuters.
“It is a huge step, and it is creating an enormous amount of suffering for these people,” he said, adding that these centres typically helped around 7,000 people a day.
The work at the centres involves personal interviews and biometrics, which he said cannot be done by men on Afghan women, he added.
Restrictions on women
Meanwhile, the United Nations in Afghanistan has called on Taliban authorities to lift restrictions barring women national staff from entering its premises, APP reported.
“These measures are putting life-saving humanitarian assistance and other essential services for hundreds of thousands of people affected by a recent deadly earthquake at risk,” the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) warned in a statement.
 
 

The UN Refugee Agency cautioned that a “crisis within a crisis” was emerging, as forced returns from Pakistan coincide with devastating earthquakes in many of the same areas where returnees are arriving.
Since the start of the year, about 2.6 million Afghans have returned from neighbouring countries, many against their will. Some have not set foot in Afghanistan for decades, while others are being brought into the country for the first time.
The agency “remains grateful to governments, companies and individuals who have already stepped up to support UNHCR’s work in Afghanistan and across the region. But our resources are running out quickly”, Mr Jamal cautioned.
Meanwhile, in the earthquake-affected areas, UNHCR has met families who had only just returned from Pakistan before losing their homes once again. “We are distributing thousands of tents and other relief items, including in some of the most remote locations, while also scaling up protection assessments and programmes already in place in these provinces for returnees,” he added.

• Evacuations continue as overflowing Indus submerges 30 villages in Dadu
• 19 controlled breaches made to save Jalalpur and Alipur; efforts on to plug Shujabad breach
• Flood-hit areas without electricity, cellular coverage; drones used to deliver food to the stranded
LAHORE: Evacuation eff­orts continued across central and south Punjab as exceptionally high flood levels persist between the Panjnad confluence of Chenab-Ravi-Sutlej and Guddu Barrage in Sindh, creating a severe humanitarian crisis, inundating low-lying areas, displacing large populations, and destroying hundreds of acres of standing crops.
The overflowing Indus has also inundated parts of Sindh, with areas in Dadu and Lar­kana witnessing widespread displacement in riverine areas.
Residents of flood-hit areas are also facing widespread electricity and mobile service outages, leaving them cut off from authorities and relatives, while trapped by rising waters.
Punjab Relief Commi­ssioner Nabil Javaid said 97 people had lost their lives as Punjab faced the “biggest flood in history”. He reported that 2.45 million people from 4,500 villages along the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers had been affected, and that 1.9m cattle had been moved to safe locations.
 
 

The Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) has warned of a very high flood at Head Panjnad, Sidhnai, and Ganda Singh Wala, while high flood levels persist at Head Sulemanki, Head Islam, and Mailsi Syphon.
According to FFD data, released at 1am on Saturday, Punjnad Headworks recorded a flow of 651,572 cusecs, while the outflows at Guddu Barrage were steady at 537,392 cusecs.
Breaches
A total of 19 controlled breaches were carried out on Friday to mitigate the flood threat to Jalapur, Alipur, while efforts to repair the damaged dyke in Shujabad continued in earnest.
In Shujabad, a dyke collapsed at Mouza Dhundwala, flooding several villages and sending water towards the city. The administration and irrigation officials are trying to reinforce the Bakhto Wah canal dyke to protect the town, but several villages have already been submerged.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, who toured several flood hit areas on Friday, also visited the breach site and directed officials to seal it.
However, three workers sent to repair the breach in Shujabad were swept away by the rising waters. Two of them were rescued, but their third colleague could not be traced and was feared dead.
Authorities also made controlled breaches on Uch Sharif Road to divert floodwaters away from Jalalpur city, with Multan police chief Sadiq Ali Dogar saying the decision was necessary as pressure on temporary dams was not easing.
In Alipur, the administration breached Seetpur Road at 18 locations to disperse water flowing towards the city, submerging several villages and trapping thousands on rooftops.  Here, a rescue boat capsized in Darabpur village when a man tried to climb on it, causing it to lose balance. However, all passengers were rescued.
‘Calamity-hit’ Alipur
Marriyum Aurangzeb also visited Alipur to monitor flood relief operations. She declared Alipur tehsil a calamity-hit area.
People gathered around her to report that six members of a family were missing after a rescue boat capsized in Seetpur. Many residents were stranded on rooftops, and boats were not available for evacuation.
The government also deployed drones in the flood-affected areas of Seetpur city to distribute food items. The drones carried supplies and delivered them to people stranded on rooftops.
Malik Riaz, a resident of Seetpur, told Dawn that he had been without food and water for the last two days and that the drone delivery provided much-needed relief. He added that hand pumps were emitting dirty water, which was unsafe for drinking.
Rescue spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said that 18,130 people have been rescued from Jalalpur Pirwala, 11,700 from Liaqatpur in Rahim Yar Khan, and 6,400 from Alipur. In the last 24 hours across Punjab, 19,946 people were rescued from flood-affected areas, including 1,955 from Bahawalpur, 1,715 from Pakpattan, 1,407 from Lodhran, 830 from Okara, 823 from Bahawalnagar, 659 from Jhang, 585 from Kasur, 558 from Vehari, and 545 from Toba Tek Singh.
Dadu flooding
In Sindh, floods inundated parts of Dadu as the Indus River overflowed near the Dadu-Moro Bridge, submerging more than 30 villages in the riverine areas. The rising waters have displaced large numbers of residents and triggered outbreaks of waterborne and other infectious diseases.
 
 

The Health Department, People’s Primary Healthcare Initiative and Rescue 1122 have set up medical camps to provide urgent care.
According to Deputy Commissioner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah, medical camps have been established along the protective embankment, while mobile ambulances are operating to assist the affected population. Boats have also been deployed to help stranded residents. Authorities are monitoring the situation closely and have urged the residents to cooperate with rescue teams and follow precautionary measures.
PM praises relief efforts
Separately, PM Shehbaz Sharif on Friday praised all four chief ministers, as well as the governments of GB and AJK, for carrying out prompt and effective flood relief operations across the country.
The prime minister specially commended his niece, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, saying: “She is leading from the front.”

The PPP chairman said it was “beyond comprehension” as to why the Centre had not sought international assistance despite a disaster of this scale. “This is standard practice for disasters of this scale internationally. It was done for the last floods when I was foreign minister, before that, the 2010 floods and the 2005 earthquake.
Countries all over the world do the same within the first 72 hours of such disasters,” he said on his X (formerly Twitter) account.
“There is no excuse to cut off the millions affected from this assistance,” he said.
 







Sherry Rehman moves resolution in Senate, urges govt to use BISP to help survivors

Mr Bhutto-Zardari welcomed the government’s decision to announce a climate and agricultural emergency and called for the announcement of relief through the Benazir Income Support Programme for flood-impacted areas. He also expressed support for the agricultural community, calling it the “most devastated sector” due to the recent floods.
Resolution
The resolution submitted to the Senate, moved by Senator Sherry Rehman, emphasised that immediate humanitarian relief was critical, including the waiver of electricity bills for the millions of vulnerable citizens now displaced or affected.
 






Key points of the resolution included acknowledging the current crisis as a climate, flood, agricultural, and humanitarian emergency, and emphasising that delays in mobilising support were unacceptable, regardless of the pace of international response, said a statement issued by the PPP.
The destruction of crops and displacement of communities had created a multi-faceted emergency, requiring both immediate national action and robust international support.
 
 

The federal government must expedite direct cash transfers to displaced families and affected farmers via the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), following the successful model of 2022, the resolution said, besides emphasising the urgent need for basic medical care and medicines.
“There is a need for a renewed call for the government of Pakistan to launch an international flash appeal through the United Nations to enable swift donor mobilisation,” it added.

• Pakistan among 142 states that vote in favour; US, nine others vote against resolution
• Palestinian official says document important step towards ‘achieving our independent state’
• US official says move ‘risks prolonging war’; Rubio to oppose ‘unilateral recognition’ during Israel visit
UNITED NATIONS: The UN General Assembly voted on Friday to back a resolution that seeks to breathe new life into the two-state solution between Israel and Palestine, without the involvement of Hamas.
The text was adopted by 142 votes in favour, 10 against, including Israel and key ally the United States, and 12 abstentions. It clearly condemned Hamas and demanded that the resistance group surrender its weapons.
Although Israel has criticised UN bodies for nearly two years over their failure to condemn Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023, the declaration, presented by Fra­nce and Saudi Arabia, left no ambiguity.
Formally called the New York Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, the text stated that “Hamas must free all hostages” and that the UN General Assembly condemned “the attacks committed by Hamas against civilians on the 7th of October.”
It also called for “collective action to end the war in Gaza, to achieve a just, peaceful and lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the effective implementation of the two-state solution.”
 
 

The declaration, which was already endorsed by the Arab League and co-signed in July by 17 UN member states, including several Arab countries, also sought to fully exclude Hamas from leadership in Gaza.
“In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State,” the declaration stated.
‘Important step’
Palestinian Vice President Hussein al-Sheikh welcomed the decision, saying the resolution “expresses international willingness to support our people’s rights and constitutes an important step towards ending the occupation and achieving our independent state”.
In his explanation of Pakistan’s vote, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad reiterated Islamabad’s “long-standing and principled position” in support of Palestinian self-determination. He condemned the ongoing Israeli aggression in Gaza, the expansion of settlements, and the humanitarian toll being exacted upon civilians there and demanded immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire.
However, Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Oren Marmorstein slammed the vote, saying in a post on X that Israel “utterly rejects” the declaration, calling it evidence that the General Assembly had become “a political circus detached from reality”.
 






A US diplomat told the General Assembly that the resolution would amount to a “gift to Hamas,” asserting that, rather than promoting peace, it risked prolonging the war and harming both short- and long-term prospects for peace.
It may be noted that the efforts to end the Gaza war and release Israeli hostages suffered a significant blow after Tel Aviv attacked the Hamas leadership in Doha, Qatar, drawing widespread condemnations for its flagrant violation of international law.
Only a few days before the attack, the US president had issued a ‘last warning’ to Hamas, asking it to accept the deal for the release of Israeli prisoners.
In response to Donald Trump’s comments, Hamas said it was ready to “immediately sit at the negotiating table” but wanted “a clear declaration of the end of the war, a full withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, and the formation of a committee of independent Palestinians to manage the Gaza Strip, which would begin its duties immediately”.
Hamas also agreed last month to a ceasefire proposal that involved a 60-day truce and staggered prisoner releases. Israel, however, demanded that Hamas release all the prisoners at once, disarm itself and relinquish control of Gaza, among other conditions.
‘Shield’ against criticism
The vote precedes an upcoming UN summit co-chaired by Riyadh and Paris on September 22 in New York, in which French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to formally recognise the Palestinian state.
“The fact that the General Assembly is finally backing a text that condemns Hamas directly is significant,” even if “Israelis will say it is far too little, far too late,” Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, told AFP.
“Now at least states supporting the Palestinians can rebuff Israeli accusations that they implicitly condone Hamas,” he said, adding that it “offers a shield against Israeli criticism”. In addition to Macron, several other leaders have announced their intent to formally recognise the Palestinian state during the UN summit.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, may be prevented from visiting New York for the UN summit after US authorities said they would deny him a visa.
 
 

The New York Declaration incl­u­des discussion of a “deployment of a temporary international stabilisation mission” to the battered region under the mandate of the UN Security Council, aiming to support the Palestinian civilian population.
Around three-quarters of the 193 UN member states recognise the Palestinian state proclaimed in 1988 by the exiled Palestinian leadership.
However, two years of war have ravaged the Gaza Strip, in addition to expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the stated desire by Israeli officials to annex the territory. “We are going to fulfill our promise that there will be no Palestinian state,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Thursday.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will leave Washington on a trip to Israel on Friday to offer support before French-led moves to recognise a Palestinian state, the State Department said. He will speak to Israeli leaders about “our commitment to fight anti-Israel actions including unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state that rewards Hamas terrorism,” State Depar­tment spokesman Tommy Pigott said in a statement.

Despite the approval, federal and regional officials face significant funding challenges, with financial responsibility for the new posts placed on the “resource-strapped” Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) government and construction funds deferred until the next fiscal year.
A Central Development Working Party (CDWP) meeting, held on July 25, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commi­ssion, reviewed the GB government sponsored pro­ject “Raising of Cou­nter Terrorism Depart­ment (CTD) in GB”, which carries a cost of over 1.5 billion rupees.
The initiative follows a directive from the prime minister, who during a visit on Nov 6, last year, ordered the establishment of the CTD in GB within six months.
The project aims to enh­ance the capacity of the GB Police by addressing “critical gaps in human and technical reso­urces, enabling effective res­ponses to terrorist incidents and the conduct of comprehensive investigations”.
While the CDWP approved the civil works component of the project — the construction of a CTD HQs in Gilgit and a regional office in Chilas at a cost of Rs720.50 million — it noted the allocation would not be made until the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the 2026-27 fiscal year.
 
 

The Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, GB and States and Frontier Regions will sponsor the project.
The Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives cited “reduced fiscal space in PSDP” and a “substantial” existing financial commitment to GB as reasons for the delay. It told the GB government to either execute the project using its own resources or approach the Finance Division for recurring budget support.
The planning division’s chairman told the meeting that the PSDP is meant for development, while expenses like arms and ammunition are recurring costs that should be covered by the current budget.
The GB Home Department informed the forum that its own regional budget has no room to accommodate new projects and that it is already facing a shortage of resources, a situation exacerbated by ongoing floods.
It said the Finance Division is considering a reduction of Rs40 billion from the already approved SDP, This reduction would limit the PSDP to funding only ongoing strategic projects.
Separately, the Federal Finance Division concurred with the creation of the 613 posts for the new department. However, in a letter to the GB Home and Prisons Department, it attached strict conditions.
“I am directed to… convey the concurrence of Finance Division for the creation of 613 posts for CTD, Gilgit-Baltistan,” the letter from Section Officer Babar Nazir stated.
It stipulated that the “additional financial implications shall be met out by the GB government from their available resources and no additional funds will be provided for this purpose”.

• Qatari PM says Tel Aviv led by ‘bloodthirsty extremists’; reminds how US never attacked Taliban leaders during Doha peace process
WASHINGTON / ISLA­M­ABAD: A rare and public rift emerged among Israel and its closest Western allies during Thursday’s emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, as the US, France and UK voiced differing views on its airstrike against Qatar.
For the first time in recent memory, the US joined all 15 Security Council members in condemning the strike.
Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea described the operation as “counterproductive” and said it “does not advance Israel or America’s goals“, while emphasizing the importance of de-escalation and support for Qatar, a key mediator in Gaza ceasefire negotiations.
For a Security Council statement to be issued, all 15 members must sign off on the text. The United States has historically shielded Israel from statements of condemnation by not endorsing them, but on Thursday, it opted not to veto the joint statement.
France’s Ambassador to the UN, Jérôme Bonna­font, condemned Israel’s strikes as a violation of international law. He stressed that “a political solution based on the two-State framework is essential,” emphasizing recognition of a sovereign Palestinian state with reformed governance.
 






UK ambassador Dame Barbara Woodward said: “We wholly condemn the strikes on Qatar which will do nothing to deliver peace in the Middle East, or to help safeguard Israel’s long-term security.”
 






Trade barbs
But Israel’s UN Amba­ssador, Danny Danon, made no effort to read the room. Instead, he underscored the double standards of those Western allies who criticised Tel Aviv’s action.
Drawing parallels to the US operation that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan, Danon said: “When bin Laden was eliminated in Pakistan, the question asked was not why target a terrorist on foreign soil… The same question must be asked today. There’s no immunity for bin Laden and there can be no immunity for Hamas.”
He also turned on France and Britain, recalling French action against terrorists in Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso, and Mau­ritania, and London’s airstrikes against the Islamic State militant group in Iraq and Syria.
 






At that, Pakistan immediately exercised its right of reply, with Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Ifti­khar Ahmad rejecting the analogy as “unacceptable” and “ludicrous” and accusing Israel of attempting to deflect attention from its own “illegal act­ions and violations of int­ernational law“.
“It [Israel] is an occupier, a serial violator of the UN Charter and international law, that threatens the international community, humanitarian org­anisations, and even the United Nations itself — and does so with impunity,” Mr Ahmad said. “Despite being the aggressor, it pretends to be the victim. But today, it stands fully exposed.”
 






Following Pakistan’s res­ponse, the Israeli amb­assador returned to the floor, accusing Pakistan and others of applying double standards.
In its weekly briefing on Friday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office also condemned the Israeli aggression against Qatar and expr­essed complete solidarity with the brotherly state, calling on the international community to hold Israel accountable for this unprovoked and unlawful aggression.
Qatari PM’s address
In his address under Rule 37, Qatar’s prime minister strongly deno­unced the Israeli attack in Doha. He said the attack targeted a residential compound allocated for negotiating teams, housing Hamas representatives and their families, and terrorised residents.
“It is a violation of the UN Member State’s sovereignty,” he said. “Israel — led by bloodthirsty extr­emists — has gone beyond any borders, any limitation when it comes to behaviour among states and individuals.
Have you heard of any state that is attacking the mediator this way? A state that is attacking the negotiating teams that are hosted by Qatar?”

The Green Shirts will face India next on Sunday — the arch-rivals will clash in a geopolitically-charged contest in Dubai. It will be the first cricket match between the sides since four days of military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May.
Player of the match Mohammad Haris top-scored with 66 of 43 deliveries after being sent at his preferred position of one down for a change after a string of failures down the order in the tri-series.
Oman restricted the Pakistani batters to 160-7 after the Green Shirts were 85-1 at the halfway mark of the first innings.
However, their batting reply fell apart against the quality of the Pakistani bowling attack — getting bowled out for a paltry 67 on a typical Dubai wicket.
Speaking after the match, skipper Salman Ali Agha said: “With the bat we still need to work [to improve], but the bowling was outstanding — I’m very happy with them as a bowling unit.”
Talking about the next match against India, Salman said that his side was playing good cricket and if they execute their plans they could beat any team.
 






Speaking at the post-match presser, Haris said the pitch played better than the Sharjah pitch as the ball spun less.
“I worked with the batting coach on my game, and am continuing to work on my calmness while batting and how to tackle spin,” he said.
Saim Ayub was the first to fall for the Green Team in the first innings when pacer Shah Faisal trapped him lbw on the third ball of the innings — the opening pair failing to get a good start again.
Opener Sahibzada Farhan was given a reprieve in the very next over when he was dropped at point off the bowling of left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed.
Haris went after spinner Aamir Kaleem in his very first over — taking 16 off the 6th over with two boundaries and a six as Pakistan ended the powerplay at 47-1.
Haris’s 50 came up with a huge six over the midwicket boundary off the bowling of Sufyan Mehmood — taking 32 deliveries to reach his second 50-plus score in T20Is.
Pakistan were 85-1 at the halfway mark of the innings, with both Haris and Farhan set at the crease on a pitch that did not spin prodigiously across both innings.
 






However, Kaleem got a chance at redemption when he caught Farhan in the very next over off his bowling — after dropping him earlier in the innings when he had scored only 2.
The left-arm spinner continued on his redemption arc as he got the well-set Haris and skipper Salman off consecutive deliveries in the 13th over.
Haris got bowled while attempting a switch hit off Kaleem, while Salman hit a full-toss straight to deep mid-wicket — the Pakistani skipper getting out for a golden duck.
Kaleem ended with figures of 3-31 and was ably supported by his fellow left-arm spinner Ahmed — who conceded just 17 runs of his quota of 4 overs.
The duo kept the Pakistani batters in check through the middle overs after the loss of Salman’s wicket.
Hassan Nawaz was the next man to fall for the Green Shirts as he got caught at the cover boundary off a slower ball by the Dir-born Faisal.
Player of the match in their win against Afghanistan — Mohammad Nawaz brought the momentum back to the Green Shirts’ innings — hitting 3 boundaries in the first five balls that he faced.
However, Oman’s bowlers did not let the match get away from their hands — keeping Pakistan from getting a huge total in the first innings.
Oman’s chase unravels
Oman lost their first wicket courtesy a carrom ball by Saim after he bowled the opposition captain Jatinder Singh in the second over of the innings.
After scoring multiple boundaries off Shaheen Afridi’s second over — first innings hero Kaleem got out lbw trying to sweep Saim in the 4th over.
Oman managed to reach 40-2 at the end of the powerplay, but after losing Mohammad Nadeem to what was essentially a bouncer by left-arm leg-spinner Sufyan Moqeem — their innings unravelled — getting bowled for 67 in 16.4 overs.
The Pakistan bowlers shared the wickets with Sufyan, Saim and Faheem picking up two wickets each.
 


Captain Salman, speaking at the toss, had said: “The team has been playing good cricket for the last two to three months and we will look to continue that form.”
There were no changes in the playing eleven from the team that won against Afghanistan.
The Green Shirts were clear favourites going into this encounter against Oman, who are ranked 20th in the International Cricket Council T20I rankings and last played competitive T20I matches more than six months ago in February — when they lost thrice in a row to the USA.
White-ball head coach Mike Hesson dismissed concerns about the national squad’s batting performance on Thursday ahead of the upcoming clash with India.
Questioned during a pre-match press conference in Dubai about the team’s batting performance and judgement, Hesson said he was “not quite sure” where the concerns were arising from, saying the team had played against the “best wrist spin attack” in the world and won by over 70 runs against Afghanistan in the tri-series final.
The eight-nation T20 tournament began on Tuesday with Afghanistan beating Hong Kong by 94 runs. India crushed the hosts, the UAE, by nine wickets on Wednesday.
Pakistan, India, Oman and UAE are in Group A, while Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, Hong Kong and Bangladesh form Group B.
The top two teams from each Group will qualify for the Super Four stage.
The top two teams will then play the September 28 final in Dubai.

So, Pakistan fans, don’t get too excited. I hope most of you won’t, since, traditionally, this team keeps finding new ways to disappoint us.
With the emotions now set aside, let’s “objectively” look into what Pakistan came up with in their Asia Cup opener at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday.
The boys in green, as expected from them, swept aside the Omanis with utter disdain, continuing the pattern of big sides staying unchallenged by the minnows in the tournament.
Like the good old days, the Pakistan bowlers starred. It was a display of what turned out to be unplayable spin bowling for Oman on a slow, sluggish, sticky surface — on which Pakistan failed to consistently put bat on ball as well, but more on that later.
Spin-stars
Pakistan are ripe with spin resources. They may not be the best in the Asia Cup with Afghanistan and India boasting the services of some proven pros, but they showed they are getting there with a top show against Oman.
Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha put so-called part-timer Saim Ayub into the attack right away, and his sly “mystery” spin stuck into the surface, deviated and left the Oman top-order bamboozled, adding weight to Saim’s claim into Pakistan’s XI despite his inconsistency with that bat.
 






With Oman openers Aamir Kaleem and Jatinder Singh trapped lbw and cleaned up respectively by Saim, Salman had three more proper spin options.
He called in Sufyan Moqeem — the left-arm wrist-spinner, having consolidated his place in the side at least for the matches taking place on slow surfaces.
 
 

But Sufyan didn’t rely on a typical slow delivery to get his first wicket, bouncing out Mohammad Nadeem with a surprise short-ball, reminding us all of former Pakistan star Shahid Afridi.
Sufyan’s second hunt was purely Salman’s brilliance at slip; the skipper chewing a chewing gum, composed as ever, acting as if nothing happened after having dived to his left to take a blinder to dismiss a well-set Hammad Mirza.
In between both dismissals, Pakistan’s “best spinner in the world” according to head coach Mike Hesson, Mohammad Nawaz continued his top form after making his comeback in the side, chipping in with Sufiyan Mehmood’s wicket.
On a wicket like this, the fast bowlers had to go untested, but the pace pairing of Shaheen Shah Afridi and Faheem Ashraf accounted for three wickets.
Haris fireworks
While Pakistan were destructive with the ball, they were far from impressive with the bat. It can be argued that the pitch didn’t support batters as much. But again, it was just Oman.
Their start was horrendous; Saim falling on the first ball, going across the line of the ball for an audacious attempt to hit it out of the park. Backed for his potential impact, the left-hander — no matter how highly-rated — is struggling with the consistency part of his game. Saim averages less than 25 in the last 15 outings, since Hesson took charge of the team.
What Saim lacked, however, was somehow made up by another batter under the press; Mohammad Haris. The flamboyant right-hander from Peshawar has been a subject of debate since he first showed up in the Pakistan colours for his perceived “irresponsible” approach. He was pushed down to number six in the recent tri-series, which Salman said was a “sacrifice”.
Batting struggles
But Haris, in his preferred number three position, bounced back with a blistering half-century and a man-of-the-match award. He did not smash every ball for his 43-ball 66.
The 24-year-old’s seven fours were mainly about manoeuvring the gaps with brilliance, while his strong slog-sweep was incredibly effective for his three sixes.
At one point, it looked like the batters on the other end — Sahibzada Farhan and Fakhar Zaman — were doing their best to help Haris post a big score, but that seemed to slow Pakistan down, and the pressure that heaped upon the batters came into play later on.
After Haris played Aamir Kaleem onto his stumps attempting a rash reverse-sweep, Salman fell on a dolly before Fakhar and the incoming Hasan Nawaz added to Pakistan’s dot-balls, more than 30 of them.
The pair failed to go hard against the Oman bowlers, raising concerns over Pakistan’s prospects against a stronger attack of archrivals India, whom they face on Sunday. Fakhar being asked to bat at number four was also an interesting decision by the Pakistan management after the experienced pro was brought back to the opening spot in the recent series.
Nawaz’s form with the bat was evident down the order, the left-hander putting the pitch out of the question and finding gaps brilliantly for his 19 off 10.
On to India
While Pakistan crushed Oman by a huge 93-run margin, they would still need to up their game for the India clash.
To be played in Dubai again, India will arrive for the high-octane clash with the likes of spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakarvarty, the kind of quality Pakistan would require a special show against.
The bowlers, too, would have to prove that they can be as good against the T20 World Champions as they were against Oman.</p><small>2025-09-12 19:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12234508fdc9d7b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941489/imran-bushras-legal-team-approaches-un-special-rapporteur-on-torture-for-help-in-halting-ill-treatment' target='_blank'><strong>Imran, Bushra’s legal team approaches UN special rapporteur on torture for help in halting ‘ill treatment’</strong></a><br><p>The legal team of PTI founder Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi has approached United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment Dr Alice J Edwards to urge the Pakistani government to cease the alleged mistreatment of the couple.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. The PTI has regularly raised concerns about his health and that of the former first lady.
Earlier this week, the party announced moving a petition before the Supreme Court regarding her health. In a statement, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram claimed that prison authorities were obstructing Bushra Bibi’s treatment despite her deteriorating health in defiance of court orders.
Last month, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) seeking Imran’s monthly medical examinations from Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital. It cited concerns over possible health complications for the 72-year-old founder of the party, who has reportedly lost weight during his detention.
In a post on X today, PTI leader Zulfi Bukhari said two formal urgent appeals were submitted to the UN special rapporteur on torture on Imran’s behalf by his sons — Sulaiman Khan and Kasim Khan — and on Bushra Bibi’s behalf by her sister.
 






A press release by international law firm Perseus Strategies said: “The filings request her to investigate their cases and press the Pakistani government to cease any further torture or ill-treatment of Mr and Mrs Khan immediately.”
 
 

It said the couple’s international legal team had previously secured a judgment from the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UWGAD), finding Imran’s detention arbitrary, in violation of international law, politically motivated and calling for his immediate release.
“Both appeals detail a pattern of severe abuses in detention, including prolonged solitary confinement, physical abuse, denial of medical care, contaminated food and the persistent denial of access to legal counsel and family that together amount to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment.
“The filings emphasise that these acts violate Pakistan’s obligations under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), and they urge the special rapporteur to act swiftly to protect the physical and mental integrity of Mr and Mrs Khan,” the press release said.
It pointed out that Imran now faced a “cumulative 14-year prison sentence on fabricated charges”.
It added that despite the UNWGAD’s finding that his detention was arbitrary and intended to bar him from political life, Imran remained imprisoned under “inhuman conditions”.
 
 

“Mr Khan is currently confined at Adiala Jail in a tiny isolation cell with no natural light, an open toilet under 24-hour CCTV surveillance, and has endured severe sleep deprivation, extreme heat due to power cuts, grossly inadequate food and water, and other harsh conditions. He is also held at times in solitary confinement for 22 hours or more a day with no access to exercise or meaningful human contact.
“Mrs Khan, the former first lady of Pakistan, has likewise been targeted with politically motivated charges and sentenced to seven years in prison. Since her detention in 2024, she has been subjected to conditions of detention that amount to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, including being served food contaminated with hydrochloric acid, confinement in unsanitary and insect-infested cells, denial of medical care and long periods of isolation. Her imprisonment is part of a campaign to break both her and her husband, and to apply psychological pressure on Imran Khan by targeting his wife.”
The press release quoted Jared Genser, international counsel to the couple, as saying that neither of them should be in prison in the first place, “let alone be subjected to torture and ill treatment”.
He further said: “This combination of illegal detention and horrific mistreatment is intolerable under international law, and the United Nations and governments worldwide must act now to protect their rights and secure their release.”
 
 

The law firm said that Imran had received “international recognition for the abuses he is facing while imprisoned”, saying that Amnesty International had warned of health risks given his age and conditions, and the US State Department had publicly stressed the importance of ensuring his safety in custody.
The firm said the UN special rapporteur on torture reported to the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) and had the authority to intervene when credible allegations of torture were presented, adding that the mandate included communicating with governments to demand they respect the right to physical and mental integrity of detainees, conducting fact-finding visits and submitting reports to both the UNHRC and the UN General Assembly.
“The United Nations has already found Imran Khan’s detention to be arbitrary and Mrs Khan’s imprisonment rests on equally spurious charges.
“Their continued solitary confinement, denial of adequate medical care and exposure to contaminated food all violate Pakistan’s binding obligations under international law. The government of Pakistan should take immediate steps to release Mr and Mrs Khan and improve the conditions of detention for all those still detained,” the press release quoted Jacob Bogart, international counsel to the couple, as saying.
The law firm said that the continued “arbitrary detention” of Imran and Bushra Bibi “threatens to deepen social and political divisions at a time when Pakistan faces a myriad internal and external challenges”. It argued that their release was “imperative not only because of the grave injustices they face, but for the sake of Pakistan’s stability and democratic progress”.
The firm pleaded that the UN should not turn away from the case and “should instead stand with Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi and democracy in Pakistan”.
The press release also quoted Bukhari as saying that in the filing the urgent appeals, “we are making clear that Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi are not forgotten.
“They are enduring unlawful imprisonment and degrading treatment, but they remain symbols of courage and peaceful resistance. The world must not look away — silence only emboldens those who seek to crush democracy in Pakistan.”
Separately, Kasim said his father was in prison because “he stood up for democracy”.
Reiterating his previous concerns about his father’s state, he said Imran was “held in solitary confinement, denied access to his doctors and restricted from meeting his lawyers and family.
“At the same time, members of his family and thousands of his supporters have been abducted or dragged before military courts. This is not justice — it is political revenge.
“Pakistan’s democracy is at stake, and I call on all who believe in human rights and democracy to stand with us so that the people’s voice is heard and the rule of law is restored.”

The text was adopted by 142 votes in favour, 10 against — including Israel and key ally the United States — and 12 abstentions. It rebukes Hamas and demands that it surrender its weapons.
 






Although Israel has criticised UN bodies for nearly two years over their failure to rebuke Hamas’s attack on October 7, 2023, the declaration, presented by France and Saudi Arabia, leaves no ambiguity.
Formally called the New York Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of the Question of Palestine and the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, the text states that “Hamas must free all hostages” and that the UN General Assembly (UNGA) condemns “the attacks committed by Hamas against civilians on October 7”.
It also calls for “collective action to end the war in Gaza, to achieve a just, peaceful and lasting settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict based on the effective implementation of the two-state solution”.
The declaration, which was already endorsed by the Arab League and co-signed in July by 17 UN member states, including several Arab countries, also goes further than rebuking Hamas, seeking to fully excise it from a role in Gaza.
“In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international engagement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Palestinian State,” the declaration states.
 
 

The vote precedes an upcoming UN summit co-chaired by Riyadh and Paris on September 22 in New York, in which French President Emmanuel Macron has promised to formally recognise the Palestinian state.
‘Shield’ against criticism
“The fact that the General Assembly is finally backing a text that condemns Hamas directly is significant” even if “Israelis will say it is far too little, far too late”, Richard Gowan, UN director at the International Crisis Group, told AFP.
“Now at least states supporting the Palestinians can rebuff Israeli accusations that they implicitly condone Hamas,” he said, adding that it “offers a shield against Israeli criticism”.
In addition to Macron, several other leaders have announced their intent to formally recognise the Palestinian state during the UN summit.
The gestures are seen as a means of increasing pressure on Israel to end the fighting in Gaza.
The New York Declaration includes discussion of a “deployment of a temporary international stabilisation mission” to the battered region under the mandate of the UN Security Council, aiming to support the Palestinian civilian population and facilitate security responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority.
Around three-quarters of the 193 UN member states recognise the Palestinian state proclaimed in 1988 by the exiled Palestinian leadership.
However, after two years of fighting have ravaged the Gaza Strip, in addition to expanded Israeli settlements in the West Bank and the stated desire by Israeli officials to annex the territory, fears have been growing that the existence of an independent Palestinian state will soon become impossible.
Israel’s devastating retaliatory offensive has killed at least 64,656 Palestinians, most of them civilians. Israel has been facing growing international criticism over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza caused by its offensive with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts already declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.
“We are going to fulfil our promise that there will be no Palestinian state,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed on Thursday.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, meanwhile, may be prevented from visiting New York for the UN summit after US authorities said they would deny him a visa.</p><small>2025-09-12 18:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12220519afa0ff9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941449/nepal-ex-chief-justice-sushila-karki-becomes-pm-after-protests' target='_blank'><strong>Nepal ex-chief justice Sushila Karki becomes PM after protests</strong></a><br><p>Nepal’s former chief justice Sushila Karki was sworn in on Friday to lead the transition as the country’s next prime minister after deadly anti-corruption protests ousted the government.
The 73-year-old Karki, Nepal’s first woman chief justice, was sworn into office by President Ram Chandra Paudel, after the previous prime minister quit on Tuesday as parliament was set ablaze.
“Congratulations! We wish you success, wish the country success,” Paudel said to Karki after the small ceremony in the presidential palace, attended by diplomats and some former leaders.
The Himalayan nation of 30 million people was plunged into chaos this week after security forces tried to crush rallies by young anti-corruption protesters.
At least 51 people were killed in the worst violence since the end of a civil war and the abolition of the monarchy in 2008.
The military took back control of the streets on Wednesday, enforcing a curfew.
The appointment of the judge, known for her independence, comes after two days of intense negotiations by army chief General Ashok Raj Sigdel and Paudel, including with representatives from “Gen Z”, the loose umbrella title of the youth protest movement.
Thousands of young activists had used the online app Discord to debate the next steps — and name Karki as their choice of next leader.
Karki, dressed in a red sari dress, took the oath but did not make a further speech. She smiled and bowed with her hands pressed together repeatedly in traditional greetings.
“It is a moment of victory … finally, the power vacuum has ended,” said Amrita Ban, a Gen Z protester.
“We did it,” key youth protest group Hami Nepal posted on Instagram, calling for unity.
“Honour the lives of those who sacrificed themselves for this moment”.

Presidential press adviser Kiran Pokharel told AFP that “a council of ministers will be formed after, and other processes will be taken from there”.
Known for her insistence on integrity, the 73-year-old has often spoken about the need for transparency and independence in a judiciary frequently under intense political pressure.
Karki emerged as the leading candidate by many “Gen Z” representatives — the loose umbrella title of the protest movement.
She told Nepali media that the Gen Z protesters had told her that “they believe in me” to lead for “a short time for the purpose of doing elections”.
“She is a credible choice to lead the interim government,” Anil Kumar Sinha, a former justice of the supreme court who worked with Karki, told AFP.
“Her integrity has never been in doubt, and she is not someone who can be intimidated or easily influenced. She is courageous and not swayed by pressure.”
‘In favour of youth’
In a speech broadcast on Nepali media earlier this year, she spoke of ingrained corruption.
“We see it everywhere but we don’t speak — now we need the youth to speak up, take the lead and stand in elections,” she said.
“What I have seen in the last 35 years does not work, I am 100 per cent in favour of youth coming forward.”
Her tenure as chief justice, from 2016 to 2017, was brief but significant — challenging gender stereotypes and facing down politicians over corruption.
Karki came of age in a society where women rarely entered the legal profession.
Born in 1952 in Biratnagar, an industrial town in eastern Nepal, she earned degrees in political science in India and in law in Kathmandu.
She began her career as a lawyer in 1979, and quickly gained a reputation as a fearless advocate, often taking up cases others avoided.
Defiant
In 2012, Karki was one of two presiding Supreme Court judges who jailed a serving government minister for corruption — a first at the time for Nepal in its battle against a culture of graft.
In 2017, the government tried to impeach her as chief justice after she overturned its choice for chief of police.
The United Nations called the impeachment “politically motivated” and the move was blocked. She stepped down from the post at her retirement.
Nepal emerged from a brutal decade-long Maoist insurgency in 2006, and in 2008, the end of the country’s 240-year-old Hindu monarchy.
The transformation to a federal state was marred by political infighting and successive governments have dragged their feet on bringing perpetrators of abuses committed during the civil war to justice.
But it was under Karki’s watch as chief justice that a court in 2017 sentenced three soldiers to 20 years in jail for the murder of a teenage girl, at the time only the second conviction for crimes committed during the war.
She will be Nepal’s first woman prime minister, but not its first woman leader — Bidya Devi Bhandari held the largely ceremonial role of president for two terms from 2015 to 2023.
‘Make a better Nepal’
The army patrolled the largely quiet streets of the capital, Kathmandu, for a third day today after the protests and nationwide chaos that included a mass breakout of prisoners.
“I was very afraid and stayed locked inside my home with family and didn’t leave,” said Naveen Kumar Das, a painter-decorator in his mid-40s. He was among many ordinary residents of Kathmandu who took advantage of a brief lifting of the curfew in the morning to stock up on supplies.
Food stores, tea stalls and pharmacies bustled with customers after people spent days inside.
“It was a really tense time and we just stayed indoors,” said Laxmi Thapa, 32, on a motorbike as her husband filled its fuel tank. “We came out as things have improved.”
At least 21 protesters were among those killed, mainly on Monday during a police crackdown on demonstrations against corruption and poor governance that was sparked by a ban on social media.
Protesters set the parliament, major government buildings and a Hilton Hotel on fire on Tuesday. KP Sharma Oli, 73, resigned as prime minister, and the army then took charge of the streets.
Nepal’s army said today that it had recovered more than 100 guns looted in the uprising, during which protesters were seen brandishing automatic rifles.
More than 12,500 prisoners who escaped from jails across the country during the chaos “are still at large”, police spokesman Binod Ghimire told AFP.

Protests fed into longstanding economic woes in Nepal, where more than two-fifths of people are aged between 16 and 40. A fifth of people aged 15-24 are unemployed, according to the World Bank, with GDP per capita just $1,447.
Discussions are still heated among Gen Z ranks as they seek a radical political transition. James Karki, 24, who was among the protesters, said he was hopeful for change.
“We started this movement so we could make a better Nepal,” he said. “And I am positive that the army will listen.“</p><small>2025-09-12 17:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12215000c9807f9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941482/brazils-bolsonaro-sentenced-to-27-years-after-landmark-coup-plot-conviction' target='_blank'><strong>Brazil’s Bolsonaro sentenced to 27 years after landmark coup plot conviction</strong></a><br><p>Former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro was sentenced on Thursday to 27 years and three months in prison, hours after being convicted of plotting a coup to remain in power after losing the 2022 election, dealing a powerful rebuke to one of the world’s most prominent far-right populist leaders.
The conviction ruling by a panel of five justices on Brazil’s supreme court, who also agreed on the sentence, made the 70-year-old Bolsonaro the first former president in the country’s history to be convicted for attacking democracy, and drew disapproval from the Trump administration.
“This criminal case is almost a meeting between Brazil and its past, its present and its future,” Justice Carmen Lucia said before her vote to convict Bolsonaro, referring to a history checkered with military coups and attempts to overthrow democracy.
There was ample evidence that Bolsonaro, who is currently under house arrest, acted “with the purpose of eroding democracy and institutions”, she added.
Four of the five judges voted to convict the former president of five crimes: taking part in an armed criminal organisation, attempting to violently abolish democracy, organising a coup and damaging government property and protected cultural assets.
The conviction of Bolsonaro, a former army captain who never hid his admiration for the military dictatorship that killed hundreds of Brazilians between 1964 and 1985, follows legal condemnations for other far-right leaders this year, including France’s Marine Le Pen and the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte.
It may further enrage Bolsonaro’s close ally, United States President Donald Trump, who had called the case a “witch hunt” and, in retaliation, hit Brazil with tariff hikes, sanctions against the presiding judge, and the revocation of visas for most of the high court justices.
Asked about the conviction on Thursday, Trump again praised Bolsonaro, calling the verdict “a terrible thing”. “I think it’s very bad for Brazil,” he added.
As he watched his father’s conviction from the US, Brazilian Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro told Reuters he expected Trump to consider imposing further sanctions on Brazil and its high court justices.
US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X that the court had “unjustly ruled”, adding, “The United States will respond accordingly to this witch hunt.”
 






Brazil’s Foreign Ministry issued a statement calling Rubio’s comment a threat that “attacks Brazilian authority and ignores the facts and the compelling evidence in the records”. The ministry said that Brazilian democracy would not be intimidated by the US.
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also said he does not fear new sanctions from the US in an interview to local TV channel Band, hours before Bolsonaro’s conviction was confirmed.
The verdict was not unanimous, with Justice Luiz Fux on Wednesday breaking with his peers by acquitting the former president of all charges and questioning the court’s jurisdiction.
That single vote could open a path to challenges to the ruling, which could push the trial’s conclusion closer to the October 2026 presidential election. Bolsonaro has repeatedly said he will be a candidate in that election despite being barred from running for office.
Bolsonaro’s lawyers said in a statement that the sentencing was absurdly excessive and that they would file the appropriate appeals.
From the back benches to the presidency
The conviction of Bolsonaro marks the nadir in his trajectory from the back benches of Congress to his forging of a powerful conservative coalition that tested the limits of the country’s young democratic institutions.
His political journey began in the 1980s on the Rio de Janeiro city council after a brief career as an army paratrooper. He went on to serve nearly three decades as a congressman in Brasilia, where he quickly became known for his defence of authoritarian-era policies.
In one interview, he argued that Brazil would only change “on the day that we break out in civil war here and do the job that the military regime didn’t do: killing 30,000”.
Long dismissed as a fringe player, he later refined his message to play up anti-corruption and pro-family values themes.
He found fertile ground as mass protests erupted across Brazil in 2014 and 2015 amid the sprawling “Car Wash” graft scandal that implicated hundreds of politicians, including President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose own conviction was later annulled.
Anti-establishment anger opened the path for his successful 2018 presidential run, with dozens of far-right and conservative lawmakers elected on his coattails. They have reshaped Congress into an enduring obstacle to Lula’s progressive agenda.
Bolsonaro’s presidency was marked by intense scepticism of vaccines during the pandemic and an embrace of illegal mining and cattle ranching in the Amazon rainforest, where deforestation climbed.
As he faced a tough reelection campaign against Lula in 2022 — which Lula went on to win — Bolsonaro’s comments took on an increasingly messianic quality, raising concerns about his willingness to accept the results.
“I have three alternatives for my future: being arrested, killed or victory,” he said, in remarks to a meeting of evangelical leaders in 2021. “No man on Earth will threaten me.”
In 2023, Brazil’s electoral court barred him from public office until 2030 for venting unfounded claims about Brazil’s electronic voting system.
Lula’s Institutional Relations Minister Gleisi Hoffmann said that Bolsonaro’s conviction “ensures that no one dares again to attack the rule of law or the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box”.
Protecting democracy
Bolsonaro’s conviction and its durability will be a powerful test for the strategy that Brazil’s highest-ranking judges have adopted to protect the country’s democracy against what they describe as dangerous attacks by the far-right.
Their targets have included social media platforms they accused of spreading disinformation about the electoral system, as well as politicians and activists who have attacked the court. Sending the former president and his allies to jail for planning a coup reflects a culmination of that polarising strategy.
The cases have largely been led by the commanding figure of Justice Alexandre de Moraes, appointed to the court by a conservative president in 2017, whose hardball approach to Bolsonaro and his allies has been celebrated by the left and denounced by the right as political persecution.
“They want to get me out of the political game next year,” Bolsonaro told Reuters in a recent interview, referring to the 2026 election in which Lula is likely to seek a fourth term. “Without me in the race, Lula could beat anyone.”
The historic significance of the case goes beyond the former president and his movement, said Carlos Fico, a historian who studies Brazil’s military at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.
The supreme court also ruled to convict seven of Bolsonaro’s allies, including five military officers.
The verdict marks the first time since Brazil became a republic almost 140 years ago that military officials have been punished for attempting to overthrow democracy.
“The trial is a wake-up call for the armed forces,” Fico said. “They must be realising that something has changed, given that there was never any punishment before, and now there is.”</p><small>2025-09-12 17:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623387-karachi-needs-at-least-15000-buses-to-meet-daily-demand' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi needs 'at least 15,000 buses' to meet daily demand</strong></a><br><p>

“We got him,” Cox told reporters.
The suspect, identified as Tyler Robinson, had confessed to a family friend or “implied that he had committed the murder” to that friend and that person in turn had contacted the Washington County sheriff’s office on Thursday.
A family member interviewed by investigators said Robinson had become more political recently and spoke in a disparaging manner about Kirk, Cox told reporters. Robinson was taken into custody on Thursday night, about 33 hours after Kirk’s murder, Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Kash Patel said at the press conference.
Kirk, a close ally of US President Donald Trump, was killed by a single bullet as he spoke onstage at an outdoor amphitheatre at Utah Valley University on Wednesday.
Previously, US investigators said they had found the bolt-action rifle believed to have been used to kill Kirk and released images of a person of interest.
Investigators spoke to Robinson’s roommate, who showed them comments Robinson had made on Discord, a chat and streaming platform popular with gamers, discussing retrieving a rifle from a drop point and then leaving the rifle in a bush wrapped in a towel. This matched the description of the gun that authorities recovered after the shooting in a wooded area near campus.
Ammunition found at the scene had been inscribed, Cox said.

The messages on the casing included: “What’s this”; “Oh, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Bella Ciao, Ciao”; “If you read this, you are gay, LMAO” and “Hey fascist, catch!” Cox told reporters.
Trump earlier said that authorities had captured the suspect.
“I think, with a high degree of certainty, we have him in custody,” Trump said on Fox News programme ‘Fox and Friends’. “Everybody did a great job; we worked with the local police, the governor.”
The president claimed that the suspect was turned in “by somebody very close to him”, noting that the authorities had “very good pictures but not great, not perfect”.
“Somebody very close to him said, ‘Oh, it’s him’,” Trump said. “Essentially, they went to a US marshal, and the person involved was involved with law enforcement and a person of faith. The father convinced the son, ‘This is it’.”
 






Additionally, Trump backed a call by Cox to give the suspect the death penalty if the suspect is found guilty.
“This trial will start in two, three, [or] four years. In certain places that do it differently, they have what’s called ‘quick trial’. You have a fast trial and fast verdict,” the president said.
  @dawn.today A suspect in the fatal shooting of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk at a Utah university has been taken into custody, US President Donald Trump said on Friday, ending an intense manhunt that followed what Trump described as a "heinous assassination." Kirk's killer had eluded police and federal agents for more than 24 hours after Wednesday's shooting, in which a sniper fired a single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, during an appearance at Utah Valley University in Orem. "I think we have him," Trump told the "Fox and Friends" show in an interview, adding that a person who knows the suspect had turned him in. "I think with a high degree of certainty we have him in custody." Via Reuters #DawnToday ♬ original sound - Dawn.com  
“If he’s guilty, we’ll need to keep him, feed him, take care of him … like for 50 years,” Trump added. “In Utah you have the death penalty. The governor … is very intent on the death penalty in this case, and he should be.”
The father-of-two used his audiences on TikTok, Instagram and YouTube to build support for anti-immigration policies, outspoken Christianity and gun ownership, and to spread carefully edited clips of his interactions during debates at his many college events, according to AFP.
Kirk, a well-connected activist, author and podcast host, helped build support for Trump and the Republican Party among younger voters.
Kirk was the co-founder and president of the conservative student group Turning Point USA and appeared at Utah Valley on Wednesday as part of a planned 15-event “American Comeback Tour” of US college campuses. His killing stirred outrage and denunciations of political violence from Democrats, Republicans and foreign governments.
Kirk had 5.2 million followers on X and hosted a popular podcast and radio programme, ‘The Charlie Kirk Show’.
Additionally, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau warned on Thursday that Washington may take action against foreigners “praising, rationalising, or making light” of Kirk’s killing, adding he had directed consular officials to take appropriate action.
“In light of yesterday’s horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said in a post on social media platform X.
“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”

According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the IBO was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Fitna al Hindustan.
The state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan. It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
“During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” said the ISPR.
The statement added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the dead terrorists, who remained actively involved in terrorist activities in the area.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi commended the security forces for the successful operation.
“Pakistan’s security forces thwarted the nefarious designs of Indian-backed terrorists,” he wrote on X. “I pay tribute to the security forces for their successful operation against Indian-sponsored terrorists.”
 






A day prior, security forces killed 19 terrorists in three separate operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, according to an ISPR statement.
Pakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.</p><small>2025-09-12 15:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623374-four-terrorists-belonging-to-indian-proxy-neutralised-in-mastung' target='_blank'><strong>Four terrorists belonging to Indian proxy neutralised in Mastung</strong></a><br><p>

On Thursday, Justice Dogar had warned Mazari of a contempt of court case and was reported to have gone as far as passing warning remarks along the lines of “getting a hold of her”.
Today, he provided a clarification regarding the matter, saying that his words were presented “out of context”.
During the hearing of a case on a plea filed by a citizen named Abdul Jabbar — who sought the removal of his name from the Exit Control List — Justice Dogar addressed the matter, saying that Mazari was “just like a daughter” to him, and he was only explaining things to her yesterday.
“Being the chief justice and an elder, I was trying to make her understand.”
He went on to say that his remarks were presented out of context and “a storm brewed up”.
The IHC CJ maintained that during his exchange with Mazari, he had told her that she could disagree with his decisions, but she should have avoided making her criticism personal.
At one point, he reiterated: “I was explaining to her just as (I would) to a child, but she was not understanding. She was repeatedly mentioning fundamental rights. Does this court not have any fundamental rights?”
Moreover, it has been reported that during yesterday’s exchange, Justice Dogar also addressed Mazari’s husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying: “Hadi sahib, make her understand; if I get hold of her someday …”
However, he clarified today that he did not say anything along the lines of “getting hold of” Mazari.
“I did not say that I will get hold of her, [but] this [reported remark] is being circulated since yesterday. Hadi sahib was standing [there], so I asked him to take her away or I would initiate contempt of court proceedings.”
Later, Chattha maintained in a post on X that the judge had in fact made the reported remarks.
 






He accused the judge of lying and misconduct before referring to Justice’s Dogar remarks from today’s hearing.
The IHC CJ said during today’s hearing that in case of contempt of court proceedings, Mazari’s career would suffer.
Reacting to that, Chattha said Justice Dogar was “not eligible to hold judicial office” and that he had held “the entire high court hostage”.
Mazari’s response
Mazari, who is known to be vocal in her criticism of Pakistani authorities, posted on X after yesterday’s hearing that “it is important for CJ IHC to understand that I am not activist Imaan Mazari in his court, I am a lawyer holding a brief for my client and conduct myself according to professional etiquette (and a court should do the same).”
She added that her client’s case “should not suffer because of any grievances a judge may have with her lawyer over the right to freedom of expression in a personal capacity”.
Following Justice Dogar’s clarification today, she again criticised him on X for making “sexist” remarks and accused him of harassing her.
“First, the chief justice misbehaved, harassed me at my workplace and threatened me openly in the court … Today again, he is passing sexist remarks.”
She asserted that she was neither his daughter nor a child. “I am a professional lawyer”.
 






Lawyers condemn
Multiple lawyers’ bodies also issued condemnatory statements today, with the  Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) demanding the removal of Justice Dogar from his post.
In a press release — which Mazari shared on X, thanking the association — the LHCBA said the body’s president, vice president and secretary “strongly condemn” Justice Dogar’s exchange with Mazari.
 






The statement said that lawyers were “officer[s] of the court” and their respect and dignity was to be prioritised just as those of respected judges who were working within the bounds of law and the Constitution.
It added that Justice Dogar’s “dictatorial behaviour is a gross violation of the judge’s code of conduct and it is immensely important to keep any such judge away from court proceedings”.
The LHCBA urged the Supreme Judicial Council — the highest forum responsible for disciplinary proceedings against judges of the superior judiciary — to remove Justice Dogar from his post.
The Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also issued a statement saying that it “strongly condemns the highly inappropriate conduct” of Justice Dogar.
“The association notes with deep concern that instead of maintaining judicial dignity and impartiality, the chief justice resorted to derogatory remarks and threats of contempt proceedings against the counsel. Such behaviour undermines the sanctity of judicial forums, intimidates members of the bar and is contrary to principles of justice,” the statement read.
It emphasised that lawyers had the right to represent their clients “without fear or harassment, and any attempt to suppress this right cannot be tolerated”.
Expressing solidarity with Mazari, the KBA urged the Judicial Commission of Pakistan, Supreme Court and Pakistan Bar Council to take notice of the incident.
“The judiciary must remain above personal remarks and coercive conduct; respect between bar and bench must always be mutual to protect the integrity of our justice system,” the KBA stressed.
 






The Balochistan Bar Council also issued a similar statement as the KBA, calling on the SJC to dismiss Justice Dogar from his post.
 






Separately, a group of female lawyers also became signatories to a condemnation of Justice Dogar’s remarks, terming them “sexist, threatening and unbecoming of a judge”.
The condemnatory statement said Justice Dogar’s remarks “reflect a deeply patriarchal attitude, and the threats are a source of concern. The purpose of contempt laws is to uphold the administration of justice, not for judges to hold a sword over the head of lawyers”.

A statement issued today from the President’s Secretariat said that he was received by Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong and Sichaun Vice Governor Huang Ruixue on arrival at Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport.
Pakistan’s Ambassador to China Khalil Hashmi and Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong were also present to welcome President Zardari.
“During the visit, the president will hold meetings with the Chinese leadership and senior officials to further strengthen Pakistan-China relations, enhance cooperation in diverse fields and advance shared objectives under the All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership,” the statement said.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) had earlier said the president would visit Chengdu, Shanghai and Xinjiang to hold meetings with the provincial leadership.
It said the discussions would encompass bilateral relations, with a particular focus on economic and trade cooperation, CPEC and future connectivity initiatives. The two sides would also exchange views on bilateral cooperation at multilateral fora.
The FO said the visit underscored the tradition of high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China, reflecting the deep commitment of the two countries to strengthen their relations.</p><small>2025-09-12 12:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12154649f8d61fd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941458/pakistan-to-host-next-sco-summit-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to host next SCO summit: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday announced that Pakistan will host the next Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, stating that authorities need to start preparing.
This development comes less than a fortnight after the SCO Summit in Tianjin, China, where Pakistan raised the issue of the Indus Waters Treaty and a joint declaration was issued condemning the attacks on the Jaffar Express, Khuzdar and Pahalgam.
Addressing a ceremony in Islamabad, the PM made the announcement and stated that authorities had to start preparing for the incoming dignitaries.
He did not give a date for the summit.
“We have to start preparing now,” the PM said.“ We need to build accommodation and beautify Islamabad. Tajikistan gave us saplings as a gift. Chairman CDA (Capital Development Authority) and his team are working day and night [to plant them].“
 


Pakistan last hosted the SCO in 2024 for the Council of Heads of Government Summit, where PM Shehbaz called for investing in the region’s collective capacity for connectivity.
A three-day holiday was declared for the summit, which was held amid tight security. Many businesses and routes in the federal capital and its twin city, Rawalpindi were closed due to safety concerns.
Foundation stone for T-Chowk flyover laid
The ceremony was held to mark the laying of the foundation stone of the T-Chowk flyover, which aims to provide relief to the citizens of Islamabad, Rawalpindi and the surrounding area.
“We have laid the foundation stone of this project, which will be a milestone for traffic,” the PM said. “This one-kilometre flyover will give the residents of Islamabad and Rawalpindi relief.”
Lauding the efforts of the interior minister and CDA, who conceived the project, the PM congratulated them on the occasion.
“This will serve the public interest greatly,” he said. “We need to set new benchmarks for work, quality and adherence to timelines. There must be no compromise on quality.”
PM Shehbaz added that the railways and interior ministries are working on a rail project which will connect Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
“I was informed by Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi that there will be another form of transport to serve the public interest in the form of a rail car which connects Islamabad and Rawalpindi,” he stated.
“We already have the metro, and we started a bus service. The CDA introduced EVs,” the PM added. “Once we get the railcar going and set up a track, this project can greatly benefit the citizens of Islamabad and Rawalpindi, as well as commuters from surrounding areas.”
The prime minister urged the relevant authorities to start work on the rail project as soon as possible and said that he would sit down and discuss the project with them.

The FIA is a border control agency which plays an important role in preventing illegal immigration and human trafficking. Its crackdown on human smugglers intensified following the capsizing of a boat carrying illegal immigrants near Greece in December last year.
During a visit to the FIA Headquarters in Islamabad, the delegation was welcomed by FIA Additional Director General Jan Muhammad and received a “comprehensive” briefing on Pakistan’s border management practices.
The head of the Iraqi delegation “reaffirmed Iraq’s commitment to further strengthening cooperation between the border management agencies of both countries,” the press release noted.
 






The briefing included an overview of FIA’s mandate and the work of FIA’s specialised units. “At the Risk Analysis Unit (RAU), the director [of] immigration explained how intelligence-led risk management is being applied to identify and mitigate threats at Pakistan’s borders,” it read.
The delegation visited the forensic laboratory, where the “lab’s crucial role in verifying travel documents, detecting forgery, and supporting litigation in travel-related offences” was highlighted. It also visited the Islamabad International Airport to “witness first-hand the enhancements made under FIA’s next-generation border control systems”.
The delegation was given a detailed briefing on the role of FIA Academy in the capacity building of its personnel and on the operations of the Second Line Border Control in detecting fraudulent travel documents and supporting front-line officers.
The visit was facilitated by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) under the framework of a Danish-funded Rights-Based Border Management project, the press release said.
Earlier this week, the FIA arrested 14 suspects, inc­luding four Iranian nationals, in Balochistan during separate operations targeting human smuggling networks.
In January, 65 FIA officials were blacklisted for posting at any immigration checkpost and anti-human trafficking circles in the country after an inquiry into the Greece boat tragedy.</p><small>2025-09-12 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/09/12150104ef4f372.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1941453/mdcat-postponed-amid-floods-in-punjab-revised-date-issued' target='_blank'><strong>MDCAT postponed amid floods in Punjab, revised date issued</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) has postponed the upcoming Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT) due to the ongoing floods in the country, the Ministry of Health said on Friday.
The decision comes as the country is facing catastrophic floods, which have inundated thousands of villages and displaced millions in Punjab, with flood water now expected to move downstream towards Sindh.
According to a statement issued by the Ministry of Health, “After holding discussions with relevant representatives from all four provinces, AJK (Azad Jammu and Kashmir) and Gilgit-Baltistan, on the instructions of Health Minister Mustafa Kamal, the PMDC has revised the exam date to October 26 (Sunday).”
The PMDC is the national statutory organisation responsible for regulating the standards of medical and dental education throughout the country.
The decision was taken in light of the “difficulties faced by students in the affected areas,“ the statement read.
The exam was previously scheduled to be held on October 5.
The “decision is in the larger interest of the students,” the statement quoted Health Minister Mustafa Kamal as saying.
“The government is committed to providing equal educational opportunities to every student in the country,” he added.
The exam, which in previous years has been marred by delays, is the entry requirement for admission to medical and dental colleges across Pakistan.
Each year, approximately 200,000 candidates take the MDCAT.
This year, the exam will conducted in the following universities across the country: University of Health Sciences, Lahore in Punjab; Sukkur IBA University, Sukkur for Sindh; Khyber Medical University, Peshawar for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Bolan University of Medical and Health Sciences, Quetta for Balochistan; and Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University, Islamabad for Islamabad Capital Territory, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan as well as PMDC’s international venue in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.</p><small>2025-09-12 10:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623328-why-us-should-shift-focus-from-india-to-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Why US should shift focus from India to Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

Incoming ambassador Raimundas Karoblis presented his credentials to President Asif Ali Zardari on September 10, according to the Foreign Office. He will be replacing the outgoing envoy, Dr Riina Kionka.
 






“With over 30 years of experience in diplomacy, international trade, and security, he (Karoblis) previously served as Ambassador of the European Union to Tajikistan from 2022 to 2025,” the statement read.
“Ambassador Karoblis had a distinguished career in Lithuania’s diplomatic service, holding senior positions, including Deputy Minister responsible for EU affairs, foreign trade, and sanctions, as well as Lithuania’s Permanent Representative to the European Union from 2010 to 2015.”
Karoblis also served as the minister of national defence from 2016 to 2020, according to the statement.
The incoming ambassador holds a law degree from Vilnius University and is fluent in Lithuanian and English, but also speaks French and Russian,“ the statement read.
“In his free time, he enjoys cycling, hiking, and exploring cultural activities.”

The sharp exchange took place at an emergency UNSC meeting convened under the agenda item ‘Situation in the Middle East’. The session had been requested by Algeria, Pakistan, and Somalia and was supported by France and the United Kingdom.
Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN, opened his address at the UNSC with a strong condemnation of Israel’s strike, calling it a “brazen and illegal assault” and a violation of Qatar’s sovereignty.
“The brazen and illegal assault is not an isolated incident, rather it is part of a broader and consistent pattern of aggression and violation of international law by Israel that undermines regional peace and stability.”
Ahmad further highlighted that the “Israeli strikes targeted a residential neighbourhood, deliberately endangering civilians, and thus, also constitute a grave breach of the International Humanitarian Law.”
He described the attack as a direct challenge to diplomacy, as it targeted Qatar at a time when delicate negotiations on a Gaza peace deal were reportedly progressing toward a possible breakthrough.
“Striking the territory of a principal mediator and those directly involved in negotiations is a deliberate attempt to sabotage diplomacy, derail peace efforts, and prolong the suffering of civilians,” he said.
Ahmad reaffirmed Pakistan’s solidarity with Qatar, highlighting the recent visit of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar to Doha as a demonstration of Islamabad’s support for the security and sovereignty of the Gulf nation.
“The visit underscores Pakistan’s unwavering support for the security and sovereignty of Qatar and its commitment to peace and stability in the Middle East,” he said.
He condemned Israel’s attack as a flagrant violation of the UN Charter, particularly Article 2(4), which prohibits the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.
 


Ahmad warned that the attack was consistent with Israel’s long record of cross-border military actions in Gaza, Syria, Lebanon, Iran, and Yemen, describing it as “yet another manifestation of [Israel’s] systematic disregard for international law, and its brazen policy of destabilising the region.”
Reading from the Security Council statement adopted earlier in the day, Ahmad highlighted the unanimous condemnation of the strikes in Doha, noting that members had expressed deep regret at the loss of civilian life, underscored the importance of de-escalation, and affirmed support for Qatar’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. The statement also stressed the vital role Qatar continues to play in mediation efforts alongside Egypt and the United States for a ceasefire in Gaza, and called for the release of hostages and the end of the conflict in Gaza.
For his part, Israel’s ambassador initially addressed the UNSC by invoking the US raid that killed Osama bin Laden in Pakistan to justify the strike in Doha.
“When bin Laden was eliminated in Pakistan, the question asked was not why target a terrorist on foreign soil. The question was why was a terrorist given shelter at all. The same question must be asked today. There’s no immunity for bin Laden and there can be no immunity for Hamas,” he said.
At that, Pakistan immediately exercised its right of reply with Ambassador Ahmad rejecting the analogy as “unacceptable, indeed ludicrous” and accusing Israel of attempting to deflect attention from its own “illegal actions and violations of international law“.
“It [Israel] is an occupier, a serial violator of the UN Charter and international law, that threatens the international community, humanitarian organisations, and even the United Nations itself — and does so with impunity,” Ahmad said. “Despite being the aggressor, it pretends to be the victim. But today, it stands fully exposed.”
Ahmad also emphasised Pakistan’s frontline role in counterterrorism.
“The international community is well aware of Pakistan’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. Al Qaeda was largely decimated due to Pakistan’s counterterrorism efforts, and we remain committed to this collective endeavor,” he said, reinforcing that Islamabad’s position was based on facts and international law.
Following Pakistan’s response, the Israeli ambassador returned to the floor, accusing Pakistan and others of applying double standards.
“Maybe he was offended by my words and I apologise for that, but I make sure my speeches stick to facts. And the fact is Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan, and no one condemned the US for that. When other countries attack terrorists, no one condemns them either,” he said.
He added: “You cannot change the fact that 9/11 happened, and you cannot change the fact that Osama bin Laden was in Pakistan and was killed on your territory. When you criticise us — and I’m sure you will continue — think about the standards you apply to your country and the standards you apply to Israel.”
‘We will not be deterred by those who call for war’
Assistant Secretary General for the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific, Mohamed Khaled Khiari, also briefed the Council while Qatar’s prime minister, Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani, participated under Rule 37 of the Council’s provisional rules of procedure.
In his address under Rule 37, Qatar’s prime minister strongly denounced the Israeli attack in Doha. He said the attack targeted a residential compound allocated for negotiating teams, housing Hamas representatives and their families, and terrorised residents.

“It is a violation of the UN Member State’s sovereignty,” he said. “Israel – led by bloodthirsty extremists – has gone beyond any borders, any limitation when it comes to behaviour among states and individuals. Have you heard of any state that is attacking the mediator this way? A state that is attacking the negotiating teams that are hosted by Qatar?”
Al-Thani criticised Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s justification of the attack, contrasting it against the Taliban’s political bureau in Doha, which facilitated the US-Taliban talks that ended the war in Afghanistan.
“The United States has never targeted the negotiators.”
He warned that Israel’s actions were destabilising the region and undermining prospects for peace.
“We call for peace, not war, and we will not be deterred by those who call for war and destruction,” he concluded.
The Security Council also heard from Rosemary DiCarlo, the under secretary general for political and peace building affairs at the UN, who described the strike in Doha as an “alarming escalation” that violated Qatar’s sovereignty and endangered the ongoing ceasefire and hostage negotiations with respect to the Gaza invasion.
 
 

She detailed that the airstrike targeted a residential area housing Hamas’ political leadership, killing several affiliates along with a Qatari security officer.
“The sovereignty and territorial integrity of any country, including Qatar — a valued partner in advancing peacemaking and conflict resolution — must be respected,” DiCarlo told the ambassadors. Israel, she noted, claimed responsibility, with PM Netanyahu describing it as “a wholly independent operation” following a deadly attack on civilians in Jerusalem on Monday, which Hamas said it carried out.
She also noted that Qatar, the Gulf Cooperation Council, the League of Arab States, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation had all condemned the action and expressed concern over further escalation, underlining the widespread international alarm over the strike.
China’s representative also highlighted the Israeli attack’s impact on ongoing diplomacy, recalling that the US had proposed a ceasefire on September 7, which Israel reportedly agreed to. Just two days later, a Hamas delegation discussing the proposal was struck by Israel. “Such an act of bad faith, irresponsibility and a deliberate sabotage of negotiations is indeed despicable,” he said, expressing concern that the attack could escalate tensions further in the region.
Other major powers also weighed in.
The US underscored that unilateral bombing inside Qatar did not serve the interests of Israel or Washington, while reaffirming support for ceasefire, humanitarian aid, and hostage negotiations. France condemned Israel’s strikes as a violation of the international law and stressed the need for a political solution based on a two-State framework. The UK described the attacks as counterproductive to peace and Israel’s long-term security. Algeria and Somalia criticised Israel’s aggression and urged the Security Council to take action to prevent further destabilisation.
An illustration of deep divisions
The debate illustrated deep divisions within the Security Council over the Doha strike, with Pakistan leading the charge in condemning Israel and defending the principles of international law. Ahmad repeatedly underscored the link between Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories and recurring crises in the region, stating that durable peace could only be achieved through a comprehensive political settlement, including an end to the occupation.
Observers noted that Pakistan’s approach combined strong condemnation with legal and diplomatic reasoning, highlighting both the humanitarian consequences of the strikes and the broader threat to regional stability. Ahmad also emphasised that attacks on Qatar, a principal mediator in Gaza negotiations, constituted not just a violation of sovereignty but an attack on diplomacy itself.
By the end of the session, the UNSC collectively reaffirmed the importance of mediation, the release of hostages, and the need for a political solution to the Gaza conflict. However, the exchanges between Pakistan and Israel, coupled with Qatar and China’s condemnations, highlighted persistent tensions over accountability, the interpretation of international law, and perceived double standards in responses to acts of state violence.
The Doha strike and the ensuing Security Council debate have raised critical questions about the effectiveness of international mechanisms in restraining unilateral military actions, protecting mediators, and ensuring civilian safety in conflict zones.
For Pakistan, the session provided a platform to assert its principled stance on international law, uphold Qatar’s mediation role, and highlight the importance of accountability for actions that threaten regional peace and security.
As the Council moves forward, the debate over Israel’s actions in Doha is likely to influence broader Middle East diplomacy, the role of mediators, and the balance between counter-terrorism operations and international legal norms.
Pakistan’s leadership in condemning the strike, combined with interventions from other Council members, demonstrates the continuing relevance of multilateral forums in addressing complex conflicts, even amid disagreement among major powers.</p><small>2025-09-12 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623308-cjp-bars-justice-mansoor-from-yale-conference-trip' target='_blank'><strong>CJP Afridi bars Justice Mansoor from Yale conference trip</strong></a><br><p>

“The security of the European continent is our top priority. We will not give in to Russia’s increasing intimidation,” he said.
 






A French military official said the warplanes had already been deployed to Poland prior to Tuesday’s incursions.
On Tuesday, Poland said it had scrambled aircraft alongside allies to shoot down “hostile objects” violating its airspace during a Russian attack on neighbouring Ukraine, a first for a NATO country during the war.
The incursion came as Russia unleashed a barrage of strikes across Ukraine, including in the western city of Lviv, around 50 miles (80 kilometres) from the Polish border.
Responding to the accusation, Russia’s foreign ministry claimed that its drones had carried out a major attack on military facilities in western Ukraine but stressed that there were no plans to hit any targets in Poland.
Subsequently, Poland — a NATO member, invoked the Western defence alliance’s Article 4 for urgent talks in reaction to the violation.
Under Article 4, any member can call urgent talks when it feels its “territorial integrity, political independence or security” are at risk.
Poland’s European partners in NATO have backed the country, with the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Sweden each summoning their Russian ambassadors on Thursday to protest.
Germany announced it would expand its role in a Nato mission to defend Polish airspace.
Meanwhile, the UN Security Council has called an emergency meeting today to discuss violations of Poland’s airspace.
Stray Russian drones and missiles have entered the airspace of Nato members, including Poland, several times since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
Last month, Warsaw said a Russian military drone flew into its airspace and exploded in farmland in eastern Poland, calling the incident a “provocation”.
Poland in 2023 said a Russian missile had crossed into its airspace to strike Ukraine. And in November 2022, two civilians were killed when a Ukrainian anti-aircraft missile fell on a village near the border.</p><small>2025-09-12 07:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623295-pakistan-will-have-to-adapt-to-floods-as-the-new-normal' target='_blank'><strong>'Pakistan will have to adapt to floods as the new normal'</strong></a><br><p>

“In light of yesterday’s horrific assassination of a leading political figure, I want to underscore that foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country,” Landau said in a post on social media platform X.
“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action.”
 






Landau did not elaborate on what such action would mean.
Some users replied to Landau’s post with screenshots of accounts and posts, though it was unclear if the accounts they flagged were US visa holders.
The State Department’s number two then replied to some of those comments, saying he would direct consular officials to monitor the comments on the post, which as of Thursday afternoon had over 2,000 replies.
A State Department spokesperson, asked about Landau’s post, said: “This Administration does not believe that the United States should grant visas to persons whose presence in our country does not align with US national security interests.”
But the spokesperson did not address questions on whether anybody had been identified to have their visa revoked or how consular officials would evaluate those flagged in response to Landau’s post.
Kirk, a 31-year-old author, podcast host and close ally of US President Donald Trump, helped build the Republican Party’s support among younger voters.
He was killed on Wednesday by a single gunshot as he gave a talk at a university in Utah in what President Donald Trump called a “heinous assassination.”
The Trump administration has pursued a sweeping crackdown on immigration, including increasing social media vetting and revoking thousands of student visas and aiming to tighten the duration of others.</p><small>2025-09-12 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/623288-at-unsc-pakistan-condemns-israels-reckless-attack-on-qatar' target='_blank'><strong>'Broader, consistent pattern of aggression': Pakistan assails Israel on Qatar strikes at UN</strong></a><br><p>
