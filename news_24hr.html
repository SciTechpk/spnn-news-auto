“​The restrictions are effective from Tuesday, October 28, 2025, at 5:01am Pakistan Standard Time (PKT) and will remain in place until Wednesday, October 29, 2025, at 9am PKT,” said a NOTAM (notice to airmen) issued by the PAA today.
​
“This is a routine operational safety matter. The measure is being implemented for ‘operational reasons’ to ensure the continued safety and effective management of air traffic.”
In a separate development, open source tracker Damien Symon, also quoted by Reuters in earlier news reports, said Indian aviation authorities issued a NOTAM a day earlier “possibly for a military exercise/weapons test as India prepares for its Tri-Services Exercise across the border”.
 






The open source tracker stated that India had also issued a NOTAM for a tri-services exercise along its western border with Pakistan from October 30 to November 10, saying the “chosen area and scale of activity are unusual”.
A map he shared showed that the exercise area extends from around the Indian city of Jaisalmer in Rajasthan to the disputed Sir Creek marsh area.
The creek area has been a point of contention for decades between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, and talks on the maritime boundary dispute have remained inconclusive thus far.
 






Indian news outlet Firstpost also reported that NOTAM was for a “large-scale tri-services exercise” along the Pakistan border “amid rising tensions following Operation Sindoor”.
It added that the exercise will involve the three branches of the Indian military and is aimed at demonstrating the country’s “growing joint operational capabilities, self-reliance and innovation”.
It quoted the Indian defence ministry as saying that “troops from Southern Command will actively participate to validate joint operations across diverse and challenging terrains, including offensive manoeuvres in the creek and desert sectors, amphibious operations off the Saurashtra coast, and joint multi-domain operational exercises encompassing Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR), Electronic Warfare (EW), and Cyber capabilities.“
CNBC-TV18 reported that as per officials, the exercise underscores India’s commitment to enhancing interoperability among its armed forces while “strengthening preparedness for future combat scenarios”.
Firstpost reported that Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had visited soldiers in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, on Thursday and claimed Operation Sindoor had “sent a strong warning to Pakistan, which would now ‘think twice before attempting any misadventure against India’”.
 






India Today reported that he had also visited the Bhuj Military Station in Gujarat the same day and warned Pakistan against any action in the disputed Sir Creek area.
“If Pakistan dares to act in the Sir Creek sector, the reply will be so strong that it will change both history and geography,” the outlet quoted him as saying.
We know how to defend every inch of our maritime frontiers: Naval chief
Separately, a press release from the Pakistan Navy said Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf visited forward posts in the creek areas to review operational preparedness and combat readiness.
The naval chief said sea lines of communication (SLOCs) and maritime security were not just a military requirement but a “cornerstone” of the nation’s sovereignty and a “vital pillar” of economic prosperity and stability.
 






He emphasised that the navy PN was the “vanguard of peace and stability” in the Indian Ocean and a “significant stakeholder” in regional maritime security.
“We know how to defend our sovereignty and every inch of our maritime frontiers from Sir Creek to Jiwani,” he added.
He also reaffirmed to the nation that the navy’s defence capabilities stood “as strong as our unwavering morale, from the shores to the sea”.
During the visit, three state-of-the-art 2400 TD Hovercraft were also inducted into the Pak Marines, marking a “significant stride” in modernising the navy’s operational capabilities.
“The newly inducted hovercraft are capable of simultaneously operating over a variety of surfaces, including shallow waters, sand dunes, marshy and boggy littoral zones, and can ply in areas where traditional craft are neither suitable nor designed to operate. This unique capability of undertaking simultaneous operations over land and sea provides an edge to Pak Marines in the performance of their assigned tasks. It will also strengthen PN’s capabilities for an effective and decisive response against all adversaries.
“While addressing officers and men on the occasion, naval chief highlighted that the induction of these new platforms symbolizes PN’s vision to modernise and reaffirm unwavering resolve in bolstering defence of the country’s maritime frontiers, coastal belt particularly the creeks area.”
Pakistan-India tensions
Earlier in the week, United States President Donald Trump stated that he and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had a phone call where they talked about having “no wars with Pakistan”.
The US president has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May. India has denied the claim that the US president was responsible for brokering the ceasefire via trade threats. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has praised Trump for his “leadership and proactive role” in helping the two neighbours achieve peace in the region.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties.
India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
Since then, Indian political and military leadership, including chiefs of the military branches, have continued to make aggressive statements, repeating terrorism allegations that Pakistan has repeatedly refuted and also warning of “geographical changes” in the course of any future conflict.
Singh had also said on May 30 that India would use the firepower of its navy in response to any future aggression by Pakistan, Reuters reported.
The Pakistani military has dismissed the statements as India attempting to “mould history to its liking by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts” in the aftermath of the May conflict while also issuing warnings of its own that any “imaginary new normal” the Indian leadership might be entertaining about bilateral dynamics would be met with a “new normal of swift retributive response”.
“In the face of highly provocative statements of the Indian defence minister and its army and air chiefs, we caution that a future conflict might lead to cataclysmic devastation. In case a fresh round of hostilities is triggered, Pakistan shall not hold back. We shall resolutely respond, without any qualms or restraint,“ the military had said earlier in October.</p><small>2025-10-25 18:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2519073025fd8bb.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951176/cm-afridi-demands-centre-pay-rs550bn-to-kp-calls-for-immediate-nfc-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>CM Afridi demands Centre pay Rs550bn to KP, calls for immediate NFC meeting</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Saturday claimed the federal government owed the province Rs550 billion, calling for the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting to be convened immediately.
He made these remarks while addressing a jirga in the province’s Khyber district today. Last week, CM Afridi had called for a grand peace jirga in a bid to discuss avenues for “establishment of peace” in the province.
“After 9/11, Pakistan entered a foreign war without our consent,” CM Afridi said, referring to the attacks of Sept 11, 2001, when deadly plane hijackings claimed almost 3,000 lives.
“It was said that Pakistan needs sacrifices. For Pakistan, we left our houses. Drone strikes and military operations started here,” Afridi said.
“We were made the scapegoats,” he told the crowd. “Our homes, markets, and mosques were destroyed, yet we gave sacrifices for Pakistan.”
 






The chief minister warned against the launching of any new military operation in the province’s tribal districts, saying the people will “not be made into scapegoats again”.
Afridi added that despite the claims of security forces in 2018 that Khyber district and other tribal areas had been cleared [of militants], “preparations are again being made for new military operations”.
The newly elected provincial chief executive said KP stands with the state when it comes to peace, but “under no circumstance will we support collateral damage”.
“If any innocent life is lost this time, there will be accountability,” Afridi said.
He also demanded that any future decisions regarding the region “must include the provincial government and parliamentarians from KP,” rejecting decisions made behind “closed doors”.
PTI leadership meet at CM House
Prior to the jirga, a meeting of PTI’s senior leadership took place at CM House in Peshawar, according to a statement by press secretary to CM Sahibzada Hassan.
Chairman PTI Barrister Gohar, CM Sohail Afridi, PTI Provincial President Junaid Akbar, Asad Qaiser and other leaders participated in the meeting, per the statement. The law and order situation of the province was discussed in detail during the meeting.
 






It was decided to convene a peace jirga in the KP Assembly, with former CMs, governors, scholars, jirga leaders, civil society, lawyers and important personalities to be invited.
“The aim of the peace jirga is to eliminate terrorism and formulate a unified strategy for sustainable peace,” said the statement. “Participants of the meeting paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police.’
“Provincial government stands by the police force,” CM Afridi was quoted as saying. “Providing modern equipment, training and resources to the police is the top priority of the government.”
Rise in terrorist incidents
Pakistan has witnessed a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) personnel.
Earlier this week, Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.
The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements.
Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan. A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.</p><small>2025-10-25 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/25221451d820598.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951189/narcotics-worth-more-than-rs18bn-seized-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Narcotics worth more than Rs18bn seized in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>The Customs Enforcement Wing of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) foiled on Saturday an attempt to smuggle a large quantity of narcotics worth more than Rs18 billion.
 






The enforcement wing, in a post on X, said a truck coming from Taftan and going towards Quetta was intercepted by a team of FEU Noshki. “Upon detailed inspection, a modified fuel tank was found containing concealed boxes filled with narcotics substance.”
At least 300kg of crystal meth (methamphetamine) was seized from the vehicle, said the enforcement wing. It added that two individuals, resident of Hoshab in Kech, were arrested. “FIR has been registered. Further investigation is underway.”
“300 kg of Crystal/Ice (Methamphetamine) and the smuggling vehicle have been seized both valuing at approximately Rs. 18.67 billion.”
Earlier in the week, Pakistan Navy ship Yarmook seized narcotics worth more than $972 million from sailboats in the Arabian Sea. The ship is operating in the Arabian Sea as part of the Combined Maritime Force (CMF), a naval partnership that includes the United States.</p><small>2025-10-25 17:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630499-security-forces-foil-terror-plot-kill-three-terrorists-in-n-waziristan-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces foil terror plot, kill three terrorists in North Waziristan: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

A statement issued today from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that security forces foiled a “major terrorist incident and averted a potential catastrophic attack” a day ago after conducting an intelligence-based operation  (IBO) in the district’s general area of Jhallar based on credible intelligence about reported terrorist presence belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna al-Khawarij preparing a vehicle-borne suicide bomber for a major terrorist activity”.
Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It added that troops effectively engaged them at their location and destroyed the vehicle being prepared for the suicide attack while eliminating three “Indian-sponsored” terrorists through “precise and skillful engagement”.
 






The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area.
“Relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.
Earlier this week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.

The seven cops were suspended a day ago after the incident came to light. While the police claimed that Muhammad Irfan died of heart attack, his relatives alleged that he was tortured to death.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered the same day at the Saddar Police Station on the complaint of SIU and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Ahmed under Sections 34 (common intention) and 319 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against seven nominated SIU/CIA officers.
“The SIU/CIA police have handed over custody of two suspects nominated in FIR … who have been arrested. If need be, we shall convert the case to 302 (premeditated murder) and arrest more SIU officials if they were found involved,” said South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza whicle speaking to Dawn.
He confirmed that “preliminary post-mortem report establishes torture”.
Meanwhile, a large number of relatives and members of the community staged a sit-in at an Edhi morgue at Sohrab Goth while carrying the coffin of the victim, whose body was kept at the morgue, and blocked the main road.
Senior journalist Shahid Jatoi, one of the protesters, told Dawn that the people were demonstrating because “the case has been registered on complaint of the killers”. He said the policemen had promised the relatives that  the FIR would be registered on the family’s complaint.
“The relatives visited the SIU/CIA centre on Friday night for the purpose of the FIR, but the police had already got the FIR registered on behalf of the state. They were informed that since FIR had already been registered, a second case could not be registered for the same offence,” Jatoi said.
He added that since then, three other people, who were detained along with Irfan, were released and cleared of any wrongdoing, the family and those gathered believed that the four were “innocent” and were tortured in custody, leading to Irfan’s death. The protesters urged the Sindh chief minister and police chief to provide justice in the matter.

The Karachi Traffic Police said in a statement that traffic at Edhi Centre Sohrab Goth, towards Shafiq Mor main Rashid Minhas Road was closed for traffic.
Traffic coming from Gulshan-i-Iqbal was being diverted under Sohrab Goth bridge towards Sharea Pakistan, while traffic coming from Water Pump was being diverted towards Al-Asif Square.
 






FIR
The FIR said that four people were detained by the SIU police party from Lilly Bridge near Cantonment Station in the limits of Frere Police Station on Wednesday. A day ago, the SIU had told Dawn that they were arrested from Ayesha Manzil in the FB Area of the city.
The FIR added they were detained on information provided by a special informant, a case was registered against the four on the same day, and they were handed over to an assistant sub-inspector (ASI).
SHO Ahmed said he came to know through the investigating office of the case that two other ASIs had continued interrogating Irfan when his health deteriorated suddenly and he became unconscious.
The SHO added that the IO took Irfan to the hospital without informing him. SHO Ahmed said the SIU personnel had committed “negligence” during Irfan’s arrest and custody. He said it transpired that the registration of the case against the deceased was also “dubious” and the entire matter raised suspicion.</p><small>2025-10-25 16:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/25172343ea02fee.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951181/indian-man-arrested-over-alleged-inappropriate-conduct-towards-australian-women-cricketers-in-madhya-pradesh' target='_blank'><strong>Indian man arrested over alleged inappropriate conduct towards Australian women cricketers in Madhya Pradesh</strong></a><br><p>Indian police have arrested a man accused of stalking and inappropriately touching two Australian cricketers participating in the ICC Women’s World Cup in Madhya Pradesh, officials said on Saturday.
The incident happened in the central Indian city of Indore on Thursday morning when the two players left their hotel to go to a cafe, a day after Australia’s six-wicket victory over England in the group stage of the World Cup, when they were allegedly approached by a motorcyclist.
“The security officers of the women’s Australian cricket team filed a complaint that two members of the team faced inappropriate behaviour,” additional deputy commissioner of police, Rajesh Dandotiya, told Indian news agency ANI.
“A FIR (first information report) was registered, and the accused was identified and arrested following an intensive strategic operation.”
He has been charged under sections 74 and 78 of the criminal code that deal with assault or using criminal force against a woman with the intent to outrage her modesty and stalking, respectively. “We are examining if there were any shortfalls in the security protocols,” Dandotiya added.
Violence against women remains a chronic issue in the world’s most populous country, where an average of nearly 90 rapes a day were reported in 2022.
Dandotiya said the 30-year-old man who was arrested has a criminal record.
The two players were not identified by Indian police or Cricket Australia, which confirmed the incident.
“The matter was reported by team security to police, who are handling the matter,” Cricket Australia said in a statement.
Board of Control for Cricket in India Secretary Devajit Saikia said it was a “deeply regrettable and isolated incident.
“We appreciate the swift and effective action taken by the Madhya Pradesh Police in apprehending the accused. The law will take its due course to ensure justice is served,” Saikia said.
“We will also review our existing safety protocols and strengthen them further, if necessary, to ensure such incidents are not repeated.”
The Times of India newspaper reported that the team’s security manager received a distress message from one of the cricketers that said “… there is a guy following us trying to grab us”.
Team officials were informed and went to their location to assist the players, the paper said.
A police patrol then escorted the players safely back to the team’s hotel.
India has made strides towards gender equality and women’s empowerment in recent years but safety for women remains a serious concern.</p><small>2025-10-25 15:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/25180531e91a574.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951184/in-pictures-lahores-skyline-engulfed-in-smog' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: Lahore’s skyline engulfed in smog</strong></a><br><p>Lahore continued to experience dry and hazy weather on Saturday as the Met Office warned that persistent dry conditions and rising air pollution were likely to keep the city and other districts of eastern Punjab under the grip of smog.
It added that continental air was prevailing over most parts of the country, bringing generally dry weather, while hilly areas were expected to remain cold during morning and night hours. Citizens were advised to take precautionary measures against the prevailing smog.
Lahore was declared the world’s most polluted city earlier this week as a hazardous blanket of smog enveloped the metropolis, prompting authorities to issue a severe public health warning.
Along with Karachi, the city was among the top five most polluted cities in terms of air quality, according to monitoring platform IQAir.
Smog is set to intensify across Lahore and other parts of Punjab due to a combination of local emissions and pollutants carried by low-speed winds from India, following Diwali celebrations, according to the provincial government.

Today’s meeting follows the first round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks mediated jointly by Qatar and Turkiye in Doha on October 18-19.
The Qatar talks had come after days of fighting along the Pak-Afghan border — where trade is still closed — and strikes by Islamabad on Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. The agreement reached in Doha extended an initial 48-hour truce and resulted in a permanent ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
 


According to Afghan interim administration spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid, the Afghan delegation was to be led by Mawlawi Rahmatullah Najeeb, deputy minister at Ministry of Interior, Turkish news agency Anadolu reported.
“The remaining issues [with Pakistan] will be discussed in the meeting,” Mujahid said in a post on X last night, adding that the Afghan delegation had left Kabul for Istanbul.
 


“Pakistan looks forward to the establishment of a concrete and verifiable monitoring mechanism in the next meeting to be hosted by Turkiye in Istanbul on Oct 25, 2025, to address the menace of terrorism emanating from Afghan soil towards Pakistan and prevent any further loss of life of Pakistanis,” the new Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, said at his maiden weekly media briefing yesterday.
In essence, Doha produced the political breakthrough, while Istanbul is expected to operationalise it by defining what constitutes cross-border terrorism, how violations will be verified and how disputes will be resolved.
The Istanbul round offers an opportunity to move from temporary calm towards a structured, verifiable peace framework with mechanisms for monitoring, verification and sustained dialogue through technical committees.
Turkish officials have indicated that a technical committee in Istanbul will review details of the ceasefire, inc­l­uding terrorism, migration and border security.
At the talks today, Pakistan is expected to seek concrete and verifiable commitments from the Afghan side to eliminate the threat of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) from its territory, which Pakistan says uses Afghan soil to launch attacks across the border.
The agenda includes dismantling known TTP sanctuaries, arresting or expelling key figures and defining clear timelines and benchmarks for measurable action such as raids, arrests and destruction of safe houses.
To ensure implementation, Islamabad plans to propose mechanisms for intelligence-sharing, cross-border coordination and real-time monitoring of militant movements and financing.
Pakistan also supports establishing a third-party oversight structure, potentially co-chaired by Turkiye and Qatar, to verify progress and address non-compliance.
 
 

Additional priorities will include securing Afghan assurances against providing safe havens to hostile groups, strengthening border control, ensuring financial transparency on militant funding and holding regular review meetings to assess compliance.
The truce agreed in Doha has largely held, with no major terrorist attacks reported since, according to the FO.
 


“We are taking part in the second round of talks in Istanbul with the same sincerity of purpose, with the same sincerity of intent with which we participated in Doha,” Andrabi said yesterday.
“During the Doha talks, the basic focus was to stop the terrorist attacks from Afghan soil into Pakistan.
“And in order to do that, we should have a verifiable, empirical mechanism to ascertain that the Afghan Taliban regime in Kabul is taking concrete actions to stop such attacks,” the FO spokesperson said.
He said the continuation of the ceasefire demonstrated the progress achieved in Doha.
“In effect, the Doha talks and outcomes were fruitful. We would like the trend to continue in Istanbul and post-Istanbul,” Andrabi added.
Khawaja Asif warns of ‘open war’ with Afghanistan if peace talks fail
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said he believes Afghanistan wants peace but that failure to reach an agreement during talks in Istanbul would mean “open war”.
Asif said there had been no incidents in the four to five days since the ceasefire was agreed, and both sides were complying with the truce.
“We have the option, if no agreement takes place, we have an open war with them,” he said, adding: “But I saw that they want peace.”
‘Turkiye trusted partner’
Turkiye’s deep counterterrorism experience against the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) and its familiarity with insurgent challenges along porous borders give Ankara both diplomatic credibility and practical insight into Pakistan’s difficulties with TTP sanctuaries inside Afghanistan.
Its role is further strengthened by the longstanding Pakistan-Turkiye counterterrorism cooperation, including consultations held earlier this year.
For Pakistan, Turkiye represents a trusted partner capable of designing a mechanism that both sides can rely on, shifting the peace process from ad hoc diplomacy to institutionalised peace-building.
 
 

Ibraheem Bahiss, an International Crisis Group analyst in Afghanistan, termed the meeting “quite essential”. He told AFP that monitoring “mechanisms” could involve intelligence sharing on armed groups.
“For example, Pakistan would give coordinates of where they suspect TTP fighters or commanders are, and instead of carrying out strikes, Afghanistan would be expected to carry out action against them,” Bahiss said.
But it was unclear if that would end the problem. “I’m not so hopeful that a technical mechanism will really address the fundamental drivers of this escalatory cycle,” he said.

Last month, the airline had received Third Country Operator approval for the UK. The development came after Britain’s Department of Transport concluded that security arrangements in the country were “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. Flight operations to Manchester are resuming in the first phase, with plans to extend them to Birmingham and London in the second.
“After a long and difficult delay of five years, today the resumption of flights from Islamabad to Manchester is a feat we have achieved through our hard work and determination,” Asif said.
“This success is not a coincidence, but a living testament of the government’s priorities, strong leadership, and efforts,” he said. The minister said that the country’s image suffered immensely when the national carrier faced international bans.
 






“We took it as a national challenge. The government, without wasting a single moment, empowered and provided resources to the country’s aviation bodies,” he said.
“To meet the standards of the world’s strictest aviation bodies, we completely restructured pilot training, the licensing system, aircraft maintenance, and safety protocols,” he added.
“It is a matter of great pride that we raised our standards to such a level that the European Union’s Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) restored its confidence in PIA,“ the minister said.
Asif also expressed gratitude to Pakistani diplomats and staff based in Britain and Europe, saying that they “presented Pakistan’s case effectively at a diplomatic level, provided evidence, and maintained continuous engagement” with the relevant authorities.
He said that their persistent efforts had enabled the national carrier to resume its regular flight operations.
“I would especially like to thank the staff of the British High Commission in Pakistan and their team leader Jane Marriott,” he said, adding that they also played a part in accelerating the process and removing obstacles.
“Their cooperation highlights the strong friendship between the two countries,” he said. The minister added that the government was committed to making PIA a profitable institution so that it could support the economy instead of being a burden.
The minister said that the flights to Manchester were an “excellent start” but the government would not stop there. “We plan that after Manchester, flights to London and Birmingham will also be started,” he said.
The minister directed the PIA management to ensure safety, punctuality and customer satisfaction. “Let us vow today to make PIA reach the status it had once achieved,” he said.
In a post on X, Asif said the restoration of flights was part of a series of measures taken by the government for the restoration of national institutions, improvement of public facilities, and the promotion of Pakistan’s image at the international level.
 






He said that the statement of the aviation minister during the PTI era “caused damage to the reputation of our beloved country, the aviation sector, and the national airline PIA, which the current government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has rectified”.
“The resumption of direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester marks the beginning of a new era of connectivity between Pakistan and the UK, which will provide significant convenience to the Pakistani community residing there,” Asif said.
Meanwhile, Marriott, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, said: “A genuine joy to wave off the first flight by a Pakistani carrier to the UK in five years. Here’s to more destinations and connections!”
 






PM Shehbaz felicitated the nation, especially Pakistanis residing in the UK, on the commencement of direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester.
The prime minister also lauded the efforts of Asif, the Civil Aviation Authority, PIA and the officials of the relevant entities in this regard.
“Pakistans image is being restored across the world,” he said, adding that the suspension had damaged PIAs reputation, which was now restored after years of dedicated efforts.
The prime minister further observed that the Pakistani community living in the UK would greatly benefit from these direct flights.
“The resumption of direct flights will further strengthen Pakistan-UK bilateral ties,” he said, adding that the journey of improvement in every national institution, through reforms, was progressing at a rapid pace.
 






The EASA had barred PIA from operating in EU countries in June 2020 over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near the Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers.
The ban on flights followed the then aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament terming pilots’ licences “dubious”.
EASA lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28 last year. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain.
It should also be mentioned that the government is making efforts to sell the struggling national flag carrier, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. In June, it received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm.</p><small>2025-10-25 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630453-sp-adeel-akbar-believed-to-have-accidentally-shot-himself-claim-police-sources' target='_blank'><strong>SP Adeel Akbar believed to have accidentally shot himself, claim police sources</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and Egypt share long-standing bilateral relations. In May, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi reaffirmed Egypt’s desire for stronger bilateral ties with Pakistan in a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
Last week, Pak­istan and Egypt agreed to enhance cooperation in the maritime and industrial sectors, aiming to foster joint ventures and promote their blue economies. The army chief is currently on a visit to the country.
A statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) today said the army chief held a meeting with the Egyptian president at the Itihadia Presidential Palace in Cairo.
 
 

“COAS commended the Egyptian leadership for key role in the region’s peace and stability, while President el-Sisi expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s positive and proactive contributions to matters of importance for the world and Muslim ummah. Both leaders underlined the importance of coordination on matters of mutual strategic interests and strengthening people-to-people contacts,” the ISPR said.
It added that both exchanged views on bilateral relations and reaffirmed the long-standing friendship between Pakistan and Egypt.
“The meeting further acknowledged the shared history of friendly ties and the mutual desire to further broaden cooperation in all domains especially socio-economic engagement, technology and security matters.”
“The meeting concluded on a warm note, with both parties expressing confidence that the strengthened economic and security dialogue would contribute significantly to peace, stability and security in Pakistan, Egypt and the wider region,” the ISPR said.
The army chief had reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to improved defence and military cooperation with Egypt in a meeting with its defence officials a day ago.
The army chief had also visited and laid a floral wreath on the Memorial of the Unknown Soldier and the grave of former Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.
During the visit, Field Marshal Munir also met the Grand Imam of Al Azhar Sheikh Ahmed El Tayab.</p><small>2025-10-25 12:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630463-in-meeting-with-coas-egypt-president-lauds-pakistans-contributions-towards-muslim-world' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with COAS, Egyptian president lauds Pakistan's 'contributions' towards Muslim world</strong></a><br><p>

The royal family is venerated in Thailand, treated by many as semi-divine figures and lavished with glowing media coverage and gold-adorned portraits hanging in public spaces and private homes nationwide.
Authorities ordered flags to fly at half-mast for 30 days, banned weddings and concerts, and instructed citizens to wear black.
Former Queen Sirikit’s body will lie in state at the Grand Palace’s Dusit Thorne Hall in the capital, Bangkok, according to the palace.

The new global legal framework aims to strengthen international cooperation to fight digital crimes, from child pornography to transnational cyberscams and money laundering.
More than 60 countries were seen to sign the declaration on Saturday, which means it will go into force once ratified by those states.
UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres described the signing as an “important milestone”, but that it was “only the beginning”.
“Every day, sophisticated scams destroy families, steal migrants and drain billions of dollars from our economy… We need a strong, connected global response,” he said at the opening ceremony in Vietnam’s capital on Saturday.
The UN Convention against Cybercrime was first proposed by Russian diplomats in 2017, and approved by consensus last year after lengthy negotiations.
Critics say its broad language could lead to abuses of power and enable the cross-border repression of government critics.
“There were multiple concerns raised throughout the negotiation of the treaty around how it actually ends up compelling companies to share data,” said Sabhanaz Rashid Diya, founder of the Tech Global Institute think tank.
“It’s almost rubber-stamping a very problematic practice that has been used against journalists and in authoritarian countries,” she told AFP.
‘Weak’ safeguards
Vietnam’s government said this week that 60 countries were registered for the official signing, without disclosing which ones.
But the list will probably not be limited to Russia, China, and their allies.
“Cybercrime is a real issue across the world,” Diya said. “I think everybody’s kind of grappling with it.”
The far-reaching online scam industry, for example, has ballooned in Southeast Asia in recent years, with thousands of scammers estimated to be involved and victims worldwide conned out of billions of dollars annually.
“Even for the most democratic states, I think they need some degree of access to data that they’re not getting under existing mechanisms,” Diya told AFP.
Democratic countries might describe the UN convention as a “compromise document”, as it contains some human rights provisions, she added.
But these safeguards were slammed as “weak” in a letter signed by more than a dozen rights groups and other organisations.
Tech sector
Big technology companies have also raised concerns.
The Cybersecurity Tech Accord delegation to the treaty talks, representing more than 160 firms including Meta, Dell and India’s Infosys, will not be present in Hanoi, its head Nick Ashton-Hart said.
Among other objections, those companies previously warned that the convention could criminalise cybersecurity researchers and “allows states to cooperate on almost any criminal act they choose”.
Potential overreach by authorities poses “serious risks to corporate IT systems relied upon by billions of people every day”, they said during the negotiation process.
In contrast, an existing international accord, the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, includes guidance on using it in a “rights-respecting” way, Ashton-Hart said.
The location for the signing has also raised eyebrows, given Vietnam’s record of crackdowns on dissent.
“Vietnamese authorities typically use laws to censor and silence any online expression of views critical of the country’s political leadership,” said Deborah Brown of Human Rights Watch.
“Russia has been a driving force behind this treaty and will certainly be pleased once it’s signed,” she told AFP.
“But a significant amount of cybercrime globally comes from Russia, and it has never needed a treaty to tackle cybercrime from within its borders,” Brown added.
“This treaty can’t make up Russia’s lack of political will in that regard.”</p><small>2025-10-25 09:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251418527f6422b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951157/3-suspected-robbers-killed-in-shootout-with-quetta-police' target='_blank'><strong>3 suspected robbers killed in shootout with Quetta police</strong></a><br><p>Three suspected robbers were killed in a shootout with police in Quetta’s outskirts on Saturday morning, an official said.
Saddar Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Shaukat Jadoon told Dawn.com that three armed suspects opened fire on a police patrol party in the Killi Khali area, a locality on the outskirts of Quetta, within the limits of the Brewery Police Station.
“All three suspects were killed during the police’s retaliatory action,” DSP Jadoon said.
“Weapons were recovered from the possession of the dacoits,” the officer said, adding that their bodies were taken to the Bolan Medical College for medico-legal procedures.
The suspects were dacoits and were present in the area with the intention of committing a robbery, the DSP said. Further police investigation was being carried out, he added.
Last month, Sala­h­u­ddin Achakzai, a prominent tribal elder of the Achakzai tribe, was shot dead and two others were injured when arm­ed men riding motorcycles targeted them on the outskirts of Chaman.
In late August, two men were gunned down when armed men opened fire on their car near Killi Dargai on Loralai-Dera Road.

Addressing the Balochistan Workshop in Islamabad today, PM Shehabz recalled various challenges faced by the people of Balochistan. Noting that some of those challenges required financial resources, the premier recalled meetings in Lahore held ahead of the 2009 National Finance Commission (NFC) Award, which he had attended as the then-Punjab chief minister.
“I would like to mention in all humility that in Lahore, all four chief ministers were gathered together, along with their finance ministers. Three days’ marathon session went on without a break — of course, when night fell, we would go for a few hours’ rest and then gather the next morning again.”
He noted that then-Balochistan CM Aslam Raisani had conditioned the acceptance of the NFC Award on “100 per cent financial resources being added to Balochistan’s share”.
“I said Punjab is ready to contribute whatever amount is required to meet my brother Aslam Raisani’s demand, and this is what we call the true spirit of a federation and what we call four brothers living under a roof,” PM Shehbaz said.
 
 

“The question now is how to meet these challenges so that the people of Balochistan — Baloch, Pashtun and all other communities living there — should not only own Pakistan but also feel like active participants and beneficiaries of economic growth.”
PM Shehbaz noted that the issues of Balochistan “will persist tomorrow as well, but to resolve them, one thing should come first; that Pakistan is our home and we have to put out the fire together”.
During his address, PM Shehbaz highlighted that Balochistan “voluntarily joined Pakistan”, terming the event “something history will always remember in golden words”.
He noted that the province was blessed with “infinite natural resources, which run into trillions and trillions of dollars”. “But unfortunately, those great natural resources of wealth and still hidden and buried under tonnes of mud and mountains,” the premier lamented.
“Unfortunately, what has happened in the last few years, rather spanning over more than a decade, is a matter of self-introspection,” the prime minister said.
 


Throughout his speech, PM Shehbaz underscored the need for unity among the people of all provinces.
“Baloch people have always been very, very generous to those segments of society who either migrated to Quetta or were living there for ages. Pashtuns, of course, are a part of Balochistan, Punjabi migrants and then other tribes living in Balochistan too,” he asserted.
“There was complete harmony and peace existed between the early segments of society for a very long time,” the prime minister highlighted.
He further said: “When I speak of Balochistan’s brothers, sisters and children, I am not referring to any geographical division, because we are Pakistanis first, then Punjabis, Baloch, Sindhis or Pashtuns.
“What happened then that distance developed between us, and complaints and grievances came into existence even though terrorism had been completely eradicated in Pakistan in 2018,” he said, terming it a “piercing” question that needed to be answered.
PM Shehbaz went on to recall that the Regional Cooperation for Development Highway (also known as N-25), which connects Karachi to Chaman, was infamously known as the khooni road (killer highway) in Balochistan due to “accidents that occur every other day there”.
The prime minister highlighted his government’s decision in April this year to divert money saved from reduced oil prices to development projects in Balochistan by skipping providing relief to fuel consumers.
 
 

“This killer road has a [reconstruction] estimate of Rs300bn-350bn,” he said, adding that the petrol and diesel prices declined by about Rs8-10 per litre. “I calculated so it amounted to Rs180 billion per year. If I retain that, then this killer road can be turned into a road of peace.
“My sole reason for this decision was harmony, bringing together provincial affection and promoting unity […] These are the decisions through which Pakistan can definitely come out of these challenges,” the premier asserted.</p><small>2025-10-25 08:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630414-eight-dead-13-injured-in-two-punjab-van-truck-collisions' target='_blank'><strong>Eight dead, 13 injured in two Punjab van-truck collisions</strong></a><br><p>

The Canadian province of Ontario said it would pull the offending anti-tariff ad on Monday so that negotiations could restart, after Trump alleged that the ad misrepresented the views of fellow Republican Reagan.
 






But Trump showed no sign of backing down, saying Ontario should not have let it air during the first two games this weekend of baseball’s World Series.
Adding extra spice to the row, the World Series features a Canadian team, the Toronto Blue Jays, facing a US team, the Los Angeles Dodgers. The Blue Jays thrashed the Dodgers 11-4 in the first game on Friday.
“Canada got caught cheating on a commercial, can you believe it?” Trump told reporters before heading on a trip to Asia.
“And I heard they were pulling the ad — I didn’t know they were putting it on a little bit more. They could have pulled it tonight,” Trump added.
After a reporter said the ad would be pulled on Monday, Trump replied: “That’s dirty play. But I can play dirtier than they can.”
 






Trump announced on his Truth Social network on Thursday that he had “terminated” all negotiations with Canada over what he called the “fake” ad campaign.
Less than 24 hours later, Ontario premier Doug Ford said he was suspending the ads after talking to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney about the spiraling row with Washington.
“In speaking with Prime Minister Carney, Ontario will pause its US advertising campaign effective Monday so that trade talks can resume,” Ford said in a post on X.
 






‘Crooked ad’
The Canadian ad used quotes from a radio address on trade that Reagan delivered in 1987, in which he warned against ramifications that he said high tariffs on foreign imports could have on the US economy.
It cited Reagan as saying that “high tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars,” a quote that matches a transcript of his speech on the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library’s website.
The Ronald Reagan foundation wrote on X on Thursday that the Ontario government had used “selective audio and video” and that it was reviewing its legal options.
 






Trump said on Friday night that it was a “crooked ad”, adding that “they know Ronald Reagan loved tariffs”.
Trump and Carney are both set to be at a dinner on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) in South Korea on Wednesday.
But Trump said he had no plans to meet Carney.
The latest twist in relations between the United States and Canada came just over two weeks after Carney visited Trump at the White House to seek a relaxation of stiff US tariffs.
On Friday, Carney had sought to calm the situation, saying that his country was ready to resume “progress” on trade talks “when the Americans are ready”.
Canada has “to focus on what we can control, and realize what we cannot control,” he added as he headed to Asia.
Trump’s global sectoral tariffs — particularly on steel, aluminum, and autos — have hit Canada hard, forcing job losses and squeezing businesses.
For now, the United States and Canada adhere to an existing North American trade deal called the USMCA, which ensures that roughly 85 per cent of cross-border trade in both directions remains tariff-free.
But in a speech on Wednesday, Carney said that the United States has raised “its tariffs to levels last seen during the Great Depression”.
“Our economic strategy needs to change dramatically,” Carney added, saying the process “will take some sacrifices and some time.”</p><small>2025-10-25 06:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/251056566dd34dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951148/thailands-former-queen-sirikit-dead-at-93-palace' target='_blank'><strong>Thailand’s former queen Sirikit dead at 93: palace</strong></a><br><p>Thailand’s former Queen Sirikit, the mother of the current King Vajiralongkorn and wife of the nation’s longest-reigning monarch, died late on Friday at the age of 93, the palace said.
The royal family is venerated in Thailand, treated by many as semi-divine figures and lavished with glowing media coverage and gold-adorned portraits hanging in public spaces and private homes nationwide.
Throughout her 66-year marriage to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Sirikit carved a dual reputation as a fashionista and the nation’s caring matriarch — with some Western media featuring her on magazine covers and comparing her to former US first lady Jackie Kennedy.
“I had heard that she had been unwell and, given that she was in her 90s, I knew this day would come,” 53-year-old housekeeper Sasis Putthasit said early on Saturday in the capital Bangkok.
“But I didn’t expect it to be today,” Sasis told AFP.
“I feel sad because she was a mother figure to the country, and now she’s gone.”
Sirikit had “suffered several illnesses” while hospitalised since 2019, including a blood infection this month, the palace said in a statement.
“Her majesty’s condition worsened until Friday and she passed away … at Chulalongkorn hospital at age 93,” it added.
King Vajiralongkorn has assigned members of the royal family to begin a year-long mourning period, the palace said.
From early on Saturday, Thai news anchors were seen wearing black during the morning broadcast, a sign of public mourning.
Her passing “marks a profoundly significant event for the Thai Royal Family and the entire nation, given her immense popularity and deep connection to the late king who remains deeply revered”, Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a former Thai diplomat and academic who studies the monarchy, told AFP.
Pakistan offers condolences
Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed “deep sorrow” at the former queen’s passing and conveyed his condolences to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand.
 






Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened at Sirikit’s passing.
“The people and government of Pakistan join me in extending our deepest condolences to His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time of national grief,” he said.
 






‘Mother of the Nation’
King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s remarkably lengthy reign from 1946 until 2016 was bookended by World War II and the first inauguration of US President Donald Trump.
Though Bhumibol’s son inherited the throne about nine years ago, many still revere him as the nation’s most steadfast figurehead — and Sirikit as his constant companion.
She retired from the public eye in recent years as she suffered from ailing health, her privacy sealed by strict lese majeste laws that limit what can be reported about the royal family.
But in her glamorous heyday in the 1960s she mingled with US presidents and superstars such as Elvis Presley, while at home touring Thailand to visit villagers in rural areas.
She was referred to as the “Mother of the Nation” and her birthday was designated the country’s Mothers’ Day.
The reigning Chakri dynasty dates back to 1782 but the succession from King Vajiralongkorn is unclear as he has not formally named an heir.
He has seven children including five sons — four from an earlier marriage who have been officially disowned, and his 20-year-old son Dipangkorn Rasmijoti.
While the royal family is still held in very high regard by most Thais, it faced unprecedented public dissent during street protests in 2020.
Tens of thousands of young protesters took to the streets demanding widespread political reforms including changes to the monarchy — a public challenge to the royals’ status never seen in Thailand before.
Though Thailand’s constitution places the monarchy above politics, Sirikit drew public attention when she attended the funeral of a royalist protester in 2008.
When her husband King Bhumibol died, Thailand observed a year-long mourning period.
Authorities ordered flags to fly at half-mast for 30 days, banned weddings and concerts, and instructed citizens to wear black.
Former Queen Sirikit’s body will lie in state at the Grand Palace’s Dusit Thorne Hall in the capital Bangkok, according to the palace.</p><small>2025-10-25 05:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/2510274717ed5dc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951017/lahorites-breathe-most-polluted-air-in-world' target='_blank'><strong>Lahorites breathe most polluted air in world</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Lahore was declared the world’s most polluted city on Friday as a hazardous blanket of smog enveloped the metropolis, prompting authorities to issue a severe public health warning.
The crisis was quantified by alarming data, with the city’s overall Air Quality Index (AQI) reaching a “hazardous” level of 362.
The situation was even worse in specific neighbourhoods, with the Shalimar area recording a staggering AQI of 690, followed by Shadman at 611 and Syed Maratib Ali Road at 609.
 
 

Other areas, including Iqbal Town, Lower Mall, and the Civil Secretariat also registered levels falling in the “emergency range”, posing serious health risks to the residents.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast no immediate respite, warning that a thick layer of smog is likely to persist over eastern Punjab, with a further increase expected in the coming days.

Met Office sees no immediate respite

The department explicitly identified industrial pollution and vehicle emissions as the primary drivers of smog and highlighted that children, the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions are at the highest risk of respiratory illnesses.
In response to the escalating crisis, Punjab’s Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb says the government is following a comprehensive strategy to combat the environmental emergency.
Smog could severely disrupt daily life and businesses, she warned.
 






“For the first time in Punjab’s history, a ban has been imposed on the use of plastic bags,” Ms Aurangzeb says.
The minister stresses the need for the people’s cooperation in combating smog, stating, “Air pollution cannot be controlled without public cooperation.”
 
 

She says that brick kilns across the province are being shifted to cleaner zig-zag technology, a dedicated “Smog War Room” has been established for Punjab, and a helpline set up for the public to report environmental violations.
Furthermore, she says that the government has launched a public awareness campaign for a clean environment and it is the collective responsibility of the people to eliminate the causes of smog and keep the atmosphere clean.
Health experts appealed to residents of Lahore to take all necessary precautions such as wearing masks and limiting outdoor exposure as the city continues to grapple with the suffocating haze.

The regulations, introduced through BPRD Circular No.1 of 2025, had mandated streamlining of account opening and customer onboarding processes by all institutions under the SBP’s regulatory ambit, including Banks, DFIs, MFBs, Digital Banks, and EMIs. As per the circular, issued on July 25, all SBP-regulated entities (REs) need to “streamline the account opening/customer onboarding process and improve the customer experience”.
One of the new requirements introduced was that biometric verification of the account or wallet operator should be made the primary verification method for all accounts and digital wallets. The prevailing system had allowed operators to take up to 60 days to complete biometric verification before a debit block was imposed on their account.
With the new regulations going into effect starting October 25, industry sources expressed fears that potentially tens of millions of account-holders who have not completed biometric verification could lose the ability to operate them. They also expressed concerns that the regulations may prevent individuals operating foreign currency accounts from sending or receiving remittances.
Financial institutions were given three months to comply with the requirements, which are part of customer due diligence and onboarding-related requirements under the SBP’s Anti Money Laundering/Countering Financing of Terrorism/Counter Proliferation Financing Regulations.
The scope and applicability of the SBP’s regulations pertaining to digital accounts and wallets had been expanded in the ‘Consolidated Customer Onboarding Framework’ introduced in July, and the change now “covers both in-branch and remote onboarding, and is applicable for opening accounts/wallets for Individuals and Entities (legal persons/arrangements), including Local Currency and Foreign Currency accounts, and explicitly mentioning Roshan Digital Accounts” and applies to all “SBP Regulated Entities (REs), including Banks, DFIs, MFBs, Digital Banks, and EMIs”.
The new framework also requires a “consolidated approach”, regardless of whether the onboarding process was performed in-branch or remotely. In the earlier framework, released in 2022, use of NADRA Verisys was allowed for verification at the time of account opening, while biometric verification was to be completed within 60 days.
However, under the 2025 framework, biometric verification will be the primary method for “customers with CNIC/NICOP/POC/ARC/POR cards prior to establishment of the relationship/opening of the account/wallet”.</p><small>2025-10-25 04:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630391-house-help-living-a-millionaires-life-arrested-in-karachi-for-theft' target='_blank'><strong>House help living 'a millionaire's life' arrested in Karachi for theft</strong></a><br><p>

The incident marks the second kidnapping of labourers in the region in four days. The first incident took place three days earlier, although it was only made public by the officials yesterday.
Levies officials said over two dozen armed men stormed the camp and crushing plant of a private construction company late on Thursday in the Naal area, about 80 km from the district headquarters of Khuzdar.
“They set at least eight vehicles and other machinery on fire and took away workers with them [to an] unknown destination,” a senior Levies force official in Naal said.

Assailants also set ablaze many vehicles; incident comes days after gunmen abducted nine labourers in Mastung

The company manager, Zulfiqar Ahmed, said the attackers initially took 20 people.
 
 

“The armed men kidnapped 20 labourers from the camp but two of them were freed later on their way to an unknown destination,” Mr Ahmed said. He confirmed that the abducted workers belong to the Sindh.
The labourers were working on a road project for the D. Baluch construction company, which is building roads to connect Naal with the areas of Washuk and Basima. Officials said that at least eight vehicles were completely gutted and other machinery was damaged in the attack.
Security forces have launched a search operation in the area to find the kidnapped workers and the armed group responsible.
In the previous attack, unidentified gunmen kidnapped nine labourers as they were returning home from their work on an under-construction building site. The assailants also hijacked the pickup truck in which the workers were travelling, all at gunpoint in the Dasht area of Mastung district.
No one has claimed responsibility for either of the recent kidnapping incidents.

The opposition Congress party blamed the change of plan on Mr Modi’s fear of meeting President Donald Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, will be held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur.
The Hindu said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had not provided any reason for Mr Modi’s decision, though the paper quoted Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as saying that Mr Modi had cited the “ongoing Deepavali celebrations” as the reason for the change in plans.
The MEA announced that External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will represent Mr Modi and lead the Indian delegation at the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 27. Asean is a key pillar of India’s Act East Policy and Asia-Pacific vision, the ministry said.
 



Congress says Indian PM’s change of plans betrays his reluctance to meet Trump

The Congress claimed that Mr Modi was attending the summit virtually instead of travelling to Malaysia to avoid “being cornered” by Mr Trump.
Taking to social media platform X, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh said it was “one thing to post messages in praise of President Trump, but far too risky to be physically seen with the man who has claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia”.
“The reason why Mr Modi is not going is simple. He just doesn’t want to be cornered by President Trump who will also be there. He refused an invitation to attend the Gaza peace summit in Egypt a few weeks back, precisely for this reason,” Mr Ramesh said.
“It’s far too risky for him. The PM may well be recalling that old hit Bollywood number: “Bachke rehna re baba, bachke rehna re,” he added.
 


In a separate post on X, Mr Ramesh reacted to a news report quoting a Reliance Industries spokesperson who said the company would recalibrate its import of Russian oil to align with the priorities of the Indian government. “Modi Proposes, Reliance Disp­oses, Trump Exposes,” he said.
 






“Had a warm conversation with my dear friend, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia. Congratulated him on Malaysia’s Asean Chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits. Look forward to joining the Asean-India Summit virtually, and to further deepening the Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Mr Modi in a statement.
 






In a statement posted on social media platform ‘X’, Mr Ibrahim said he discussed details of the 47th Asean summit with Mr Modi.
“He [Prime Minister Modi] informed me that he will attend virtually due to the ongoing Deepavali celebrations in India at that time. I respect his decision and extended my greetings for a happy Deepavali to him and the entire people of India.”
The East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur will draw a host of dignitaries, including President Trump. It was expected that the venue would provide a meeting opportunity for Mr Modi and Mr Trump, especially as the India-US relations remain uneasy after Mr Trump imposed punitive tariffs on India because of India’s purchase of Russian crude oil.
The Hindu said Mr Trump and Mr Modi exchanged greetings on Deepavali on Tuesday as India-US negotiations for a trade pact continue. The two sides, however, gave differing takes on the conversation.
It said President Trump was telling a group of prominent Indian-Americans and Indian Embassy officials in the White House that the telephone call focused on a trade deal, the purchase of Russian oil and “no war with Pakistan” and the Indian sources maintained that Pakistan was not discussed during the call.
Officials had earlier given mixed signals about Mr Modi’s travel plans for Kuala Lumpur, saying that the Bihar election campaign required the PM’s attention. Earlier, President Trump had invited Mr Modi to the Sharm el-Sheikh peace summit for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but India was represented at the event by Kirti Vardhan Singh, Minister of State for External Affairs.

In his dissenting note on the court’s judgement issued in a case pertaining to the killing of Mohammad Hayat Mirza, a Karachi University student, in Turbat, Justice Minallah said that there can be “no tolerance” for such acts and conduct by law enforcement agencies and their members.
In 2020, police arrested a soldier of the Frontier Corps (FC), Shadiullah, on charges of killing Mirza and started an investigation after registering a case against him. The case was registered against the suspect on the complaint of Mohammad Murad Baloch, the brother of the deceased.
The convicted had appealed to the SC following his sentencing by a trial court. The trial court, in a judgment on January 20, 2021, convicted the appellant under Section 302(b) (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code and he was sentenced to death.
 
 

However, the SC issued its 2-1 majority verdict on Shadiullah’s plea on September 17, 2025, a written order for which was issued yesterday. According to the verdict, the death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.
The ruling was issued by a three-member bench comprising Justices Athar Minallah, Irfan Saadat Khan, and Malik Shahzad Ahmad Khan, among whom Justice Minallah dissented.
“In a society where grievances relating to enforced disappearances, use of excessive force, abuse of power, extra-judicial killings and violation of fundamental rights by law enforcement agencies are widespread, impunity in case of crimes committed against the citizens becomes the most aggravated form of transgression of law,” Justice Minallah stated.
“The gravity intensifies when a citizen falls victim to aggression by a law enforcement agency or its officers and members,” he said. “Any such act or conduct is intolerable in a society governed under the Constitution.”
Justice Minallah said that the rule of law is “eroded” when law enforcers take the law into their own hands and “arrogate to themselves the role of a judge
and an executor”, adding that the appellant had abused his position of
authority and trust.
“The officers and members are provided weapons and ammunition
for the exclusive use to protect the people and to serve them in their best
interest,” he said in his note.
“As a uniformed disciplined force, each officer and member of the FC Balochistan is presumed to be highly trained and that each would demonstrably display high standards of professionalism and exemplary conduct at all times while dealing with the civilian population for whose
benefit they have been entrusted with onerous duties and obligations,” he stated.
Deterrent punishment, he said, is not only to maintain a balance between the gravity of wrong done by a person but “also to make the offender an example for others as a preventive measure for reformation of the society”.
“In the case of heinous crimes committed with premeditation and in a gruesome manner, no leniency ought to be shown to the culprits,” Justice Minallah said.</p><small>2025-10-25 03:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/250734255b593c6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951096/rabi-wheat-target-set-at-30m-tonnes' target='_blank'><strong>Rabi wheat target set at 30m tonnes</strong></a><br><p>• Adequate water availability anticipated in Punjab, Sindh
• Sugarcane output estimated at 84.7m tonnes, rice at 9.4m tonnes
ISLAMABAD: The federal government has set a wheat production target of around 30 million tonnes for the Rabi season 2025-26, banking on adequate water availability in Punjab and Sindh — the two main wheat-producing provinces.
The wheat production target for the Rabi season 2024-25 was set at 27.92m tonnes, but the government exceeded it by achieving 28.42m tonnes.
The target for 2025-26 was approved at a meeting of the Federal Committee on Agriculture (FCA), which also finalised the wheat policy to ensure farmers receive fair support prices, enabling them to cover production costs and earn reasonable profit margins, according to a statement issued by the Ministry of National Food Security and Research on Friday.
In light of recent floods, the FCA recommended launching a campaign for early wheat sowing, ensuring the availability of quality certified seed of improved varieties through a track-and-trace system, timely and affordable fertiliser supply, and the proper use of herbicides. It also called for wider dissemination of production technology through electronic and print media, greater access to agricultural credit, and bringing cultivable and barren wastelands under wheat cultivation through corporate farming.
 
 

Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain, who presided over the FCA meeting, said the policy reflects the government’s commitment to safeguarding farmers’ interests and achieving self-sufficiency in staple food commodities.
Production targets for other Rabi crops were fixed at 393,000 tonnes for gram, 8.916 million tonnes for potato, 2.788m tonnes for onion, and 659,000 tonnes for tomato. The committee also reviewed seed availability for Rabi crops.
The director general of the Federal Seed Certification and Registration Department informed the meeting that the availability of certified seed for Rabi 2025-26 will remain satisfactory.
Regarding water availability, the Irsa Advisory Committee anticipated no shortage of water for Punjab and Sindh during Rabi 2025-26, allocating 33.814m acre-feet (MAF) of water to the provinces.
 
 

The Meteorological Department informed the meeting that below-normal precipitation is expected in most parts of the country during November and December, while near-normal rainfall is likely in January 2026.
The committee emphasised the use of new wheat seed varieties for improved production, suggesting the sowing of drought-tolerant and rust-resistant varieties, and the development of high-yielding, heat-tolerant varieties in response to climate change. It also called for strengthening provincial seed production systems and building farmers’ capacity to produce and maintain pure seed varieties.
The FCA highlighted the need to prevent curtailment of agricultural land to ensure maximum cultivation area and urged the use of innovative technologies, such as those developed by Suparco and the Land Information and Manag­ement System, for production forecasting and better planning. The committee also stressed the adoption of climate-smart agriculture techniques.
The meeting was informed that sugarcane production for 2025-26 is provisionally estimated at 84.7m tonnes from an area of 1.146m hectares, showing an increase of 5.5 per cent in area and 5.9pc in production over FCA targets.
Rice production for 2025-26 is estimated at 9.417m tonnes from an area of 3.039m hectares, indicating an increase of 21.9pc in area and 2.7pc in production compared to targets. Mungbean production is estimated at 150,800 tons. The availability of certified wheat seed for Rabi 2025-26 will meet 44pc of the total requirement.
 
 

In line with the government’s agenda to promote the agriculture sector, the minister appreciated the State Bank of Pakistan’s efforts to enhance agricultural credit flow. The SBP has set an indicative agricultural credit disbursement target of Rs2.572 trillion for fiscal year 2025 — 16.3 per cent higher than the preceding year’s Rs2.250tr.
Currently, 47 financial institutions are providing agricultural loans, including five major commercial banks, 13 medium-sized private banks, six Islamic banks, two specialised banks (ZTBL and PPCBL), 11 microfinance banks, and 10 microfinance institutions or rural support programmes.
During FY25, lending institutions disbursed Rs2.577tr, achieving 100.2pc of the annual target and recording 16.3pc growth compared to Rs2.215tr disbursed in the corresponding period last year. The committee was also informed that the supply of urea and DAP fertilisers is expected to remain stable during the upcoming Rabi season.
The minister reiterated the government’s resolve to ensure food security through coordinated federal and provincial efforts. He said farmers are the backbone of the country’s progress, and their prosperity remains a top government priority.
He also underscored the importance of timely policy implementation, impr­oved irrigation management, mechanisation, and greater investment in research and development to ensure sustainable agricultural growth.

Officials denied reports that Islamabad had partially opened the border crossing at Chaman for Afghan transit trade. Even pedestrians are not allowed to cross the border from both sides, they added.
“The border has been closed for the last 12 days and not opened for any commercial activities so far, including transit trade,” a senior customs official told Dawn.
The official added that there were very few transit trade trucks parked at the Chaman crossing.
The district administration officials also said that they have not yet received any instructions from the authorities from Islamabad about the opening of the border.
 
 

The border opens for a very limited time for Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi, to return to their home country.
Officials said only vehicles repatriating the household goods of Afghan refugees and returning to their country via the Chaman border were allowed to travel through the border.
However, traders hope that the situation would be relaxed after a meeting between officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul today.
‘Customs staff ready’
Separately, the FBR announced that customs staffers are stationed at border points and ready to resume the clearance process as soon as it reopens and the situation returns to normal.
The announcement from the tax department follows the build-up of over 1,000 trucks loaded with transit cargo, export consignments, and imported goods at the border stations with Afghanistan.
The disruption stems from the suspension of customs clearance for both exports and imports at major border crossings — Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective Oct 12, and at the Chaman border from Oct 15.
An official announcement of the FBR said that bilateral trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan is temporarily halted due to security concerns at the border customs stations
Before the suspension of bilateral trade took effect, customs officials successfully processed and cleared 363 import vehicles at Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda crossings, falling under the jurisdiction of Northern region of Appraisement.
At Torkham, clearance of 23 import vehicles remains pending due to the failure of importers to file goods declarations. The vehicles are carrying non-perishable items such as fabric, paint, peanuts, and pulses. Customs authorities are expected to process the consignments promptly once the required declarations are submitted by the respective importers or their clearing agents.
With respect to exports, 255 vehicles remain parked inside the Torkham terminal due to the ongoing border closure, while around 200 more are stranded along the Jamrud–Landi Kotal road. Meanwhile, no import vehicles are pending clearance at the Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda border stations.
Customs clearance operations at the Chaman Border Customs Station have remained suspended since Oct 15. As a result, five import vehicles and 23 export consignments are currently awaiting processing. Notably, the exporters have opted not to dray off their consignments, choosing instead to wait for the resumption of cross-border trade.
In terms of transit cargo, approximately 495 vehicles are queued for border crossing at Torkham and Chaman. Of these, the majority — 412 vehicles — are stranded at Chaman, while the remaining 83 are held up at Torkham, the announcement added.

• Calls for allowing KP CM Afridi’s meeting with Imran Khan
• KP’s Kundi says his office will play role of bridge between Centre and province
PESHAWAR: Punjab Gov­ernor Sardar Saleem Haider Khan on Friday said the alliance between his PPP and the PML-N was a political “compulsion” rather than an act of affection, aimed at maintaining political stability after the 2024 general elections.
“At least two parties had to join forces for the formation of the government,” he added while addressing a press conference with his Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa counterpart Faisal Karim Kundi at the Governor’s House in Peshawar.
The Punjab governor noted that the alliance serves the country’s interests. “Pakistan is our top priority,” he added.
Mr Khan conceded that party workers from both sides were finding it difficult to accept the alliance.
 
 

“The PPP’s inclusion in the government was borne out of necessity, not choice, and it has come at a political cost for our party,” he said, warning that even a minor irresponsibility could derail the system.
Mr Khan further said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had assured the PPP that its concerns would be addressed soon, even though PML-N leaders had admitted they could not meet several commitments.
CM’s meeting with Imran
The Punjab governor also said that KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi should “definitely” be allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan.
“There is democracy [in the country], and in my view, politicians should be dealt with in a political manner. The court has given [Mr Afridi] the permission to meet [Imran Khan], and if there is no legal hindrance, I see no reason why the meeting should not take place,” he said in response to a question.
He also urged the KP government to have working relations with the federal government.
“You need to hold talks to get your rights though a political process,” he added.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

He said the PPP owned the 26th Constitution Amend­ment and it was not rolled out of compulsion, noting that it would not have become possible without his party’s support.
The Punjab governor said that his party had no knowledge about the 27th Consti­tution Amendment, adding that the PPP would only back it if is satisfied there was nothing wrong in it.
‘Role of bridge’
Speaking on the occasion, KP Governor Kundi said CM Afridi recently took oath and his cabinet was yet to be finalised as he was in Rawalpindi to meet his party’s founder.
“I understand that every political party has its own age­nda but whenever it involves province, I have already suggested a parliamentary jirga should be formed to talk to the federal government,” he said, noting that issues could be discussed in Council of Common Interest meetings.
He said that after merger of the tribal districts with KP, the province’s population had increased, adding that the PM had committed to hold meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) in August but it was delayed due to floods.
“My doors are open. The Governor’s House will play role as a bridge between the provincial and federal government for peace and development of the province.”
While talking about military operations in the province, Mr Kundi said the instable law and order situation in the merged districts was worsening with each passing day. “There is no other way except for intelligence-based operations.”
He said representatives of the federal government visited Kabul and the Afghan interim government was asked not to allow India and Israel use its land against Pakistan.
Mr Kundi noted that 80 per cent of the militant attacks in KP were being carried out in connivance with Afghanistan, adding that except for a facilitator, all the attackers on police training schools in Dera Ismail Khan were Afghan nationals.

• SIC chief rejects ‘politics of violence’ under Barelvi banner
ISLAMABAD: With the government’s ban on Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) now in force, the once-influential religio-political group finds itself increasingly isolated as, unlike after the previous ban in 2021, no major religious or political party has come forward in its defence this time around.
The Ministry of Interior on Friday formally notified the ban on TLP, a day after the Punjab government’s proposal was ratified by the federal cabinet.
The notification, SRO 2011(1) of 2025, highlighted that the TLP has been declared a proscribed organisation under Section 11B(1)(a) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) 1997 and placed on the Act’s First Schedule.
The party may appeal to a review committee comprising officers of the Ministry of Law and Justice and the Ministry of Interior within 30 days.
The National Counter Terrorism Authority (Nacta) has issued an advisory to all provinces, law enforcement agencies, the banking sector, the Election Commission and other stakeholders regarding restrictions applicable to entities listed on Schedule I.
 
 

These include sealing party offices; curbs on promotional material (literature, posters, banners, printed and digital content); a bar on press statements and press conferences; financial sanctions and prohibitions on financial support; and limits on political and social activity.
Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah claimed on Friday that the TLP was “created in a bid to cut into PML-N’s vote bank”, Dawn.com reported.
Speaking to Geo News, Mr Sanaullah, in response to a question regarding TLP’s future as a political party and whether it was being kept as an option to be used against rival political parties, agreed that TLP had been used in the past for that purpose. The group “was created to steal votes from the PML-N’s vote bank”, he said.
However, he denied that TLP’s current fate had anything to do with its previous use as a proxy group, stating that “it was up to the federal cabinet to decide on any dissolution plans”.
The TLP has become the third religio-political party, and the first from the Barelvi school of thought, to be declared proscribed. It’s also the first political party to be proscribed twice, as it was briefly banned in 2021 by the PTI-led government. That ban was lifted after the party reportedly pledged to renounce violence.
Asked if the government was open to negotiating with the now-banned group if it provided any assurances, Mr Sanaullah said, “I think there can be no reassurance after you have already violated reassurances that were made previously”.
On a question on whether TLP can still contest elections as a political party, the PM’s aide said: “It is very difficult for a party to function while they are banned under the ATA” and maintained that “the party cannot take part in any elections”.
 
 

Earlier bans under the ATA have targeted groups across the spectrum. Sipah-i-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) and Tehreek-i-Jafria Pakistan (TJP) were banned in 2002. Both had sympathisers in political and religious circles.
TJP remained part of the Muttahida Majlis-i-Amal (MMA) as well as the Milli Yakjehti Council (MYC). The SSP, with support largely within Deobandi networks and some former militant groups, later saw one of its leaders elected to the National Assembly.
By contrast, no major religious group from any of the country’s four main sects, nor any political party, has publicly extended support to the TLP following the latest decision.
One reason no group is backing the TLP is that most political and non-political organisations seem hopeful that the leaders and workers of the banned group would now join their original parties that they belonged to before 2015.
Mosques sealed
Following the announcement, the Punjab government moved to seal and take over mosques linked to TLP supporters.
Hafiz Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi, member of the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) and part of the first official negotiating team in 2021, opposed any move that would obstruct prayers.
Social media speculation suggested that mosques linked to Barelvi adherents might be handed over to Deobandi administrators. However, Mr Ashrafi later clarified that no such transfer would take place.
The Tanzeemat Ahl-i-Sunnat Pakistan — an umbrella body of almost all political and non-political groups of the Barelvi sect, but which the TLP never joined — raised concerns over mosque takeovers. Senior leader Mufti Gulzar Naeemi said they suspected the Punjab Auqaf Department’s actions.
“After negotiations with the Islamabad administration and other districts of Punjab, all sealed mosques have been reopened for prayers, and where prayer leaders had gone into hiding, replacement clerics have been appointed by the Auqaf Department in consultation with Tanzeemat,” Mufti Naeemi said.
TLP’s leadership originally belonged to the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC). The late Allama Khadim Hussain Rizvi founded TLP in 2015, primarily focusing on issues related to the honour of the finality of Prophethood.
SIC chief Sahibzada Hamid Raza said, “We have always objected to the politics of violence from any platform belonging to the Barelvi school of thought because it will be more harmful for the whole nation compared to the benefits achieved out of that struggle.”
In 2021, prominent figures Mufti Muneebur Rehman, businessman Aqeel Karim Dhedhi (AKD) and Saylani Welfare Trust Chairman Bashir Qureshi acted as guarantors for the TLP in talks that led to the lifting of the earlier ban.
However, Mufti Muneeb has remained silent after the latest ban. Sources said Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi recently met Mufti Muneeb and reminded him of the October 2021 undertaking that TLP would not take the law into its own hands or challenge the writ of the state.
Mr Ashrafi told Dawn that the TLP had “constantly violated its own commitments” and alienated senior clerics by “harassing or misbehaving” with them.
“They ridiculed everyone who tried to pacify them; that is why nobody wants to speak on their behalf now,” he said.
