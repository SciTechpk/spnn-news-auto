Pakistan won the series opener by 14 runs but dropped the second match by two wickets to set up a Sunday night decider at Lauderhill, Florida.
After winning the toss and choosing to bat first, Pakistan were rewarded with a powerhouse performance by Farhan and Ayub.
 






Pakistan went 189 for four as Farhan hammered the hosts for 74 runs on 53 balls, smashing five sixes and three fours, while Ayub lasted 19 overs, finishing on 66 from 49 balls with two sixes and four fours.
Farhan was caught by West Indies captain Shai Hope at long off from a delivery by Shamar Joseph on the second ball of the 17th over.
Hasan Nawaz entered but was retired after only 15 runs, caught by Romario Shepherd at long off from a delivery by Roston Chase on the penultimate ball of the 18th over.
Mohammad Haris was run out for only two runs by Gudakesh Motie to start the 19th over and Ayub finally exited on the last ball of the penultimate over,
Jason Holder’s delivery grabbed by Sherfane Rutherford at sweeper cover.
Set 190 to win, West Indies struck for 30 runs on the first 10 balls from Hasan Ali and Mohammad Nawaz.
Jewel Andrew was caught by Hasan Ali at long on, bowled by Haris Rauf for 24, the first West Indies wicket falling at 44.
Ayub caught Hope bowled out by Nawaz for seven in the ninth over with the hosts still 116 runs from victory.
Alick Athanaze lasted 13 overs before being taken for 60, caught by Khushdil Shah bowled by Ayub with West Indies on 110, needing 80 runs off the last 42 deliveries.
Chase was retired on the last ball of the 17th over and his replacement, last-ball hero Holder from the win a night earlier, was bowled out by Sufiyan Muqeem two balls later for a duck, leaving the hosts 41 runs shy with 16 balls remaining.
Rutherford smashed a six to reach a half-century with seven balls remaining before exiting on 51 as West Indies couldn’t pull off another last-over comeback.
President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated the cricket team on their win, praising their determination and teamwork.
“Pakistani players won hearts by playing their best game,” he said in a statement. “Hopefully the national team will continue to achieve successes in the future.”

The additional duties were revised just a day after US President Donald Trump announced on social media that he would help Pakistan develop its ‘vast oil reserves’.
The new trade deal — reached with the US just a day before the extended pause in the implementation of the global reciprocal tariffs was to end on August 1 — gives Pakistan a big duty advantage over India, which is hit with 25pc valorem duties and a slight edge over other competitors like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Vietnam who have been slapped with 20pc import duties.
President Trump had announced his higher ad valorem duties  — in addition to a universal 10pc base tariff — on dozens of countries running a trade surplus with America on April 2. In his executive order, he had stated that the “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States that has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States”.
Pakistan ran a trade surplus of $5.2 billion in 2024, with its total goods exports totalling $5.1bn and imports $2.1bn. The trade surplus showed an increase of 5.2pc over the previous year.
The additional tariffs were, however, suspended, initially until July 9 and later until July 31, in less than a week of their announcement to give the affected countries time to renegotiate new trade deals with the US.

Some of the peer countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand, which were at a much higher bracket before, got better treatment by Trump’s tariffs and are almost at par with Pakistan now

Commenting on the conclusion of the trade agreement with the US, Pakistan’s finance ministry said the deal gives the country a major opportunity to expand its footprint in the American market.
“In particular, this tariff level is expected to support Pakistan’s export potential, especially in key sectors such as textiles, which remain the backbone of the country’s export economy,” the ministry highlighted. The statement noted that the decision reflected a “balanced and forward-looking approach by the US authorities, keeping Pakistan competitive relative to other South and Southeast Asian countries”.
The Pakistan government, it went on, “looks forward to further positive engagements and close cooperation with the United States in the areas of investment, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, mines & minerals, energy, and other emerging sectors.”
Trade and investment have to go hand in hand, said the country’s finance minister. He said that the bilateral and strategic partnership has come up prominently, adding, “I think we are in a good place today… in terms of where we have arrived before August 1.”
There is also satisfaction locally that Pakistan’s tariff rate is much lower than arch-rival India’s, CNN noted. Fears in Islamabad that India was trying to isolate Pakistan financially have been somewhat tempered by the 25pc tariff rate that the Trump administration hit New Delhi with after talks bogged down over access to its agriculture sector. On top of that, India also faces an unspecified penalty for its purchases of Russian oil.
Adviser to the finance minister Khurram Schehzad noted that the “deal signals a strategic deepening of economic ties and shared growth. The way Pakistan has been treated compared to different countries in this region, very encouraging and important,” he said, referring to the higher levy imposed on India. He also wrote on X that Pakistan is possibly the only country to which the US has offered its investments, as well as a competitive trade deal.
Nevertheless, some textile exporters like Interloop’s Mus­addiq Zulq­ernain cautioned against attaching too many hopes to the reduced tariff. “It, indeed, is a good development, given the fact that a higher tariff could have hit us. That we got a deal on par with our peers is absolutely an advantage.”
However, he said, “the higher tariff on India will not help us increase our goods exports to the US because Indian industry is way more competitive than ours. If we want to capture India’s market share in the US, we would have to work on enhancing our competitiveness.”
Then, he pointed out, India is still negotiating a new deal with Washington in spite of the initial setback. “What if it succeeds in clinching a better deal than ours, say, in the next few weeks or even a couple of months?” That’s not all.
“We don’t yet know if our agreement is final and aligns with the US on economic and national-security matters (as demanded by President Tru­mp)”. Pakistan falls in the category of countries which, according to the July 31 executive order of President Trump, have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States.
“The order states that the countries failing to reach an agreement on security commitments with the US could face a higher tariff. The situation remains a bit uncertain even if the revised duty structure provides us with some sort of clarity for the next few months,” he argued.
President Trump’s executive order says “… some trading partners have agreed to, or are on the verge of agreeing to, meaningful trade and security commitments with the United States, thus signaling their sincere intentions to permanently remedy the trade barriers that have contributed to the national emergency declared in (the previous executive order of April 2), and to align with the United States on economic and national security matters.”
It goes on: “other trading partners, despite having engaged in negotiations, have offered terms that, in my judgment, do not sufficiently address imbalances in our trading relationship or have failed to align sufficiently with the US on economic and national-security matters.”
According to the executive order, if a trading partner fails to take “adequate steps” to address the tariffs or retaliates against the US, Washington could take additional action. It says the countries failing to conclude meaningful trade and security commitments with the US could face 10pc and ad valorem duties on top of reciprocal tariffs.
In a note, Topline Security maintains that the trade deal with the US is largely neutral. “Unlike the market vibes and perception after the US president tweeted about the signing of a deal with Pakistan, the pact seems to be less exciting for Pakistan.” It also points out that some of the peer countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and Thailand, which were at a much higher bracket before, got a better treatment and are almost at par with Pakistan now.
Vietnam was initially imposed with tariffs of 46pc and Bangladesh was hit with a tariff of 37pc. Others like Sri Lanka and Thailand have also got better terms than previously proposed.
Textile comprises 75-80pc of Pakistan’s exports to the US, the brokerage said. In textiles and clothing, it said, Pakistan largely competes with China, India, Vietnam, Cambodia, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. “The duties imposed on China, Cambodia, Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh were much higher than those on Pakistan initially. However, the revised duties are more or less equal to Pakistan, thus leaving no competitive edge to Pakistan, in our view, except for cheaper labour.
“This deal will nonetheless help the country to remain competitive with direct competitors, without giving it any significant advantage over its peers.” It further states that China’s talks will further determine the competitiveness of Pakistan and other countries facing a deadline of August 12, since Beijing is the US’s largest supplier.
The US is Pakistan’s single largest export market. Recently, Pakistan’s goods exports to the US have consistently increased. In the first 11 months of FY25, exports to the US rose by 11.06pc to over $5.5bn from nearly $5bn a year earlier. In FY24, Pakistan’s textiles exports to the US reached $5bn, representing 92pc of its overall exports to that country.
Khurram Mukhtar, former chairman of the Pakistan Textile Exporters Association, says the country’s exports to the US are already rising. “The American buyers are very bullish on Pakistan at the moment because we have the entire supply chain here. But if we want to take advantage of the lower tariff than our competitors, we will have to improve our competitiveness by reducing our cost of doing business.”

The International Organization for Migration’s country chief of mission, Abdusattor Esoev, told AFP that “as of last night, 68 people aboard the boat were killed, but only 12 out of 157 have been rescued so far. The fate of the missing is still unknown.”
On Sunday, two security sources in southern Yemen’s Abyan province — a frequent destination for migrant smuggling boats — gave a preliminary toll of 27 killed in the shipwreck.
Despite the war that has ravaged Yemen since 2014, the impoverished country has remained a key transit point for irregular migration, in particular from Ethiopia which itself has been roiled by ethnic conflict.
Each yeah, thousands brave the so-called “Eastern Route” from Djibouti to Yemen across the Red Sea, in the hope of eventually reaching oil-rich Gulf countries.
The vessel that sank off the coast of Yemen’s Abyan was carrying mostly Ethiopian migrants, according to the province’s security directorate.
It said on Sunday that security forces were conducting operations to recover a “significant” number of bodies.
Last month, at least eight people died after smugglers had forced migrants to disembark from a boat in the Red Sea, according to the UN’s migration agency.
The International Organization for Migration says tens of thousands of migrants have become stranded in Yemen and suffer abuse and exploitation during their journeys.
Last year, the IOM recorded at least 558 deaths on the Red Sea route, with 462 resulting from shipwrecks.</p><small>2025-08-04 06:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/041057439d08bcd.jpg?r=110120' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928551/couple-shot-dead-over-honour-in-rajanpur-a-year-after-love-marriage' target='_blank'><strong>Couple shot dead over ‘honour’ in Rajanpur a year after love marriage</strong></a><br><p>DERA GHAZI KHAN: A man and a woman who had married of their own free will a year ago were shot dead on Sunday, allegedly by the woman’s brother in the jurisdiction of Muhammad Pur Dewan police station in Rajanpur district.
Rajanpur District Police Officer (DPO) Farooq Amjad told Dawn that Saqlain, son of Ghulam Sadiq, a resident of Muhammad Pur Dewan, had contracted marriage with Ayesha Bibi, a year ago, without the consent of her family.
He said that on Sunday, when the couple was in their house, the armed suspect barged in and opened indiscriminate fire, leaving his sister and her husband dead on the spot.
The DPO said that on being informed of the incident, the police acted promptly and arrested the suspect.
 
 

The police, after collecting evidence from the crime scene, moved the bodies to the hospital for autopsy.
According to initial investigation, the double murder was committed over ‘honour’. A case is yet to be registered.
NOSE CHOPPED OFF: Four assailants chopped off the nose of a man in a brutal attack in the limits of Kot Mubarak police station on Sunday.
According to the police, four men attacked Jumma Oghani, a resident of Jumma Chowk, and after overpowering him, chopped off his nose with a sharp object, leaving him seriously injured.
The injured man was shifted to hospital.
Police sources say that the victim was in litigation with the attackers.
Police are conducting raids to apprehend the culprits.

On the other hand, the railways has earned a record revenue of over Rs7.48bn in the first month (July) of the ongoing fiscal year 2025-26. The revenue is Rs1.46bn more than the July of the last fiscal, Dawn has learnt.
“During the last couple of fiscal years, we did a lot of repair work at the railway track in Sukkur division—the most troubled area in terms of decaying railway track. Due to massive works, wherein we even replaced various decaying stretches of the track (ML-1) with new ones, the number of derailments declined. Now the track in Sukkur division has improved compared to the past,” PR Chief Executive Officer Amir Ali Baloch explained by phone when asked why the PR was not focusing on the track rehabilitation.
 
 

Speaking to Dawn on Sunday, he said that despite meager financial resources, the PR has improved its passenger and freight train operations and other revenue streams. Under the federal government’s Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) for the FY 2025-26, Rs22bn has been given to the railways. Of these, Rs12bn would be spent only on the infrastructure-related projects including tracks’ rehabilitation and repair of signaling and communication systems.

Targets Rs100bn revenue by the end of fiscal in June next year

Mr Baloch said the PR had succeeded in massively decreasing its dependency on the federal government as the department was meeting most of its expenses with its own financial resources.
“We didn’t get even a single penny from the federal government for refurbishment of passengers coaches, turning Lahore and other major railway stations into modern ones having escalators, state of the art toilets, washrooms, waiting rooms, dining rooms, dining on wheels, provision of WiFi service in trains, vigilance, online booking, track tracking and several other developments,” Mr Baloch said, adding that the number of accidents caused by derailments were declining fast compared to the situation with previous years.
Talking about income of the railways, the CEO said: “While July 2025-26 figure shows that revenue earned this month was Rs1.46bn more than the last year’s July,by end of the ongoing fiscal year on June 30 next year, the department is most likely to touch a figure of Rs100bn”.
 
 

It is pertinent to mention that in the last fiscal that ended on June 30, the railways had earned Rs93bn that included Rs47bn and Rs31bn from passenger and freight trains, respectively. Rs1.5bn were earned through military goods operation through rail, Rs3bn from other coaches’ operations and Rs9bn from other miscellaneous resources.
In the year 2023-24, the PR had earned Rs88bn revenue, Rs15bn more than the target. In 2018-19, the PR’s total income touched the figure of Rs45bn that increased to Rs48.5bn in 2020-21 and Rs63.5bn in 2022-23 fiscal years.
In 2024-25, the railways Karachi division remained on top in passenger revenue with Rs15bn, followed by Lahore with over Rs11bn. In the freight sector, the Karachi division topped with a record earning of Rs28bn, followed by Multan division that earned Rs1bn.
“Though we are already doing our best to improve our operations and revenues, we aim to make our train operations safer and more comfortable for the passengers,” the railways CEO claimed.

That is a major policy shift in Washington.
Announcing a trade deal with Pakistan last Thursday, Washington vowed to develop “massive oil reserves” in the country. “We have just concluded a Deal with the Country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves. We are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling oil to India someday!” Trump wrote on Truth Social. That was a teasing comment for India, and it took some by surprise.
However, the question that began circulating immediately after was: Where is that massive resource located, and how big is it?
Pakistan has limited domestic energy resources. To meet its energy requirements, Pakistan is dependent on imports. State Bank data indicates that oil is its biggest import item — $11.3 billion in the year that ended June 2025 — accounting for nearly a fifth of the total import bill of the country.
Hitting crude oil and gas reserves in the country has been a long-held dream of Islamabad. Every successive government in Pakistan has aspired to tap the black gold reserves in the country, indeed, if any. Success has been elusive. Lack of incentives, proper policies, and non-availability of foolproof security have been cited as the major reasons behind this lack of success.

Security concerns and the requirement of massive inflows have in the past deterred investments in the country’s possible resources

In the past decade, too, the possibility of reserves was reported. But those were not ‘massive’. In 2015, a US Energy Information Administration report estimated up to 9.1bn barrels of technically recoverable shale oil in Pakistan, primarily in the Sembar and Ranikot formations — but these too remain unproven and speculative, says a source now based in Sicily, Italy.
According to the source, a more conservative 2017 US Geological Survey (USGS) assessment put the mean technically recoverable oil at only 164 million barrels, along with natural gas estimates; still not considered as proven reserves.
Exploring shale deposits needs considerable investment. To attract that, a secure environment is essential. That has been missing in Pakistan. In the absence of such an environment, oil majors were not interested in looking at the existing possibility and investing in Pakistan. In fact, over the last couple of decades, one could recall global oil majors, including Occidental Petroleum, Union Texas Pakistan, Eni of Italy and a few other smaller ones, exiting Pakistan. That presents a dismal outlook for Pakistan’s oil and gas sector.

But why has there been an abrupt U-turn in the US’s attitude towards Pakistan? After all, until recently, Islamabad was not a priority for Washington

What does the announcement about massive oil reserves in Pakistan mean? Has the security situation changed? Has there been any new interesting finds reported from Pakistan recently?
Late September last year, local and international media were buzzing with reports of a ‘massive’ oil and gas find in the offshore territory of Pakistan. According to some estimates, the find could be the “fourth largest” oil and gas reserve in the world.
The results of the find were made public after three years of extensive geological survey, conducted in partnership with an ‘allied nation’, reports then said. Who that ally was, it was not revealed then and remains a matter of speculation. There are, though, some indications that it could be Saudi Aramco. Some reports, however, felt the Emiratis could be involved in the mapping of this offshore possibility.
Some Pakistani officials were quoted in the media as saying then that the survey results confirmed the presence of massive resources in the Pakistani territory, pinpointing the exact location of the deposits. Similar announcements were also made in March 2019 when the then Prime Minister Imran Khan publicly disclosed the discovery of a massive field in the offshore territory of Pakistan. The possible find was even tipped by some as ‘Asia’s largest oil and gas reserve’.
But the announcement did not turn into a reality, and Mr Khan had to chew his words. Hours after Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that there was a chance of discovering “massive reserves at the site by next week”, the Petroleum Division denied it, saying the drill did not yield the desired results.
“ExxonMobil, ENI, PPL [Pakistan Petroleum Limited], and OGDCL [Oil & Gas Development Limited] were conducting the drill at Kekra-1. More than 5,500-metre-deep drilling was conducted, but oil and gas reserves were not found. The drilling work has now been abandoned,” an official then told DawnNewsTV. In hindsight, it appeared that the announcement was made in haste, apparently for political reasons.
But not all hopes were dashed. In 2021, while Imran Khan’s government was still at the helm in Islamabad, a renewed effort was initiated by the government to pinpoint the presence of the asset in the territorial waters of Pakistan, with the help of an ‘allied nation’.
The efforts bore results after three years of extensive surveys. Last September, a senior, unnamed, Pakistani official told the media that the find was an opportunity to capitalise on the “blue water economy,” adding that proposals for bidding and exploration are under consideration, which could lead to the commencement of exploration activities soon.
But would Pakistan be able to capitalise on this opportunity? After all such explorations required a hefty investment of around $5bn, and it might take four to five years to extract reserves from the offshore location. With oil majors not keen to get back into Pakistan, from where Pakistan could muster such investment, remained a big if.
Oil majors did not appear to be rushing over to Pakistan to obtain a piece of the cake, Alex Kimani said in his September piece in Oilprice.com. The issue was how to bring out the assets from beneath the ground, and not a lack of assets beneath the surface.
Security remained a major concern. Speaking on behalf of the government, the then Petroleum Minister, Musadik Malik, told a parliamentary committee that oil majors were not interested in offshore oil and gas exploration in Pakistan.
It comes down to security and risk versus reward, Mr Malik told the committee, emphasising that the cost of security is a major deal-breaker because “in areas where companies search for oil and gas, they have to spend a significant amount to maintain security for their employees and assets”. And the security, provided by Pakistan, has not been up to the task.
The US involvement could significantly alter the situation. That is a silver lining, for sure. But why this abrupt U-turn in the American attitude towards Pakistan? After all, until recently, Pakistan was not at all a priority in Washington’s scheme of things. For the last couple of decades, Washington has overtly preferred India over Pakistan. Why this change, now?
This entire episode can be looked at differently, too.
Donald Trump is mercurial by nature. Is he using Pakistan as a pawn to increase pressure on India to make it yield to the American demands on opening up the large Indian markets to American goods, arms, F-35s and in the process ditch Russia?
On the part of the US, is this a strategic shift towards Pakistan, or just a tactical move to put pressure on India? That is a point to ponder indeed. After all, history tells us a disturbing story. We have been stung on this front many times in the past. This time could be no different, too.

“Around 20 armed men attacked the 132kV grid station in the wee hours, causing massive damage to the grid station,” Qesco officials said on Sunday.
The armed men snatched the 12-bore rifle from the security guards and vandalised the premises while holding the staff at gunpoint. They opened fire inside the grid station, damaging the control room, high-power transformer, current transformers, conservator tank, radiator tubes, AC/DC panels, auxiliary panels, and other essential electrical equipment, according to a Qesco spokesperson.
After holding the staff and guards at gunpoint for some time, the attackers reportedly threatened them to vacate the premises immediately or risk losing their life. Subsequently, the staff and guards fled to safety.
Later, Qesco officials submitted a written complaint to the local police station to lodge an FIR against the attackers.
Separately, some men sabotaged the 132kV Yaro industrial transmission line near Kuchlak Bypass by creating a technical fault using ropes.
 
 

During a joint patrolling operation with local administration and police, nearly 700m of conductors and various electrical components were found stolen.
The electric company later filed a written request with the police to pursue legal action against those behind the transmission line theft.
The spokesperson expressed serious concern over the rising number of sabotage and theft incidents targeting power infrastructure in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Dasht, and Sibi in recent weeks. The attacks not only disrupted power supply but also posed a significant threat to public safety and national assets, he added.
The Qesco appealed to all consumers to assist in protecting national infrastructure by reporting any suspicious activity related to theft or tampering of transmission lines.

The session, summoned by President Asif Ali Zardari, is expected to witness strong protests from PTI lawmakers over the conviction of party members, the recent verdict on reserved seats and the disqualification of party leaders.
It is believed the convicted PTI MNAs will not attend the session today, fearing their arrest outside the Parliament House.
If the convicted MNAs do not turn up in the lower house of the parliament, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar will lead the PTI protest in the house.
 
 

According to the agenda of today’s NA session, eight bills will be tabled, mostly by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
These bills include the Pakistan Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, the Motor Vehicles Industry Development Bill, the Societies Registration (Amendment) Bill, the Societies Registration (Amendment) Bill, the Criminal Laws (Amendment) Bill, the Whistleblower Protec­tion and Vigilance Commission Bill, and the Pakistan Land Port Authority Bill.
Additionally, two ordinances are to be laid before the house: the Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Ordinance, 2025, by Mohsin Naqvi, and the National Agri-trade and Food Safety Authority Ordinance, 2025, by Food Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain.

This is apparent from the deterioration in public service delivery and people’s eroding confidence in the state machinery.
Weakening of the state’s institutional capacity has affected the quality of advice available to governments and meant even the most well-crafted policy cannot be effectively implemented.
The increase in the size of the civil service over the years — with federal employees now around half a million — has not made it fit for purpose or produced improvements in efficiency and reskilling of personnel. It has had the opposite effect. Around 2.4m civil servants are employed in provincial governments.
Acknowledging the need for change, Prime Mi­­nister Shehbaz Sharif recently convened a meeting where he heard proposals for reform from a committee set up earlier and chaired by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal. The committee met over a dozen times and came up with recommendations for “transition to a smart civil service”, which were placed before the PM. Iqbal’s committee has now been given a month to translate these into an action plan for the PM’s approval.
Before discussing the key proposals, it is important to place this issue in its historical context. The declining capacity of the state machinery is the cumulative result of several factors. Among these, two stand out. One, postponed reforms and two, politicisation of the civil service. After independence, governance required transforming the colonial-era administrative system into one responsive to public expectations and the needs of a developing country. For decades, this task was ignored, which left the administrative system unable to meet the requirements of modern governance.
When reform was attempted in 1973, it was limited and controversial. Various government commissions and committees were set up in the 2000s and subsequently, whose recommendations were usually not implemented. At other times, ‘reform’ efforts took the form of isolated steps in select areas and not what was needed to make the civil service competent and people-friendly. Patchwork measures instituted from time to time tinkered with the system and fell short of a transformational overhaul of the civil service. No provincial government even undertook such an endeavour.

A systemic problem needs a systemic response and not patchwork reform.

Meanwhile, politicisation of the bureaucratic and police cadres from the 1970s onwards distorted their functioning and entailed a number of damaging consequences — undermining of efficiency, erosion of authority and draining of morale. It also meant the civil service ceased to attract the best and the brightest as it once did. Merit and professionalism were cast aside by both military and civilian governments in manipulating the state machinery for political ends. They failed to see this would ultimately leave governments with less rather than more control.
 
 

It is against this backdrop that the government is contemplating reform on the basis of around 50 recommendations from the Iqbal committee. These focus on areas of recruitment, training, performance management, institutional restructuring and compensation. The proposal for greater specialisation in the civil service is a welcome one. Downsizing is missing from the top recommendations except a passing mention of the need to implement those made by another committee.
The main recommendation is the establishment of a ‘National Executive Service’ to provide for lateral entry by opening a certain percentage of senior posts at Grade 20 or above to experts in different areas from outside the civil service.
It is unclear whether NES would have both lateral entrants and career civil servants. The last time lateral entry was attempted was in 1973, with mixed results. There is little doubt that professional talent inducted from outside can inject fresh ideas, encourage innovation and bring specialised expertise to a ‘closed service’.
But if one of the aims of reform is to end the ‘elitist’ nature of the higher civil service, the proposed NEC risks setting up another elite cadre akin to the Pakistan Administrative Service and the District Management Group. Creation of another service may raise both administrative and legal issues that would have to be resolved. Perhaps lateral inductions of professionals can be done while avoiding these problems, especially the risk of politicisation to ensure candidates are not selected on political criteria. The ‘competitive and transparent process’ promised by the proposal will need to be rigorously enforced.
Instead of creating a new separate service, the government could consider identifying select ministries where outside expertise and specialisation are sorely needed and initially open these to lateral entry above grade 19. Induction should be through the Federal Public Service Commission. It would be important to ensure representation of all provinces in lateral entry inductions to preserve the federal character of the service.
Downsizing the civil service is not addressed by the reform package but is essential for reform. A bloated bureaucracy is not just a drain on the exchequer but also contributes to its dysfunctionality. No serious effort has been made in the past to ‘rightsize’ the government.
There are several ways to do this. Reduce the tiers in the bureaucratic hierarchy, merge divisions which have proliferated and abolish posts lying vacant for over three years. Another way is to ensure federal and provincial expenditures are strictly aligned with constitutional mandates, which will both save money and reduce personnel.
The reform proposals do not deal with provincial and local government structures. Yet service delivery takes place at the local and provincial level. Excluding them in the reform effort means overlooking the crucial coordination the federal government maintains with them. Meaningful reform to improve service delivery means it has to be comprehensive with a whole-of-government vision. Strong local government institutions are essential for effective service delivery. Officials argue provincial and local government structures are the purview of provincial governments. But that doesn’t mean reform suggestions cannot be made to them to consider.
Comprehensive reform should involve the following interlinked aspects: fundamental changes in recruitment and training to meet today’s governance needs, professionalising the service by acquisition of specialised skills and technological know-how, incentivising performance by clear criteria, spelling out measurable deliverables, streamlining decision-making processes for quicker decisions, merit-based promotions and weeding out deadwood and poor performers by severance packages. It is yet to be seen how far the government’s final reform proposals meet these requirements. A systemic problem needs a systemic response.

For several years, policymakers associated with the finance ministry, as well as political actors across different parties at the centre, have spoken about revising revenue transfers to the provinces to improve the federal government’s financial position.
Such a revision would have most certainly happened earlier had it not been for the compulsions of centre-province politics (especially the PPP’s strength and position on the matter) and the constitutional protection accorded to the provincial share under the 18th Amendment.
Article 160-3A currently states that “the share of the Provinces in each Award of National Finance Commission shall not be less than the share given to the Provinces in the previous Award”. The current share is 57.5 per cent.
 
 

There are no clear workarounds available at the moment. The centre managed to take out the lucrative petroleum levy from the divisible pool by calling it a developmental levy rather than a tax (which it is in all but name). However, any further change would require amending the Constitution — either by doing away with Article 160-3A that places a floor on the downward transfer, or by amending Article 160-3 to take out transferrable revenue sources. The former is more likely than the latter.
What are the political prospects of this change?
The recent reconfiguration of the ruling coalition’s National Assembly strength, through the bizarre reserved seats judgement, hands over a virtual two-thirds majority to the ruling coalition and its allies. The provincial assembly numbers have also been skewed the same way, paving the way for more favourable Senate numbers. Recent outcomes of the Senate polls from KP already show this strategy bearing fruit.

The NFC award is not some great heist that the provinces performed on an unsuspecting centre.

In any case, as demonstrated by the past year, constitutional norms hardly pose much of a challenge for the governing regime. Numbers can be conjured up and subsequently validated by the courts. A bigger unknown variable here is the PPP’s position on the matter.
The reserved seat reallocation may have slightly diluted the PPP’s importance and strengthened the PML-N, but a constitutional amendment will require everyone on the treasury benches to play along. Given its foundational role in the current NFC and the 18th Amendment, the PPP’s position has remained consistent in favour of large transfers to the provinces. It’s unclear what would compel the needle to move on this front. If the establishment decides it wants to push ahead with it, inducements and coercion will both be applied.
At a broader level, most talk around the NFC focuses on its technical and developmental dimensions. Centrists in favour of cutting the provinces’ share usually provide some or all of the following arguments:

The centre bears large expenses, such as social protection, power subsidies, pensions, defence and debt-servicing while getting a minority sum from the divisible pool.
The centre puts in the effort to raise revenue but the majority gets transferred downwards.
The provinces are profligate, choosing to spend money inefficiently, with no notable improvements in core areas of health and education.
The provinces have no incentive to raise their own revenue.
The federal government’s own incentive to raise revenues is diminishing given how little is left for it to spend.

People can agree or disagree with these arguments, but the fact remains that the current system is constitutional in nature. What revenues are to be shared has a history going back nearly a century.
What is the percentage of that share was agreed upon by all legitimate political forces through deliberations 15 years ago. Contrary to how some present it, the NFC award is not some great heist that the provinces performed on an unsuspecting centre. It was, and remains, a consensual agreement.
But there is another perspective worth considering.
The NFC is also what provides space for any semblance of civilian politics under a hybrid regime. For much of the last decade, politics at the centre has remained hostage to the compulsions of civil-military intrigue and the demands of IMF programmes. There is little space for civilian political action on the development and policy front. Consequently, there is little that they can do politics on. Survival and success at the centre is correlated with compliance rather than performance.
 
 

It is instead in the provinces where there is far more space available, thanks to the flow of finances from the centre. Parties looking to cement or recover their electoral position use provincial finances to hand out patronage or demonstrate their developmental ambitions; whether that is through expanding public sector employment, initiating social protection programmes, or building large infrastructure projects.
This should not be mistaken as a justification for profligate and inefficient spending. Provincial political elites have not delivered on many fronts and for that they should be held accountable. But the political consequences of slashing the provincial share should be considered. A hard budget constraint on provincial finances, which many envision under a revised NFC, would place limits on the space for party politics in its current form. If that is the desired end goal (and for some, it seems that it is), then the demand for a revised NFC makes sense.
However, there is another proposal that can achieve greater province-level efficiency sought by the centrists, but doesn’t close off space for party politics. Instead of limiting transfers to the provinces, an amendment should guarantee further downward transfers to local governments, provided there are elected ones in place. In the absence of elected ones, the centre can hold back a designated share from the divisible pool. This helps solve the spending efficiency issue, allows space for developmental programmes that parties can use to claim political credit, and provides an incentive to have a functional third tier.

• Punjab gears up for sixth spell of heavy rains
ISLAMABAD: At least 299 people, including 140 children, have died and more than 700 others have been injured in flash floods and torrential rains that have battered several parts of Pakistan since late June, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Sunday.
The NDMA said the deluges, which began on June 26, have left a trail of devastation across the country.  The dead include 102 men, 57 women and 140 children, while the injured include 239 children, 204 women and 272 men.
The severe weather has also caused widespread destruction, damaging a total of 1,676 houses, according to the agency’s data.
Of those, 562 homes were completely destroyed while 1,114 sustained partial damage.
The floods also led to the loss of 428 livestock, compounding the impact on local communities.
In response, the NDMA said it has carried out 223 rescue operations, successfully evacuating 2,880 people from flood-hit regions.
The authority has distributed more than 13,400 relief items to affected communities. These include almost 2,000 tents, 958 blankets, 569 quilts, 613 mattresses, and over 1,100 food packs.
Relief teams have also provided 1,282 kitchen sets, 350 life jackets, 1,122 hygiene kits, 2,170 tarpaulins, and 146 de-watering pumps, among other essential items.
Medical support has been mobilised, with 71 camps set up to treat those affected by the disaster. So far, 577 people have received medical attention.
The NDMA said the crisis has affected multiple regions, with joint relief operations underway in collaboration with provincial and federal agencies.
As per PMD’s latest forecast, rain, wind and thundershowers, with isolated heavy falls, are expected to hit the northern parts of the country, starting from August 4 till August 7.
Rainfall is expected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab, and Islamabad between these dates, while Gilgit-Baltistan will receive rainfall starting from August 5.
Meanwhile, Balochistan is forecast to experience mainly hot and humid weather, al­t­h­ough rain, wind and thundershowers are expected in the northeastern and southern parts on Aug 6.
Sindh is likely to see hot and humid conditions in most parts, with cloudy weather and light rain expected in coastal areas.
Next spell likely to be heavier
In Punjab, Director General (DG) Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Irfan Ali Kathia warned residents on Sunday to prepare for a sixth round of heavy monsoon rains starting Aug 5.
“The ongoing rains could lead to medium to high-level flooding in the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, with the risk expected to begin from Aug 5,” Mr Kathia said.
According to PDMA, monsoon rains in August are expected to be heavier than those experienced last month. Rain is predicted in dozens of districts, including Lahore, Mur­ree, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Sheikhu­pura, Faisalabad, Sargodha, Mian­wali, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawal­pur, Khanewal, and Rajanpur.
The warning advised of a specific risk of landslides in the tourist destinations of Murree and Galliyat, where weak buildings and mud houses could also be damaged.

For example, the latest edition of the relevant UN Security Council monitoring report on IS and Al Qaeda reveals that both the banned TTP and IS-K continue to operate in Afghanistan with relative freedom.
In fact, where the latter group is concerned, the report says that IS-K poses a major threat regionally and internationally. The UN document again validates what Pakistan has long been arguing — that the Afghan Taliban are not doing enough to address the presence of terrorist groups on their soil, and that these outfits pose a significant challenge to regional security.
With regard to the TTP, which has been carrying out terrorist attacks in Pakistan with regularity, the report states that the outfit has some 6,000 fighters, and that it “continued to receive … logistical and operational support” from the Afghan Taliban.
 
 

This is despite the fact that some within the Afghan Taliban were of the view that Afghanistan’s de facto rulers should distance themselves from the TTP. The document also observes that the TTP maintains ties with IS-K, Al Qaeda as well as Baloch militants.
Interestingly, the TTP seems to be ‘diversifying’ its options, as it has links with both the Afghan Taliban and IS-K, which oppose one another. The UN report points out that IS-K “is the most serious threat” regionally and internationally. For this country, it should be a matter of great concern that this dangerous group is reportedly operating “close to the Pakistani” border, where it is training suicide bombers, who include minors.
These findings should prompt the Pakistani state, regional countries as well as the international community to address the problem of militancy in Afghanistan with alacrity. Though the Foreign Office has said there has been “better receptivity” to Pakistan’s concerns in Kabul, concrete action is needed from the Afghan Taliban regime to ensure that the potpourri of terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil do not transform into a global security nightmare.
While Pakistan needs to secure its borders and ensure that TTP and IS-K terrorists are not able to enter the country and find a foothold here, on its part, Kabul must do much more to neutralise the militant threat in Afghanistan. The prospect of the TTP and IS-K joining forces is a frightening one, and this budding terrorist alliance must be nipped in the bud.
The TTP has spilt innocent blood for years in this country, while the world has witnessed the horrors that the IS is capable of inflicting in the Middle East. Therefore, urgent action is needed to address the problem of terrorist groups in Afghanistan.

• Season comes to a close with climbers returning from K2, Broad Peak ‘empty handed’
FOR mountaineers, the mighty peaks in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Karakoram range became unusually precarious this year due to changing weather patterns, which have brought with them an increase in avalanches, rockfalls and other life-threatening hazards.
The mountains are comparatively dry, having lost much snow cover, and hence prone to avalanches — sometimes several times a day.
Baqir Ali, a mountain guide with four decades of experience, said he had never experienced such conditions on the peaks in his entire career.
A resident of Shigar’s Askole village, Mr Ali was part of Laura Dahlmeier’s team. The German Olympian recently perished after being struck by a rockfall at Laila Peak (6,096m).
“Several days before the incident, a French expedition team had cancelled their plan to attempt to climb Laila Peak due to the unfavourable weather condit­ions at the peak,” the 56-year-old told Dawn.
He said he had asked the German climber to do the same, but she continued her ascent in the alpine style — and at an altitude of 5,700m, she became the victim of falling rocks on July 28.
These precarious conditions made Hungary’s László Csomor abandon his expedition to Broad Peak (8,050 m) after more than a month and return to Skardu on Saturday.
His seven-member team had been at the base camp since June 27, hoping to summit the mountain. They, however, decided to call off the adventure, like more than two hundred climbers who had come to Pakistan to ascend its mighty peaks.
“This year, there was less snow at all mountains; rockfall was unusual; we would hear the sound of rockfall and snow avalanches 10 times in a day while sitting at the base camp,” László said, adding that he climbed to Camp 3 twice, but could not start the summit push due to bad weather. He blamed these conditions on less snow cover, saying that with enough snow, such threats diminish.
He said more than 90 climbers had been waiting at the base camp to summit K-2, while 30 mountaineers had been waiting to begin the Broad Peak adventure for the last month. Both peaks share the same base camp. Most of them have had to return with heavy hearts, as the climbing season for the Karakoram peaks nears its end.
László was also a witness to two accidents during his stay at the base camp – on July 11, Polish climber Waldemar Kowalewski fractured his leg in an avalanche on Broad Peak at 6,500m; while on July 19, porter Iftikhar Sadpara lost his life in a similar incident on K2’s Camp 1, located 500m above the base camp.
At least three people were killed and five were injured in such incidents during this season.
New challenges
“These conditions at the Karakoram range were new, and it was also challenging to climb the peaks because the snow was steep and unstable,” László said, adding that a decrease in snowfall made the slopes and hanging rocks prone to falls and avalanches, while crevasses had become bigger.
High winds also made the climb difficult. The foreign climber believed these changes were linked to climate change.
Mingma G, owner of Imagine Nepal and a renowned climber, also abandoned his Gasherbrum-II summit attempt due to avalanche risks. Traditionally, the climbing season for these peaks spans late June to mid-August. But this year, the risks are unusually high, forcing scores to abandon their summits.
“The weather at the peaks is not normal this year,” said Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator. Mr Qadri told Dawn that K2, Broad Peak, Gasherbrum-II and many other seven-thousanders remained unclimbed in the summer, while a few summits at Gasherbrum-I and Nanga Parbat were recorded.
He said some climbers were still at the K2 base camp, to try their luck. However, the season is over and this summer, none of the climbers could move past Camp 3 on K2.
This year, about 22 climbers, including five Pakistanis, scaled Gasherbrum-I (8,080 m) on July 20 and July 22, whereas at least 24 mountaineers, including foreigners, summited Nanga Parbat (8,126m) in the Himalayas.
Distressing situation
Veteran Russian climber Denis Urubko and his wife Maria Cardell summitted Nanga Parbat in alpine style while also charting a new route for ascent in July. Currently, he is in Skardu and plans to scale K2 via a new route. However, he said the situation in the mountains was distressing.
“Glaciers and snow on mountains are melting fast, crevasses are becoming larger, and rockfall occurrences have become routine in the GB mountains,” Mr Urubko said.
He said the “classical route” to summit Nanga Parbat had also become a dangerous route due to speedy snowmelt, adding that these factors had made risks in the mountains higher than usual.
A senior government expert blamed these conditions on changes in the snowfall patterns induced by global warming. He said the region received snow late in the year, and it could not be converted into ice before the summer and thus remained unstable. In addition to that, the heatwave in June and July exacerbated the situation, leading to an unusual number of avalanches.
Livelihoods in danger
As mountains become precarious for climbers, the livelihoods of those who are linked to the tourism industry have also taken a hit. Out of 400 applications received by the GB tourism department, only over 200 climbers from multiple countries arrived to attempt summits, almost 50 per cent down from the previous year.
Thousands of people, including transporters, shopkeepers, hotel owners, porters, mountain guides, and tour operators, depend on the industry for income. Fida Hussain, a high-altitude porter from Shigar, feared that with the reduction of adventure tourism activities, they would also be left without jobs and income.

The results based on a survey of more than 1,100 leaders from government, industry, civil society and academia across 136 countries, paints a stark picture of mounting vulnerabilities that threaten to overwhelm international institutions and destabilise societies.
Environmental risks, including climate change inaction, large-scale pollution, and biodiversity loss, dominate the list of concerns, with the report warning that these crises are both highly likely and potentially catastrophic.
Yet, the report also highlights a worrying lack of preparedness for emerging threats such as space-based events, pandemics, and the rapid advance of frontier technologies.
The report concludes with a call from UN secretary-general for the immediate creation of a task team to strengthen the organisation’s capacity to address risks in the information ecosystem.

Environmental challenges and disinformation top list of vulnerabilities

The UN Department of Global Communications has already begun work to assess the impact of mis- and disinformation on the delivery of the UN’s mandate. The report’s authors warn that global vulnerabilities are being exacerbated by weak governance, a lack of political consensus, and the erosion of state sovereignty.
“One thing is clear when looking out on this landscape of global risk: ultimate responsibility lies with today’s leaders,” UN’s Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming said.
“They face a stark choice: breakdown, or break through to a better tomorrow — one in which we all live in peace, dignity and equality on a healthy planet.”
The survey found that multilateral institutions are least prepared to address five critical risks: outer space, cybersecurity breakdowns, the proliferation of non-state actors, mis- and disinformation, and the erosion of state sovereignty.

• Blames rupee devaluation for hike despite near same fuel prices
ISLAMABAD: The price of electricity is expected to increase by one-fourth over the next eight years, according to a power division forecast, after a 50per cent increase in the past three years due to massive currency devaluation.
The average tariff is projected at Rs29.70 per unit by 2034, up by Rs5.70 from the existing rate of Rs24, said the power division in a working paper shared with stakeholders in the last week of July.
The report said the increase in tariffs over the last three years can largely be attributed to the rupee’s depreciation which led to “second round effects of inflation and a contractionary monetary policy that further escalated overall tariff”.
The average power purchase rates increased by almost 50pc from Rs16.77 per unit to Rs24.88 between FY2022 and 2025.
This included about a 115pc increase in annual capacity charges from Rs971bn to about Rs2.1tr, although energy payments slightly dropped by 11pc from Rs1.43tr to Rs1.27tr.
All in all, power purchase rates increased by almost 250pc to Rs24.88 per unit in FY2025 from Rs7.17 per unit in FY2016 before the induction of mega power projects, mostly under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as capacity charges surged from Rs275bn to Rs2.1tr, an increase of 660pc, according to the power division.
Exchange rate impact
The power division said the average base tariff largely remained unchanged between FY2023 and FY25 in dollar terms ($0.12 per unit).
However, due to exchange rate losses, effective base rate jumped 44pc to Rs35.50 per unit from Rs25 as capacity charges increased by 66pc to Rs18.4 per unit compared to Rs11 per unit.
The energy price was reported at Rs10.94 per unit in FY25 against Rs10.2 in FY23, a nominal change. According to the power division, the capacity costs denominated in US dollars escalated from Rs11 to Rs18.4 mainly due to the depreciation of rupee against dollar from about Rs100 to Rs300.
The fuel costs generally remained flat as lower-cost generation capacities came online.
Therefore, “delinking capacity costs from impact of depreciation, and enhancing reliance on indigenous sources remains critical to ensure sustainability”, the power division advocated.
The overall tariff is further bloated by extraneous taxes and other duties, increasing the costs for the end-consumer.
Despite all efforts and reforms, both the average tariff and capacity charges would “keep growing”.
Going forward, capacity charges are estimated at Rs3.14tr in FY2034, up by 65pc, the power division said.
Deindustrialisation
The power division also confirmed “deindustrialisation” that further contracted demand.
“Increase in electricity prices made industry uncompetitive, resulting in closure of industrial units and accelerating process of deindustrialisation”, it said and reported that industrial power consumption peaked in FY22 at 34 billion units (kWh) and declined to 28bn units in FY24, “largely due to higher prices and transition to off-grid generation”.
The power division said “inefficient pricing” increased the cost of debt servicing, further burdening consumers and contracting demand.
Further compounding the issues was the fact that despite tall claims, aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses remained mostly flat — 18.9pc in FY2013 and 18.3pc in FY2024. ATC losses broadly cover the difference between units produced and recovered.
The power division forecast for slower growth in tariff — 25 to 30pc over the next decade against over 260pc in the past decade — comes on the back of an increase in generation from clean-fuel sources to 66pc by 2034 against 46pc in FY25.

As currently they produce about 41 to 42 million barrels a day, the increase would be about 1.5 per cent, though analysts believe with the Brent reference oil currently selling at about $70 a barrel, there is unlikely to be a major impact on prices.
“The eight participating countries will implement a production adjustment of 547,000 barrels per day in September 2025 from August 2025 required production level,” said a statement released after a meeting where the hike was agreed upon.
The eight key producers, which started increasing production in April, affirmed their commitment to market stability on “current healthy oil market fundamentals”, an Opec statement read.

1.5pc hike unlikely to have major impact on prices, analysts say

Oil prices have held up better than observers anticipated amid strong summer demand and a high geopolitical risk premium, notably owing to conflict between Iran and Israel.
“Opec+ has passed the first test — unwinding 2.2 million barrels per day (since April) without crashing prices or compromising unity,” said Jorge Leon, analyst at Rystad Energy. But the next task would be even harder: deciding if and when to unwind the remaining 1.66 million barrels, all while navigating geopolitical tension and preserving cohesion, Leon said.
Low oil inventories
The post-meeting statement said the decision came “in view of a steady global economic outlook and current healthy market fundamentals, as reflected in the low oil inventories.” The Opec+ countries agreed in December to start a gradual return from last April of the 2.2 million barrels per day of previous production cuts.
The latest move, a year ahead of an initial 18-month schedule, completes the unwinding and also provides for a 300,000 barrels per day tranche granted specifically to the United Arab Emirates.
The statement added that the phase-out of the additional voluntary production adjustments may be paused or reversed subject to evolving market conditions. The eight added that they will hold monthly meetings for a regular review of market conditions. For now, the return of other production cuts is to be discussed at the next Opec+ ministerial meeting at the end of November, with all 22 members.
Opec said the V8 will first meet on September 7.
In a bid to boost prices, the wider Opec+ group — comprising the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies — in recent years had agreed to three different tranches of output cuts, amounting to almost six million bpd in total.
Market experts warn that forecasting is particularly challenging given the uncertainty emanating from US President Donald Trump’s tariffs policy and its effects on global trade, as well as his 10-day deadline for Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

• Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir publicly conducts Jewish prayer in Al-Aqsa compound, sparking outrage
CAIRO: At least 46 deaths, including six from starvation or malnutrition, were reported in Gaza over the past 24 hours, local health authorities said on Sunday.
The health ministry said that six more Palestinians died of starvation or malnutrition while 40 killed in Israeli gunfire and airstrikes across the coastal enclave.
Deaths included persons trying to make their way to aid distribution points in southern and central areas of Gaza, Palestinian medics said.
Among those killed was a staff member of the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, which said an Israeli strike at their headquarters in Khan Younis in southern Gaza ignited a fire on the first floor of the building.
The new hunger-related deaths raised the toll of those dying from what international humanitarian agencies say may be an unfolding famine to 175, including 93 children, since the war began, the ministry said.
 
 

Egypt’s state-affiliated Al Qahera News TV said two trucks carrying 107 tons of diesel were set to enter Gaza, months after Israel severely restricted aid access to the enclave before easing it somewhat as starvation began to spread.
COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, said later in the day that four tankers of UN fuel had entered to help in operations of hospitals, bakeries, public kitchens and other essential services.
There was no immediate confirmation whether the two diesel fuel trucks had entered Gaza from Egypt.
Gaza’s health ministry has said fuel shortages have severely impaired hospital services, forcing doctors to focus on treating only critically ill or injured patients.
Prayer in Al-Aqsa
According to AFP, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir publicly conducted on Sunday a Jewish prayer on the Al-Aqsa compound in east Jerusalem — a highly contentious move that violates a long-held understanding at the site.
Jewish religious rituals are prohibited there by a long-standing agreement between Israel and Jordan, custodian of the site.
Ben Gvir’s Sunday visit however marked the first time a prayer was publicly recited by a government minister, according to Israeli media.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a statement saying that “Israel’s policy of maintaining the status quo on the Temple Mount has not changed and will remain unchanged”.
‘Airdrops are insufficient’
UN agencies say airdrops are insufficient and that Israel must let in far more aid by land and open up access to the territory to prevent starvation among its 2.2 million people, most of whom are displaced amidst vast swathes of rubble.
 
 

Meanwhile, Belgium’s air force dropped the first in a series of its aid packages into Gaza on Sunday in a joint operation with Jordan, the Belgian defence ministry said.
France on Friday started to air-drop 40 tons of humanitarian aid.
Looted aid trucks
The Hamas-run Gaza government media office said on Sunday that nearly 1,600 aid trucks had arrived since Israel eased restrictions late in July. However, witnesses and Hamas sources said many of those trucks have been looted by desperate displaced people and armed gangs.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he had asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to give humanitarian assistance to the hostages during a conversation with the head of the Swiss-based ICRC’s local delegation.

The party leaders, a maj­ority of whom are in Khy­ber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), have decided to att­end parliamentary sessions after getting relief from courts.
The Leader of the Opposition in National Ass­e­mbly, Omar Ayub Khan, told Dawn that all legal options would be used to get relief and till that time he and other leaders including Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza and Zartaj Gul Wazir would not attend sessions of the National Assembly and Senate.
“I have asked my lawyer Babar Awan to complete documentation and file a case. Other leaders will also do the same,” he said.
When asked in which courts, application for bails and stay orders would be filed, Omar Ayub said that applications would be filed in different courts. However, he made it clear that they would not come in public before getting bails.
Last week, Omar  Ayub refused to meet the CJP on Supreme Court premises, or in Islamabad, citing the possibility of his arrest due to warrants issued against him. Replying to a question, he said that MNA Abdul Lateef has already sought a stay order and the same will be done by other leaders.
The Peshawar High Court last week stopped the Election Commission of Pakistan from proceeding further on de-notifying a PTI MNA from Chitral Abdul Lateef and declaring his seat vacant.
A bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Dr Khurshid Iqbal issued notices to respondents including ECP and the National Assembly speaker seeking their response to a petition filed by MNA Abdul Lateef challenging the order of the ECP of disqualifying him and subsequent notification of declaring his seat vacant by de-notifying him as an MNA on July 29, 2025. The bench fixed Aug 20 for next hearing of the petition.
Mr Ayub Khan and other PTI leaders, who have been sentenced 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots, have been hoping to get a similar relief.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting against the arrest of party founder Imran Khan, had staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings.
Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including PTI leaders, were arrested.
Out of 185 PTI workers, 108 have been sentenced by the court. PTI’s MPA Junaid Afzal Sahi was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, MNA Zain Qureshi, and former party leader Fawad Chaudhry were acquitted in the cases.

• Dar welcomes ‘positive momentum’ towards free trade agreement
• Iranian president meets Zardari, army chief before wrapping up his two-day visit
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Iran on Sunday agreed that peace and prosperity in their border regions hinged on effectively combating terrorism, as both countries renewed their commitment to increase annual bilateral trade to $10 billion.
The consensus was rea­ched during a bilateral meeting at the Prime Mini­ster’s House in Islamabad and later emphasised at a joint press conference by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Iranian Presi­dent Masoud Pezeshkian. “The development of economic and trade ties will be achieved through peace, stability, and tranquillity,” Mr Pezeshkian said, underscoring that terrorism remains a key obstacle to mutual prosperity.
“Given the threats from terrorist groups in border areas, both sides emphasised the need to increase cooperation to ensure border security and safeguard the peace and well-being of citizens in border cities,” the Iranian president added.
The nearly 900-kilometre border between the two countries has long faced security threats from proscribed groups, such as Jaish al-Adl and the Balochistan Liberation Army. Persistent issues, including terrorism, smuggling, and mutual accusations of harbouring militants, have periodically strained ties.
PM Shehbaz acknowledged that security was paramount for progress in bilateral relations. “There will be zero tolerance for all forms of terrorism. If anyone falls victim to terrorism in Iran, it is the same as someone being affected by terrorism in Pakistan,” he said.
“For peace and development in our region, and along our hundreds of kilometres-long shared border, we must cooperate against terrorism and take effective steps to eliminate the scourge of terrorism once and for all,” the PM added.
While the two leaders voiced their commitment to deepening cooperation, specific operational details were reportedly discussed in President Pezeshkian’s meeting with Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir. Neither side issued a state­ment on the meeting by the time of publication.
Later in the evening, Mr Pezeshkian met senior Pakistani military leaders, including Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Babar Sidhu, and ISI chief Lt Gen Asim Malik at the presidency before the dinner reception hosted by President Asif Ali Zardari. A naval representative was also in attendance.

$10 billion trade target
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to raising annual bilateral trade to $10 billion — a target first set during the late Iranian president Ebrahim Raisi’s visit to Pakistan in April 2024.
“We can easily, in a short time, increase the volume of trade from the current $3 billion to the projected goal of $10 billion,” Mr Pezeshkian said during the joint media conference.
PM Shehbaz echoed the sentiment. “We also jointly hope that the $10bn trade target is achieved at the earliest,” he said.
Official estimates place current bilateral trade at approximately $2.8bn.
Trade has been constrained by a range of factors, including international sanctions on Iran, security concerns along the border, inadequate infrastructure, and limited economic complementarity.
Diplomatic and political fluctuations, often shaped by broader geopolitical tensions, have also affected the implementation of trade agreements.
While neither leader offered a clear roadmap to resolve these issues, both underscored a shared political will to continue engaging on them.
“Our delegations will take these discussions forward very soon,” the PM said.
Earlier, at the bilateral talks, he had emphasised the need to convene the long-delayed 22nd meeting of the Pakistan-Iran Joint Economic Commission at the earliest. The 21st meeting of the Commission was held in 2022.
Proposals discussed during the talks included facilitating barter trade, increasing export quotas for rice, fruits, and meat, operationalising cross-border markets, and removing trade barriers.
Border market development remains a key focus. Although the two countries agreed several years ago to establish six such markets, only three have become operational so far.
“The development of transit routes – railway routes and sea routes – the expansion and equipping of border markets, the facilitation of trade, and the establishment of joint free economic zones are critical needs in the relationship between the two countries, and we had constructive discussions on these issues,” Mr Pezeshkian said.
Among the documents exchanged after Sunday’s talks was a “joint ministerial statement on the intent to finalise (the) Free Trade Agreement.”
On the sidelines of the visit, a business forum was also held.
Speaking at the event, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar welcomed the “positive momentum” toward finalising the FTA, calling it a potential catalyst for strengthening bilateral trade.
12 agreements and MoUs
Pakistan and Iran signed and exchanged 12 agreements and memorandums of understanding (MoUs) to enhance cooperation across a broad spectrum of areas. The documents covered trade, transit, science and technology, tourism, agriculture, cultural exchange, maritime safety, and judicial cooperation.
The agreements include collaboration on plant quarantine, joint use of the Mirjaveh-Taftan border crossing, ICT, tourism cooperation for 2025-27, and a joint ministerial statement on finalising a Free Trade Agreement.
“We reached agreements in political, economic, commercial, and cultural fields, and signed documents to facilitate and promote cooperation in commerce, culture, tourism, transportation, and scientific and educational exchanges,” Mr Pezeshkian said.
He left for Iran after the reception at the Presidency.

While Comsats currently has a temporary rector, the position at IIUI remains vacant. Dr Mukhtar Ahmed, who had been looking after the affairs of IIUI in his capacity as chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC), completed his term on July 29 and is no longer serving as the rector.
The Ministry of Science and Technology is the line ministry for Comsats, while the Ministry of Federal Education supervises IIUI.
The post of Comsats rector has been vacant since July 2023, following the resignation of Dr Mohammad T. Afzal. Subsequently, the university’s chancellor - the then president Dr Arif Alvi - assigned the look-after charge to Senior Dean Prof Dr Sajid Qamar, who continues to serve in that capacity on an ad-hoc basis. Several other key positions at Comsats, including the registrar’s office, are also being run on a temporary basis.

Posts at public sector universities fell vacant in 2023 and since then permanent heads could not be appointed

Similar is the situation at the IIUI. The post became vacant in November 2023 after the Supreme Court removed then rector Dr Samina Malik and directed that the HEC chairman or a permanent HEC member nominated by him would oversee the rector’s responsibilities until a regular appointment was made.
Following the directive, then HEC chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed assumed additional charge as the IIUI rector. However, with the completion of his term on July 29, the university is again without a rector. Although the prime minister assigned the secretary federal education the additional charge of HEC chairman for three months or until a regular appointment, no steps have been taken to fill the IIUI rector position.
“As of today, there is no rector in our university,” said an IIUI official.
A senior officer from the Ministry of Education claimed that the process was underway to assign the charge of the rector to someone soon. However, university officials have voiced concern over why the position has remained vacant since October last year despite the court’s directive.
Meanwhile, the issue of Comsats’ rector has seen even longer delays. In September 2023, following a competitive selection process, a panel of three candidates was submitted to the President’s Office for final approval. After thorough consideration, President Asif Ali Zardari in his capacity as the Comsats Chancellor approved the appointment of Dr Shahid Munir with the Ministry of Science and Technology issuing a notification on September 23, 2024.
However, Dr Munir did not take charge as Comsats rector as he was appointed Vice Chancellor of the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), Lahore, on the same day. Since then, the matter has remained unresolved.
According to a Comsats official, the issue is likely to be resolved soon, as the university’s senate, its supreme decision-making body, was expected to meet in the third week of August to deliberate on the appointment.

Mr Niazi was taken into custody near the shrine of Baba Shadi Shaheed in Bhimber district while returning from Samahni to Bhimber city—constituency of incumbent AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq—to lead another rally as part of PTI’s mobilisation campaign for the August 5 protests, called by the party’s incarcerated founder Imran Khan.
Mr Niazi had spent Saturday night in Mirpur but, anticipating his arrest, left his accommodation via a back exit and used someone else’s vehicle to reach Samahni.
There, he led a rally from Pir Galli to Samahni from 2pm to 4pm, urging people to participate in large numbers in the upcoming protest against both the “unlawful arrest” of Mr Khan and India’s abrogation of occupied Jammu and Kashmir’s special status six years ago.
According to Mr Niazi’s press secretary, Habib Ahmed, a large contingent of police led by SSP Mirpur Khurram Iqbal intercepted his entourage and detained him.
Mr Niazi was among several PTI leaders—including former President Dr Arif Alvi—who were booked on November 24 last year at Karachi Company police station in Islamabad under seven sections of the Pakistan Penal Code, two provisions of the Anti-Terrorism Act, and one clause of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Ordinance.
His nephew, Advocate Sardar Moteeb, told Dawn that Mr Niazi had secured protective bail from the Islamabad High Court on July 13, which was further extended on July 26 until August 17.
“Despite this, Islamabad police had new arrest warrants issued based on additional charges,” he said.
Eyewitnesses said that apart from AJK policemen, the arresting party included nearly 20 plainclothed officials, reportedly from Islamabad police.
However, DIG Mirpur region Dr Liaqat Ali clarified to Dawn that Mr Niazi was taken into custody on the orders of the Mirpur deputy commissioner under Section 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).
“Given his health condition, he has been kept at the Industrial Area rest house in Mirpur, which has been declared a sub-jail by the deputy commissioner,” he added.
The DIG also rejected reports that two PTI activists accompanying Mr Niazi were also arrested.
Soon after news of Mr Niazi’s arrest spread across the region, PTI workers staged protest demonstrations in various areas, blocking roads and burning tyres.
Meanwhile, in a statement issued from the United States, where he is currently on a private visit, PTI regional information secretary and former minister Chaudhry Maqbool Gujjar condemned what he called the “uncalled-for arrest” of Mr Niazi on “frivolous charges,” accusing Prime Minister Haq of betrayal.
“Anwarul Haq owes his return to the AJK Assembly after a decade to PTI’s platform and Imran Khan’s personal campaigning. It’s shameful that the same man is now ordering crackdowns on party workers who are peacefully demanding Khan Sahib’s release,” he said.

They were addressing a joint press conference in their newly-established district office in Shahmansoor Town here on Sunday flanked by various other leaders of the party.
Mr Qaiser said: “With the August 5 rally, we are launching a movement for the release of our leader, securing the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law in the country.”
Tarakai said: “The central and provincial leaders and the allied partners have decided that this time, there will be various protests. This is a movement and we will continue it till achieving our goals.”

Qaiser, Tarakai ask govt not to allow military operations in merged areas

He said: “We will not allow military operations in the merged districts in any way. The provincial government should implement Imran Khan’s orders in this regard. We want education and business instead of guns, and we also want good trade relations with Afghanistan.”
He said that August 5 would be observed as a black day, marking the two years since the incarceration of Imran Khan.
He claimed that according to the Constitution, if a person’s case was not decided within a year, then he should be released on bail after that period, but regretted that Imran was being kept behind bars ‘unjustifiably’.
“We want an open trial of Imran Khan and other PTI leaders and workers in the presence of the media in the Supreme Court,” he said, adding, ‘when the judge is yours, the witness is yours, and the testimony is yours, then we don’t accept it’.
Tarakai called for the formation of a judicial commission to investigate the incidents of May 9, with a view to identifying those responsible and ensuring accountability under the law of the land. He said that after the 26th Amendment, judiciary no longer remained independent.
He said that the federal government was responsible for the deteriorating security situation in the merged districts.
The two leaders admitted that there were internal differences in PTI but declared it part of the democratic process and beauty of democracy, claiming that PTI’s leaders and workers followed Imran Khan’s directives.
“Despite all the difficulties, obstacles, internal differences and the punishment of our leaders, PTI leaders and workers will reach Minar-i-Pakistan on Tuesday,” said Mr Qaiser.
“We are focused on Tuesday’s gathering, which will prove a milestone in securing the release of the party founder,” he said.
Mr Qaiser and Mr Tarakai said though their arrest warrants had been issued they were not afraid of such tactics by the hybrid government, which had ‘stolen’ the PTI’s mandate.
“We have completed our homework for the Lahore rally and the government should not create any obstacles in the way of peaceful protests,” said Qaiser.

Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the head of the 50-member Bajaur Amn Jirga, didn’t say anything about the details of the third round of talks with TTP leaders that concluded after Maghrib prayers. However, two members of the jirga told Dawn on Sunday that the third round of talks was held in Lowi Mamund tehsil, following conditional agreement of TTP leaders to vacate civilian areas during Saturday’s meeting, which was one of the two key demands of Bajaur Amn Jirga.
Sources said that the Sunday’s talks between both sides, aimed at convincing terrorists to either return to Afghanistan or retreat to mountains if they wanted to fight against security forces, were held after high-ups met with jirga members late on Saturday night to discuss the latest developments.
“Officials expressed satisfaction over the outcome of Saturday’s talks between both sides in a meeting with Bajaur Amn Jirga leaders headed by Sahibzada Haroon Rashid and decided to give negotiations another chance to resolve the conflict peacefully, leading to third round of talks,” they said.

Third round of talks between local elders and terrorists continues for several hours

On Saturday night, Sahibzada Haroon Rashid in his Facebook post also stated that the third round of talks between them and terrorists would be held on Sunday to resolve the issue through dialogue.
Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, the sole authorised person to inform local media about the outcome of the meeting, did not share details of talks with journalists till filing of this report as he and some other members of the jirga were busy in a meeting with senior officials to brief them on new developments.
However, in a social media post shared just before meeting with officials, he said: “I’m satisfied with today’s meeting, which lasted for seven hours.”
Meanwhile, the residents of Thangi area of Salarzai tehsil on Sunday urged authorities not to abandon a security post in their locality, fearing that the move would put their lives in peril.
 
 

Addressing a jirga held at Toot Shah Chowk, local elders said that authorities had planned to abandon the security post, established several years ago in the area.
The participants of the jirga demanded of relevant authorities to reconsider the plan.
ISLAMIC LAW: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl local leaders on Sunday vowed to continue their peaceful struggle for enforcement of Islamic law in the country and for peace and socioeconomic development of the district.
They made the pledge while addressing an event to mark the second anniversary of the July 30, 2023, bombing at a party’s gathering near Khar that left 64 people dead and 122 others wounded, mostly JUI-F workers, according to a statement.
The gathering, meant to pay homage to the martyrs, was held at Madressah Jamia Rashidia in Saroo Wanoo area of Salarzai.
JUI-F local chapter head Maulana Abdur Rashid and other senior party leaders including Maulana Kareemullah, Maulana Fataullah, Mufti Mohammad Naeem, and Maulana Mohammad Imran were among the key speakers at the event.
“Despite the deadly bombing of the party’s rally on July 30, 2023, JUI-F is still standing firm on its narrative and position,” the statement quoted Maulana Rashid as saying.
He said that JUI-F would continue the martyrs’ mission and play an active role in promoting peace and people’s prosperity.
The speakers also expressed great concerns over poor law and order in the district, particularly the launch of a military operation in several areas of Lowi Mamund tehsil.
 
 

Describing the military operations as no solution to the issue of terrorism, they called for negotiated settlement of the matter.
The speakers urged all political figures, social and political activists, elders, religious leaders and locals to play their part in promoting peace and stability in the district.
The ceremony concluded with a joint prayer for the departed souls of the martyrs.

Pakistan and Iran vowed to further expand their land and rail route linkages. 
The two sides made these commitments when Iranian Minister for Roads and Urban Development, Farzaneh Sadegh, who accompanied the Iranian president on the official visit to Pakistan, participated in the joint meeting held with federal ministers Abdul Aleem Khan, Jam Kamal Khan, and Hanif Abbasi.
According to an official press release, the discussions focused on strengthening the longstanding friendly and bilateral relations between the two countries, particularly by enhancing transportation, connectivity network and road infrastructure.

The passenger, flying from Srinagar to Delhi, left the staff with severe injuries after allegedly attacking them with punches, kicks and even a queue stand.
“The airline says its staff members ‘suffered a spinal fracture and serious jaw injuries’,” TOI reported.

The outlet added that the passenger was carrying two pieces of cabin luggage weighing 16 kilogrammes — more than double the allowed 7kg limit. When asked to pay a baggage fee by airline staff, he “refused and forcefully boarded the aerobridge without completing the boarding process”.
“He was escorted back to the gate by a CISF (Central Industrial Security Force) official,” TOI reported, quoting a spokesperson for Indian airline SpiceJet. “At the gate, the passenger grew increasingly aggressive and physically assaulted four members of the SpiceJet ground staff.
“One SpiceJet employee collapsed unconscious on the floor, but the passenger continued kicking and hitting the fainted employee,” the spokesperson continued.
“Another staff member suffered bleeding from the nose and mouth after receiving a forceful kick to the jaw while bending down to assist the colleague who had fainted.”
According to the spokesperson, the injured staff were rushed to the hospital, where they are still receiving treatment for their injuries.
“The matter involving an alleged altercation between an Army personnel [sic] and airline staff at Srinagar Airport on July 26 has come to the notice of the Indian Army,” TOI reported quoting a statement from the Indian military.
“The Indian Army is committed to uphold highest standards of discipline and conduct and takes all allegations seriously. Full cooperation is being extended to the authorities in investigating the case.”
Meanwhile, SpiceJet, which registered a first information report (FIR) with the local police, said it has initiated the process to put the passenger on the no-fly list.
“SpiceJet has written to the aviation ministry, appraising them about the murderous assault on its staff and has requested appropriate action against the passenger,” the airline’s spokesperson said.
“The airline has secured the CCTV footage of the incident from the airport authorities and handed it over to the police.”
According to Indian daily The Hindu, the officer, a lieutenant colonel, was nominated in an FIR registered at Budgam police station.</p><small>2025-08-03 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/032211245d9e253.jpg?r=221236' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928506/imran-not-leaving-the-country-says-kp-cm-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>Imran ‘not leaving the country’, says KP CM Gandapur</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Sunday dismissed rumours of PTI founder Imran Khan leaving the country under a deal, describing them as attempts to weaken the provincial government.
According to a statement issued today by his focal person for digital media Yar Muhammad Niyazi, Gandapur also rubbished media reports that Imran had asked him to resign from his post as chief minister if he was unable to keep the peace in KP.
The PTI founder said in a “clear message” to Gandapur a day prior that the federation should not be allowed to conduct another military operation in the province and its tribal areas.
Earlier this week, security forces, backed by gunship helicopters and artillery, launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in Lowi Mamund tehsil and imposed a three-day curfew in the region.
“Chief Minister Gandapur has said that the PTI founder Imran Khan will never leave Pakistan,” the statement read. “If he (Imran) had to make a deal, he would have done so by now.”
The focal person’s statement added that Imran never expressed any desire to leave the country.
“The assumptions that are being made that Imran Khan will go abroad are just an attempt to weaken the movement and damage Khan’s position,” it clarified.
The statement continued: “Ali Amin Khan Gandapur said, ’Imran Khan has made me the chief minister. His trust is with me.
“Khan sahib has the government, he has the command, and we are all trying our best to deal with the challenges of the province effectively according to his vision’,”.
The statement further read: “Along with our movement, there is also an administrative responsibility, which we are paying full attention to.”
Gandapur also claimed that rumours are being spread by political opponents to weaken the PTI government in KP and the party’s movement itself.
Yesterday, the CM held the first in a series of jirgas to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.
A statement listed down the recommendations made by the jirga, such as ensuring unity against terrorism to restore peace, as well as declaring that displacement amid the ongoing military operation was “unacceptable under any circumstances”.
“Development is linked to peace and it will accelerate when peace is restored,” the statement said. “No one has asked for any resources of the province, including minerals, nor has it been given to anyone, nor will it be given to anyone.”
This development comes days before the PTI is due to launch a major protest movement across the country, to mark the second year of Imran’s incarceration in multiple cases and demand his release.</p><small>2025-08-03 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617159-pakistan-iran-reaffirm-resolve-to-further-broaden-bilateral-cooperation' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Iran reaffirm resolve to deepen cooperation across multiple sectors</strong></a><br><p>
