The killings occurred in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, a picturesque mountain valley town in the foothills of the Rockies.
A total of 27 people were wounded, including two with serious injuries and 25 others who suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in a statement.
Canadian media have reported that the shooter was female, but the RCMP declined to provide any details on the suspect’s identity in a press conference on Tuesday.



Police said an alert was issued about an active shooter at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School on Tuesday afternoon.
As police searched the school, they found six people shot dead. A seventh person with a gunshot wound died while en route to hospital.
Separately, police found two more dead bodies at a residence in Tumbler Ridge.
This residence is “believed to be connected to the incident”, police said.
At the school, “an individual believed to be the shooter was also found deceased with what appears to be a self-inflicted injury”, police said.
In a statement, the municipality of Tumbler Ridge said: “There are no words sufficient for the heartbreak our community is experiencing tonight.”
Tumbler Ridge student Darian Quist told the public broadcaster CBC that he was in his mechanics class when there was an announcement that the school was in lockdown.
He said that initially he “didn’t think anything was going on,” but started receiving “disturbing” photos about the carnage at the school.
Then “it set in what was happening”, Quist said.
He said he stayed in lockdown for more than two hours when police stormed in, ordering everyone to put their hands up before escorting them out of the school.
Darian’s mother Shelley Quist, also interviewed, said she embraced her son when they finally connected after the site was declared safe.
“He’s not going to be out of my sight for a while now,” she told the CBC.
‘Horrific violence’
Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was “devastated” by the “horrific” shooting.
“My prayers and deepest condolences are with the families and friends who have lost loved ones to these horrific acts of violence,” Carney said in a social media post.







British Columbia Premier David Eby called the violence “unimaginable”.
Mass shootings are extremely rare in Canada, but 11 people were killed in Vancouver in April during a vehicle attack that targeted a Filipino cultural festival.
RCMP’s northern district commander Ken Floyd described the incident as “a rapidly evolving and dynamic situation”.
“This has been an incredibly difficult and emotional day for our community, and we are grateful for the cooperation shown as officers continue their work to advance the investigation,” he added.
The RCMP said officers were searching other homes and properties in the community to see if there were additional sites connected to the incident.
Tumbler Ridge, a quiet town with roughly 2,400 residents, is more than 1,100 kilometres north of Vancouver, British Columbia’s largest city.
“We are devastated by the loss of life and the profound impact this tragedy has had on families, students, staff, and our entire town,” the municipality said.
Federal opposition leader Pierre Poilievre called it a “senseless act of violence”.</p><small>2026-02-11 05:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698bf234b6461.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972491/exiting-imf-change-incentives' target='_blank'><strong>Exiting IMF: change incentives</strong></a><br><p>IN our article of Jan 28, 2026, we had highlighted the importance of fixing energy and the tax regime, both major constraints on our growth potential, for Pakistan to break its dependence on the IMF. Now we turn to other parts of the economy obstructing progress on the same goal.
A structural issue responsible for perpetuating Pakistan’s dependence on the IMF is its failure to control expenditure. Spending routinely outpaces revenues not because the state invests productively but because it lacks discipline over what it creates and consumes. At both federal and provincial levels, expenditures have spiralled via salary increases far exceeding inflation for the civil, judicial and military bureaucracies alongside expanding vehicle fleets, luxury housing, plush offices, overseas junkets and discretionary budgets, often without mandates, sunset clauses or performance tests.
The federal and provincial governments are huge employment bureaus. Even after the 18th Amendment, Islamabad has retained over 40 divisions and 400 attached departments, with a combined employee strength of 1.2 million. Moreover, creating new departments, authorities and special units, with full secretariats and perks, has become too easy; trimming by almost two-thirds is needed, alongside an immediate hiring freeze. Bureaucratic and political resistance preserve positions of authority.
SOEs are another fiscal sinkhole. Accumulated losses have crossed Rs6 trillion, growing by nearly a trillion annually, despite repeated bailouts through grants and equity injections. Most can’t be privatised, either because the purpose for their establishment has become redundant or they’re not commercially viable. They must be liquidated. Continuing to prop them up is a direct subsidy to irrelevancy and inefficiency financed through debt.
PSDP compounds the problem. Projects are rushed for political visibility, cost-benefit analysis is perfunctory, feasibility is weak and future operating costs ignored. The result is half-finished projects, mounting liabilities and financial gaps filled through debt or inflation. We must impose a hard brake on new PSDP starts, complete only high-return projects, write off sunk costs on low priority projects and redirect spending towards the economy’s ‘software’, i.e., education, basic health, courts, regulation, enforcement and trade facilitation.

The perks system lies at the heart of the country’s dysfunction.

Trade policy is the silent enabler of the crisis, and sustains IMF dependence. Pakistan remains poorly integrated into global value chains; it’s viewed as a peripheral supplier rather than a reliable, scalable partner. We safeguard and sustain inefficient constituencies of incumbents and entrenched special interests behind tariffs and non-tariff barriers — SROs, subsidised inputs, guaranteed returns, discretionary walls and bailouts. Exporters bear this cost through expensive inputs, an overvalued exchange rate, delayed refunds and policy uncertainty, leading to a narrow export base and chronic foreign exchange shortages. This anti-export bias functions as a subsidy to rent-seekers financed through IMF borrowing.
Export-led growth does not emerge by declaration. It requires simplified tariffs, elimination of discretion, competitive exchange rate and a genuine zero-rated regime with automatic refunds. Competition must replace lobbying. Exiting IMF dependence also requires forsaking the comfort of a closed, managed economy and creating opportunities for growth by embracing open, competitive markets. Protection and controls, which also facilitate cartel formation, have not produced national champions. They have cemented inefficiency, rewarded lobbying, made businesses habituated to the pursuit of protection rather than developing their capacity to compete, resulting in the misallocation of capital.

 

It is competition and not protection that is the only reliable disciplining device for firms, regulators and policymakers. Productivity growth is undermined by insulating inefficient producers while imposing heavy taxes on technology-enabling inputs. In contrast, open markets and low taxation of technological instruments enhance productivity, efficiency, facilitate scale and mitigate the structural distortions that trigger balance-of-payments crises.
A central lesson is that the government must exit price-setting altogether. Fixing prices administratively replaces information with discretion, resulting in shortages, misallocations and rent-seeking. Prices are signals. Suppressing them simply delays costs, which reappear as inflation, debt or IMF programmes. If entry remains blocked, even these reforms will fail. Pakistan’s most powerful growth killer is the gatekeeper state. Licences, NOCs, inspections and permissions administered by over 100 regulatory agencies create a toll economy where access matters more than productivity.
A genuine regulatory guillotine is one of the fastest, lowest-cost ways to reduce cost of doing business and raise growth. Pakistan doesn’t lack entrepreneurs; it lacks firms that are allowed to become large, productive, and export-oriented. The central aim of economic policy must, therefore, be to promote acceleration of investment and enable firms to grow, list and integrate with global markets. Listed companies matter. They bring transparency, governance, long-term capital and productivity spillovers that informal or protected firms cannot. Growth driven by scale, formality, and contract certainty is the only durable path to stability. This is why judicial reform is macroeconomic reform. Contracts that take decades to enforce repel investment regardless of vision statements. Predictable, time-bound commercial justice is indispensable to investment.
The perks system lies at the heart of our dysfunction. Incentives shift from performance to rent extraction when compensation is delivered through houses, plots, cars and protocol rather than transparent pay. Bureaucrats stop optimising the system and start optimising access to these privileges. Capital gets locked in prime land and elite enclaves instead of circulating through markets.
Finally, credibility requires rules. Pakistan’s stop-go cycles stem from discretion masquerading as flexibility as seen in defend-the-rupee episodes, off-budget guarantees and abrupt reversals. A credible exit requires binding fiscal and monetary rules, transparent escape clauses and the discipline to let prices work. It’s not the IMF that is the cause of Pakistan’s problems but the auditor that arrives after the damage. Exiting the IMF is not an act of defiance or nationalism; it is an act of competence. Until Pakistan stops confusing aspirations with instruments, plans with incentives, and rhetoric with reform, it will keep announcing exits — and signing the next programme.

Published in Dawn, February 11th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-11 04:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/698bf2a16aab0.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972492/epsteins-creepy-world' target='_blank'><strong>Epstein’s creepy world</strong></a><br><p>MORE than three million files related to disgraced financier and convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein have recently been released by the US Department of Justice. The files shed light on the intersection of sex, power and money primarily in the politics of the US and some Western countries. The list of Epstein’s contacts pertaining to the US includes two presidents, politicians, business tycoons and intellectuals of all ideological shades.
Although some of the names were already known, the latest files provide new details about Epstein’s shady network that extended to many countries, involving top politicians and even members of royal families. The exchange of lurid messages between Epstein and his high-profile and politically influential contacts exposes the moral and financial corruption entrenched in the political system and among the influential elite of the West.
Some of the files detailing the ‘wild parties’ at Epstein’s various mansions read like passages from the novels of Harold Robbins, featuring wealth, power, and sex. The framed photos displayed at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion and those found in files show his relationships with presidents, kings and even a Nobel Prize-winning scientist.
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman also figures in one of the pictures, and reportedly Fidel Castro and Pope John Paul II do so as well, indicating Epstein’s wide circle of contacts among powerful people across the world.

 

A most shocking disclosure was his apparently close friendship with renowned left-wing thinker and author Noam Chomsky, as detailed in the recently released files. There may be no evidence of personal familiarity beyond social gatherings, yet several questions remain. The files show that Epstein once sought advice from Chomsky over what he called the “putrid” media coverage of sex trafficking allegations against him.

The new files reveal the extent of Epstein’s social network and web of sexual abusers.

A convicted sex offender, Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges, reportedly had a close association with President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton. The documents suggest that both received favours from the disgraced financier.
Epstein, who was accused of sexually exploiting underage girls, had boasted about having a close relationship with Trump, who frequented his wild parties. In a 2002 interview with New York Magazine, Trump said he had known Epstein for 15 years, since the 1980s. There are several photos and videos of Trump and Epstein at various events in the early 1990s.
While Trump maintained he had cut ties with Epstein long ago, his name reportedly appears hundreds of times in the latest files. The sex offender had also maintained ties with Trump’s inner circle, including Steve Bannon, the White House’s right-wing chief strategist during Trump’s first presidency, indicating Epstein’s access to the power centre of the world’s most powerful nation.
Bannon later fell out with Trump. Perhaps Trump’s close ties with Epstein may have been the reason for his administration’s reluctance to release the entire file. The Justice Department finally released the explosive files under pressure from Congress.
Epstein’s apparently close association with Bill Clinton began in the early 1990s. During Clinton’s presidency, Epstein made multiple visits to the White House and maintained ties with the president’s associates. After leaving office, Clinton reportedly travelled on Epstein’s private jet on several occasions for charitable trips.
Epstein’s own life story, from modest origins to extreme wealth, speaks volumes about his remarkable ability to connect with those in powerful positions. A university dropout who was sacked from his first job as a private school teacher primarily due to “poor job performance”, he became a top financier and a billionaire within a few years.
His connection, through one of his students, with a partner at Bear Stearns gave him a stepping stone to fortune. He established his own company and managed the investment portfolios of some of America’s wealthiest business tycoons. He himself acquired properties across the world, including a ranch in New Mexico, a mansion in Palm Beach and a 40-room mansion in Manhattan where he entertained celebrities, politicians, business tycoons and royalty.
The new set of messages released recently reveals the staggering range of his social network and the web of sexual abusers he had built. Even widespread allegations of sexually abusing underage girls and his conviction on charges of solicitation of prostitution with a minor in 2008 didn’t affect his connections with influential figures across the US and outside. He was awarded just a 13-month jail sentence in 2008. He was later arrested in 2019 on charges of sex trafficking.

 

The latest files have shaken British royalty and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government. The documents provide extensive details about Epstein’s close association with Prince Andrew. Some of the emails exchanged between the two go back to 2011, after Epstein’s 2008 conviction. There are some pictures of Andrew in a compromising setting, presumably at one of Epstein’s mansions.
Perhaps the most damning revelation pertains to Peter Mandelson, a former cabinet minister who also served as Britain’s ambassador to Washington. He was sacked a few months ago due to his friendship with Epstein, who reportedly paid a huge sum of money to him in return for information regarding the fiscal decisions of the British government. He resigned from the Labour Party over his association with Epstein.
Epstein’s links with Israel’s intelligence agencies are also clearer from the recently released files. The documents have revealed details of Epstein’s interactions with former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and his funding of Israeli groups, including Friends of the Israeli Defence Forces, as well as his ties to members of Israel’s overseas intelligence services.
The entire Epstein episode exposes the hypocrisy of those in the West who espouse the high moral ground yet maintain connections with a depraved sex criminal. He may be dead but the impact of the documents revealing his vast web of connections continues to jolt America and other countries.

Pakistan had earlier refused to play the blockbuster fixture, which is the revenue generator for the International Cricket Council, after Scotland had been drafted in to replace Bangladesh at the World Cup following the latter country’s refusal to travel to India for their matches due to security concerns. The Pakistan Cricket Board had protested the decision of the India-led ICC. While the team was allowed to travel to the tournament it was instructed to forfeit the match against India.
With its finances in danger, the ICC came to the table with its director Imran Khawaja flying to Pakistan over the weekend. Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Aminul Islam also arrived, with Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi at the centre of negotiations. Pakistan had already been requested by Sri Lanka, where the national team is playing their matches of the World Cup, and the UAE to reconsider their decision. The PCB, however, was fighting a bigger battle: to ensure equality in world cricket against the governing body that has for long acted on India’s whims.

 

In many ways, it has succeeded. The ICC has not penalised Bangladesh, while also granting it hosting rights for a tournament in the 2028-2031 cycle to mitigate the impact from its ouster from the World Cup. It therefore made sense for Pakistan to change their stance; going ahead with the World Cup match against India means ensuring financial security for the cricket world, especially the associate members.
This should not be forgotten. It should also mark the start of a new era in cricket governance. The politicisation of the sport has been a menace that has hindered the growth of the game for long. Sports should not be used as a propagation of political messaging and it is high time this practice was stopped.
Once the arrangement between Pakistan and India, which sees both sides play their matches of an event in either country at neutral venues, ends, the ICC should look to ensuring that it normalises bilateral cricketing ties between the two arch-rivals. That would embellish the ICC’s legitimacy as a neutral body that is focused on making sure that the game stays above petty politicking.

The analysis led by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations further claimed deep structural imbalances in food availability that undermine nutrition, public health, and long-term development outcomes.
Results of the analysis were presented at the National Results Dissemination Workshop on the Integrated Roadmap for Sustainable Food Systems Transformation in Pakistan.
The FAO-led analysis was carried out in collaboration with the UN Resident Coordinator, the national food security and research ministry, and UN partners WFP, Unicef, IFAD and WHO.

Strategic reallocation of subsidies by government urged to boost production, accessibility of nutrient-rich foods

The analysis said while Pakistan’s overall food energy availability is adequate, the national food supply falls short of what is needed to support healthy diets in line with the National Food-Based Dietary Guidelines of 2018.
Significant gaps persist in the availability of key food groups, including fruits and vegetables, pulses and legumes. These shortages directly weaken efforts to address malnutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and diet-related diseases.
The food system of the country is characterised by a substantial oversupply of cereals and grains, sugar, and edible oils, far exceeding levels recommended for healthy diets. This imbalance reinforces cereal-heavy consumption patterns, limits dietary diversity, and contributes to the rising burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), the analysis shows.
Grains and cereals dominate food consumption, across rural and urban areas alike, with particularly high reliance in rural households. While this ensures calorie intake, it comes at the cost of diet quality. Milk and milk products are the second most consumed food group nationally.
Urban and national averages are similar; rural consumption is slightly lower. Consumption of vegetables remains moderate, but fruit intake is consistently low, especially in rural areas signalling widespread micronutrient gaps. Protein sources beyond dairy remain limited. Consumption of meat, poultry, and eggs remains low overall and is especially limited in rural areas. Consumption of pulses remains insufficient to compensate for low animal-source foods.
The analysis highlights concerning trends in sweets and snacks consumption. Rural households consume more free sugar and fats than urban households, reflecting reliance on inexpensive, energy-dense foods. Provincial differences are stark, with particularly high sugar consumption obser­ved in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.
Complementary market data show that sales volumes of processed foods in Pakistan have nearly doubled in recent years, pointing to rapid dietary shifts with serious public health implications.
These dietary patterns are contributing to Pakistan’s double burden of malnutrition, where undernutrition coexists with rising obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs).
According to national and international estimates from various data sources, diabetes affects 34.5 million people in Pakistan, including one in three adults. NCDs now account for 58 per cent of all deaths nationwide. Cardiovascular disease alone claims nearly 400,000 lives annually.
Experts warn that without decisive action to improve food system, these trends will continue to place immense strain on health systems and economic productivity.
In its recommendations, the analysis emphasised the need for targeted government incentives and a strategic reallocation of subsidies to boost the production, affordability, and accessibility of nutrient-rich foods, particularly fruits, vegetables, and pulses to promote healthier diets across the country.
It urged the government to consider increasing taxes on sugar and sugary beverages and confectionery, with revenues reinvested in nutrition and healthy food programmes, and offer tax incentives or preferential procurement for companies that meet sugar reduction targets.

Headed by FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, a three-judge bench, also comprising Justice Ali Baqar Najafi and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah, took up a set of appeals filed by the federal government.
The appeals challenge the IHC’s initiation of contempt proceedings against government officials and seek to overturn the May 16, 2025 order allowing amendments to an already settled petition relating to Dr Aafia Siddiqui, nearly a decade after its disposal.
Additional Attorney General Rashid Hafeez represented the government, while Advocate Imran Shafeeq appeared on behalf of Dr Fowzia, to whom the court also issued notice.

FCC takes up govt appeal challenging ‘judicial overreach’ and its foreign policy implications

Earlier, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan of the IHC had put the PM and the entire federal government on notice, seeking an explanation from the cabinet for not supporting Dr Fowzia’s legal efforts in the US.
In its appeal, the government argued that the IHC’s direction permitting amendments to the pleadings amounted to judicial overreach and undermined the finality of concluded litigation.
It maintained that reopening a settled matter after such a long lapse violated settled principles of law.
Dr Aafia was convicted by the US district court for the southern district of New York .
Her sister Dr Fowzia had approached the IHC expressing concern for Dr Aafia’s life, safety, and physical and mental wellbeing, citing a lack of consistent and reliable updates about her condition in custody.
The government contended that by allowing the amendments, the high court failed to consider the serious legal and foreign policy implications of the revised relief sought, which, it said, squarely fell within the exclusive domain of the executive and engaged Pakistan’s obligations under international law.
It asserted that the respondent sought the amendments with mala fide intent, describing the move as a counterblast aimed solely at keeping the petition alive.

 

In the amended petition, Dr Fowzia sought a declaration that the government had constitutional and international law obligations to take all necessary measures for Dr Aafia’s release and repatriation.
The appeal stated that these concerns had already been addressed, noting that in October 2024 the PM had written a formal letter to the US president in support of Dr Aafia’s clemency petition. This was followed by the dispatch of a high-level state delegation. The government also made efforts to negotiate bilateral and multilateral treaties for the transfer of prisoners, but US authorities declined to enter into any such agreement.
The government argued that the IHC had overlooked the applicability of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 (VCDR) and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963 (VCCR), both of which have the force of law in Pakistan under the Diplomatic and Consular Privileges Act, 1972.

ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday reluctantly conceded that the industrial sector had, for the first time, been fully freed from cross-subsidy to compete globally, as it disclosed a higher-than-previously known financial impact of the newly imposed fixed charges on residential electricity consumers.
At an almost one-way public hearing on Rs4.04 per unit average cut in power rates for industrial consumers and imposition of fixed charges on residential consumers, industrial consumers, power division and the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) were all praise for each other for a long overdue “great move” and “first step in the right direction”.
No representative appeared on behalf of more than 28.5 million residential consumers who will be subject to the fixed charges.
The power division team, led by Additional Secretary Mehfooz Bhatti and comprising the chief financial officer of Power Planning and Manage­ment Com­pany (PPMC), Naveed Qaiser, reported that fixed charges would be collected from residential consumers at the rate of Rs200-675 per kilowatt a month and not Rs200-675 per connection per month.
This means the charge will be linked to the sanctioned load regardless of consumption. A consumer with a 2kW sanctioned load would pay Rs400 per month at a Rs200 per kW rate, while a 5kW consumer would pay Rs2,500 per month at Rs500 per kW. A 6kW sanctioned load would attract Rs4,050 per month at Rs675 per kW.
Mr Qaiser said it was also for the first time that a two-part tariff would be charged to consumers to cater for the Rs2.56 trillion annual fixed cost of capacity. While the move reduces about Rs101bn cross-subsidy from industrial consumers, the recovery of fixed charge would increase by Rs132bn, to Rs355bn (10 per cent) from Rs223bn (7pc) at present, excluding 18pc GST and other surcharges and duties.
He said that about Rs31bn to be collected through fixed charges would be used to reduce the variable tariff of consumers using more than 300 units per month to minimise their incentive to move away from the national grid, while the remaining Rs101bn would be used to ease the industrial burden.
Mr Bhatti said the industrial tariff would now come down to around 11.50 cents per unit from around 13, although it was still higher than regional competitors, but involved no cross-subsidy.
Separately, the financial advisory firm Optimus Capital Management worked out the average power tariff for protected consumers in the first 100-unit slab, increasing by 76pc or Rs8 per unit due to the fixed charge. The average cost for 101-200 units in the protected category would see an increase of Rs4 per unit (or 31pc).
For the non-protected category, Optimus estimated a 74pc increase — about Rs16.50 per unit — for the first 100 units, followed by a 21pc increase (about Rs6 per unit) for the 101-200 unit slab.
It said the net average tariff, including fixed charges, would rise for all domestic consumers, including by 13pc for 201-300 units, 6.5pc for 301-400 units, 5.8pc for 401-600 units per month and about 5pc for consumption above 600 units. The only net reduction — about 7pc — would apply to time-of-use consumers with sanctioned load above 5kW.

WASHINGTON: A day after the eight-member Muslim bloc condemned illegal Israeli measures to annex the West Bank, several Western nations — including staunch ally the United States — have come out against Tel Aviv’s move to tighten its grip over the occupied Palestinian territory.
The Israeli security cabinet had voted on Monday to allow Jew­ish settlers to buy West Bank land dir­e­ctly, and to extend greater control over areas where the Palestinian Authority exercises power.
“As the president has clearly stated, he does not support Israel annexing the West Bank,” a Tru­mp administration official said.
“A stable West Bank keeps Isr­ael secure and is in line with this administration’s goal to achieve peace,” the official said, when asked about the Israeli actions.
UN Secretary-General Anto­nio Guterres warned that this decision was eroding the prospect for a two-state solution.
He reiterated that all Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and their associated regime and infrastructure, have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of international law, including relevant UN resolutions.
Such actions, including Israel’s continued presence in the occu­pied Palestinian territory, are not only destabilising but also unlawful as recalled by the Inter­national Court of Justice, a statement issued by the UN chief said.
France also condemned the Israeli security cabinet’s decisions aimed at expanding Israel’s control over the West Bank, calling the move “contrary to international law and represent[ing] a dangerous challenge to the Oslo Accords and the Hebron Protocol”.
“These measures, along with the approval of the E1 project and the publication of a tender for that project, are fueling momentum for annexing the West Bank and as such, represent a serious attack on the two-state solution. At a time when international efforts are focused on implementing phase two of the Gaza peace plan, these decisions are detrimental to current peace efforts and threaten to raise tensions,” the French foreign ministry said in a statement
The usually-neutral Swiss government also weighed in, saying Israeli “settlement activities are illegal under international law”.
Meanwhile, the Arab League Council is expected to convene today (Wednesday) — at the request of the State of Palestine — to discuss ways to confront the recent Israeli expansion of its occupation of the West Bank.
Israel starts ‘clearing’ West Bank
On Tuesday, Anadolu Agency reported the Israeli army had demolished Palestinian structures and assaulted several residents in the occupied West Bank.
Military bulldozers brought down three homes belonging to two Palestinian families in the town of Barta’a, southwest of Jenin in the northern West Bank, citing a lack of building permits, the official news agency Wafa said.
In the nearby Ya’bad town, Israeli forces assaulted several young men after raiding the area and storming several shops there, the outlet said.
Separately, four Palestinians were injured after they were assaulted by Israeli forces during demolition operations in Silwan town in occupied West Bank, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said.
According to the Wadi Hilwah Information Center, Israeli for­ces raided the town and demolished walls surrounding houses in the al-Bustan neighborhood.
A building material store was also razed by Israeli forces in the Bir Ayoub neighborhood in the same town. Two people were detained during the raid.

Cumulative sales rose 43pc to 111,377 units in 7MFY26, up from 77,686 units in 7MFY25. Myesha Sohail of Topline Securi­ties said the sharp MoM surge was largely driven by new-year registrations, as customers typically delay deliveries to secure January registrations for better resale value.
The strong YoY growth was supported by new market entrants, lower interest rates, easing inflation, and improving macroeconomic sentiment, she said.
Sazgar Engineering Works Ltd (SEWL) reported all-time high sales of 2,004 units in January, up 72pc MoM. SEWL sales in 7MFY26 were 9,214, up by 49pc YoY.

Tractor demand shrinks, truck and bus sales surge to record high

Indus Motor Company (IMC) and Honda Atlas Cars Ltd (HCAR) recorded 43-month high sales in January, she added.
HACL posted growth of 64pc YoY and 86pc MoM to 3,620 units in January. Honda City and Civic models sales rose 69pc YoY and 93pc MoM to 3,364 units, which were a 43-month high. BRV and HRV models surged by 14pc YoY and 25pc MoM to 256 units in January. HACL sold 15,659 units in 7MFY26, up by 68pc YoY.

 

IMC posted a 52pc YoY and 119pc MoM growth to 5,060 units. Corolla, Yaris and Cross sales together went up 90pc YoY and 93pc MoM to 4,078 units. Meanwhile, Fortuner and IMVs fell 17pc YoY but rose to 982 units in January from 196 units in December 2025. Total IMC sales during 7MFY26 were 25,623, showing a growth of 61pc YoY.
In 2 and 3-wheelers, sales increased by 31pc YoY and 13pc MoM to 181,790 units in January, marking an all-time high. This took cumulative 7MFY26 sales to 1.1m units, up 32pc YoY.
Atlas Honda Ltd (AHL), the maker of the popular CD70 bike, yet again recorded all-time high monthly sales of 157,059 units in January.
Tractor sales posted a decline of 9pc YoY and 26pc MoM to 2,505 units in January, while total sales (Fiat and Millat) in 7MFY26 fell by 23pc to 15,434 units YoY.
Truck and bus sales surged by 77pc YoY and three times MoM to 1,101 units in January, to an all-time high. During 7MFY26, total sales surged by 92pc to 4,633 units YoY.
Myesha Sohail expects positive momentum in auto sales to continue in 2026, supported by lower interest rates and new hybrid and plug-in hybrid models.

Police records show that five people were killed and more than 600 injured in political clashes during the campaign period from Dec 11 to Feb 9.
More than 157,000 police officers, backed by 100,000 soldiers and other security forces, will guard Thursday’s vote — the first since a mass uprising toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina in 2024.
“We are 1,000 per cent confident about doing our part,” Inspector General of Police Baharul Alam told reporters in Dhaka.

Tarique Rahman warns of ‘huge’ challenges ahead

The country of 170 million has remained in political turmoil since the uprising against Hasina, when police carried out a deadly crackdown during her failed bid to cling to power.
Alam said police had assessed that “more than 24,000 polling centres have been marked as either high-risk or moderately risky” for possible unrest, violence or ballot stuffing — more than half of the 42,000 centres nationwide.
“The location of some centres is very remote, and there is intense competition, and hostility among candidates and their supporters,” he said, adding that 1,300 police guns looted during the 2024 unrest have still not been recovered.
“In high-risk and moderately risky centres, police will carry out patrol duty with body-worn cameras for the first time,” Alam said. He added that police were determined to ensure the polls were peaceful, but said he accepted that distrust of his force remained.

 

“It is quite understandable why people do not trust the police,” he said, adding: “Over the last 15 ye­­a­rs, based on what we have delivered — in fact, for the last 150 years, our predecessors mostly beat people.”
Meanwhile, Bangla­de­sh’s leading prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman said on Tuesday he faces “huge” challenges if he wins elections this week, vowing to repair a country he said was looted under the previous ousted government.
“We need to ensure a normal situation in the country, so that people are safe,” Rahman told AFP. But he warned the task ahead would be daunting.

Trump said the United States should own “at least half” of the still under-construction Gordie Howe International Bridge that links the Canadian province of Ontario with the US state of Michigan.
Work on the $4.7-billion bridge — named after the late Canadian-born National Hockey League great Gordie Howe — started in 2018 and it is due to open later this year.
“I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve,” Trump posted on Truth Social.
“We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY.”







The 79-year-old Republican complained that Canada owned both sides of the bridge and used “virtually” no US products to build it. According to a factsheet issued by the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, the bridge was financed entirely by Canada and will be jointly owned by the governments of Canada and the state of Michigan.
“And now, on top of everything else, Prime Minister (Mark) Carney wants to make a deal with China — which will eat Canada alive. We’ll just get the leftovers! I don’t think so,” Trump added.
Washington threatened to slap 100 percent tariffs on Canada after Carney visited Beijing last month and sealed a preliminary trade deal with China. The US leader meanwhile repeated the outlandish claim that Beijing would “terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada.” Trump has clashed with Canada over trade since returning to office in January 2025. He previously called for the United States to annex Canada but has largely dropped that claim in recent months.

WASHINGTON: US lawmakers reviewing the un-redacted files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have expressed concern that some names have been removed from the records released to the public.
The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) compelled the Justice Department to release all of the documents in its possession.
It required the redaction of the names or personal identifying information about Epstein’s victims, but said that no records could be “withheld, delayed, or redacted on the basis of embarrassment, reputational harm, or political sensitivity, including to any government official, public figure, or foreign dignitary.”
Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, was among the Democratic and Republican lawmakers who examined the un-redacted Epstein files at a secure Justice Department location on Monday.
“I saw the names of lots of people who were redacted for mysterious or baffling or inscrutable reasons,” Raskin told reporters.
“There are certainly lots of names of other people who were enablers and cooperators with Jeffrey Epstein that were just blanked out for no apparent reason,” he said.
Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky, said he discovered the names of six men whose identities have been redacted from the released documents and who “are likely incriminated by their inclusion in these files.”
Ro Khanna, a Democrat from California, said “there’s no explanation why those people were redacted.”
They declined to provide their identities but Massie said one of them “is pretty high up in a foreign government” and Khanna said one of the others “is a pretty prominent individual.”
Massie and Khanna also said that many of the redactions in the released files had actually been made prior to the documents being received by the Justice Department. Those redactions may have been made earlier by the FBI or by prosecutors, they said.
Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former girlfriend, also testified from prison before Congress, but refused to answer any questions, stating that she would only speak if President Donald Trump granted her clemency.
‘Virginia’s Law’
Separately, Congressional Democrats introduced legislation on Tuesday that they said would eliminate the statute of limitations that has shielded sex traffickers such as Epstein.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Representative Teresa Leger Fernandez announced the proposal alongside Epstein victims and Virginia Giuffre’s family.
The proposal Virginia’s Law is named after Giuffre, one of Epstein’s most prominent accusers, who died by suicide last year.
“Virginia’s dream was to inspire and empower survivors to come forward in a world that too often turns away from abuse and pushes it into the shadows. She wanted to bring light,” said Sky Roberts, Giuffre’s brother.
The bill’s fate in the Senate and House of Representatives, which are both controlled by Republicans, is unclear.
Meanwhile, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick admitted to having lunch on Epstein’s private island but denied closer ties.

 

A rising number of US lawmakers have called for Lutnick to step down from President Donald Trump’s cabinet, as files released by the Justice Department contradicted earlier comments that he severed ties with Epstein more than two decades ago.
Separately, the Norwegian parliament has agreed to set up an independent commission to investigate the ties between Epstein and several prominent citizens, from the crown princess to a former prime minister who later chaired the committee that selects Nobel Peace Prize winners.
“It is absolutely crucial that trust in the Norwegian foreign service, the political sphere, and Norwegian democracy is maintained,” said lawmaker Per-Willy Amundsen, who heads a committee tasked with ensuring compliance with Norway’s constitution.

The South African government said in November it had received “distress calls” from 17 men who were trapped in the epicentre of the fighting in Ukraine’s Donbas region after being tricked into joining mercenary forces.
“President Ramaphosa and President Putin pledged their support to the process of returning Sou­th Africans fighting alongside Russ­i­an forces in Ukraine,” the president’s office said in a statement.
“In this regard, teams from both sides will continue their engagements towards the finalisation of this process,” it said. Ukraine’s foreign minister said in November that more than 1,400 citizens from 36 African countries had been identified among the Russian ranks.

Kenya deplores use of citizens as ‘cannon fodder’ in war

An investigation spoke to four Kenyans recently returned from Russia who said they were tricked by a Nairobi recruitment agency into travelling to Russia under false promises of well-paying jobs. In December, Kenyan authorities said around 200 citizens had been sent to fight in Ukraine, of whom 23 had since been repatriated.
This is an underestimate, said the four Kenyan recruits. The daughter of South African former president Jacob Zuma is among several accused of recruiting men to join Russian mercenaries in the Ukraine war. Pretoria warned its citizens last year not to fall for recruitment scams, after multiple social media influencers shared campaigns promising young women jobs in a Russia-based programme that has been accused of abuses.
‘Cannon fodder’ Kenyans
Kenya on Tuesday condemned as “unacceptable” recruiters luring Kenyans to Russia with promises of lucrative jobs, only to send them to Ukraine’s front lines as “cannon fodder.”
In recent weeks, mounting reports indicate that Kenyans deceived into travelling for high-paying work in Russia are dying on the battlefield, with others sustaining serious wounds.
An investigation published this week revealed the web of deception into which four men with no military background fell — forced to sign contracts with the Russian army and swiftly sent to the front lines in Ukraine. “It’s unacceptable for them to be participants in this conflict,” junior foreign minister Korir Sing’Oei said.
The four, three of whom returned wounded, were given contracts written in Russian. One had expected to work as a salesman, two as security guards and the fourth as a high-level athlete.
“These individuals are used as cannon fodder on the war front,” Sing’Oei said. “No Kenyan would voluntarily enter into that kind of engagement.”

While the details of the brawl itself are unclear, the bone of contention was allegedly a three-acre chunk of prime real estate located just off the thoroughfare. One of its two co-owners, builder and developer Javed Iqbal had employed a local JUI-F leader named Jibrail Khan, 32, to work there as a supervisor. Several sources claim that the huge plot is coveted by extremely powerful individuals at the top of the political food chain.
Some days earlier, this party had sent in their supporters to occupy the plot. On Feb 25, Jibrail got into a heated confrontation with them. An FIR was filed against him for rioting armed with a deadly weapon, kidnapping and attempted murder. Several other FIRs (copies of which are in Dawn’s possession) were also filed against him in Karachi and other parts of Sindh, including Shikarpur, Moro, Qazi Ahmed and Nawabshah for various crimes, ostensibly committed within the span of a few weeks, including theft of cattle, cash and a motorbike. He was arrested, taken to Central Jail and a few weeks later, transferred to prison in Nawabshah.
According to an individual close to Jibrail, who originally hails from KP, “He’s never been anywhere in Sindh except for Karachi”. Even after he was acquitted by a Shaheed Benazirabad court, with the judicial magistrate in his order saying there had been an abuse of power and that Jibrail had been falsely implicated, he continued to be detained in the same prison.
The plot’s co-owner, Mr Iqbal, alleges that a fake FIR was filed against him as well and he was detained by the Counter Terrorism Department police for four days, during which, he says, he was ordered to surrender the plot in writing. He refused; ultimately, he obtained relief from the Sindh High Court.
Political big guns soon became involved. Rashid Mehmood Soomro, secretary general of JUI-F Sindh, issued a strongly worded statement on social media in Jibrail’s defence, describing the dispute as one in connection with a plot which “two big crocodiles are rushing to grab”. He denounced one of them as “someone who perhaps believes he owns Sindh, owns the country, and thinks he can use brute force to grab land…”; he warned that if the matter was not resolved quickly, Sindh would go up in flames.



This is the tip of the iceberg that illustrates the lawlessness prevailing in Sindh, where an entire system allegedly operates free from the constraints of the law and institutional guardrails, beholden only to its political masters and their whims, and existing solely to rake in eyewatering fortunes for everyone involved.
While the sources of this wealth are many and varied, Karachi’s precious real estate is the gift that keeps on giving, and it is the focus of this report. Sources within the political leadership, bureaucracy and civil society speak of a city divided up into zones, with a trusted front man (sometimes several) presiding over receipts from each area under his control. Among these are a seasoned medical professional, a civil servant active in brokering land deals, a business group that allegedly handles all the ‘earnings’ generated in the province, etc.
Given the heft of the personalities involved, most sources were unwilling to speak on the record, but there is sufficient documentary evidence and on-ground reporting by Dawn to support their statements. Certain names have been changed to protect the individuals’ identity. With the law having been weaponised to silence the media, drawing too clear a picture can be fraught with risk, so readers are invited to connect the dots where possible.
King of the West?
In a country where political fortunes can go through cycles of boom and bust, Ali Hassan Brohi — also known as Ali Hassan Zehri because of his Baloch tribal ancestry — has suffered a setback of sorts. On Feb 3, he tendered his resignation from the Balochistan cabinet. But, given his powerful connections, this may be only a bump in the road.
There was a time he was said to be on the run and allegedly in the crosshairs of the ‘encounter specialist’ — Rao Anwar, then SSP Malir. Fast forward to December 2024, he was sworn in as Balochistan’s minister for agriculture and cooperatives. His recent setbacks in that province notwithstanding, he is arguably one of the most powerful people in Sindh, rumoured to have the ear of no less than the president himself.


Letter of resignation by Ali Hassan Zehri to CM Balochistan.

Hailing from Bandhi, Nawabshah district (since renamed Shaheed Benazirabad), he was once, as a prominent politician told Dawn, in the employ of an octroi tax collector in Bolari, district Jamshoro.
“He wasn’t even a manager, but a helper. However, according to the contractor, he was extremely sharp.” Showing a political savvy that was to stand him in good stead, Mr Brohi developed contacts with low-level PPP workers and over time, with senior party leaders in Nawabshah. With the help of his connections, alleges the politician, Mr Brohi gradually worked his way out of small-town Sindh to providing muscle for the PPP in connection with Karachi’s pricey real estate — but then, there was a falling out.
Several sources confirmed to Dawn that Mr Brohi made a run for Balochistan; police close to the Sindh-Balochistan border had received orders from SSP Rao to ‘intercept’ him, and they fired upon his vehicle in the Mochko area, but he made it across. There he sought shelter with certain political and tribal heavyweights, two of whom are said to have paved the way for his rapprochement with his former benefactor several years later when they joined the PPP.

 

Until then, though, Mr Brohi’s travails were far from over. On May 20, 2020, English and Urdu newspapers carried a public notice by the deputy commissioner, district West (the DC office is the most senior in the district revenue department). The notice declared Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claimed he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees. It read: “For his immense crimes of forgery and land grabs, Ali Hassan Brohi is under a comprehensive and impartial inquiry by this office. A significant number of fake entries managed by Ali Hassan Brohi in the revenue record of district West have been found, which will be conveyed to higher authorities with recommendations for cancellation and penal action after completion of scrutiny.” The notice asked for public assistance in gathering further information.


Public notice published in a national daily, declaring Mr Brohi “an extremely notorious individual” and claiming he had grabbed over 3,000 acres of state and private land worth billions of rupees.

On the orders of Owais Muzaffar Tappi who was believed to run the system at the time, the then DC West Fayyaz Solangi retrieved the lands that Mr Brohi had allegedly grabbed. However, as this story will later show, Mr Solangi would come to regret following those orders so faithfully.
In 2021, FIA’s corporate crime circle, Karachi office, instituted an enquiry based on what it claimed was a reference from the DIG CTD, Sindh, in which Mr Brohi and eight others were named on the basis of an FIR (no 811/2021) filed in Karachi. Briefly, the FIR accused Mr Brohi of having taken Rs20 million from drug dealers to bribe two policemen with Rs7m to get two of his alleged front men to spring three Nigerian nationals from custody. According to the FIA’s brief, subsequent enquiries brought to light 14 FIRs dating from 2007 till 2020, in which Mr Brohi is named as the accused in eight, while the rest nominate two other individuals described as his “front men”.
The charges against him include terrorism, murder, attempted murder, rioting armed with a deadly weapon, dacoity, causing hurt and criminal intimidation, among others. The document also names nine “front men” of Mr Brohi in whose name the latter had “acquired/ purchased various properties in different areas” of Karachi. These findings, according to the brief, are based on only a partial record, some of it obtained from the digitised records compiled by the Land Revenue Management Information Systems (LARMIS), Board of Revenue (BoR), Sindh. Mr Brohi did not respond to questions put to him in writing by Dawn regarding these allegations and other claims about him by sources quoted in this report.
(Of the eight FIRs in which Mr Brohi is nominated as the sole accused, police sources contacted by Dawn were able to confirm three FIRs from their record, plus two more registered in 2021 that are not listed in the FIA brief.)
In conclusion, the brief says that in December 2021, the enquiry was transferred to FIA headquarters in Islamabad. The story of that transfer is revealing in its brazen conflict of interest.
In March 2021, Mr Brohi’s wife, Samina Mumtaz Zehri was elected to the Senate on a reserved women’s seat. According to a senior political leader, her election was managed by former ISI chief Faiz Hameed, who had her vote shifted to Hub from Karachi and presented her as a Senate candidate from the Balochistan Awami Party. (The BAP is well known to have the military establishment’s backing.) After her election, Ms Zehri became a member of the standing committee on interior. At its meeting on Oct 22, 2021, the minutes of which are in Dawn’s possession, the members made several recommendations. One of these reads: “Senators Rana Maqbool Ahmed, Azam Nazir Tarar and Muhammad Talha Mahmood were of the considered opinion that Dr Farooq, deputy director of FIA, Karachi has now become a controversial officer and the case pointed by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri should be transferred to Islamabad and interrogated…” The case in question was the FIA’s inquiry into Ms Zehri’s own husband.
As per its letter dated Dec 27, 2021 acknowledging the standing committee’s decision, the DG FIA’s Islamabad office directed that the enquiry report be submitted for perusal to the DG, FIA within a fortnight. The DG FIA did not respond to repeated requests in writing from Dawn as to the fate of the enquiry.

On Nov 4, 2024, Senior Vice President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce & Industry Saquib Fayyaz Magoon wrote to Chief Secretary Sindh Asif Hyder Shah about a complaint forwarded to him by President, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industries Jawed Bilwani. The complaint, by businessman Shoaib Razzak Makkad and also dated Nov 4, 2024, was enclosed with the letter to the chief secretary.
Mr Makkad in his complaint stated that he was a partner in Salina International, a salt manufacturing business. According to him, he was “in possession of land measuring 54.3 acres since 2019” in Mauripur, district Keamari. “…[O]n June 28, 2024, Tapedar … and Tapedar …, notable front men of Ali Hassan Brohi, with some unknown people came with heavy weapons and … encroached on the entire land. They are still today residing [there] with heavy weapons.”


Saquib Fayyaz Magoon’s letter to chief secretary Sindh.

A senior government officer told Dawn, “In districts West and Keamari, without Ali Hassan’s NOC, neither DC, nor SSP, nor mukhtiarkar, nor some ACs — such as of Manghopir and Mauripur — can be appointed.” This view was corroborated by sources in the police, bureaucracy, business sector and PPP itself. A seasoned bureaucrat said that even after lease papers for a particular housing society in district West had been signed, “the AC and mukhtiarkar wouldn’t make an entry in their mutation registers because they don’t do anything unless specifically ordered by Ali Hassan.”
(A mukhtiarkar is a BoR official just below the assistant commissioner, responsible for processing and issuing documents related to land revenue, which makes this an extremely powerful post.)
This is not to suggest that Mr Brohi is the only one whose name crops up in context of allegedly questionable land dealings. However, given his political profile, he is arguably the most prominent among these individuals.
Dirty business
Before moving on to the other actors in the sordid saga of land grabbing in Karachi, a brief note on how land ownership is created followed by some instances of shady real estate dealings that Dawn has uncovered.
The Board of Revenue, Sindh is original custodian of all the land in the province. Aside from revenue collection and maintaining land records in Sindh, BoR allots land to individuals, societies and various institutions and development authorities such as Karachi Development Authority (KDA), Lyari Development Authority (LDA), Defence Housing Authority, etc to develop schemes for specific purposes.
Relevant revenue officials ‘survey’ an area of state land and divide it into blocks with each given a unique identifier called a “survey number”. The surveyed land can then be allotted according to a procedure specified under the Sindh Colonisation and Disposal of Government Land Rules, 2005. Unsurveyed land is termed ‘na class’ land, which belongs to the original owner, the state, which holds it in trust for the public. Na class or unsurveyed land is distinguished on BoR maps by a different colour and different sequence of numbers than surveyed land.
But evidence that rules of procedure are being violated with breathtaking impunity — and with full knowledge of the authorities — lies scattered all across Karachi. Districts West (particularly in Halkani, Bund Murad and Jam Chakro), Keamari (which was carved out of the original district West in 2020), East and Malir have become increasingly attractive for builders. “To make a project viable inside the city is quite difficult because you can’t find big chunks of land there, and whatever land that does exist there is expensive,” says Hamid Khan* of the Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD). “That’s why builders tend to focus on the suburbs.”
No doubt there are countless examples of illegal land use within Karachi proper, including encroachment on amenity plots, by elements connected with all political parties — PPP, MQM and ANP (during the latter two’s heyday in the city), and even by the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan for a period. For reasons of space, however, this report focuses on Karachi’s outlying areas and encroachments within recent years.
Dawn Investigations visited multiple sites in district West, as well as the huge development scheme known as Hawkesbay Scheme 42 in district Keamari. Where until some years ago there were vast stretches of empty land dotted with goths (rural settlements), dozens of gated housing schemes are now coming up, many boasting little more than an entrance, a boundary wall and a booking office where dubious claims about the builders’ title to land are made.
Take Al-Jannat City by MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd in deh Halkani, for example. Mohammed Aqeel in the booking office informs the Dawn correspondent, who approaches him as a prospective investor, that there are 575 residential plots of 120 sq yards each available here, and a number of commercial plots. The proposed layout plan displayed in the booking office shows the project as being spread across 32.8 acres on survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61. The salesperson says six families are already residing in the society while around 20 houses are under construction. Residential plots cost between Rs3 to 3.5 million, with all sales final. Calculated at Rs3.3m each, the residential plots alone add up to at least Rs1.84 billion.


A masterplan of the housing society is plastered on a wall inside the Al Jannat City office.

“If you delay buying for a month, the price could cross four million rupees,” cautions Mr Aqeel. “Construction has been picking up pace here and there’s no other leased project nearing completion in the area.” He adds: “We have been issuing sub-leases to owners of the plots.” The question is: how is that possible when the land on which Al-Jannat City is coming up does not even belong to the builder?
Mr Aqeel claims LDA has leased the land to the builders, but tellingly, he refuses to show the lease. “Not until you purchase a plot,” he says firmly. (Deh Halkani is part of what is known as Scheme 43, which the BoR has given only as a ‘controlled’ area to LDA. The Authority itself has no lease for it.)
To delve deeper into the builder’s claims, Dawn GIS department referred to the digitised data in LARMIS. The apex court in 2012 banned the mutation of public land in Sindh, but in 2019, it partially lifted the ban in areas where the land record had been digitised. Thus, one can reasonably assume that the LARMIS data, where it exists, is up to date.
It turns out that survey numbers 57, 58, 59 and 61 actually lie on the other side of the road from where Al-Jannat City is coming up. The project is located on what is entirely state land. Interestingly, taken together, these survey numbers almost mirror the dimensions of the project itself.
A short drive away on the main road is Alvisha Housing Society by the same builder, located opposite the Ijtema Gah where a mammoth religious congregation gathers every year. The salesman at the project office tells the correspondent that 120- and 160-sq yard residential and 200 sq yard commercial plots are available for sale in blocks A, B and C. In block C, a 120 sq yard plot costs Rs2.8m lump sum, and Rs3.6m on a 42-month installment plan.
When asked about official approvals, one of the two men present says that for the time being, the plots in block A, where the office is located, are being offered on sale to “those who have faith in the builder” and not to the general public. When asked why that is so, he admits that the “paperwork for block A is not 100 per cent complete, unlike blocks B and C.”
He lays out the society’s proposed layout plan on the desk; it lists the survey numbers (86, 87, 88 and 89) on which it is being constructed. Frontline Marketing, which is handling the project, shares with Dawn an NOC issued by LDA which also mentions the same survey numbers, 86 to 89.
However, Dawn’s GIS department has determined that these survey numbers lie quite some distance away, in the direction where the men in the sales office vaguely indicated that blocks B and C will come up. Moreover, Alvisha’s block A is actually situated on survey numbers 96 and 97. It is not known what is the reason for this discrepancy.

But revenue officials tell Dawn this kind of discrepancy is very common. One explains it thus: “Sometimes there are other claimants to the land; sometimes builders will use ownership of one piece of survey land to falsely claim ownership over other surveyed land, or even over unsurveyed land; another ploy is to get a fake allotment of unsurveyed land and, after possession, go to the revenue department for a survey number.”
Dawn’s letter to MAA Construction & Builders Pvt Ltd was returned. Another letter with questions to Frontline Marketing received no response either.
With around 60 projects in Karachi, GFS Builders & Developers is one of the big players in Pakistan’s real estate market. Supported by a slick marketing campaign, its numerous smooth-talking salespersons push discount offers, and district West is dotted with a number of their projects. A closer look at North Town Residency Phase-2 exposes some shocking facts.
According to an ‘NOC’ for sale and advertisement of plots in NTR phase 2 issued by the Sindh Building Control Association, the project measures 30 acres on land bearing survey numbers 363 to 367 “out of na class no 294 in deh Halkani”. The BoR map submitted to the Supreme Court in 2013 clearly shows this entire area — which falls partly in deh Halkani and partly in deh Bund Murad — as being na class (or unsurveyed/state land). The LARMIS website currently shows the same situation in deh Halkani. The map for deh Bund Murad is missing. Dawn received no response to questions it sent in writing to the GFS CEO.

(Dawn repeatedly contacted the DC West; Senior Member Board of Revenue, Sindh with a cc to the Chief Secretary, Sindh; Member, Land Utilisation, BoR; and Project Director, LARMIS to ask about the provenance of the survey numbers in connection with the aforementioned housing projects. There was no response from any of them except for LARMIS Assistant Director, Coordination, Hafeezullah Abbasi. Mr Abbasi informed Dawn over the phone that LARMIS does not possess the data in question. “We can only digitise the data that we have been provided.”)
Filthy rich
Interestingly, the above-mentioned na class number — no 294 — from which piece of land GFS representatives claim that survey numbers 363 to 367 have been carved out for its North Town Residency-Phase 2, crops up in a complaint to NAB about huge tracts of land being illegally taken over and sold. A list of suspicious sales/allotments was enclosed with the complaint, mentioning the survey/na class numbers, area and value, and ‘sellers’ and ‘purchasers’ of the land in question. According to this, 82 acres on na class numbers 284 – 294 were illegally sold/allotted to GFS.
The dubious transactions listed in the complaint to NAB involve nearly 1,500 acres, including around 1,150 acres of state land. On Oct 11, 2023, NAB wrote to DC West informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land”, and asking him to furnish NAB with a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023.


Letter written by NAB to the DC West, informing him about the complaint it had received regarding “illegal sale/ allotment of government land” in the district and seeking a comprehensive report by Oct 23, 2023.

Repeated attempts to seek NAB’s official response to this complaint went unanswered. Sources told Dawn that NAB had initiated a formal enquiry based on the allegations in this complaint, but recently, 166 cases, enquiries, references and complaints relating to the departments of revenue, local government and food had been transferred to Sindh’s Anti-Corruption Establishment.
The list enclosed with the complaint to NAB lays bare how predatory networks have hollowed out governance in Sindh — like locusts stripping bare every field they descend upon. Those who acquired the land allegedly through illegal sale/allotment include a number of well-known builders and developers. And among those accused of supplying them the land — the ‘sellers’ — are Ali Hassan Brohi, an SHO and a mukhtiarkar.
The cop is Ghulam Hussain Korai, then SHO Manghopir in district West. Consider just one of the parcels of land that he, jointly with one Yousuf Brohi, is accused of grabbing: 200 acres of state land in deh Bund Murad which was, as per this document, worth an eye-watering Rs4 bn.
An SHO can be a grade 14 (sub-inspector) or grade 16 (inspector) officer, whose monthly salary is at the most Rs120,000. In December 2024, after complaints by a number of businessmen about brazen land grabbing in Karachi became too vociferous to ignore, the powers that be ordered the Sindh government to address the issue.
Inspector Korai was among five police officers who were subsequently transferred to desk jobs at the police headquarters. (A number of revenue officials were also transferred, though often replaced, say sources, with others of equally ill repute but boasting strong ties with those who matter in the provincial leadership.)
In response to Dawn’s questions, Inspector Korai described the allegations against him as “false, fabricated, and baseless … the [Association of Builders & Developers] have withdrawn their application, and the issue has been resolved accordingly.” He enclosed a letter from ABAD with his response. An excerpt from it reads: “… due to unavoidable circumstances the complainant currently displaying a lack of coordination with ABAD regarding their submitted complaints … We hereby request to withdraw the complaint against him.” Dawn was unable to confirm the nature of the “unavoidable circumstances”. Mr Korai remains without any posting. Sources say he has been sanctioned several times for misconduct.
There is on the same list one Ejaz, described as mukhtiarkar Scheme 33, who is alleged to have handed over in a fraudulent manner seven acres in Scheme 33 itself to an undisclosed builder and developer. This appears to be a reference to Aijazul Hassan Khan. Incidentally, Mr Aijaz was among 11 mukhtiarkars suspended in 2023 for land fraud.
It is difficult to overstate the cruel irony in this situation. While public land gets siphoned away by unscrupulous builders hand in glove with rapacious elements from the ruling elite and corrupt government officials, affordable public sector housing schemes almost never go beyond the blueprint.
Hawkesbay Scheme 42, Karachi’s oldest public sector project, is a stark example. This scheme was started in 1984 for the low- and middle-income segment by KDA and transferred to LDA in 1996. Over four decades later, much of it is still undeveloped and without electricity or water. Many original allottees remained unable during their lifetime to take possession of their plots, which they had paid for with their hard-earned money.
Scheme 42 even includes a block exclusively for overseas Pakistanis, but they too have nothing to show for their investment till today. And yet, those with no right to the land but plenty of clout have staked their claim to the overseas block by building a boundary wall around its perimeter, repeatedly. Each time the wall is bulldozed by the authorities, it comes up again within no time.
An illegal housing society called Aashqan-e-Mustafa has materialised along the Suparco Road which cuts through Scheme 42. Two front men of an MPA are said to be handling transactions.

When a Dawn Investigations team visits, a man strolls up, asking if they are interested in a plot and if so, to take their queries to Madina Real Estate nearby. There are 100- or 120-square yard plots available for sale here, says the realtor: “a 400-sq yard commercial plot alongside the main road costs Rs6.5m with cash payment over three months.” When asked whether the society has a lease from the development authority, he replies: “No, it’s not leased but this is part of the Gothabad Scheme, so you’ll get a sanad if you buy here.” This means the government had notified this piece of state land for a goth situated here — ostensibly in this case, Kachelo Goth. However, sanads can only be issued to the original residents of a goth. Incidentally, Kachelo Goth actually lies around 2km away.

Predictably, the Gothabad Scheme over the years has become another vehicle for corruption since it began in 1987 to provide housing to the deserving indigenous population in rural Sindh. Gothabad mukhiarkars began issuing fake sanads, even multiple sanads to one individual to enable the latter to claim title over a large area.
Mohammed Shahnawaz at the Aashqan-e-Mustafa housing society site office in fact claimed that buyers would be given backdated sanads because “sanads stopped being issued after 2012”. Dawn received no response to questions addressed in writing to the proprietors of Aashqan-e-Mustafa.
In June 2014, during Supreme Court hearings into the Karachi unrest case, BoR submitted a report stating that 59,803 acres of state land had been encroached upon. Backroom land deals are not mere irregularities — they are a fundamental breach of public trust. State land is not for the government to bestow upon whomever it favours, which is why a recent Sindh High Court judgement underscored that, in the interest of transparency, state land must be disposed of through an open auction.
Fake NOCs, no paper trail
All the housing societies investigated for this report happen to fall under LDA. Ahmed Saeed*, who is very familiar with the LDA’s workings, reveals that the Authority has in umpteen instances showed ‘na class’ land (ie unsurveyed land which cannot be allotted to anyone and on which no project can be constructed) as survey land. He alleges that everyone, including BoR, is party to the fraud.
According to him, the landgrabber writes to the Director General LDA to request an NOC for the layout plan on what they claim is their land. The DG sends the letter to the relevant DC, asking for clarification on the status of the land in question. The DC forwards it to the mukhtiarkar who takes out a report which then goes back to the DC, who forwards it to the DG confirming the land does indeed belong to the interested party.
“The official fee for approval of the layout plan is Rs1.3m per acre, and the bribe for showing na class land as survey land is Rs500,000 per acre,” says Mr Saeed. “But because the letters have been sent around by hand, not by a dispatcher, there’s no trail. LDA will say they did this on BoR’s say-so; if you ask BoR for verification, they’ll say this is state land and they never gave approval for it. You show them the correspondence — and they’ll say it’s fake, but they all know. They’re all involved.” In other words, classic smoke and mirrors.

 

At his office, a rather harried-looking DG LDA Safdar Bughio, tells Dawn: “Our planning department verifies ownership through the concerned DC office; it’s BoR that checks whether the builder has ownership or not. When they confirm ownership title, then our planning department does the technical work on it [to issue NOC for layout plan].”
LDA planning department head, Mohammed Arbab, toes a similar line: “Our mandate and function is the KBTPR [Karachi Building and Town Planning Rules]. We are only a town planning agency. The identification of the land is done by the DC, title verification is done by the DC, record of survey numbers is with the DC.”
However, Mr Bughio concedes there are some illegal housing societies. “It is also our responsibility to stop them. We do stop them, but officially we deal only with those who come for [layout plan] NOCs from us. But definitely I will soon start a programme in which we will take on the responsibility of dealing with them.”
As for Mr Arbab, when pressed further on the issue, he says: “Qabzay bhi wohi log kartay hain … na class land pay jin kay hukoomati links hotay hain.” (Encroachment on state land is done by those who have government connections.)
Other cogs in the wheel
There are nevertheless some public servants who try to discharge their duty with at least a degree of integrity. In instances where the mukhtiarkar concerned takes action and issues a notice to a suspected land grabber, the latter can approach the anti-encroachment tribunal. The Sindh Public Property (Removal of Encroachment) Act, 2010, empowers anti-encroachment tribunals headed by a retired district and sessions judge or an advocate of 10 years’ standing to determine the rights of the parties involved.
Too often, though, the only anti-encroachment tribunal in Karachi has given questionable decisions. In fact, several sources told Dawn that encroachers go to the tribunal with fake/ forged documents to establish title to the land they have grabbed by obtaining a stay order. “It’s simple,” says Umair Rafiq*, a senior bureaucrat. “Go meet the court reader, file an application quickly and get a stay. Then anyone who visits that land becomes guilty of contempt. You just pay one or two million rupees for this.”
Dawn has in its possession the copy of an order in suit no 15/ 2024, issued on July 23, 2024, by Muneer Bhutto, district and sessions judge and, until recently, presiding officer of the anti-encroachment tribunal. The plaintiff is Al-Faiz Builders Pvt Ltd while the defendants include officials from BoR, SBCA, LDA, anti-encroachment police personnel, etc.

 

In his interim order, the presiding offer restrained “the defendants, their agents and anyone on their behalf from eject[ting], evict[ing], dispossess[ing] the plaintiff from the suit property ie 32 acres land na class No 42 situated at Deh Methan, tapo Manghopir, district Keamari”.
Interestingly, the same presiding officer (now heading the Karachi Water & Sewerage Tribunal) was the focus of a complaint made earlier that year. In a letter dated Jan 30, 2024, a copy of which is available with Dawn, the DC East wrote to the Sindh High Court Registrar, the Member Inspection Team-II (a body that handles complaints against judicial officers in the district and lower courts), requesting further action on a complaint against Mr Bhutto that had been forwarded to him by the assistant commissioner East. With his letter, he enclosed a report submitted by a mukhtiarkar of Karachi East, Muhammad Irfan Lashari.
Mr Lashari in his complaint alleged that the presiding officer had granted a stay to land grabbers on 500 sq yards of state land at Fateh Mohammed Gabol Goth that had been reserved by the Sindh government for a dispensary for the local residents. In fact, he said in his report, possession had already been given to the health department representative with documentation to the effect. According to him, through the stay order, a contempt of court notice against him and letter of suspension, he was “pressurised to follow the unlawful order passed by the presiding officer of the tribunal. … The stay orders … not only provide cover to the land grabbers but also encourage them to usurp more state land in connivance with support of presiding officer of the said tribunal and his staff…”
Nothing came of this complaint. In fact, sources said that a “fake case” had been filed against the DC concerned, his properties were attached and he was declared an absconder.
(On Oct 15, 2025, in a development unrelated to Mr Lashari’s complaint, Muneer Bhutto was found guilty of misconduct after an enquiry by MIT member Justice Muhammad Faisal Kamal Alam of the Sindh High Court that began in 2021. Concluding that Mr Bhutto had “misused” his “senior official position”, the MIT imposed on him “the minor penalty of withholding of annual increment for a period of three years”.)
Despite repeated attempts, Mr Bhutto refused to receive Dawn’s letter with questions regarding the above allegations.
Nothing oils the wheels of elite capture like a corrupt bureaucracy. Seasoned bureaucrats hold that officers were generally appointed on merit in Benazir Bhutto’s time, but this changed after her assassination in December 2007. “As soon as PPP’s victory in the 2008 election seemed assured, officers began to get calls from the PPP leadership telling them to refrain from recruitment and from making any appointments,” says Rashid Saleem*, a retired assistant commissioner. “As soon as they came in, they began to recruit their own people.”
The passage of the 18th Amendment, say old-school bureaucrats, removed the guardrails entirely. “The 2012 recruits were rapidly promoted and are now in grade 19. Soon they’ll be in grade 20, secretary level. God help Sindh when that happens,” says Mr Saleem.

 

According to several senior civil servants, the Sindh Public Service Commission’s (SPSC) examination process has become seriously compromised, with ‘favoured’ candidates awarded inflated scores in the oral segment while deserving candidates are failed despite strong written performances. Each recruitment, appointment and promotion has a price, they claim.
Journalist Imdad Soomro has extensively investigated corruption in the SPSC. “To get recruited into a department, one has to pay between Rs5m to Rs10m,” he alleges. At the other end of the spectrum are the top posts, such as assistant commissioner, excise and taxation officer, DSP, mukhtiarkar, etc for which candidates must sit the Combined Competitive Examination or CCE. The ‘rates’ are higher for such “kamanay walay [lucrative] posts” as Mr Soomro puts it. According to him, to become AC or ETO, one must pay Rs80m; appointment as mukhtiarkar entails a bribe of Rs40m.
According to a retired official, “There’s an exam called the revenue qualifier exam for clerical staff who have served three years in the Revenue Department. Clerks have paid Rs15m to Rs20m to become assistant mukhtiarkar. Close to 30 clerks have become assistant mukhtiarkars in this manner.”
Often, all it takes for career advancement is to cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship with a political patron. Dawn was told that in one land development authority, an individual on a contingency contract as a watchman was now a grade-19 officer on an extremely important post.
The great Karachi land grab
Real estate in Karachi has been the cause of much disorder and violence. The final JIT report looking into the murder on March 13, 2013 of Perween Rahman, director of the Orangi Pilot Project, offered a revealing commentary.

 

Referring to the period between 2006-2012, and the ethnic conflict between Pashtuns and Mohajirs, it noted that cadres of both MQM and ANP were heavily involved in various criminal activities, especially land grabbing, as were the Taliban who were a potent militant force in Karachi at the time. “… whatever their stated political differences, all three groups worked hand in glove … Big developers … would ally themselves with these groups, using the militant wings of these groups as their ‘muscle’, in order to forcibly seize land. Anyone who came in their way was either threatened, or if they refused to back off, killed. …[O]ften murders that were declared as being politically motivated or acts of terrorism, were in actual fact land disputes that were made to look like political killings to cover up the real facts. The state apparatus, in the shape of the land revenue administration or the police, was either too weak, or complicit in the face of the great Karachi land grab.”
It was against this backdrop that the then Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry in 2012 while hearing the Karachi ‘badamni’ (unrest) case, banned the Sindh government from effecting mutation, allotment, or transfer of any government land in Sindh until the province’s land record — huge amounts of which was destroyed in the rioting following the murder of Benazir Bhutto — was digitised. (The court conditionally lifted the ban in 2019 in instances where the record had been computerised.)
But the ban meant little in the areas of Karachi where state land was plentiful.
During retired Justice Maqbool Baqar’s tenure as chief minister Sindh in the runup to the 2024 election, an enquiry was held into allotments and mutations made by BoR Sindh between 2012 and 2023. That is, after the Supreme Court ban. Some of the findings are as follows.
In Manghopir, district West, there were forged entries and fake allotments in land record; an incident of arson was committed in 2021 by revenue officials, including mukhtiarkars and tapedars, “to deliberately destroy fake entries kept by the revenue officials in collusion with private beneficiaries”.
In deh Bund Murad, also district West, the enquiry found that “Government land worth billions of rupees in various na class … was illegally transferred to private individuals… .” Numerous revenue officials were named as being complicit and acquiring assets beyond their means. None of them appears to have been prosecuted.
According to the 2018 JIT report on money laundering worth billions of rupees through fake bank accounts, 562 acres of state land in Sindh, including 363 acres of Pakistan Steel Mill land, were “illegally allotted to private builders causing a loss of Rs4.14 billion to the national exchequer”. The report also alleged that Bahria Town Ltd had remitted Rs10bn into the fake accounts as kickbacks for grabbing thousands of acres of state as well as private lands for its projects in Karachi.
In 2023, a member of Sindh’s caretaker cabinet told Dawn: “[During the previous government,] the sub registrars and mukhtiarkars in Karachi would collect 600 to 700 million rupees per month for ‘upward’ distribution. They had a free hand. Even if someone’s land was legal, they would still charge according to the ‘system’ at the rate they had set, eg Korangi, Rs300,000 per acre. By transferring mukhtiarkars, we disrupted that system of collection.”
Under the caretaker setup, per one government official, security agencies were said to have taken up the task of ‘cleaning the system’. Officials were assured that “qabzas will not happen like before”. A number of people were even put on the ECL, unofficially if not officially. But despite those claims, rather little has changed in the way that real estate is occupied in the city. The faces may be different, but the practices remain the same.
Thus, individuals like Mr Brohi have even greater sway than before; they are fixtures in the corridors of power, protected by their formidable patrons. According to a bureaucrat, “Even DIGs, senior government officials will go out of their way to maintain good relations with them.”
Perhaps that is why Fayyaz Solangi, the former DC West who placed that damning notice in the newspapers against Mr Brohi back in 2020, put in another notice on July 8, 2025 — five years later — in Urdu, English and Sindhi newspapers containing a grovelling apology, and stating that an enquiry had not established allegations of land grabbing against him. An excerpt from the notice reads “…I had already apologized to him in person and directed my staff to issue corrigendum to this effect but unfortunately the same [was] not published on a timely basis and I was transferred…”


Former DC West Fayyaz Solangi’s public apology to Mr Brohi published in Dawn on July 8, 2025.

That shameful apology was a step too far, even for a severely compromised bureaucracy. Two days later, the former DC West swiftly found himself reduced to officer on special duty by the chief secretary Sindh. Mr Solangi did not respond to Dawn’s repeated requests for comment.
As for Jibrail Khan, the JUI-F local leader who ran afoul of certain political bigwigs, the intercession of his party leadership appears to have magically made the FIRs against him melt into thin air. Even though he has yet to obtain bail in all the cases, he is out of prison. The ‘system’ knows when compromise is a better closing gambit.

In an interview with several European newspapers, the French leader said the European Union should not mistake a lull in tensions with Washington for a lasting shift despite a pause in US threats over Greenland, trade and technology.
Macron urged EU leaders to use a summit in a Belgian castle this week to inject fresh energy into economic reforms to bolster the bloc’s competitiveness and strengthen its ability to stand up to China and the United States on the world stage.
When there’s a clear act of aggression, I think what we should do isn’t bow down or try to reach a settlement,” Macron told Le Monde, the Financial Times and other newspapers in comments published on Tuesday.

French president warns of renewed friction with US, urges EU to use ‘Greenland moment’ to push reforms

“We’ve tried that strategy for months. Its not working, Macron said the Trump administration was being “openly anti-European” and seeking the EU’s “dismemberment”. He said he anticipated further tensions with the Trump administration, including over Europe’s regulation of digital technology.
“The US will, in the coming months that’s certain attack us over digital regulation,” Macron added, warning of potential US import tariffs from US President Donald Trump should the EU use its Digital Services Act to control tech companies.
Europe needs protection
Europe needed to be more resilient in the face of a double challenge from the United States and China, Macron said. “We have the Chinese tsunami on the trade front, and we have minute-by-minute instability on the American side. These two crises amount to a profound shock a rupture for Europeans,” he continued.

 

Macron, whose second term finishes in spring 2027, renewed his call for the EU to embark on more common borrowing to help the bloc of 27 nations invest at scale and challenge the hegemony of the US dollar.
“World markets are increasingly wary of the US dollar. They’re looking at alternatives. Let’s offer them European debt,” Macron said, adding that Europe’s democratic institutions were a major asset for investors at a time when the US was “drifting away from the rule of law”.
The EU used joint debt in 2020 to re-boot the European economy after the Covid-19 pandemic, but French attempts to make such tools permanent have faced stiff resistance from Germany and other more frugal northern member states.
Thursday’s summit will include discussions around French-led plans for a Made in Europe strategy that would set minimum requirements for European content in locally manufactured goods. The approach has split EU countries and alarmed automakers.
“For me, the economic strategy to make our Europe a power lies in what I call protection, which is not protectionism, but rather European preference,” Macron said.
Published in Dawn, February 11th, 2026</p><small>2026-02-11 02:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/11083555e624110.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972484/govt-woos-japanese-investors' target='_blank'><strong>Govt woos Japanese investors</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar on Tuesday assured Japanese automobile manufacturers that the government would address their concerns to deepen and sustain industrial cooperation, telling them that Islamabad was committed to creating an enabling environment for long-term investment.
“Pakistan is listening, and Pakistan is acting,” Mr Akhtar said, assuring Japanese firms that their issues would be taken up “in partnership with stakeholders” to ensure continued, mutually beneficial cooperation.
Mr Akhtar was speaking at the Japan-Pakistan Business Seminar 2026, which brought together government officials, business leaders, universities, and the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Pakistan, Japan Interna­tional Cooperation Agency and the Japan External Trade Organisation.
He said the automotive sector remained one of the most visible and impactful areas of economic cooperation between Japan and Pakistan, noting that Japa­nese automakers had been operating in the country for decades and had played a central role in shaping its industrial landscape.
“Japanese automakers have been at the forefront of Pakistan’s automotive industry, creating jobs, transferring technology and supporting local supply chains,” Mr Akhtar said. Companies such as Toyota, Suzuki and Honda, he added, had contributed not only to vehicle production but also to parts manufacturing, logistics, dealerships and service networks.
Mr Akhtar acknowledged, however, that recent engagements with Japanese automakers had highlighted concerns about tax refunds and export-related hurdles, underscoring the need for continuous dialogue and streamlined processes to support long-term growth.
“We are committed to addressing these concerns in partnership with stakeholders, ensuring that Japan’s industrial participation in Pakistan remains robust, competitive, and mutually beneficial,” Mr Akhtar said.
Japanese Ambassador to Pakistan Akamatsu Shuichi said Japanese automotive companies had made a substantial and lasting contribution to Pakistan’s economy and would continue to do so.
“Japanese automotive companies have created more than 100,000 jobs in Pakistan and have established domestic supply chains to localise automotive components,” he added.

RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: Courts in twin cities on Tuesday issued non-bailable arrest warrants in two separate cases involving senior PTI figures Aleema Khanum, sister of party founder Imran Khan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.
The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Ms Khan in connection with the November 26 PTI protest case registered at Sadiqabad police station.
ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah ruled that there was no legal justification for Ms Khan’s absence from court proceedings, noting that she neither appeared nor sought an exemption.
Her counsel, Faisal Malik, also failed to attend the hearing, prompting the court to proceed with the case in their absence.
The court accepted the request of Special Prosecutor Zaheer Shah to include NCCI official Salman Niaz as a prosecution witness and adjourned the hearing until Wednesday (today).
Earlier, the same court rejected Ms Khan’s petition seeking removal of terrorism charges, dismissing her challenge to the court’s jurisdiction under the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).
Judge Amjad Ali Shah ruled that the case fell within the scope of the ATA, rejecting the defence’s argument that protest-related charges should not be tried in an anti-terrorism court.
Ms Khan is accused of relaying a message from her brother Imran Khan from Adiala jail, allegedly calling for nationwide protests, which prosecutors claim led to violence.
Special Prosecutor Zaheer Shah argued that the Faizabad protest turned violent, resulting in injuries to police officers and gunfire striking a police van – actions that, he said, met the legal threshold for terrorism.
The prosecution also accused the defence of employing delaying tactics, including seeking adjournments due to a lawyers’ strike.
During earlier proceedings, the court ordered the unfreezing of bank accounts belonging to the Shaukat Khanum Memorial Trust and Namal University, clarifying that prosecutors had never requested their freezing.
The November 26 protests saw PTI supporters march towards Islamabad despite government restrictions, clashing with security personnel in the Red Zone.
Following the unrest, multiple cases were registered under the PPC and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act at Taxila, Sadiqabad, and Naseerabad police stations.
Proceedings in the Sadiqabad case continue at the ATC Rawalpindi.
KP CM’s warrant
Meanwhile, an Islamabad court issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi in a case pertaining to misleading statements against state institutions and damage to their reputation.
The case was registered by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Authority (NCCIA) under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), 2016, following allegations that the chief minister made false and defamatory claims against state institutions.
During the hearing, Senior Civil Judge Abbas Shah noted that CM Afridi had once again failed to appear despite being summoned multiple times. Subsequently, the judge ordered his immediate arrest and directed law enforcement authorities to ensure his production before the court. The hearing was then adjourned till Feb 21.

Moscow has been threatening various internet platforms with forced slowdowns or outright bans if they do not comply with Russian laws. Those laws require data on Russian users to be stored inside the country, and for efforts to be made to stamp out their use for what Moscow calls “criminal and terrorist purposes”.
Critics and rights campaigners say the restrictions are a transparent attempt by the Kremlin to ramp up control and surveillance over internet use in Russia, amid a sweeping crackdown on dissent during the Ukraine offensive.
Telegram’s Russian-born founder Pavel Durov, who lives outside the country, posted on his Telegram channel that “Russia is restricting access to Telegram in an attempt to force its citizens to switch to a state-controlled app built for surveillance and political censorship”.
The Roskomnadzor agency said in a statement cited by state media that it will “continue to introduce phased restrictions” on Telegram, which it said had not complied with the laws.
Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned what it called a continuous “strategy to strangle the circulation of information” and noted that Russia ranks 171st out of 180 in its World Press Freedom Index.
Amnesty International meanwhile branded the move “censorship and obstruction under the guise of protecting people’s rights and interests”. Telegram is widely used across Russia, both as a messaging app and as a social media service.
Almost all major public figures, including government bodies and the Kremlin, post regular updates on the platform. Some pro-war bloggers, who also use Telegram extensively, criticised the decision, saying it would hobble communications around the front line and in Russian-occupied territory.
“It’s very unpleasant,” said the Two Majors channel, one of Russia’s most widely read military correspondents.
“People’s positions will now mostly be conveyed to the outside world not by people, but by our masters of the foreign ministry,” it added, lamenting the switch to Russian apps that nobody outside the country uses.
Max rival
Moscow is trying to push users onto a state-backed competitor, called Max, which can also handle payments and government services. Pro-war correspondent Alexander Kots also said blocking Telegram would limit Russia’s own “information operations”, and recruitment of Ukrainians through the app to carry out sabotage attacks.

 

Both sides widely accuse each other of plotting behind-the-lines operations by recruiting sympathisers, or those in need of cash, over social media. Before the war, Russia had previously tried to ban Telegram — which is still run by Durov, who also possesses French and Emirati citizenships — but ultimately failed in its attempts to block access and lifted the ban in 2020.
Russian users reported slow traffic and lagging downloads on Telegram throughout Tuesday before the official announcement.

ISLAMABAD: A United Nations Security Council report has warned that the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) enjoys preferential treatment among terrorist groups operating from Afghanistan under the Taliban regime, heightening concerns among member states that the outfit could pose an extra-regional threat.
The warning was contained in the 37th report of the UN Security Council’s Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team, covering the period between July and December 2025.
The report stated: “In Afghanistan, the de facto authorities continued to provide a permissive environment for a range of terrorist groups, notably Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.”
It drew a direct comparison between the operational space available to the TTP and that afforded to other militant groups, and linked this disparity to a sharp deterioration in Pakistan’s security situation.
“TTP, however, was accorded greater liberty and support from the de facto authorities, and consequently, TTP attacks against Pakistan increased, amplifying regional tensions,” the report said. Of more than 3,500 terrorist attacks attributed to the TTP last year, over 2,100 were recorded in the second half of the year.
According to the monitoring team, the TTP “operates as one of the largest terrorist groups in Afghanistan”, reflecting its entrenched presence across multiple provinces and its sustained ability to plan and execute cross-border attacks.
The TTP is believed to have a strong presence in Afghanistan’s eastern and south-eastern border provinces, including Kunar, Nangarhar, Khost, Paktika — including the Barmal district — and Paktia. There are reports of new or expanded training centres in these locations, often under the influence of networks such as the Haqqani Network.
Various UN Security Council Monitoring Team assessments indicated that the TTP benefited from Taliban tolerance or active support, including access to safe houses, such as guesthouses in Kabul for senior leaders, movement passes, weapons permits and logistical assistance. These arrangements persist despite internal Taliban debates that have at times viewed the TTP as a liability due to strained relations with Pakistan.
Conservative estimates placed the number of TTP fighters in Afghanistan at around 6,000, with the group recruiting from Afghan Taliban ranks and receiving operational enhancements.
‘Extra-regional threat’
Member states, the report said, were increasingly alarmed not only by the scale of TTP’s activities but also by the direction in which the group could be heading. “Some member states expressed concern that TTP may deepen its cooperation with Al Qaeda-aligned groups in order to attack a wider range of targets, potentially resulting in an extra-regional threat,” the report noted.
These concerns were situated within a broader ecosystem of collaboration between terrorist groups in Afghanistan. The report said that Al Qaeda “acted as a service provider and multiplier for other terrorist groups in Afghanistan in terms of training and advice, principally to TTP”.
Member states feared that deeper cooperation could lead to more structured alliances, joint planning and access to a wider pool of fighters and resources, expanding the range of potential targets beyond Pakistan.
While the report did not state that the TTP was currently carrying out attacks outside the region, it reflected growing international concern that Afghanistan’s permissive environment under Taliban rule could allow the group, with Al Qaeda’s backing, to acquire capabilities and ambitions extending beyond South Asia.
The report also cautioned that Al Qaeda’s regional affiliate was adapting its posture. “There were concerns that AQIS was increasingly focused on external operations. Such operations would likely be unclaimed or deniable operations, perhaps as part of the umbrella group Ittihad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan (not listed), which declared itself in April, so as not to create difficulties for the Taliban as hosts of AQIS.”
Detailing the footprint of Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, the report stated, “Al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS) remained active in south-eastern Afghanistan, where the Haqqani Network exerts considerable influence. Osama Mahmoud, the ‘emir’ of AQIS, and Yahya Ghauri, his deputy, were reported to be in Kabul, with the media cell of AQIS based in Herat.”
‘ISIL-K remains resilient’
The report noted that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K) remained resilient in 2025 despite sustained counterterrorism pressure and losses.
According to the report, “Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan was under sustained counterterrorism pressure, but it retained a potent capability, coupled with intent to conduct external operations.”
The monitoring team said the terror outfit faced significant losses as a result of security operations by regional states and continued military action by the Taliban inside Afghanistan. These pressures reduced the overall number of attacks but did not dismantle the group’s operational base or its ability to regenerate.
The report noted that ISIL-K “was active mainly in northern Afghanistan, particularly Badakhshan, and areas close to the Pakistani border”, where it maintained networks of cells to project a regional threat and, potentially, operations beyond the immediate region.
Despite being under pressure, the group retained “significant operational and combat capability and the ability to rapidly replace fighters, including through online recruitment”, according to the report.
The campaign against ISIL-K also pus­hed it to seek alliances with other armed factions across Afghanistan as it adapted to the evolving security environment.
The monitoring team said ISIL-K continued efforts to expand its reach through technology, noting that ISIL and Al Qaeda “continued their efforts to build cybercapabilities”, a trend that member states saw as enhancing propaganda, recruitment and operational planning.
The monitoring team’s assessment that the group’s strong recruitment pipelines and expanding cyber capabilities in 2025 pointed to enabling factors that may have contributed to its ability to plan and execute the Feb 6 gun-and-bomb attack on a Shia mosque on the outskirts of Islamabad.
The report also pointed to growing concerns about militant collaboration. Member states reported that the Balochistan Liberation Army collaborated with the TTP and ISIL-K “through shared training camps and resources, coordinating attacks and meetings between commanders”.

“Either we reach a deal, or we’ll have to do something very tough,” it quoted Trump as saying.
Trump has said he is considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East, Axios and Channel 12 reported, amid simmering tensions between Washington and Tehran over Iran’s nuclear programme and over its recent crackdown on protesters.
“We have an armada that is heading there and another one might be going,” Trump told Axios, though he noted that Iran “wants to make a deal very badly”.
Trump initially threatened military action against Tehran over its crackdown on protesters last month. Subsequently, the US said that a naval strike group led by an aircraft carrier was deployed to Middle Eastern waters amid tensions between the two countries.
However, the countries held talks in Oman last week, which Iran called a good start. Trump also called the talks “very good” and pledged another round of negotiations.
On Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he hoped talks with the US would resume soon, while reiterating Tehran’s red lines and warning against any American attack.
According to excerpts published on his official Telegram channel during an interview with the Al Jazeera network, Araghchi said that Iran’s missile programme was “never negotiable” in the talks in Oman.
He warned that Tehran would target US bases in the region if the US attacked Iranian territory.</p><small>2026-02-10 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10215858126deab.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972350/norway-parliament-to-appoint-rare-outside-probe-of-foreign-ministrys-epstein-links' target='_blank'><strong>Norway parliament to appoint rare outside probe of foreign ministry’s Epstein links</strong></a><br><p>Norway’s parliamentary oversight committee unanimously agreed on Tuesday to appoint a rare external inquiry into foreign ministry links to Jeffrey Epstein, part of a deepening scandal over friendships with the late US sex offender.
The release of a cache of new files in the US has revealed a host of new Epstein connections with politicians, royals and the ultra-rich across Europe.
Norway’s white-collar crime police opened an investigation into Thorbjoern Jagland, former prime minister and foreign minister and ex-chair of the Nobel Peace Prize committee, on suspicion of aggravated corruption.
On Monday, police announced that Mona Juul, who on Sunday resigned as ambassador to Jordan and Iraq, was also being investigated for corruption. Her husband, former cabinet minister Terje Roed-Larsen, is suspected of complicity.
All three will cooperate with the respective investigations and see no merit in the accusations, their lawyers have said.
Epstein scandal reverberates across Norway
But the police’s actions have not stemmed the demand for a public inquiry in a country where officials are expected to be squeaky-clean.
“If only half of what we have learned in the last few weeks is true, then this is terrible,” the Labour Party’s Sverre Myrli told reporters after a meeting of parliament’s Standing Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs.
The files show, among other things, that Jagland and Epstein’s assistants made detailed plans in 2014 for Jagland, his wife, two children and his son’s girlfriend to visit Epstein at Palm Beach and the Caribbean island that he owned.
Jagland, then secretary general of the Council of Europe rights watchdog, has denied ever visiting Epstein’s private island.
In an email in 2014, he sought Epstein’s help in financing an apartment in Oslo.
Emails from 2018 showed Epstein asking Jagland to arrange for him to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and saying he had insights to offer President Vladimir Putin. Jagland promised to bring it up with Lavrov’s assistant.
Roed-Larsen’s ties to Epstein came to light in 2019. He has apologised several times for the relationship and, in 2020 stepped down as chief executive officer of the New York-based International Peace Institute think tank.
The files indicate that Juul and Roed-Larsen made plans to visit Epstein’s private island with their two children in 2011, though it was unclear if the visit took place.
In a message in 2017, Roed-Larsen called Epstein a “thoroughly good human being”, and in 2018, the couple received his help in negotiating the purchase of an apartment in Oslo that is now a subject of the police investigation.
In a will signed two days before his death by suicide in a jail cell in 2019, Epstein said he was leaving $5 million to each of the couple’s two children.
Norway’s crown princess, Mette-Marit, wife of the heir to the throne, apologised last week to the king and queen over a friendship with Epstein between 2011 and 2014, long after his 2008 conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.</p><small>2026-02-10 17:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10212854cf22349.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972341/outcry-in-senate-after-nepra-notifies-new-regulations-scrapping-net-metering' target='_blank'><strong>Outcry in Senate after Nepra notifies new regulations scrapping net-metering</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: There was an outcry in the upper house of Parliament on Tuesday against changes by the power regulator in the contracts for solar consumers, with the government defending the move.
The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Monday drastically changed the terms of contracts for all existing and future net-metered solar consumers — known as prosumers — to contain rising solar energy penetration and protect an expensive and inefficient state-owned power network. The notification effectively terminated the existing net-metering regime and replaced it with net-billing for all.
Speaking on a motion in the Senate on Tuesday, PTI Senator Syed Ali Zafar strongly criticised the government’s decision to withdraw net metering benefits for solar consumers, calling it a grave breach of trust and a cruel act against the people of Pakistan.
Senator Zafar stated that a promise, once made, must be honoured and when that promise came from the state, it became sacrosanct. He recalled that the government had assured citizens that if they invested in solar energy, they would be provided net metering on equitable terms.

 

This policy, he said, was presented not only as a personal financial benefit but as a national cause — reducing dependence on imported fuel, lowering energy costs, and moving Pakistan towards clean and sustainable energy.
He said the government made a solemn commitment to the people, urging them to invest for their own benefit and for the future of Pakistan, while assuring that issues with independent power producers (IPPs) would be addressed as citizens shifted to self-generation through solar power.
Acting on this assurance, people across the country invested heavily in solar panels, he said. He further stated that families diverted their life savings, sold assets, and even took loans, which they were still repaying, to install solar systems.
Senator Zafar said that solar energy was present in nearly every household, commercial building, and agricultural operation. Despite this, the government abruptly turned around and sought to cancel its commitment retrospectively, he regretted.
He termed retrospective withdrawal and retrospective imposition as a grave injustice. He also pointed out that under established law, the doctrine of promissory estoppel — a legal doctrine allowing enforcement of a promise lacking formal consideration to prevent injustice — applied.
Calling the decision “the most cruel act of the government”, Senator Zafar said it was akin to throwing a bomb into the already burdened lives of Pakistani citizens, who were struggling with soaring electricity bills and economic hardship.
He questioned how the government could expect foreign investment when it failed to honour commitments made to its own people.
Addressing the claim that the decision rested with Nepra, supposedly an independent authority, Senator Zafar categorically rejected this assertion.
He said that Nepra did not act independently but followed government directives. Any suggestion to the contrary, he said, would be misleading.
He challenged the government to prove its sincerity by making a clear commitment to ensure that the decision was withdrawn. He warned that the decision was disastrous, undermined public trust, damaged Pakistan’s investment climate, and punished those who acted in good faith for the betterment of the country.
In her remarks, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman said that the decision by Nepra was beyond understanding. She said that the middle class was questioning why the government provided incentives for solar power in the first place, if this decision was to be taken.
“How can you do this to your country and citizens who are being affected the most by climate change?” she asked. She said that the problem lay with the distribution system, asking what message was being sent to investors by changing tariffs again and again.
“You have made electricity bills an instrument through which various taxes are being imposed,” she said. She said that instead of setting up artificial intelligence centres like other countries, Pakistan was increasing the power bills of consumers.
“Manufacturing companies and domestic consumers should be provided with cheap electricity,” she said, adding that major manufacturing industries were leaving Pakistan due to heavy taxes and expensive energy.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam — Fazl Senator Kamran Murtaza and PTI Senator Zeeshan Khanzada also spoke on similar lines.
However, Power Minister Awais Leghari defended the move, stating that Nepra was within its remit to do so and that it had been done to take the burden off consumers.
“Changing regulations according to the law and the Constitution is a regulator’s job,” he said, adding that he refused to step back from this.
“This is not policy; there should be clarity on that,” he maintained. “This is a change in regulations, which was conducted according to the Constitution and Pakistan’s laws,” he said.
The minister added that seminars were held involving solar associations, consumers and all other stakeholders, and that matters were settled with them last June.
“The Solar Association of Pakistan — whose bread and butter is installing and investing in these systems — conveyed to us that what the government was doing was not just necessary, but without it, public interests could not be saved,” the minister emphasised.
Leghari added that the solar association warned that up to 95 per cent of people would suffer “greater damages and increased burdens”.
“They said in June, don’t do this now, wait at least five or six months and carry out a proper transition,” he stated.
“Nepra, a regulator with the responsibility of maintaining its consumers’ interests, was formed to watch consumer interest and protect people from increases in electricity prices.”
The minister noted that PTI Senator Ali Zafar spoke about retrospective effects, but said that there were none in this regulation.
“I am proud to say that in this regulation, our regulator did not reverse one clause on these contracts, which used to last seven years,” Leghari said.
He added that Zafar mentioned that these contracts would last 20 years, before assailing the PTI government.
“Under that, Imran Niazi, electricity prices were touching the sky and we are trying to deal with it right now,” he added. The minister emphasised that there were no 20-year contracts.
“It was a seven-year contract and until it expires, nobody in this country has dared to insert new terms and conditions in the contract. Nepra has not done this either,” he stated.
He added that of the over 30 million consumers, 466,506 of them had net-metering.
“These 466,506 consumers have put 7,000 megawatts (mW) of electricity on net-metering,” the minister stated. “Other than these 466,000 consumers, there are 30.04m who live in flats or slums, where they cannot install solar systems, or they cannot afford them.
“If Nepra allowed electricity to be bought at these rates, then the 30.04m consumers — who are the true public — would have to shoulder a Rs200 billion burden left by net-metering consumers, which would increase to Rs550bn,” Leghari added.
The minister further said that nothing would happen to the existing contracts of the 466,000 consumers, but that these were regulations for future consumers.
“What we are saying is that we will buy electricity from you based on the average rate of the grid,” he explained. Leghari added that consumer regulations were evolving.
“These are policies formed by innovative thinking which evolve with time, and these aren’t even policies, they are just regulations,” he added. “This is not the first time regulations have been changed, or rates have been revised.”</p><small>2026-02-10 16:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/102124574ebe593.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972340/paf-successfully-completes-golden-eagle-training-exercise-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>PAF successfully completes ‘Golden Eagle’ training exercise: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) on Monday completed the ‘Golden Eagle’ training exercise, where artificial intelligence (AI) and the use of new indigenous technology were focused on, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
According to the statement, the exercise took place in “Southern Air Command’s area of responsibility”, to “validate combat readiness and operational agility through the synchronised employment of PAF’s complete combat potential”.
“The exercise was executed under unified command and control from the Next-Generation All-Domain Command and Control Centre, [at] Air Headquarters, Islamabad,” the statement said.
It added that the exercise was conducted on a two-force construct and particularly focused on AI-enabled and net-centric operations, while integrating indigenous niche, disruptive and smart technologies, in line with evolving regional security dynamics.
ISPR said that while operating within a robust integrated air defence system, participants seamlessly combined kinetic, cyber, space and electromagnetic spectrum operations.
“The kinetic phase featured first-shoot, first-kill swing-role combat aircraft equipped with long-range beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, extended-range stand-off weapons and precision strike capabilities, supported by airborne early warning and control platforms and air-to-air refuellers,” the statement said.
It added that the key highlight of the exercise was “manned-unmanned teaming”, where drones and loitering munitions were sent to operate in a highly contested, congested and degraded environment, to validate the PAF’s capability to conduct high-tempo operations.
“The successful conduct of exercise ‘Golden Eagle’ reaffirms PAF’s unwavering commitment to maintaining a high state of operational preparedness, leveraging indigenous innovation and effectively countering emerging and future security challenges,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2026-02-10 16:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650161-watch-paf-conducts-exercise-golden-eagle' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: PAF conducts Exercise Golden Eagle</strong></a><br><p>

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting at the Corps Headquarters in Peshawar to review the overall security situation in the province.
According to a handout, the meeting was attended by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, the national security adviser, and Peshawar corps commander, along with senior civil and military officials.
The press release said that at the outset of the meeting, the attendees paid tribute to the civilians and security personnel martyred in terrorist attacks.



The high-level meeting decided that Pakistan Super League (PSL) matches scheduled for this year would be held in Peshawar.
According to the statement, the meeting decided to implement a provincial governance model in Malakand Division under the supervision of the police and other provincial institutions.
It added that the model would then be implemented in “phases in the affected districts, particularly Khyber, Orakzai and Kurram”.
The press release said that to ensure the effective “monitoring of development projects and review of any security operations” in these districts, a special sub-committee would be formed under the leadership of CM Afridi. It was decided that the committee will hold monthly meetings.
The statement added that the special sub-committee would also include elected public representatives, the Peshawar corps commander, the KP chief secretary, the inspector general, provincial officials, and representatives from federal institutions.
The special sub-committee would also be responsible for “creating opportunities for alternative employment, ensuring a steady income for the locals” and arrangements to address the issues of temporarily displaced persons, the statement said.
During the meeting, it was decided that “effective communication between the Centre and the KP govt, complete coordination, and a united stance will be ensured on key policy matters to address issues such as terrorism”.
It was also decided to promote sustainable employment opportunities to prevent the youth from developing extremist ideas. The meeting also decided that strict action against illegal SIM cards, explosive material, and extortion will be taken, the meeting decided.
“Additionally, attention will be paid to the phased profiling of non-custom paid vehicles,” the statement said.
Last week, in an apex committee meeting, “consultation, cooperation and coordination” with the federal government and all political parties were termed “essential” for the success of a comprehensive counter-terrorism policy.
The panel discussed the “general rise in terrorism incidents in KP and an action plan to eradicate the menace of Fitna al Khawarij and establish complete peace and stability”.
According to the Annual Security Report 2025 from the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS), KP recorded a significant surge in violence last year as “fatalities rose from 1,620 in 2024 to 2,331 in 2025”.
Security, economic decisions taken
In a video statement, CM’s aide for public relations Shafi Jan said a briefing on the security situation was provided during the meeting.
He added that certain decisions related to the province’s law and order and the economy were made.







Detailing the security-related decisions, KP Law Minister Aftab Alam said: “It was unanimously decided during the meeting that in Malakand Division, our Pak Army would hand over its responsibilities to law enforcement agencies, CTD (Counter-Terrorism Department) and the police.”
He termed it a “major decision and good news for the entire KP’s people, especially those in Malakand Division”.
Alam further said it was an “achievement” for the KP government, as well as the civilian and military leadership, that “peace was being restored in the province and efforts are being made for it”.
“This is also the restoration of trust in our police,” he highlighted.

 

Another decision made was that a meeting of “all political stakeholders would be summoned, where the civilian and military higher-ups and leadership would take them into confidence, and their recommendations would be implemented”, he said.
The minister also stated that the agreements reached upon in the last provincial apex committee would be “ensured before the federal Apex Committee’s meeting and would be endorsed” in the same.
Jan then emphasised that it was decided to hand over the local “services” to the civil administration as the law and order improved in certain districts.
Elaborating on the economic decisions, Adviser to KP CM on Finance Muzzammil Aslam said the meeting was conducted in an “extremely pleasant environment”.
He stated that the meeting was informed in detail about the financial issues faced by the KP government, as had been communicated by CM Afridi to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in a January letter and a meeting last week.
Aslam lamented that had the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award been announced, it would have solved many issues of KP.

 

“We also told them that due to the reduced money coming from the Centre, the KP government was contributing from its funds for the merged districts, but it was insufficient,” the KP official said, adding that suggestions were made to improve the future situation.
According to Aslam, it was decided during the meeting that those recommendations will be presented before the federal government and aim to get KP “maximum relief”.
The adviser further said that “an assurance was given” on providing alternative arrangements to people whose livelihoods had been impacted as a result of any “operations” and the trade disruption with Afghanistan.
They also discussed “how the Centre and the province would together compensate people there financially</p><small>2026-02-10 14:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/1019362821ce00a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972309/t20-world-cup-india-look-forward-to-pakistan-challenge' target='_blank'><strong>T20 World Cup: India look forward to Pakistan ‘challenge’</strong></a><br><p>India on Tuesday said it would be “a challenge” to face a “quality” Pakistan team in Colombo after Islamabad decided to play the blockbuster T20 World Cup clash.
“It’s great that the game is back on, we kind of never changed the preparation,” said India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate.
India will face a second Group A match against Namibia on Thursday in New Delhi before flying to Sri Lanka.
It means a quick turnaround for Sunday’s match, the biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket.
“It’s going to be a challenge going to Colombo where Pakistan have been for the last two weeks,” added Ten Doeschate.
“We are delighted to have another chance to play against a quality side in the first phase of the tournament.
“We are fully focused on just bringing our best game to that fixture.”
Sri Lanka, who will host the match that generates multi-millions of dollars in advertising, broadcast rights, sponsorship and tourism, also praised the decision.
Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, in a social media post, thanked Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.







Pakistan, who edged out Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, would have conceded two points if they had forfeited the match.
Pakistan will play all their T20 World Cup matches in Sri Lanka as part of an International Cricket Council deal that ensures the two nations only meet on neutral territory.
India captain Suryakumar Yadav said on Friday before their opening win against the USA that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash, whether the game was on or not.
“We haven’t said no to playing them,” Suryakumar said. “Our flights are booked and we are going to Colombo.”</p><small>2026-02-10 14:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/101104067fb512e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972247/pti-lawyer-salman-safdar-meets-imran-at-adiala-jail-says-party-founder-appeared-fine-healthwise' target='_blank'><strong>PTI lawyer Salman Safdar meets Imran at Adiala jail, says party founder appeared fine healthwise</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: PTI lawyer Salman Safdar on Tuesday met ex-premier Imran Khan at Adiala jail, saying that the party founder appeared fine healthwise.
The meeting, which lasted nearly three hours, came after the Supreme Court earlier in the day allowed Safdar to meet Imran.
Speaking to reporters outside the jail, Safdar said that Imran was fine and was looking healthy. However, he did not share further details about the meeting, saying that he had to submit a report to the court.
He said once the report was submitted to the court, he would be able to share the details.
SC allows lawyer to meet Imran
Earlier in the day, the SC had allowed Safdar to meet Imran, declaring him amicus curiae. The development came a day after a request for an ‘urgent’ meeting — submitted by senior PTI leader Latif Khosa — was rejected by a two-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.
The bench observed that such an order could not be passed without hearing the other side. Hence, a notice was then issued to the government for Tuesday.
The two-member bench resumed the hearing, during which CJP Afridi appointed Safdar as “friend of the court”, with the court directing him to visit Adiala jail today and submit a written report regarding Imran’s living conditions by tomorrow.
PTI counsel Latif Khosa and Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan also appeared before the court.
At the outset of the hearing, CJP Afridi barred Khosa from speaking, while AGP Awan said that he had “submitted a written response to the chamber in light of the order of August 24, 2023”.
In 2023, SC had directed the AGP to submit a report on Imran’s “living conditions in jail”.
He informed the court that the PTI founder was in Attock jail at the time of the order.
“We had submitted a written report to the chamber on August 28, 2023,” the AGP said, adding that a medical report from August 5 to August 18 was also included.
In response to this, CJP Afridi said, “After the August 24, 2023 order, there has not been any order on record which was satisfactory to the SC”.
In the court order, available with Dawn, it was noted that the report submitted by the AGP pertained to the period when the former premier was imprisoned in the District jail, Attock, in 2023.
Hence, it maintained that the court “considered appropriate that a report regarding the present ‘living conditions of the petitioner in jail’ be submitted by the Superintendent, Central Prison, Rawalpindi.”
Subsequently, the court appointed Safdar as amicus curiae.
“Salman Safdar should go to Adiala as a friend of the court,” CJP Afridi said.
“We have full faith in Salman Safdar,” he further remarked.
“He should be given full access to the PTI founder so he may be able to file a written response,” he added.
Justice Afridi directed that Safdar should “not be kept waiting outside Adiala”, assuring him that in case he encounters any issues, the CJP’s personal staff will be available.
Safdar, addressing the court, asked “if the scope of the report was limited to living conditions only”, citing concerns regarding Imran’s health in light of a recent medical procedure.
“Submit a report of the living conditions only,” CJP Afridi responded.
AGP Awan also requested the court to “include in the order that a report had already been submitted”.
Towards the end of the hearing, Khosa took the rostrum again, seeking that his request to meet Imran be accepted as well. However, the request was again rejected.
The court then adjourned the hearing till February 12.
Raja terms conversation with court as ‘beneficial’
Speaking to reporters after the hearing, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja recalled his meeting with the chief justice last Friday, adding that Imran’s incarceration and health came under discussion.
He termed the conversation with the court as “beneficial” and stated that progress had been made as a result of it.
However, the PTI leader clarified, “We are not declaring anything as final. We are not saying everything is good [and] we have gotten everything. This is not the case.”
The PTI leader called for the “system to […] return to humanity”. “It is humanity and piousness that we are demanding right now,” he stated.







The former premier has been incarcerated since Aug 5, 2023, currently imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Central Jail.
According to a two-page memorandum filed by PTI last week to the SC registrar, the party had requested immediate jail visitation rights for Imran with his family, doctors, lawyers and friends.
In the memorandum, it was alleged that Imran’s rights as a prisoner and a human being have been consistently violated during this period.
The PTI memorandum also highlighted the reports about “Imran being subjected to some secretive medical procedure at a hospital in Islamabad and keeping his relatives in the dark in violation of jail rules”.</p><small>2026-02-10 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650130-punjab-cm-maryam-announces-rs10bn-assistance-for-security-forces-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM Maryam announces Rs10bn assistance for security forces in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

The changes amend India’s 2021 IT rules, which have already been a flashpoint between Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government and global technology companies.
The amended rules also relaxed an earlier proposal that would have required platforms to visibly label AI-generated content across 10 per cent of its surface area or duration, instead mandating that such content be “prominently labelled”.
The new regulations will take effect from February 20.
The tighter timeline marks the latest escalation in India’s efforts to control online speech, with a takedown regime that has drawn criticism from digital rights advocates and prompted clashes with companies including Elon Musks X.
Facebook-owner Meta declined to comment on the changes, while X and Alphabet’s Google, which operates YouTube, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The rules add to mounting global pressure on social media companies to police content more aggressively, with governments from Brussels to Brasilia demanding faster takedowns and greater accountability.
India’s IT rules empower the government to order the removal of content deemed illegal under various laws, including those related to national security, public order and sexual offenses.
The country has issued thousands of takedown orders in recent years, according to platform transparency reports.</p><small>2026-02-10 14:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/10163605792c236.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972276/hats-off-to-you-maryam-assures-bugti-of-punjabs-full-support-for-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>‘Hats off to you’: Maryam assures Bugti of Punjab’s full support for Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Tuesday paid a visit to Quetta, where she met with her Balochistan counterpart CM Sarfraz Bugti and assured him of her full support.
CM Maryam’s visit comes in the wake of a spate of attacks across Balochistan on January 31, which brought parts of the restive province to a standstill for several days. Security forces had responded by killing a total of 216 terrorists during “Operation Radd-ul-Fitna-1” in the province.
“As the chief minister of Punjab, as a Pakistani and as your sister, all services and resources of Punjab, whatever cooperation or support you need — whether in operations against khawarij here or any kind of challenges in the government — we are with you,” Maryam said.
She further assured Bugti, “Whatever kind of support you need, I am just a call away. I will be very glad if I can assist you or do something for the people of Balochistan.”







Noting that this was her first visit to another province after assuming the office of Punjab CM in February 2024, Maryam said she was glad it was to Quetta.
“You have rightly said that you do not have fitna, but you have Fitna al Khawarij, which is your own unique set of challenges that Balochistan is facing,” she further remarked, referring to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“A lot of courage and firmness is needed for it, which you are demonstrating by governing Balochistan in such situations, so hats off to you, CM sahib,” Maryam said.
The Punjab chief minister said she visited the Frontier Corps (FC) headquarters in the morning, where the “commitment” she saw was very “promising and encouraged” her.
She prayed that may God help “Balochistan move forward and very soon eradicate the menace of terrorism” from the province.
“May Balochistan be a cradle of peace, safety and happiness,” she added.
According to her PML-N, CM Maryam held a meeting with Bugti and Balochistan Governor Sheikh Jaffar Khan Mandokhail. She also attended an event at the FC headquarters.







Punjab gives Rs10bn for Balochistan forces
Separately, CM Bugti also lauded Rs10 billion in “assistance for security forces” from the Punjab government.
A post on X by the CM Office quoted Bugti as welcoming Maryam to Quetta, adding: “The assistance of Rs10bn for security forces is a positive and commendable step.”
Bugti further affirmed, “The Balochistan government and the opposition is united for the people’s welfare.
According to the post, the Punjab chief minister also met with members of the provincial cabinet and leaders of allied parties.
Speaking to reporters after their meeting, CM Bugti lauded the Punjab chief minister’s visit to Quetta, saying her visit was “very respectful for us, especially during a time when we are confronting a situation”.
“And helping our security forces, which required Rs10 billion […] she gave the entire Rs10bn,” he said, lauding CM Maryam’s announcement and terming it a “great justice” to Balochistan.

Naqvi said this while speaking to the media in Peshawar, a day after the government announced it was withdrawing its decision to boycott the group-stage match against India in the T20 World Cup, scheduled for February 15.
The development followed protracted negotiations between the ICC, the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, consultations among national leaders and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.

 

The now-withdrawn decision to boycott the match against arch-rival India was announced by the government on February 1 after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland in the tournament, following their refusal to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.
The matter was raised during Naqvi’s media talk in Peshawar on Tuesday, where he was asked about several conditions that were reportedly put forward during his meeting with the ICC and BCB officials on Sunday.
In his response, Naqvi said: “We did not discuss anything apart from Bangladesh; our only purpose was to get Bangladesh respect, to highlight the injustice done to them.
“And you saw that whatever demands Bangladesh made, they were accepted. That’s it.”
He added, “We had no personal interest in the meeting … our task was purely related to Bangladesh. The government made the decision on that [basis]. When their demands have been accepted, and it has been acknowledged that injustice was done to them, we are playing after that.”
The developments unfolded as the ongoing T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, began on February 7. It was, however, overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland.
Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the ICC rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka.
After mulling its stance, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.

 

In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.
It expressed the hope that the PCB would consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country. Subsequently, it was reported last week that the ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.
Sri Lanka’s cricket board had also asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.
Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.

 

On Sunday, the BCB chief and ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja landed in Lahore and held a long meeting with Naqvi.
A day later, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake also urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India in a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India.
The government then announced the withdrawal of its earlier decision to boycott the match against India while an ICC statement said “that no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on Bangladesh Cricket Board”.
The statement also said that to compensate Dhaka, it was agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2031.</p><small>2026-02-10 12:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/650110-cybercrime-case-non-bailable-arrest-warrant-out-for-kp-cm-again' target='_blank'><strong>Cybercrime case: Non-bailable arrest warrant out for KP CM, again</strong></a><br><p>
