Spot gold rose 0.1 per cent to $4,492.51 per ounce by 3:59am GMT (8:59am PKT), after touching a record high of $4,525.19 earlier in the session. US gold futures for February delivery climbed 0.3pc to a record high of $4,520.60.
Silver gained 1.2pc to $72.27 an ounce, after hitting an all-time peak of $72.70 earlier, while platinum jumped 3.3pc to $2,351.05 after rising to a historic high of $2,377.50.
Palladium climbed almost 2pc to $1,897.11, its highest level in three years.
“Precious metals have become more of a speculative narrative around the idea that, with de-globalisation, you need an asset that can act as a neutral go-between, without sovereign risk particularly as tensions between the US and China persist,” said Ilya Spivak, head of global macro at Tastylive.

 

Thin year-end liquidity exaggerated recent price moves but the broader theme was likely to endure, with gold targeting $5,000 over the next six to twelve months and silver potentially pushing toward $80 as markets respond to key psychological levels, Spivak added.
Gold has surged more than 70pc this year, its biggest annual gain since 1979, driven by safe-haven demand, expectations of US rate cuts, robust central-bank buying, de-dollarisation trends and ETF inflows, with traders pricing in two rate cuts next year.
Silver has jumped more than 150pc over the same period, outpacing gold on strong investment demand, its inclusion on the US critical minerals list and momentum buying.
Gold and silver have “been hitting the accelerator pedal this week” with fresh record highs, reflecting their appeal as stores of value amid expectations of lower US rates and lingering global debt, said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade.
Platinum and palladium, primarily used in automotive catalytic converters to reduce emissions, have surged this year on tight mine supply, tariff uncertainty, and a rotation from gold investment demand, with platinum up about 160pc and palladium gaining more than 100pc year to date.
“What we’re seeing in platinum and palladium is largely catch-up,” Spivak said adding that the thin nature of those markets leave them vulnerable to sharp swings, even as they broadly track gold, once liquidity returns.</p><small>2025-12-24 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641194-former-pti-leaders-seek-parole-for-jailed-party-stalwarts' target='_blank'><strong>Former PTI leaders seek parole for jailed party stalwarts</strong></a><br><p>

Initially, pre-qualified bids were submitted by Lucky Cement, private airline Airblue and investment firm Arif Habib in the morning. Airblue exited the race after the first round of bidding, with a proposition lower than the reference price of Rs100bn.
In the first round, Lucky Cement put up a bid of Rs101.5bn, Airblue Rs26.5bn, and the Arif Habib consortium bid Rs115bn, after which the reference price was announced.
Following that, a 30-minute break was taken so that the two top bidders could hold consultations. A second round was then commenced.
It began with the base bid at Rs115bn, and the minimum increment was at Rs250 million. The base price was set on the basis of the highest bid made during the first round by Arif Habib.
Both bidders engaged in a brief competition to outbid each other during the round. However, when Lucky Cement raised its bid to Rs134bn, Arif Habib countered with Rs135bn, forcing Lucky Cement to bow out and congratulate Arif Habib.



The whole process was telecast live and streamed across all TV channels as well as the respective social media handles of the government.
Adviser to the prime minister on privatisation, Muhammad Ali, will also hold a press conference after the conclusion of the bidding process.
Privatisation will ‘promote’ investment
After winning the bid to acquire the national airline, business owner Arif Habib said the privatisation will “promote” investment in the country.
“PIA is our national institution,” Habib said.
“The national airline has witnessed days of glory and was once ranked number two in the world. All its employees are very competent,” he added.
Habib said he is hopeful of resolving all shortcomings with the new capital investment.
When asked about his expansion plans, he said, “Initially, we plan to expand the fleet to 38 aircraft in the first phase, then to 65, depending on demand.”
The successful bidder assured he would give “confidence to PIA employees” and help in “realising their potential.”
“Employment opportunities will grow as we expand,” Habib said. “The existing experienced employees will also get opportunities.”
“When all necessary capital investment is made, they will perform well.”
Later, speaking on Geo News programme ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada ke Saath’, the business tycoon said that he was willing to bring in foreign airlines once the transaction was completed.
Asked if he was willing to bring in additional investors, including foreign airlines, Habib expressed hope that they would come on board.
“Now that we’re the highest bidder and once the cabinet approves the deal, we will have about 90 days to negotiate with them and possibly bring them into the airline,” he replied.
Habib added that his company would approach airlines, adding that once the consortium acquires PIA, it will demonstrate that it is able to put more capital into the flag carrier.
He also noted that the consortium‘s bid was Rs4bn higher than their adviser’s valuation.
“I think our adviser’s valuation was Rs131bn, so when the bidding happened, we ended up paying an entry premium,” he said, adding that this provision is needed when buying an active business.
“Considering the Lucky Group is strong and has deep pockets, that was something we took into consideration. We were expecting that this transaction would be achieved at around Rs130bn,” the tycoon elaborated.
Habib said it was a “big comfort” because when bids increase, there is more funding available for development and turnaround.
“This was a big factor behind the valuation,” he said.
Habib stated that he wanted to purchase a 100pc stake in PIA, but the transition commission produced a “very good structure” and limited the bids to 75pc of the flag carrier.
“They gave us the option of a balance of 25pc, which we can exercise in 90 days,” he said.
“The payment can be made within a year with a 12pc per annum premium. We need to assess the company’s value and make a decision within three months. If we avail the option, we will have to make the payment at a 12pc premium.”
’A very good start“
Khaqan Najeeb, a seasoned economist and policy expert, hailed the privatisation as a “sought-after” micro-economic reform that “must take place”.
Talking to Geo News, Najeed said, “It is a very good start that after 19-20 years, we have successfully privatised a major institution.”
“We have achieved this milestone on the third attempt. We must always remember that, despite parking Rs650 billion – not a small amount – in a holding company, it couldn’t be achieved,” he said.
“After removing a liability of Rs33 billion from the balance sheet of PIA and adding various other incentives in the form of tax or other concessions, only then have we made this happen,” Najeeb said.
The economist termed the development a “good outcome” and “positive” for the national airline.
“However, we achieved this by offering tax favours, deferred credits, and creating positive equities,” he said.
“We must notice that, as a good sweetener, it was necessary to reinvest 92.5% of the sold 75% in PIA, while only giving 7.5% to the state to run the company, because it is in need of significant funds to manage its affairs.”
“The company needs money to grow despite having multiple landing rights and air services agreements.”
He highlighted that the national airline has 18 planes in its fleet and carries four million passengers, but “it will not be enough to achieve economies of scale.”
“We have to reconsider how we have supported our SOEs, giving repeated sweeteners and unnecessary concessions, while selling a national airline that holds dozens of landing rights.”
Najeeb said that if anyone runs this company with “financial muscle,” a hidden value could be rediscovered. “I hope that when we finalise this deal, we will design a proper business and investment plan to expand the current fleet from 18 to 50 aeroplanes, reach further destinations, and carry more passengers,” he said.
“It’s a long way to go.”
Labelling the development as “positive,” he added, “There was a time when we were losing Rs50 to Rs100 billion. We can now avoid such losses – a good way to save taxpayers’ money.”
“However,” he reminded, “we have to keep in mind that for the Rs650 billion parked in the holding company, we have to pay around Rs30 billion every year from taxpayers’ money, according to estimates.”
He remarked that an “overhang” exists in Pakistan’s aviation policy, which has to be “fixed.”
The economist further stated the three important aspects of a good economy. “The first is a good regulatory environment, the second is a smooth policy-making process, and the last is the efficiency of operations,” he explained. “That’s how the economy works.”
‘Historic day for Pakistan’
In a post on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed the sale as “a historic day for Pakistan” and congratulated Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, among others.
“It was our firm commitment to the people of Pakistan that speedy and concrete steps would be taken to privatise loss-making state-owned enterprises that have been a burden on the economy,” the PM wrote.
“The successful completion of the transparent and highly competitive bidding process for the privatisation of PIA marks an important milestone in fulfilling that commitment.”







The PM added that he has always maintained that regardless of which consortium won the auction, “Pakistan would be the ultimate winner and today’s outcome fully vindicates that belief”.
“The strong participation of our leading business groups and some of Pakistan’s most seasoned and respected investors is a powerful vote of confidence in our economy and its future,” PM Shehbaz wrote.
“This is work in progress and we will continue our hard work with even greater vigour and perseverance in the days ahead to build a brighter future for our nation.”
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also offered his congratulations on the successful privatisation of PIA.
“Pakistan has won today,” he exclaimed.
“By the grace of God, the process has been conducted with transparency,” Naqvi said.
He also extended felicitations to Advisor on Privatisation Mohammad Ali and his team, the prime minister, and especially to those who “secured PIA”.
“We are all looking forward to travelling through PIA again,” he added.







The Ministry of Privatisation also congratulated the consortium for winning the auction.
Aurangzeb hopes PIA sale will bring investment
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, speaking at the bidding ceremony, thanked the PM‘s aide and his team for their efforts and hailed the bidding process in terms of transparency.
“It takes a lot of time and effort to get to a good place where we are today,“ he said.
“All of the bidders today are from Pakistan. I used to say that no matter which team wins, Pakistan would win.”
He lauded Pakistan‘s biggest conglomerates for “vying for the best airline” and said that the flag carrier would be led by investors and some of Pakistan’s most experienced businesspeople.
“The fact that they have stepped up is a doubtless sign that anyone who is the successful bidder will take it not only to where we were, but where we need to be in the comity of nations,” Aurangzeb added.
“We need to stop the bleeding and losses, but more importantly, our institutions need to be part of the comity of nations, and we will take them there,” he added.
Aurangzeb also expressed hope that the bidding would increase the number of local investors and, in turn, the number of foreign investors entering the country.
“The government, through the privatisation of business entities under state custody, will not only save itself from losses in the thousands of billions but also accelerate the process of economic recovery,” he wrote, congratulating the privatisation commission.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif took to X to celebrate the sale, calling it a “growing vote of confidence in the national economy”.
Asif added that Europe and the UK lifting bans on PIA‘s operations was a major contributor to the success of today’s deal.
“From a bid of Rs10bn in the past to a price of Rs135bn today, it is proof of trust in our Civil Aviation Regulator.”
He also assailed the PTI government for leaving “no stone unturned to destroy PIA”, adding that it took three years to rebuild the flag carrier.







At the outset of the ceremony, the adviser to the prime minister on privatisation addressed the audience.
Ali hoped that PIA’s privatisation would open “paths for investment in the country”.
“I would also like to thank all bidders who are present today, and those who were part of the bidding process but did not reach the final round. We wouldn‘t have been here without them, and this process wouldn’t have been completed,” he said.
“We actively engaged with all the bidders. Two of them demanded to take up to 75 per cent at least, and the other two demanded 100pc,“ he said.
“We wanted a multitude of bidders so the process of bidding would be transparent and competitive,” he continued.
He said that the government had “decided to sell at least 75pc of shares, and simultaneously, we also decided to offer the other 25pc”.
“Bidders will have the right to consider and let the government know if they also want to buy the other 25pc in the next 90 days,” he said.
He further said, “The transaction would be from 75pc up to 100pc; however, 75pc of them will be made available for sale today”.
“The government wanted to structure this transaction so it would also get a fair share and investment to be made,” he said, adding that the government did not just want to sell PIA but “to bring the national airline back to the glory it enjoyed in the past”.
He stressed the need for bringing in “new investment, buy new carriers and repair the engine, cut the liabilities, pay the employees on time”.
“If we want to expand the fleet from 18 planes to 30-40 or more, then investment is the only way,” he added.
Pre-qualified bids
In the morning, representatives of the bidding groups had walked in one by one to deposit sealed offers into a transparent box, briefly fumbling as they pushed envelopes through the slot in a separate public ceremony in Islamabad that was also broadcast on state television.
Following that, the reference price for PIACL’s bidding was approved by the Privatisation Commission Board and the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation after bids were received.







Meanwhile, speaking to the media, Ali said, “God willing, we will get a good bid, there will be good investment, and we will succeed.“
The auction was Pakistan’s second attempt at selling the once storied flag carrier after televised bidding last year collapsed when a solitary offer fell far below the government‘s reference price, derailing what would have been the country’s first major privatisation in nearly two decades.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, thanked government officials and the Privatisation Commission for their role in the national carrier’s privatisation.
He stressed that the process has been made “transparent“, stating that it will be the “largest transaction” ever in Pakistan’s history.
“Today, as the bidding starts [..] the bids will come in sealed envelopes, there will be transparent boxes, there will be a live telecast. When the price is determined, the envelopes will be opened. They will compete, and whoever has the highest bid will [succeed],“ he said.
“Only God knows how high the bid will go, but the process must come back to the cabinet,” he said.
Unsuccessful bidders to be excluded from PIA management
Earlier, Ali said the two unsuccessful bidders will be excluded from any future role in the airline’s management thanks to a unique stipulation.
In recent remarks, he explained that losing bidders will have no right to join the winning bidder, and only those groups who were not party to the auction would be able to join the new management.
This means that while only one of the three consortiums currently in the running for the flag carrier will become part of its administration upon acquisition of a majority stake, Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd retains the option to join with them subsequently, if it wishes to.
The company was previously in the race for PIA but then decided to quit the bidding process.
Ahead of Tuesday’s bidding, reports surfaced of a behind-the-scenes deal involving at least two of the parties involved — the Arif Habib and Lucky Cement groups — that reportedly fell through.
In a tweet, journalist Kamran Khan alluded to a meeting where it was proposed to split the controlling stake among three of the four interested parties. However, Khan claimed, this arrangement fell through as one of the parties — i.e. the Muhammad Ali Tabba-led Lucky Cement group — did not agree to it.







Both Tabba and a high-ranking government official privy to developments confirmed this, but clarified that this was not a government-brokered mee­ting, but rather an informal interaction.
Talking to Dawn, Tabba expressed unwavering confidence in the privatisation process, and clarified that the proposal was floated to him after a meeting in Islamabad, which he did not pursue.

A special meeting of the cabinet, presided over by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, also approved amendments to the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) Ordinance 2002, aimed at aligning public tendering and procurement procedures with contemporary requirements.
The cabinet approved the repeal of the National University for Security Sciences Islamabad Bill 2025 and constituted a committee to ensure effective consultation on private members’ bills and other legislation in the National Assembly.
Furthermore, it granted approval to the National Cannabis Control and Regulatory Policy 2025, which aims to promote the use of plant-based resources in the pharmaceutical and textile sectors under a regulated framework.

Approves visa clearance system to facilitate foreign travel

On the recommendation of the Ministry of Interior, the cabinet approved a visa clearance system designed to facilitate Pakistani citizens travelling abroad by providing a transparent and secure mechanism for visa acquisition.
The cabinet also ratified the decisions taken by the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases at its meetings held on Oct 20, Nov 5 and Nov 21 this year, as well as the decisions taken by the Economic Coordination Committee at its meeting on Dec 18.
In his concluding remarks, PM Shehbaz reaffirmed that the national interest would remain the guiding principle of the government’s decisions, particularly in matters concerning economic reform, political stability and public confidence.
The prime minister also congratulated the nation on Pakistan’s victory in the Under-19 cricket championship, calling it a moment of pride for the entire country.
He further referred to the recent conferment of the King Abdulaziz Award on Field Marshal Asim Munir in Saudi Arabia, saying the honour belonged not to an individual but to the entire nation and reflected Pakistan’s collective dignity.

KARACHI: Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar said on Tuesday that five major extortion networks operating from abroad were active in Karachi and that efforts were underway to have their ringleaders extradited and arrested.
Speaking at a press conference at the Central Police Office, the home minister identified the ringleaders of the five networks as Wasiullah Lakho, Jameel Changa, Bahadur PMT, Gul Sher Jagirani and Azeem.
Accompanied by Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon and Karachi police chief Javed Alam Odho, the minister said the Sindh government had approached the federal government for extradition of the ringleaders of the five gangs.
Speaking on the occasion, IGP Memon said that gangster Lakho topped the list of those involved in extortion rackets.
He disclosed that the government had sent a request to Interpol for issuance of ‘red notice’ against Lakho.
He added that necessary documents regarding two other gangsters —Ahmed Ali Magsi and Samad Kathiawari — had been sent to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), which already forwarded the relevant letters for issuance of red notices against them.
The IGP clarified that the preparation and verification of documents to meet international legal requirements took some time.
Talking about police action against extortion rackets, the minister said law enforcers had recently conducted several operations against these gangs, arrested 37 members and killed one of them in encounters.
In a veiled reference to a raid on the house of Sunni Tehreek’s chief, he said recently an action was also conducted at an “important residence” in the metropolis and eight suspected extortionists were arrested with weapons.
To a question, the home minister, without naming the head of the religious party, said legal action would be taken against him for providing “shelter to criminals”.
He said these arrests were made within seven days after the Association of Builders and Developers raised concerns over incidents of extortion at a press conference and during a meeting with the chief minister.
He said a WhatsApp group had been created where the builders and traders could directly lodge their complaints to senior police officers.
Surrender or face consequences, dacoits warned
Talking about a recent joint police-Rangers operation in riverine area to recover over one dozen Quetta-bound passengers abducted in Ghotki district, he said that four hardened bandits were killed and ‘military-grade’ weapons were recovered from them.
He said these joint operations by Sindh and Punjab police and the paramilitary force were conducted in “hard-to-access riverine areas”.
The minister declared that they had adopted a policy of “surrender or face the consequences” for riverine bandits.
To a question, the home minister said that at least 11 arms dealers who provided sophisticated weapons to riverine area gangs had been identified and the Sindh government had asked the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to take action against them.
He hoped that after action against such dealers, flow of arms to the riverine areas would be reduced, which would lead to further improvement in law and order there.
To a question, the home minister said IGP Memon is going to retire on Dec 30. However, he evaded questions as to whether Sindh and federal governments finalised a name to be appointed as the new police chief.

Police said unknown miscreants had planted an improvised explosive device (IED) on the main railway track near the Notal area of Nasirabad district. The device detonated before the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express, coming from Peshawar, reached the site. The explosion damaged a portion of the track, forcing the suspension of train services.
“About four feet of the railway track was blown up in the powerful blast,” a senior police officer told Dawn, adding that another IED, weighing around 10 kilogrammes, was found planted at a similar distance from the first blast and was defused by the concerned authorities.
Railway officials stopped the Jaffar Express at Dera Murad Jamali and suspended train services between Quetta and other provinces until repairs to the track are completed.

Jaffar Express narrowly escapes another attack

Following the blast, a heavy contingent of police, the bomb disposal squad, and security forces rushed to the site, cordoned off the area, and launched a search operation to arrest those involved.
Police said that over the past two months, around a dozen attempts had been made by miscreants to target the Jaffar Express.
In a separate incident, a landmine blast in Dera Bugti district killed three goats and injured five others. Police said the explosion occurred in the Lanjo Saghari area, where unknown individuals had planted an underground landmine for sabotage purposes. Further investigation is underway.

It trusts people to think, argue, dissent, and decide. It believes political legitimacy comes from consent, not coercion, and that progress is best made through persuasion rather than force. Bertrand Russell’s Liberal Decalogue remains a powerful moral compass for this worldview — one rooted in doubt, critical thinking, respect for dissent, and the refusal to sanctify authority.
But what happens when a crisis demands speed, certainty, and unilateral execution — qualities that liberal democracies, by design, resist? As the climate crisis accelerates and the world edges beyond the 1.5°C threshold, this tension has moved from philosophical debate to an existential question. Can liberal democracies with their slow churn of deliberation, electoral cycles, and competing interests take the drastic actions needed to avoid catastrophic warming? Or will authoritarian regimes, for all their moral costs, prove more capable of implementing harsh but necessary measures? The critical question is whether democracy can survive the climate emergency and is liberalism ill-suited for an age of hard choices.

 

The answer lies in an uncomfortable but essential examination of liberalism’s strengths and weaknesses when confronted with planetary emergency.
Liberalism was built in an age when the greatest threats came from the overreach of power — kings, tyrants, majorities, churches. Its commandments were forged to protect the individual from being crushed by political authority. Russell captured this ethos perfectly: do not be certain, do not suppress opinions, overcome opposition through argument not power.
These principles create the deliberative ecosystem that democracies prize. But they also slow everything down. In stable times, caution is a virtue. In a rapidly heating world where emissions must halve within a decade, it becomes a barrier.

Climate change demands immediate sacrifice, while the benefits are distant and diffused.

Climate action in democracies is fragmented by electoral short-termism, interest-group capture, misinformation and judicial/bureaucratic constraints.

 

Democracies encourage exactly what Russell cherished: dissent, debate, hesitation, the weighing of competing evidence. But the climate system does not pause for public consultations. Ice sheets do not wait for consensus. Authoritarian regimes, can, in theory, bypass these obstacles. They do not face elections. They can plan long-term. They can suppress opposition. They can silence climate denial. They can impose strict consumption limits or transform energy systems through top-down control.
In the climate context, authoritarian systems have the structural advantage of speed (no legislative bottlenecks), coherence (long-term planning without electoral turnover), enforcement (policies can be made and rules imposed swiftly), and insulation from populism (leaders not beholden to voter backlash).
If the goal is rapid decarbonisation within a decade, authoritarian efficiency appears seductive. Yet this narrative has limits and fatal flaws.
Authoritarian regimes can act quickly but only if they choose to. They can also choose denial, secrecy, and grand projects that worsen vulnerability. Climate policy requires transparency, science, data sharing, and accountability — traits authoritarian systems routinely suffocate. Their weaknesses include suppression of truth, corruption, lack of public trust, curtailed civil liberties and policy fragility.
In short, authoritarianism can deliver fast results, but it can also deliver fast disasters.
Democracies are messy, but they have proven capable of extraordinary structural transformations when public urgency aligns with political will. The United States mobilised for World War II at unprecedented speed. Social democracies in Scandinavia decarbonised their power sectors with public consent. The EU’s Green Deal — though slow — is one of the world’s most comprehensive climate frameworks.
The problem is not democracy itself — it is democratic complacency. Liberalism depends on inf­or­med citizens and courageous leadership. Climate change, however, demands immediate sacrifice, while the benefits are distant and diffused.
Here, Russell’s commandments reveal a deeper tension: climate action requires certainty, authority, and limits — exactly the impulses liberalism warns against.
Yet democracy’s strengths are uniquely suited to the long-term, generational character of climate transitions through policy buy-in, free media and transparency.
Democracy struggles with urgency, but it excels at endurance.
The climate crisis is accelerating faster than democratic systems are adapting. This has prompted some scholars to speculate about “eco-authoritarianism”— the idea that survival may require centralised, coercive power.
But this path is dangerous. A climate emergency managed by unchecked authority risks creating a green dystopia: surveillance justified by carbon accounting, disenfranchisement masked as ecological necessity, and forced relocations with silenced dissent.
The real challenge is not to abandon democracy, but to reconstruct it for an age of planetary limits. Democracy must evolve from a politics of infinite choice to a politics of survival-driven realism.
Russell’s Liberal Decalogue champions humility, dissent, truth, and freedom — virtues essential for a just society. But liberalism was not designed for an age when inaction carries existential risk. The climate emergency is forcing democracies to confront a paradox: to preserve freedom, they must restrict it; to protect individual rights, they must impose collective limits.
Authoritarianism may appear more capable of making painful decisions swiftly, but its opacity, repression, and fragility make it dangerous and unreliable as a planetary steward.
The answer is neither to romanticise authoritarian efficiency nor to cling defensively to liberal inertia. It is to build a more decisive, resilient, and future-oriented democracy — one that retains its moral core while shedding its procedural complacency.
In the end, the climate crisis will test not just our technologies or economies, but our political imagination. Only a democracy that learns to act as if the future matters will survive it.

IN nuclear-powered Pakistan nearly 40-50 per cent of the country’s 240 million people live below or around the poverty line, fighting for daily survival. But millions more are extremely vulnerable. As John Wall said, “The incomes of a very large portion of the population are just above and below the official poverty line. This clustering around the poverty line also implies that families are quite vulnerable to falling into poverty with the slightest run of bad luck. A drought or bad agricultural year, an illness of a breadwinner, rises in prices of basic commodities — all these can cause families to fall into poverty.”
In Pakistan, poverty is often discussed in numbers, percentages, GDP ratios, and economic growth rates. Policymakers debate fiscal reforms, economists analyse inflation trends, and politicians promise relief packages. Yet, what remains largely ignored is the psychology of poverty — the effect chronic deprivation has on the human mind, behaviour and social fabric. Poverty is not only an economic condition but also a psychological experience, one that influences how millions of poor in Pakistan think, feel, and act every day.

 

Behind statistics lie complex emotional realities: uncertainty, humiliation, despondency and a persistent sense of powerlessness. Poverty is not merely about lack of money; it is about lack of dignity and agency. It distorts one’s sense of self, narrows cognitive functions, and traps individuals in cycles of stress and short-term survival. Inflation, unemployment, and debt create an unbearable cognitive load for the poor largely ignored by policymakers and health professionals alike.
One of the most damaging psychological aspects of poverty is chronic uncertainty. A poor family in rural Sindh or an informal daily wage labourer in Karachi lives on the edge perpetually, asking: ‘can I earn enough to feed my family today’? This constant state of worry leads to prolonged physiological arousal that impairs memory, attention, and emotional regulation.

Poverty is not only an economic condition but also a psychological experience.

Children raised in such environments often exhibit heightened anxiety and difficulty concentrating in school. Adults experience exhaustion, irritability, and depression. Over time, the brain becomes wired for survival rather than growth. When survival is the priority, planning for the future becomes a luxury. This explains why many development programmes fail: they expect long-term rational decision-making from individuals whose daily lives allow no psychological space for it.

 

Poverty is hugely stigmatising as the poor are blamed as being lazy, uneducated, or irresponsible. While the rich can argue that they acquired their wealth through merit, ignoring advantages such as education, inheritance and class that may have helped to secure it, the poor begin to blame themselves for their failures, even when they can do little to change their circumstances.
This ‘internalised stigma’ is not only unfair but psychologically damaging, as the poor see themselves as inferior or undeserving. They remain invisible and excluded from any decision-making. They are subjected to daily indignities of humiliation, lack of justice, exposure to pollution and violence that take a cumulative psychological toll.
For Pakistan’s young population — over 60pc under the age of 30 — poverty carries a huge psychological burden. In a society that celebrates success and wealth, poor youth face intense pressure and shame. They are told to “work hard,” yet find few opportunities. This gap between aspiration and reality leads to frustration, anxiety, and turns many youth towards anti-social activities. No wonder every young person wants to leave the country.
At the same time, many poor see the immense wealth displayed by other Pakistanis. The number of luxury cars on our roads, the huge palatial houses, the manicured lawns of the gated communities and golf courses and the unfettered spending in our weddings are there for all to see. The poor cannot even dream of this, creating a ‘cognitive dissonance’ within them leading to psychological reactions including anger, frustration, depression and despondency.
Pakistan already faces a mental health crisis, with one in four people estimated to suffer from depression or anxiety, a figure significantly higher among low-income populations. Yet, mental health remains a neglected issue in public policy.
For the poor, access to mental healthcare is nearly impossible. The cost, stigma, lack of awareness and accessibility to the few services make psychological care a privilege of the wealthy. Consequently, emotional suffering is often expressed through physical symptoms — fatigue, headaches, or chronic pain — and misdiagnosed and treated inadequately. This neglect perpetuates the false notion that the poor are ‘resilient’ or ‘used to suffering.’ In reality, they have no choice but to silently endure the psychological distress.

 

Tackling the psychology of poverty requires going beyond mere welfare programmes. Economic reforms alone cannot heal the emotional wounds of chronic deprivation. Pakistan needs policies that restore dignity, agency, and hope. Social protection must be designed not just to provide cash but to build confidence, for example through microcredit programmes that trust women as decision-makers, or job initiatives that give youth a sense of purpose.
Importantly, the political discourse must shift away from portraying the poor as passive recipients of charity. They are active agents surviving against immense odds. Recognising their resilience, rather than pitying their condition, is the first step toward social healing.
Poverty in Pakistan is not only a failure of economics; it is a crisis of the mind. It erodes hope, corrodes trust, and diminishes the belief in collective progress. For millions of Pakistanis, poverty means living with daily psychological strain that no relief package can quantify.
If Pakistan truly seeks inclusive development, it must place mental well-being at the heart of its poverty alleviation agenda. The fight against poverty is not only about raising incomes; it is about restoring dignity, rebuilding confidence, and healing minds.
To end poverty, we must first understand — and care for — the psychology of the poor.

Justice Raheel Kamran issued the ruling while dismissing a petition filed by a government official seeking to overturn his removal from service for workplace harassment, a penalty imposed by the Punjab Ombudsperson and later upheld after the rejection of his representation by the governor.
The petitioner, Umer Shehzad, a district manager, was accused by his female subordinate, an ad hoc teacher, of persistent harassment.
According to the complaint, Sheh­zad allegedly used his supervisory position to cast indecent glances, send inappropriate WhatsApp messages and demand an illicit relationship in exchange for professional favours.
According to the complaint, Sheh­zad forcibly entered her residence, attempted to rape her and fled only after she called the police service Rescue 15.

Judge dismisses petition filed by govt official seeking to set aside his removal from service

Following an inquiry, the Punjab Ombudsperson found Shehzad guilty of “abuse of authority” and harassment under the 2010 Act and imposed the major penalty of removal from service. The decision was later affirmed by the governor.
Before the LHC, the petitioner argued that the incident took place at a private residence and therefore did not fall within the legal definition of a “workplace”.
However, Justice Kamran rejec­ted this narrow interpretation, holding that under Section 2(n) of the Act, a “workplace” includes any situation linked to official work or activity outside the office.
The judge observed that when a supervisor uses the leverage of emp­loyment — such as threats to terminate an appointment — to exert pressure on a subordinate, the statutory “nexus” is firmly established regardless of the physical location.
“The statutory emphasis, therefore, is not on geography alone, but on the nexus between the conduct complained of and the employment relationship, particularly where sup­ervisory authority is alleged to have been misused,” the judge noted.
Justice Kamran also addressed the petitioner’s objection to the use of unverified WhatsApp messages, noting that the petitioner had indirectly admitted to the communication in his initial defence and failed to challenge their forensics during the inquiry.
Furthermore, the judge clarified that proceedings before the ombudsperson are administrative and disciplinary, not criminal.
The judge noted that the ombudsperson is not bound by the rigid technicalities of the Code of Civil Procedure or the Qanun-i-Shahadat.
The judge also dismissed another argument of the petitioner that a pending criminal case on the same facts barred the ombudsperson’s jurisdiction.
Justice Kamran ruled that the principle of “double jeopardy” does not apply here because criminal trials and disciplinary inquiries engage distinct legal regimes — one for criminal culpability and the other for workplace dignity.
The judge concluded that the guilt of the petitioner reached by the ombudsperson, affirmed by the governor, appears to be not only in consonance with law but also a reasonable and logical inference that could be drawn from the material available on the record.
The judge ruled that the findings recorded by both the forums are neither perverse nor unsupported by the record, nor do they suffer from any jurisdictional defect or legal infirmity so as to warrant interference by the court.

On Monday, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman suggested fresh elections as a way to turn a new leaf and break the political deadlock. In the maulana’s estimation, an electoral reset would help the nation move on from this era, which has seen two governments born of what he described as ‘rigged’ elections.

 

“Neither the 2018 elections nor the 2024 polls reflected the will of the people,” the maulana said. “The governments born out of establishment-backed rigging should come to an end. From Sindh to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, these governments should be brought to an end, and fresh elections must be held across the country.”
His is not an unfair assessment, even if his own political history is not untouched by the compromises he now decries; nor is the demand novel or unreasonable.
But it is well-timed. With opposition parties calling for a new charter of democracy, and the government signalling openness for dialogue, the maulana has highlighted the root of their dispute. In the maulana’s view, both the present dispensation and those who ruled in the previous setup must accept that the electoral process that brought them to power was an unfair one.
So much has been documented regarding this matter since 2018 that it is unreasonable for either party not to concede this much. Yet both continue to act as if they have not, at different moments, benefited from the corruption of the electoral process. The PTI still refuses to accept that its ‘victory’ in 2018 was a tainted one, even after finding itself at the wrong end of the same tactics used to engineer electoral outcomes in 2024. Unless it accepts this, it cannot credibly demand reform or claim the moral high ground it now seeks.

 

Likewise, the PML-N and PPP, despite appearing to be aware of the realities of the 2024 general election, never stopped and reconsidered whether accepting such a ‘victory’ would delegitimise their politics in the eyes of the people. They have lost much in this Faustian bargain, and it is understandable why they, too, need a reset. Which is why the conditions seem to be conducive for a new charter.
If both sides concede that the other was wronged, agree to stop victimising opponents, reverse their poor decisions, and agree on a modus vivendi that involves civilised opposition even if it is unyielding in its principles, there is a good chance that they will make decent headway. Their fight has been long, and it has hurt the nation. Much may still be redeemed if they choose to end it in a civil manner.

Defence Minister Israel Katz, speaking at a settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said the military would never leave all of Gaza and planned to station a type of unit — Nahal — that has historically played a role in establishing Israeli communities, including settlements.
Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem said that Katz’s announcement was “a clear violation of the ceasefire agreement” and “completely goes against” Trump’s peace plan.
After Israeli media reported the comment as a plan to resettle Gaza, where Israel dismantled settlements in 2005, Katz issued a statement saying “the government has no intention of establishing settlements in the Gaza Strip”.

US-backed peace plan bars Tel Aviv from establishing settlements and calls for it to pull out completely

Katz tried to further clarify his remarks, saying “the reference to the integration of Nahal … in the northern Gaza Strip was made in a security context only”.
The Israeli defence minister, in his comments at the Beit El settlement, said: “We are located deep inside Gaza and we will never leave all of Gaza. There will never be such a thing. We are there to protect, to prevent what happened. We don’t trust anybody else to protect our citizens.”
According to the US-backed peace plan signed by both Israel and Hamas in October, the Israeli military will gradually withdraw completely from the coastal enclave and Israel will not re-establish civilian settlements there.
The plan nevertheless provides for an Israeli “security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat”.
Netanyahu, Trump to meet next week
The comments point to complications facing Trump’s Gaza plan, ahead of his meeting with Netanyahu at the White House next week.
The US president’s plan secured a ceasefire in October and the release of the remaining living Israeli prisoners seized in the Oct 7, 2023, raids.
But there has been little sign of progress towards the other goals. Hamas has so far refused to disarm, as required by the plan, which also foresees the establishment of a transitional authority and the deployment of a multinational force.
Israeli settlement building in the occupied West Bank — part of the territory where Palestinians aim to establish a state — has accelerated under Netanyahu. Israel is gearing up for elections next year and settlers make up part of Katz and Netanyahu’s Likud party voter base.

Amanullah Khan and Malik Abdul Khaliq Lala Ghabizai, the tribal elders, addressing a press conference on Tuesday, said that trade had been suspended for the past two months, bringing all business activities in the border region to a standstill.
“Pakistanis stranded in Afghanistan are not allo­wed by the authorities concerned to return to Pak­istan,” Malik Ghabizai said, adding that such a situation was causing hum­a­nitarian concerns. He dem­anded that those str­anded on the other side of the border be allowed to return home without any delay.
The tribal elders said thousands of people who travelled on valid passports and visas had been stranded in Afghanistan for several weeks, adding that many travellers’ legal documents had also expired, compounding their difficulties.
Similarly, thousands of trucks carrying household belongings of migrants are stuck at the border. The drivers and cleaners are facing severe shortages of food and have been left without any source of livelihood, leaving their families back home in dire conditions.
The jirga leaders also alleged that people are subjected to humiliation and extortion at 22 checkpoints between Chaman and Quetta, terming the practice highly condemnable. They urged the authorities to allow residents of Chaman to travel freely to their area and remove the checkpoints. The elders also announced that a three-day Pashtun National Jirga would be convened to highlight issues faced by residents of Chaman and other districts.

ISLAMABAD: A local court on Tuesday extended the interim bail of PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in the May 9 cases and five other matters, while directing the former prime minister to appear at the next hearing either in person or through video link.
Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the pre-arrest bail applications. Advocate Shamsa Kayani appeared on behalf of the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi. However, arguments on the bail pleas could not be advanced due to the unavailability of the ex-PM.
Consequently, the court extended the interim bail and adjourned the hearing till Jan 27, directing that the PTI founder’s appearance be ensured on the next date.
Apart from the May 9 cases, other cases, including attempt to murder and submission of alleged fake receipts, have been registered against the former prime minister. A separate case pertaining to the alleged submission of fake receipts related to Toshakhana gifts has also been lodged against Bushra Bibi.
Meanwhile, Additional District and Sessions Judge Chaudhry Amir Zia also extended Bushra Bibi’s interim bail on her pre-arrest bail application and adjourned the matter till Jan 27. A case was registered against her at the Ramna police station under the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act and other relevant provisions.
Meeting denied again
Separately, PTI lawyer Khalid Yousaf Chaudhry was once again not allowed to meet Imran Khan to obtain his signature on the power of attorney papers for filing an appeal against his recent conviction in the Toshakhana case.
The PTI condemned what it termed “deliberate obstructions” to the party founder’s right to appeal in the Toshakhana-II case, alleging that prison authorities were preventing Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi from meeting their counsel at Adiala jail to sign the power of attorney. In a statement, the party said that making the PTI founder’s counsel wait for hours, closing the legal desk and denying facilitation for execution of the power of attorney amounted to a “planned attempt to obstruct access to justice”.
The PTI maintained that under Rules 178 and 179 of the Punjab Prison Rules, 1978, every prisoner has the legal right to meet his/her lawyer, sign legal documents and file an appeal, adding that prison authorities were not empowered to create hurdles in this regard.
The party further alleged that the denial of the right to appeal violated Articles 10-A, 4, 9, and 25 of the Constitution, and demanded immediate and unhindered access of the ex-PM to his counsel to enable him to pursue his legal remedies.

ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday approved the process for the auction of 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum within two months, followed by the rollout of 5G internet in five to six months, on the recommendation of a US-based consultancy firm.
The decision was made at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, which also approved a Rs20bn (more than $7m) bailout package for Pakistan International Airlines Investment Limited (PIA-IL) to discharge $4m tax liability against Roosevelt Hotel, New York, and other domestic loan liabilities.
Speaking at a no-questions-asked recorded statement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khwaja said the new spectrum auction, to be completed by early February, would be ten times larger than the 60MHz auctioned over all past auctions put together because internet congestion was a major constraint to the nation’s digitisation transformation.
The finance minister said recommendations for the spectrum auction were prepared by National Economic Research Associates (NERA), based on experiences in recent spectrum auctions in other countries, including process, pricing mechanism, auction and implementation strategies. He said the success of digitisation, digital inclusion and financial inclusion was linked to faster, cheaper and better processes, and unsold spectrum was directly translating into economic losses.
IT Minister Shaza Fatima said that under the ECC decision, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) would complete all spectrum auctions by the end of January or early February because Pakistan was behind regional competitors due to the unavailability of spectrum capacity.

 

She said Pakistan’s 245m population had access to only 274MHz spectrum compared to 600MHz available to the 175m people of Bangladesh. That was the major reason for internet traffic congestion in Pakistan, she said, adding, “This means we are using two lanes for traffic which requires eight lanes…your internet does not work and you face challenges.”
She said the upcoming auction would not only improve 3G and 4G services but also enable the launch of 5G, and more international operators would enter the country. The operators would be obligated, under the terms of the auction, to roll out all spectrums within four to six months, so that service improvements become visible to the people in five to six months and to be followed by 5G rollout in six months.
Ms Khwaja said the internet was a basic ingredient to the government’s digitisation efforts, for which the Digital Nation Pakistan Act 2025 had already been put in place. According to Connect 2030, to be inaugurated by the prime minister soon, the government would ensure that over the next five years, the minimum connectivity available to users should be 100 Mbps.
Under the decision, Pakistan would now be offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands, including 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz and new bands 2600MHz and 3500MHz. The 2600 and 3500MHz band are considered conducive to 5G.
PIA bailout
The ECC also approved about Rs20bn (about $7m) bailout to PIA-IL against $17.5m demanded by the Defence Division to meet tax liabilities of Roosevelt Hotel due on January 1, 2026.
In October, the Ministry of Defence sought around $17.5 million to meet urgent liabilities at the Manhattan property, which could require up to $20m to restart operations pending a joint-venture arrangement through the Privatisation Commission. The hotel’s $200m lease with New York City, under which it housed migrants, was terminated earlier this year.
The ECC had directed PIA-IL and the ministry to hold separate deliberations with the Ministry of Finance to rationalise their demand, which appeared exaggerated to the committee members. These meetings led to the identification of $4m tax payable by the end of the current month to avoid any adverse action in the United States.
In addition, the company was also in default in debt servicing to the National Bank of Pakistan, for which another $3.5m equivalent of rupee cover was approved for settlements and rollovers.

Inflows in November alone amounted to $511m, relatively higher than $471m in October, but almost 46pc lower than $944m in the same month of last year.
Of the total, foreign loan inflows rose 46.22pc to $2.521bn in 5MFY26 compared to $1.724bn last year. Grants, on the other hand, fell by 43pc to $54m from $94m in the same period last year.
These inflows do not include $1.2bn disbursed by the IMF early this month and would be accounted for later.

MoF reports Pakistan receives over $3.03bn, including grants

The target for total foreign inflows for current year has been set at $19.9bn compared to $19.4bn last year.
In July-November of 2023, Pakistan was able to materialise more than $4.3bn mainly because of signing of the 9-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with the IMF. As a result, Pakistan received a major injection of $2bn in time deposit from Saudi Arabia. In fact, total inflows in July 2023 had amounted to $5.1bn that also included $1.2bn from the IMF and another $1bn from the UAE.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs on Tuesday said that total foreign inflows in 5MFY26 stood at $3.032bn compared to $2.667bn last year. The EAD said that out of total inflows, $1.157bn was received for project financing compared while non-project inflows amounted to $1.875bn.
This meant about $966m loans were received in five months for budget support. This is despite the fact that annual target for budget support this year was set at $13.5bn compared to $15bn last year. The authorities were also able to materialise $500m against Saudi Oil facility in five months, at a set rate of $100m each month, of the fiscal year against an annual target of $1bn.
Against a full year target of $5bn from multilaterals (excluding IMF), Pakistan got only $1.258bn in five months from multilateral lenders against $1.46bn of same period last year when the annual target was $4.5bn.
Total inflows from bilateral lenders (other than three strategic friendly countries) in five months of the year amounted to $808m against annual target of $1.36bn but was 200pc higher than $269m of same period last year when the full year target was $523m.
Total inflows from bilateral and multilateral lenders amounted to $2.066bn in five months of this year against the annual target of $6.4b. Last year, the government had secured $1.73bn from bilateral and multilaterals against annual target of $5.05bn.
Inflows from overseas Pakistanis increased to $966m in five months, up from $735m of same period last year in the shape of Naya Pakistan Certificates. The government has targeted a total of $609m through these certificates during the current year, which has already been surpassed by a wide margin.
The full year $19.9bn target for current fiscal year includes $6.4bn from both multilateral and bilateral lenders including $5.05bn from multilaterals and $1.36bn from bilateral lenders, $400m in international bonds, $3.1bn foreign commercial loans, $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn SAFE deposit from China.

“This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people,” Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement.
He said the commander of Libya’s ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff’s office were also on the aircraft.
Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT.







He said authorities found the plane’s wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara’s Haymana district.







He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established.
The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.
Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said an investigation into the crash was under way.
The Tripoli-based Government of National Unity said in a statement that the prime minister directed the defence minister to send an official delegation to Ankara to follow up on proceedings.
Walid Ellafi, state minister of political affairs and communication for the GNU, told broadcaster Libya Alahrar that it was not clear when a crash report would be ready, but that the jet was a leased Maltese aircraft.
He added that officials did not have “sufficient information regarding its ownership or technical history,” but said this would be investigated.
Libya’s UN-recognised Government of National Unity announced official mourning across the country for three days.
Turkiye’s defence ministry had announced Haddad’s visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders.
The crash occurred a day after Turkiye’s parliament passed a decision to extend the mandate of Turkish soldiers’ deployment in Libya by two more years.
Nato member Turkiye has militarily and politically supported Libya’s Tripoli-based, internationally recognised government.
In 2020, it sent military personnel there to train and support its government and later reached a maritime demarcation accord, which has been disputed by Egypt and Greece.
In 2022, Ankara and Tripoli also signed a preliminary accord on energy exploration, which Egypt and Greece also oppose.
However, Turkiye has recently switched course under its “One Libya” policy, ramping up contacts with Libya’s eastern faction as well.</p><small>2025-12-24 02:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641182-daytime-movement-of-dumpers-heavy-vehicles-banned-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Daytime movement of dumpers, heavy vehicles banned in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

The nation witnessed its undefeated king, Rizwan ’The Haider’ Ali, dethroned, only to see another warrior, Ismail ‘The Volcano’ Khan, announce his arrival as a genuine global force with a breathtaking finish.
The main event carried the hopes of a nation on the shoulders of its brightest star, Rizwan.
Entering the Bukhara arena with an unblemished 11-0 record and seven first-round finishes, the PAKMMA superstar faced a daunting task: defeating the local hero, Nozim ‘The Bukhara Warrior’ Kalandarov, in his own fortress.
Trouble appeared before the fight even began, with the 28-year-old Rizwan missing the lightweight limit, forcing the bout to a 72kg catchweight.
In the cage, a more critical problem emerged. Kalandarov executed a flawless grappler’s game plan, securing takedowns with ease in every round.
Despite a valiant defensive effort, Rizwan, a feared striker, had no answer for the relentless control and top pressure.
After three rounds of one-sided dominance, the judges’ unanimous decision was a mere formality, ending Rizwan’s historic unbeaten run.
In a display of true sportsmanship and resilience, Rizwan addressed the setback directly.
“I was the only undefeated fighter of Pakistan fighting on the highest stage — I took a fight against a hero in Central Asia,” Rizwan stated while talking to Dawn.
“I carried an injury throughout the camp but still decided to go ahead. My loss will go a long way in teaching me lessons that will help me rise. Big thanks to the people who supported me and I will come back stronger.”
The eruption of the volcano
Earlier in the evening, the Pakistani flag was flown with ruthless authority by Ismail.
Facing Kyrgyz submission specialist Rayimbek Tazhibaev in a 60.5kg catchweight bout, ‘The Volcano’ delivered a performance that was anything but catchweight in its significance.
Displaying terrifying fight IQ, Ismail masterfully neutralised his opponent’s strengths. He battered Tazhibaev with heavy leg kicks and crisp boxing, even out-grappling the grappler by securing takedowns and maintaining crushing top control.
In the second round, after rocking his foe with a clean combination, Ismail smelled blood. He secured a takedown, advanced to full mount, and seamlessly locked in his signature move — a vicious head-arm triangle choke.
The submission was so tight it rendered Tazhibaev unconscious, forcing the referee to stop the fight.
Pumping his fists and roaring in triumph, Ismail climbed the cage, embodying the explosive promise of his moniker.
“The arm triangle is my favourite submission,” stated a confident Ismail in his post-fight interview. “I train it constantly. When it’s on, I know I can put any fighter to sleep.”
The victory extends Ismail’s undefeated streak and marks his fourth consecutive win under the Brave CF banner, solidifying his position as one of the promotion’s most dangerous rising talents.
While the loss of Rizwan’s ‘0’ marks the closing of a legendary chapter for Pakistani MMA, his gracious response and determined vow to return set the stage for a compelling comeback saga.
Simultaneously, the emphatic victory of Ismail forcefully turns the page to a new one. The night proved that the nation’s fighting spirit is not housed in one man, but is a resilient flame carried by many.</p><small>2025-12-23 19:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/232317414f965e8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962824/thousands-stranded-after-karakoram-highway-blocked-by-rockslide-official' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands stranded after Karakoram Highway blocked by rockslide: official</strong></a><br><p>GILGIT: The Karakoram Highway (KKH) in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Chanas area was blocked by a large rockfall on Tuesday, leaving thousands stranded, according to a local official.
Nagar district Deputy Commissioner Asghar Khan told Dawn that the rockfall occurred in the early hours of Tuesday. He advised travellers and tourists to avoid the area until confirmation about the status of the KKH was received.
“The [rock] slide occurred around Fajr time in the boundary area between the Nagar and Gilgit districts,” Khan said. “We immediately informed the FWO (Frontier Works Organisation), and they arrived with machinery.”
Khan added that the boulders blocking the road were very large and would require blasting to clear.
Nobody was hurt in the rock slide, but access to the Hunza and Nagar districts was cut off, leaving thousands of students, patients, and tourists stranded for eight hours. A long queue of vehicles formed on both sides of the road.
Some people walked across the debris and changed vehicles after reaching the other side of the blockage.
Khan said that work to clear the blocked stretch of the KKH was underway and that he expects the road to be reopened for traffic by 11am on Wednesday.
The KKH is no stranger to rockfalls, landslides or other natural events that block the road.
Earlier in July, thousands of people, including foreign tourists, were stranded at multiple locations in Gilgit-Baltistan due to blocked roads, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), due to landslides.</p><small>2025-12-23 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23180321d264db7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962815/asif-calls-comparison-of-islamabads-action-against-taliban-with-indias-unprovoked-attacks-wrong-and-inappropriate' target='_blank'><strong>Asif calls comparison of Islamabad’s action against Taliban with India’s unprovoked attacks ‘wrong and inappropriate’</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday rejected the comparison between Islamabad‘s actions against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and New Delhi’s unprovoked action against the country in May as “wrong and inappropriate”.







The defence minister‘s remarks come a day after Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman questioned Pakistan’s objection to Indian attacks when the country also allegedly conducted cross-border strikes against terrorist targets in Afghanistan.







Pakistan has either denied or not commented on striking targets inside Afghanistan.
In a post on X, Asif also said that India, to date, has “not been able to provide evidence” of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pahalgam attack, despite Pakistan’s offer of “neutral investigations”.
“The report issued by the United Nations also clarifies that the Indian aggression was illegal and unsubstantiated, and Pakistan’s response was fully justified,“ said the defence minister.
He elaborated that the international community and the United Nations are also concerned about terrorism under the regime of the Afghan Taliban, and maintained that the presence of terrorist formations and terrorists infiltrating Pakistan “are a clear proof of this”.
He further stated that “any doubts raised by India, its proxies, and sympathisers” were addressed by the country “earlier and continue to be addressed today”.
Relations with neighbours
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
However, two additional rounds of talks were held, but did not bear any fruit. Asif said that the talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase”. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad.
Meanwhile, in May, tensions between Pakistan and India boiled over and led to a four-day military conflict.
The fighting was sparked by an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation.
But, New Delhi launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of the four-day clash. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
Pakistan initially said it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat during the conflict, but later raised the tally to seven. Islamabad has denied any losses of its planes and said it hit 26 Indian targets after three air bases were targeted.</p><small>2025-12-23 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/232020584a43568.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962809/pti-sit-in-at-rawalpindis-factory-naka-concludes-as-aleema-party-workers-leave-without-meeting-imran' target='_blank'><strong>PTI sit-in at Rawalpindi’s Factory Naka concludes as Aleema, party workers leave without meeting Imran</strong></a><br><p>PTI founder Imran Khan‘s sisters — Aleema Khan, Noreen Khan Niazi and Uzma Khan — ended their sit-in and left Rawalpindi’s Factory Naka on Tuesday night, hours after they were again barred from moving towards Adiala jail in a bid to meet the incarcerated ex-premier.
Over the past several weeks, the PTI founder has been denied meetings in prison with his family, party members and lawyers, prompting them to stage sit-ins near or outside the prison complex every Tuesday and Thursday — the court-mandated days for visiting Imran. At times, police also used water cannons and baton charges to disperse them.
A Dawn correspondent said that the PTI founder’s sisters left Factory Naka at around 9:30pm and moved towards Gorakhpur on foot, before heading home. Meanwhile, traffic resumed on the thoroughfare as soon as the 6-hour sit-in ended.
Half an hour before that, the Saddar police station house officer arrived at the protest site and began negotiations with PTI’s Shaukat Basra and Meena Khan Afridi. After initial talks, the PTI leaders reached out to Imran’s sisters for consultation.
An earlier post shared on the PTI’s official X account showed that the sit-in was ongoing at 7pm. In a video shared in the post, PTI workers are seen shouting slogans of “Prime Minister Imran Khan“.







A Dawn correspondent confirmed that police had installed a riot fence near the Factory Naka in Rawalpindi, and upon reaching the spot, Imran’s sister, along with party workers, staged a sit-in.
Earlier today, a PTI livestream showed crowds of party supporters marching towards the prison on Adiala Road, before being stopped in front of the riot fence, where they chanted slogans and waved Pakistani and PTI flags.
On the occasion, Aleema said that Imran was being kept in “solitary confinement”, stressing that the “government had become so fearful of Imran’s message that they had resorted to breaking the law” — in a reference to the police presence at the scene.







Speaking to reporters, Aleema said that the authorities are afraid of Imran, which is why they have jailed him.
When asked about the statement issued after the TTAP’s two-day conference, she said it “was not a statement”.
“The PTI people are saying that they want to negotiate (with the government), I responded by saying that Imran Khan has instructed Sohail Afridi to take to the streets and lead a movement,” she said.
She added that this last message came from lawyer Salman Safdar, who represented the PTI founder when he was convicted in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday.
“Whoever says that we should negotiate with the government after Imran gave these instructions, they cannot be a member of Imran Khan’s party,” Aleema stated.







“We will sit here and we will not leave Imran Khan.
She questioned what the government wants to negotiate when meetings with the PTI founder have been banned.
“Tell me why I cannot have meetings (with Imran),“ she said.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja spoke to reporters and said that the party’s struggle is now a national one for democracy and judicial independence.
“These punishments are unlawful and wrong,” Raja said when asked about Imran’s conviction. “Punishments have been handed out before. These are false cases.
“We are standing against a system of lies and will file appeals. But the true cases will be fought in the public‘s court and Allah’s court,” he added.
Raja said that Imran would be released when “the people decide on this case”.
Asked about the street movement, the secretary general said that Imran instructed the KP CM to lead it in the province.
“Sohail Afridi is ready and this will occur soon,” he replied, adding that when the time comes, there will be a similar movement in Punjab.
In response to a question about negotiations with the government, Raja said: “These are false reports; Imran has given nobody in the party the power to start talks with the government.
“Only [TTAP chief Mahmood Khan] Achakzai and [Senator] Allama Nasir have the power to do this,” he added. “Achakzai sahib gave his statement during the conference. He said that he will not negotiate with people who break into and rob his house.”
Raja affirmed that the PTI would stand by its principles and their claim that the February 8 elections were “stolen”.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a 14-year sentence at the Adiala jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023. Bushra Bibi is also serving a seven-year sentence in £190 million corruption case.
As court-ordered prison visits stay blocked, Imran’s family and party have expressed concerns about the conditions in which he is being kept inside the prison. A United Nations’ special rapporteur has also warned that Imran is being held in conditions that could amount to inhuman or degrading treatment.
On Monday, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Tariq Fazal Chaudhry said that meetings with incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan would remain suspended till February 8.

In response to an application filed by PPP worker Mohammad Amir seeking a First Information Report (FIR) against the director, the producer, and other crew members of Dhurandhar, SHO Darakhshan stated that, during the course of an inquiry, police found that all the proposed accused are Indian nationals and have no residential, business, or legal presence in Pakistan.
“The impugned film was produced, filmed and released in India, and all alleged acts took place outside the territorial jurisdiction of Pakistan. No material or evidence has surfaced to suggest screening, circulation, or availability of the said film within Pakistan,” he added.
The SHO stated in the report that the applicant also failed to disclose the commission of any cognisable offence within the territorial jurisdiction of the Darakhshan police station or in Pakistan at large.
“In absence of territorial jurisdiction and essential legal ingredients, registration of an FIR is neither warranted nor permissible under law,” the police maintained.
The report added that police had made multiple efforts to contact the applicant, but he did not appear before the police for verification of his allegations, despite being provided sufficient opportunity.
Submitting their opinion, the police report suggested that the application was devoid of merit, did not call for the registration of an FIR, and was liable to be dismissed.
The applicant moved the court after the police refused to register an FIR, maintaining that the PPP was portrayed as sympathetic to terrorists in the movie trailer and that Lyari was labelled a “terrorist war zone.” He claimed this was a provocative, misleading, and harmful misrepresentation that damaged the reputation of the country and its people.
He further stated that he had viewed the official trailer and promotional material of the film on social media platforms, saying that images of Benazir Bhutto, along with PPP’s flag and rally visuals, were used in the movie without legal permission.</p><small>2025-12-23 17:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2320591287ff420.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962822/new-epstein-releases-turn-up-more-emails-about-trump' target='_blank'><strong>New Epstein releases turn up more emails about Trump</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: Thousands of new documents linked to the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were made available on Tuesday by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), amid mounting criticism over the pace of the publication and heavy redactions.
The latest release includes around 11,000 files containing 30,000 pages of documents, with many redactions, including an email from a prosecutor indicating President Trump had travelled aboard his private jet “many more times than previously has been reported”.
The tranche of materials released on Friday included photographs of former Democratic president Bill Clinton and other famous names.
According to BBC News, these include the likes of pop stars Diana Ross, Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson, actor Kevin Spacey, British politician Peter Mandelson and former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, broadcaster Walter Cronkite, French modelling agent Jean Luc Brunel and Virgin founder Richard Branson.
An initial review of the released materials by BBC News and The Guardian yielded three particularly damning pieces of correspondence.
The first was a letter from Epstein to Larry Nassar – the US gymnastics team doctor convicted of sexually abusing scores of young gymnasts – ostensibly written while the former was in prison.
“Dear LN as you know by now, I have taken the ‘short route’ home. Good Luck! We share one thing … our love & caring for young ladies at the hope they’d reach their full potential. Our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls. When a young beauty walked by he loved to ‘grab snatch’, whereas we ended up snatching grub in the mess halls of the system. Life is unfair. Yours, J Epstein.”
The second is a series of emails between an individual identified as ‘The Invisible Man’ – believed to be an alias of former prince Andrew – and Epstein’s associate Ghislaine Maxwell.
In 2022, Maxwell was sentenced to 20 years in prison for crimes including conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts and sex trafficking of a minor.
Sent on August 16, 2001, the email begins: “I am up here at Balmoral Summer Camp for the Royal Family.“Lower down, the sender asks: “Have you found me some new inappropriate friends?” The sign-off reads: “See ya A xxx.”

The BBC maintained that the email did not indicate any wrongdoing, but said it had contacted Andrew’s team for a response.
In October 2025, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lost use of his Duke of York title following scrutiny over his links with Epstein.
A third email, concerned with Donald Trump, which had both the sender and recipient redacted, is part of an email chain, which includes the subject heading: ‘Epstein flight records’.
The email states: “He is listed as a passenger on at least eight flights between 1993 and 1996, including at least four flights on which Maxwell was also present. He is listed as having travelled with, among others and at various times, Marla Maples, his daughter Tiffany, and his son Eric.”
“On one flight in 1993, he and Epstein are the only two listed passengers; on another, the only three passengers are Epstein, Trump, and then-20-year-old” - with the person’s name redacted.
It goes on: “On two other flights, two of the passengers, respectively, were women who would be possible witnesses in a Maxwell case.

Trump defends ‘innocent people’
For his part, President Trump – who was the one pushing for the release of the files – said on Monday that people who “innocently met” Jeffrey Epstein in the past risked having their reputations ruined by the release.
In his first comments since the Justice Department began releasing the files on Friday, the president also dismissed the furore over Epstein as a distraction from his party’s achievements.
“This whole thing with Epstein is a way of trying to deflect from the tremendous success that the Republican Party has,” he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago home.
Former president Bill Clinton featured prominently in the first batch of photos from the Epstein files released by the Justice Department and Trump was asked for his reaction.
“I like Bill Clinton. I’ve always gotten along with Bill Clinton. I hate to see photos come out of him,” he said. “There’s photos of me too. Everybody was friendly with this guy (Epstein).”
Trump said he did not like the release of pictures of Clinton and others, calling it a “terrible thing”.
“Bill Clinton’s a big boy, he can handle it,” he said.

In a statement released by his spokesman, Clinton urged the Justice Department to release any materials in the files related to the former president, saying he had nothing to hide.
The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA), passed nearly unanimously by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, mandated the complete release of the Epstein files by Friday of last week.
Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche has blamed the delay on the need to redact the identities of Epstein’s more than 1,000 victims from the hundreds of thousands of documents and photos in the government’s possession.
EFTA co-sponsors Ro Khanna, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, threatened over the weekend to bring contempt of Congress charges against Attorney General Pam Bondi for failing to comply with the law.
Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution on Monday calling for legal action against the Trump administration for failing to release the complete Epstein files.</p><small>2025-12-23 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23123922f34193d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962796/punjab-cm-argues-against-lhcs-suspension-of-land-protection-law-says-move-will-benefit-encroachment-mafias' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM argues against LHC’s suspension of land protection law. says move will ‘benefit encroachment mafias’</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif expressed strong concern on Tuesday on the suspension of the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025 by the Lahore High Court (LHC), arguing that the move would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”.
Maryam‘s statement issued by the CM’s Office comes a day after LHC Chief Justice Aalia Neelum issued an interim order suspending the operation of the newly enacted Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, which empowers dispute resolution committees led by deputy commissioners to resolve property disputes.
The ordinance was approved by the Punjab chief minister on Oct 31 and mandates the resolution of land disputes within 90 days.
The law has been challenged in the LHC, about which Maryam argued that its enactment was aimed at providing “long-awaited relief to millions of citizens suffering from prolonged land and property disputes”.
“The legislation, for the first time, fixed a 90-day time frame for the resolution of land and property cases that have historically dragged on for years and even generations,” she said, terming the law a “major step” toward protecting ordinary citizens from powerful land grabbers and mafias.
Maryam emphasised that the “democratically elected Punjab Assembly had passed the law to free the public from the grip of influential land mafias”.
The legislation, she insisted, empowered citizens to safeguard their legally owned land and properties.
The legislation was “evidence-based and comprehensive”, covering both administrative and legal dimensions to ensure justice for the oppressed, the CM said.
Maryam further maintained that the LHC‘s decision to suspend the ordinance’s operation “is not in line with the settled principles laid down by the superior judiciary”.
Its suspension would “benefit encroachment and land-grabbing mafias”, and the public would perceive it as state patronage of such elements, she said.
The CM highlighted that progress in cases pertaining to land and property would often be stalled by stay orders for decades, and justice was being denied to rightful owners.
“This law was neither made for my personal benefit nor does its suspension harm me personally,” she said, adding that “real loss” from its suspension would be borne by the poor, widows, the helpless, and other marginalised citizens who were finally beginning to receive relief.
Maryam stressed that “legislation is the constitutional right of the provincial assembly and cannot be obstructed”.
Halting the new property law would “shatter the fragile hope of justice that had been rekindled among the poor and oppressed segments of society”, the CM said.
Ministers defend the law
Punjab Law Minister Malik Sohaib Ahmad Bherth, Information Minister Azma Bukhari, and treasury MPAs strongly defended the Punjab Protection of Ownership of Immovable Property Act, 2025, in the provincial assembly as debate over the suspension of the law intensified in the House.
Bherth maintained that the objective of the law was to make people’s lives easier, as land grabbing remained one of the biggest public grievances.
He credited CM Maryam for initiating reforms, saying that whenever she decided to curb crime, results started to appear.
The law minister claimed that officials received a large number of applications after the passage of the law, and the government started taking action on public grievances.
“So far, the government has retrieved around 5,000 properties from illegal occupants,” he said.
He noted that certain mafias opposed the law and took the matter to the high court.
“When a system is moving towards improvement, it should be allowed to function, and its weaknesses should be corrected rather than derailing it,” he said, stressing that institutions must work together.
Speaking on the matter, Information Minister Azma Bukhari said the law was designed to safeguard legal property owners, as it stood firm against the land-grabbing mafia that operates through an organised network with alleged links to sections of the bureaucracy.
“Under the law, a 90-day timeframe is provided to establish illegal occupation. So far, the officials have announced decisions in 5,044 cases, including rulings on illegal possession,” she said.
She added that committees formed under the law also scrutinised fake and forged property documents during proceedings.
Bukhari said residents of areas where cases have been decided are satisfied, as properties have been retrieved from land grabbers not in months or weeks, but in some instances, within hours.
She pointed out that the LHC currently has 169,000 pending cases, including around 11,000 property-related disputes.
She further stated that similar property protection laws are in force in countries such as China, Mexico, Brazil, and the United States, expressing surprise over a court decision reportedly directing the reversal of decisions already made under the law.
“No victim of the land grabbers was asked which party they voted for,” she said, adding that the chief minister’s sole objective was to stand with the poor.
Earlier, initiating the debate in the assembly, treasury MPA Amjad Ali Javed termed the suspension of the bill “regrettable,” saying it was meant to provide long-denied justice to citizens suffering due to land and property disputes.
He pointed out that overseas Pakistanis’ lands remained under illegal occupation for years due to prolonged stay orders.
“Millions of cases are pending in courts, and citizens spend years seeking justice. Suspension of the law adds to their suffering,” he said, urging the high courts to issue remarks with caution and allow institutions to perform their constitutional roles.
Opposition lawmaker Brigadier (retd) Mushtaq questioned “the government’s hostility toward the judiciary” and alleged that the government sought a weak judiciary while empowering district administrations and the police.
“Despite past grievances, the PTI stands with the judiciary and opposes concentrating all powers in the hands of deputy commissioners,” he added.
While Maryam has defended the law, LHC CJ Neelum expressed her disapproval of the law during the hearing on Monday, saying: “It appears that some people want to hold all powers”.
The judge had further observed that the new law had dismantled the civil setup, civil rights, and judicial supremacy.
“If it were up to the authorities, they would even suspend the Const­itution,” she had said.
Questioning the purpose of the law, CJ Neelum had asked how a revenue officer could hand over the possession of a property in a matter pending before a civil court.</p><small>2025-12-23 16:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/231846540e482f4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962819/ppp-senator-palwasha-khan-files-privilege-motion-against-aleem-khan-calls-his-conduct-highly-unbecoming' target='_blank'><strong>PPP Senator Palwasha Khan files privilege motion against Aleem Khan, calls his conduct ‘highly unbecoming’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Peoples Party Senator Palwasha Khan on Tuesday submitted a privilege motion in a Senate committee against Communications Minister Aleem Khan for reacting in a manner “highly unbecoming” to hold public office.
A heated exchange was witnessed between Minister for Communications Aleem Khan and Senator Palwasha Khan last week during a meeting of the Senate Committee on Communications over a question related to the construction of a road project.
Palwasha blamed Aleem for personal attacks as he reacted angrily to parliamentary scrutiny.
“We will treat you the way we are treated,” Aleem had responded, saying that he cannot stand the allegations levelled against him.
During a press conference in Islamabad today, the senator, along with other party members, condemned the behaviour of the communications minister.
She emphasised that it was not a personal matter, but a question of the collective dignity of parliament, and that remaining silent on this would not be appropriate.

“If we tolerate and don’t raise our voice against this, it will soon become the norm.” She clarified that she did not blame anyone.
“I had submitted a written question a few months ago under the rights granted to lawmakers. However, the responsible officials never responded, which subsequently led to this question being added to the agenda of the Senate’s Standing Committee.”
Palwasha elaborated that she raised a question over a road built by the National Highway Authority and funded by the taxpayers’ money.
“I asked whether it was built for public benefit or to give an advantage to a specific society.”
“Raising questions on the utilisation of public resources is the fundamental duty of the legislators,” she added.
“Time will decide who was at fault and who was subjected to injustice,” The senator said.
PPP senator thanked her party leadership for “clearly” declaring that the party will never compromise on the “dignity of the parliamentarians and the democratic rights of lawmakers”.
“A Senate committee is not a drawing room; it is the extension of the parliament in which everyone is answerable, where not the voice but the argument should be strong.”
“Unfortunately, people mix up indecency and coarseness with courage,” she indicated.
She further stated that the communication minister’s behaviour was neither “democratic” nor “up to the standards of parliament”.
“The dignity comes through the practices, not the personalities.” She further said, “Politics is not a circus, but it has become one in our country. We will resist this.”
The senator maintained that her party had always defended the dignity of the parliament, women’s rights and democratic values.
“I am not against anyone,” she said. “However, PM Shehbaz Sharif has to consider the attitude of his cabinet members. It is a collective responsibility, and the PM is primarily responsible for it.”
The senator further stated that “disrespecting women cannot become a routine“, and added that she would also release media which will ”further expose the minister“.
She also demanded that the Joint Investigation Team (JIT) be constituted to conduct a forensic audit of all matters related to the Communications Ministry based on the revelations in the IMF report.
The senator also lamented the conduct of the committee chairman for “not giving a ruling or interrupting”.
Earlier, PPP leader Sherry Rehman had said that Aleem must apologise following his heated exchange with Palwasha.
“He must apologise. I am not even going to say that it is necessary because she is a woman. She is due that basic right of respect as an honourable member of Parliament from a federal minister,” she said.
PPP on Sunday also termed the verbal attacks by the minister “disappointing”.
“Humiliation of a party woman is intolerable and the PPP will not sit silent on the matter,” he said. Without naming the minister, the PPP secretary general said: “The arrogance of power was speaking loudly. The sanctity of the (standing) committee was marred,” Mr Khan said.</p><small>2025-12-23 16:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641142-na-committee-rejects-bill-seeking-ban-on-dowry' target='_blank'><strong>NA committee rejects bill seeking ban on dowry</strong></a><br><p>

The district police spokesman, Shaukat Khan, confirmed the incident and the casualties, saying that all of the martyred personnel were constables.
The martyred policemen were identified as constables Shahid Iqbal, Samiullah, Arif, Safdar and Muhammad Abrar, who was also the mobile’s driver, Khan added.
He said that on the instructions of the Kohat Regional Police Office and the Karak district police officer, a joint operation between the Karak Police and Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) was launched in the area.
“Eight terrorists were killed as they were pursued through tricky and mountainous terrain,” Khan said. “The bodies of the slain terrorists have been shifted to the hospital for a post-mortem, while the process of identifying them is underway.”
While the exact details of the attack remain unclear, an image shared by the police spokesman showed what appeared to be the charred remains of the vehicle.
Meanwhile, a press release from the Karak Police stated that funeral prayers had been offered for the five martyrs, who were presented with full honours.
“In the funeral prayer ceremony, a decorated contingent of police offered a salute to the martyrs, while flowers were placed on the bodies of the martyrs wrapped in the national flag,” the press release read.
Karak Police added that the funeral prayers were attended by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah and KP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed, among other civilian and police officials.

The CM and chief secretary “met the relatives of the martyrs, expressed their grief and sorrow and paid tribute to their great sacrifice”, the press release added. “The senior officers also assured the relatives of all possible cooperation, government benefits and welfare facilities.”
The statement further said that IG stated that the martyred police personnel sacrificed their lives for the maintenance of law and order and the protection of the public, which will never be forgotten.
He further clarified that the KP police would continue its fight against terrorism with full force, professionalism and determination, vowing retaliation for martyrs’ blood.
CM Afridi was quoted as saying that the sacrifices of martyrs are expensive and that the police have always been on the front line in combating terrorism. He added that the government stands by the police, who are being provided with modern equipment.
“Elements hostile to peace will not be forgiven under any circumstances. The sacrifices of the martyred police personnel are a source of pride not only for the police force but also for the entire nation, and their memories will always live on,” CM Afridi as quoted as saying.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the incident, expressing deep sorrow and grief over the lives lost and offering prayers for the martyred officers, according to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office.
He extended his condolences to the bereaved families and assured them of the government’s full support during this difficult time.
The prime minister paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police force, stating that police personnel had always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism and rendered “unparalleled” services to ensure peace and security in the country.
“The entire nation salutes the martyrs who laid down their lives in the line of duty,” the prime minister said, adding that their sacrifices would never be forgotten.
Reiterating the government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan remained fully committed to the complete elimination of terrorism in all its forms.
Separately, district police spokesperson Asif Hassan told Dawn that an assistant sub-inspector, Rehmatullah, and a passerby were injured during an exchange of fire between police and wanted suspects in Lakki Marwat’s Tajori area.
Today‘s attack on the vehicle is the latest in a series of incidents in which police personnel have been targeted in the province. Last week, a police official and his brother were martyred in a gun attack in KP’s Lakki Marwat.
Earlier this month, a cop was martyred while five others were injured in a suicide blast targeting a police mobile in Lakki Marwat. In November, three police personnel were martyred as law enforcers responded to a terrorist attack on a checkpost in Hangu.</p><small>2025-12-23 15:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641129-punjab-cm-says-lhc-stay-on-land-protection-law-will-embolden-grabbers' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab CM says LHC stay on land protection law will 'embolden grabbers'</strong></a><br><p>

The proposition by the premier was made during a federal cabinet meeting in Islamabad, where he referred to news reports of the opposition PTI and its “companions talking about dialogue“.
He recalled that he had previously invited the opposition for talks on multiple occasions, including in the assembly.
“If they are ready for this, the government of Pakistan is definitely ready,” he said, adding that harmony among all political parties was necessary for the progress and prosperity of the country.
However, he continued, there should be no “blackmailing” under the guise of talks and dialogue could only move forward “in light of legitimate matters”.

 

The need for dialogue between the government and the opposition has been stressed as Pakistan continues to face political and economic crises.
On December 21, the second and last day of a “national conference” held by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), the participants had agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.
They were of the opinion that in light of the ongoing national crisis, the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before.
The same day, political leaders, including ruling PML-N stalwarts, from across the spectrum called for dialogue and restraint to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.
This call for reconciliation among political actors was made at the Khawaja Rafique Shaheed reference in Lahore.
Speaking on the occasion, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar urged a new national political charter rooted in tolerance and dialogue while PM’s Adviser Rana Sanaullah stressed that political stability could only be achieved through restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue.
Recently, a similar proposal was also made by five PTI leaders currently incarcerated in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail. In a letter, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Sarfraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mian Mehmoodur Rasheed argued dialogue was the only viable path to steer the country out of its ongoing crises.
The matter of talks between the opposition, mainly the PTI, and the government has been in the news since last year.
After more than a year of heightened tensions, the two sides had commenced dialogue in the last week of December 2024 to bring down political temperatures. But despite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process stalled on major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions to probe the protests of May 9, 2023 and Nov 26, 2024, and the release of PTI prisoners.
The Shehbaz government once again extended a dialogue offer to the opposition PTI in February this year as National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq insisted that the option of talks had never been dropped.
However, a day after the PM made the offer, the PTI refused it, with party leader Asad Qaiser asking how they could enter a dialogue with the government when the rulers had stepped up the crackdown on the PTI.
Qaiser alleged the government had started raids to round up the PTI workers, and dozens of them had reportedly been arrested across the country.
In early August, the dialogue offer was again extended by government ministers and Speaker Sadiq during a debate on the Kashmir issue in the NA.
The PTI members welcomed the offer for talks but questioned the government’s authority to initiate dialogue.
More recently, Sadiq reiterated his offer on November 13 to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties.
The offer was made by the speaker at a time when the opposition members belonging to the PTI were protesting in the assembly during the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill.
He had again ostensibly made an offer of talks to the opposition, telling a group of parliamentarians visiting him on November 28 that dialogue was the way to resolve issues.
On December 6, after a fiery speech in the Senate by a PTI-backed lawmaker, deploring the absence of rule of law and an unannounced ban on meetings with incarcerated former prime minister Imran Khan, the ruling party once again held out an olive branch to the PTI, reassuring it that all issues could be resolved through dialogue.
Speaking in the upper house of parliament, Sana­ullah said the PTI had always rejected the path of negotiations, even though all issues could be reso­lved through dialogue rather than deadlock.
He said the government was ready to hold a dialogue with the opposition to take the country forward, but the PTI leadership remained unwilling.
Without naming the military establishment, the adviser to the premier said, “Those who they want [to have] dialogue [with] are not ready for talks with them.”</p><small>2025-12-23 14:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23185800d87cba8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962820/cdf-field-marshal-munir-talks-about-security-challenges-highlights-indirect-ambiguous-approaches-used-by-hostile-actors' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Field Marshal Munir talks about security challenges, highlights ‘indirect, ambiguous approaches’ used by hostile actors</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on Tuesday warned of “indirect and ambiguous approaches” employed by actors hostile to Pakistan, including the use of proxies, during a visit to Islamabad’s National Defence University (NDU).
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the CDF was briefed by civil and military participants of the ongoing national security and war course about their academic perspectives on challenges to national security.
“The field marshal highlighted that hostile elements increasingly employ indirect and ambiguous approaches, including the use of proxies to exploit internal fault lines, rather than overt confrontation,” the statement read.
“He stressed that future leaders must be trained and remain alert to recognise, anticipate and counter such multi-layered cognitive challenges.”

According to the ISPR, the field marshal outlined the complex and evolving global, regional and internal security environment, noting that Pakistan faces broad and persistent challenges in multiple domains.
“He noted that these challenges span conventional, sub-conventional, intelligence, cyber, information, military, economic and other domains, requiring comprehensive multi-domain preparedness, continuous adaptation and synergy amongst all elements of national power,” the statement read.
Field Marshal Munir also highlighted that clear decision-making amid uncertain conditions and mental resilience are critical for operating in today’s contested and diffused security environment.
He also lauded NDU’s role in developing strategic thinkers capable of translating rigorous training and academic insight into effective policy formulation and operational outcomes.
The field marshal “underscored that professional military education remains central to strengthening institutional capacity, fostering indigenous capability, and ensuring long-term national resilience”, the statement added.
He also appreciated the panel’s analysis and conclusions, urging students to “remain vigilant, adaptive and steadfast in upholding the values of integrity, discipline and selfless service”.</p><small>2025-12-23 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641122-hostile-elements-using-proxies-to-exploit-internal-fault-lines-field-marshal' target='_blank'><strong>Hostile elements using proxies to ‘exploit internal fault lines': Field Marshal</strong></a><br><p>

A detailed cross-examination of the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency’s (NCCIA) witnesses exposed procedural gaps and triggered heated exchanges inside the courtroom.
The court began recording the statements of prosecution witnesses afresh last Tuesday in compliance with directives issued by the Islamabad High Court (IHC) the day prior, while hearing a petition filed by Mazari challenging the trial court’s November 19 order.
The hearing was conducted by Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka at the District and Sessions Court in Islamabad, with the couple appearing along with their legal teams.
During cross-examination, NCCIA Naib Qasid Afzal admitted that he did not have copies of his contract or service card and conceded that official letters received on October 16 and 20 did not mention the time of receipt.
Chatha pointed out discrepancies between the signatures on official documents, raising questions about the authenticity of record-keeping.
Another prosecution witness, Wasim, informed the court he had been a contract employee for the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for five years and had served with the NCCIA since its establishment.
However, he admitted that he was carrying only an FIA service card and not an NCCIA card and that the USB provided by the investigating officer was not sealed.
Wasim added that he had no written contract describing his job responsibilities and also stated he was unaware of any FIA circular barring the registration of first information reports (FIR) without prior notice.
The most pointed exchange came during the cross-examination of technical expert Anis, who claimed to have prepared over 5,200 forensic reports and stated that he was the sole technical expert at NCCIA.
He informed the court that his report was prepared using surface analysis techniques on seven screenshots and fourteen posts, based strictly on the scope letter issued by the investigating officer.
Anis conceded that neither the complaint nor the scope letter mentioned the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM), Manzoor Pashteen or Ali Wazir, and confirmed that the post under scrutiny dated back to October 31, 2021, while the cited individuals were declared proscribed in 2024.
Despite this, he maintained that the accused were spreading a “state-hostile narrative” by referring to enforced disappearances — a position strongly contested by the defence.
Chatha questioned whether references to enforced disappearances by the Supreme Court, high courts, cabinet members, or even former intelligence chiefs would also be considered anti-state. The witness declined to comment, stating such matters were outside his mandate and could only be assessed if presented to him as a case.
Tempers flared when sharp remarks were exchanged between the prosecution and defence, resulting in an attempt at physical confrontation. Police intervened to restore order.
Judge Majoka directed the prosecution to apologise for using inappropriate language and reminded both sides that objections must be addressed through the court.
After a brief recess, further cross-examination revealed that dozens of other social media accounts had retweeted the same content, yet no investigation was conducted against them. The witness acknowledged that the scope of inquiry was limited to the accused.
The court adjourned further proceedings till January 5, when cross-examination of the technical expert will resume.
The controversy at the centre of the case stems from a complaint filed on August 12, 2025, by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the NCCIA Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca).
The complaint accused Mazari of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.
Consequently, an inquiry was initiated, and following its conclusion on August 22, 2025, a first information report was registered against the two, alleging commission of offences under sections 9, 10, 11 and 26-A of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (PECA).
They were indicted in the case on October 30.
Last Thursday, the Supreme Court (SC) stayed trial proceedings against the couple until their pending appeals were decided by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The court issued the directives as a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and comprising Justice Salahuddin Panwhar and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, heard Imaan’s appeal seeking to set aside the IHC’s Dec 1 order refusing to grant interim relief by staying the trial in the case.</p><small>2025-12-23 13:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/23161058bb02741.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808/bangladesh-summons-indian-envoy-over-protests-targeting-its-diplomatic-facilities-vandalism-at-visa-centre' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh summons Indian envoy over protests targeting its diplomatic facilities, vandalism at visa centre</strong></a><br><p>Bangladesh on Tuesday summoned India’s high commissioner in Dhaka to protest what it described as violent incidents targeting its diplomatic facilities in India, including vandalism at visa centres and protests outside its mission in New Delhi.
Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it summoned Indian High Commissioner Pranay Verma to convey Dhaka’s grave concern over what it called “regrettable incidents” outside the Bangladesh High Commission and the ambassador’s residence in New Delhi on December 20, as well as vandalism at the Bangladesh Visa Centre in Siliguri on December 22 by “extremist elements.”
The ministry condemned what it described as premeditated acts of violence and intimidation against diplomatic establishments.
It said such acts not only “endanger the safety of diplomatic personnel but also undermine the principles of mutual respect and values of peace and tolerance.”
Calling for a proper investigation, the ministry said: “Bangladesh expects the Government of India to immediately take appropriate steps in accordance with its international and diplomatic obligations to safeguard the dignity and security of diplomatic personnel and establishments.”
According to Bangladeshi media, around 20 to 25 protesters had gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Saturday evening. According to mission officials, the protesters raised anti-Bangladesh slogans and issued threats against the Bangladesh high commissioner, Prothom Alo reported.
India’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that the New Delhi demonstration consisted of “20-25 youths” who were dispersed by police after a few minutes, adding that India was “committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions”.
Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also said that India had taken note of “misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident”.
In response, the Bangldesh foreign ministry issued a statement, saying that the “unjustifiable incident at the Bangladesh High Commission residence in New Delhi on December 20 is highly regrettable and cannot be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’”.
The tensions with India come as Bangladesh struggles to deal with domestic unrest over the death of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi, who was shot in the head while launching his campaign for February’s parliamentary election last week.
His killing sparked widespread protests that spiralled into arson and vandalism targeting major media outlets and cultural institutions.
Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star previously reported that around 100 protesters had gathered in the Chowhatta area and demanded that those responsible for Hadi‘s killing be brought to justice.
“Addressing the gathering, protesters alleged that the killing had been carried out ‘at the behest of India’.
Bangladesh has also halted all consular and visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi while the Indian Visa Application Centre in the Bangladeshi city of Chattogram has suspended its operations, citing security concerns at India’s mission there.
Protests in India
In another development connected to the tensions between the two countries, hundreds of people protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi today against the lynching of a Hindu man over allegations of blasphemy.
Factory worker Dipu Chandra Das, 27, was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district last week by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). At least 10 people have been arrested in connection with his death.
Tuesday’s demonstration, called by Hindu groups, involved people clashing with police personnel as they tried to push through barricades set up near the High Commission, television footage showed.
They also chanted slogans and burnt pictures of Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, with some holding posters demanding “boycott Bangladesh”.
“We needed to raise the voice of Hindus in Bangladesh in Delhi, and we have done that … as long as even one Hindu is being harmed there, we will be awake and will not stop,” a protester told broadcaster India Today.
Demonstrations were also held in other parts of the country, as well as in India-occupied Kashmir.</p><small>2025-12-23 11:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/2315560291b00ad.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1962812/corruption-charges-spark-protests-against-albanian-government' target='_blank'><strong>Corruption charges spark protests against Albanian government</strong></a><br><p>Protesters in Albania’s capital of Tirana hurled petrol bombs at the government building housing Prime Minister Edi Rama’s office on Monday, demanding the government’s resignation after prosecutors indicted the deputy prime minister for alleged corruption.
Political tensions in Albania have escalated in recent weeks after accusations were made against Deputy Prime Minister Belinda Balluku. Along with several officials and private companies, she has been accused of using state funds to favour some companies in major infrastructure projects.

         View this post on Instagram            

She referred to the accusations in parliament last month as “mudslinging, insinuations, half-truths and lies,” and stated that she would fully cooperate with the judiciary.
The Special Prosecution Office, tasked with combating corruption and organised crime, has requested that parliament lift Balluku’s immunity this week and allow her arrest. It is not clear when the parliament, where Rama’s ruling party holds a majority, is expected to vote.
As protesters threw petrol bombs on Monday, police in riot gear protected the government building but did not push back the protesters.
“We have had enough because it’s a matter of tens and hundreds of millions of euros stolen, and she isn’t resigning. This is disgraceful,” said protester Arben Sulo.
Balluku also heads the Ministry of Infrastructure, which manages hundreds of millions of euros in projects such as roads, bridges, and tunnels.</p><small>2025-12-23 11:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/641074-field-marshal-munir-hailed-as-leading-middle-power-multi-aligner-in-leading-british-newspaper-report' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir hailed as leading middle power multi-aligner in British newspaper report</strong></a><br><p>

She made the remarks while addressing a press conference alongside Finance Minister Muhammad Aurganzeb in Islamabad. At the outset of the press conference, Aurangzeb said the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) had approved the recommendations of the Spectrum Advisory Committee.
In her remarks, Khawaja said that the recommendations would now be taken to the federal cabinet.
“After that, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) will issue an information memorandum based on which consultations and negotiations will be held with stakeholders and the telecom sector,” she said.
“We are trying to ensure that the auction is completed by the end of January or early February,” she added. Explaining the significance of the development, she said that the internet quality in Pakistan was not at par with international best practices or even the quality in the region.
“The major reason for this is that the spectrum is not available in Pakistan,” she said. The IT minister said that Pakistan’s population of 240 million was operating on a spectrum of 274 MHz.
“This means we are using two lanes for traffic which requires eight, which is why there is congestion, your internet does not work and you face challenges,” she said. “For that reason, the spectrum auction is being carried out.”
She said that during auctions held in the past, around 60MHz of spectrum was acquired. She said that the government was going to auction 600 MHz, making it the largest-ever.
The IT minister said that during the auction, additional bands were being auctioned in Pakistan for the first time, which meant that for consumers, not only 3G and 4G quality would improve, but it would also ensure the rollout of 5G services.
She said the PTA would ensure that all these rollouts would be completed between four to six months of the auction so that services could “visibly” improve after this period.
She said that the government was making efforts to ensure that 5G services would roll out after six months.
The minister stressed that the internet was integral to the government’s digitisation efforts as part of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act, 2025.
“According to Connect 2030 — which the prime minister will inaugurate soon — we will ensure that over the next five years the minimum connectivity available to users should 100 Mbps.“
In November, the consultant for the 5G spectrum auction presented its report to the government, which had remained stalled due to the merger of PTCL and Telenor and litigation over the 2600MHz band.
The report, prepared by US-based consultancy firm National Economic Research Associates (NERA), noted that Pakistan was offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands: 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz, 2600MHz and 3500MHz.
The 2600MHz band was considered the most suitable for 5G.
