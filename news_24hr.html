Those who were offloaded belong to Faisalabad.
An FIA spokesperson said on Saturday that all of the passengers were going to Jeddah by flight number FZ 356 from Faisalabad airport; however, they were stopped during clearance on the basis of their suspicious movements and evidence.
The passengers included Hamza Ali, Zeeshan Ali, Samiullah, Shiraz Hassan, Imran Waris, Bilal Hassan, Syed Yasin Hussain, Muhammad Rizwan, Ghulam Rasool, Haq Nawaz, Faizal Bibi, Zahida Bibi and Sardaran Bibi.
He said there were reports that female passengers were being used as shields to travel to Europe through Saudi Arabia from various airports on Umrah visas.
During the investigation, suspicious international phone calls were detected which were made from the passengers’ mobile phones. He also added that calls from the phones of offloaded passengers were also detected which were made to an agent identified as Sajid Ali and chats were made with him related to their next illegal journey to Egypt and Libya.
According to the initial investigation, the passengers stated that they were planning to travel from Libya to Europe by boat.
The FIA Anti-Human Trafficking Circle has been handed over the custody of offloaded 13 passengers for investigation and legal action.
Meanwhile, FIA arrested two persons for violation of Copyright Act.
An official said that FIA Corporate Crime Circle team raided Sargodha Road and arrested both suspects Mazhar Ali and Arqam Ali from whom a large quantity of fake products of known registered companies were also recovered.
ACCIDENT: A youth died after he was hit by a speeding car near Tin Pullian Wala Adda on Shorkot Cantonment Road on Saturday.
Rescue 1122 said deceased identified as Amanullah (19) of Mauza Bhangoo was crossing the road when a car ran over him as a result he was critically injured. He was shifted to Shorkot THQ hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.The car driver sped away after the accident.
SUSPENDED: Faisalabad Commissioner Raja Jehangir Anwar suspended secretary of union council No 70 of Pirmahal tehsil, Syed Zeeshan Haider, due to his failure to eliminate stray dogs in UC villages which caused rising dog-bite cases.
During his visit to Pirmahal tehsil on Saturday, people complained to the commissioner that a number of children and senior citizens had been bitten by the rabid dogs.
He also warned the assistant director (local government) to boost municipal services in all 17 rural UCs in the tehsil, including focussing on dog culling and sanitation.
The commissioner took notice of the poor condition of the cleanliness in Pirmahal THQ hospital and asked the MS to improve cleanliness within seven days otherwise action be taken against him. He set the Dec 31 deadline for the contractor to complete the construction of trauma centre in the hospital.
During the briefing, he was informed that after the completion of 20-bed trauma centre the total number of beds will increase to 50.
He also directed the assistant commissioner to deploy additional janitors for cleaning the hospital and submit him report. He said the general bus stand at Pirmahal is in bad shape and its essential repairs would be done by District Council funds.
The commissioner also visited the Lyallpur Museum at Faisalabad along with its Chairman Board of Governors Dr Amir Sarfraz. On this occasion, it was decided to expand the Lyallpur Museum and the commissioner said that it is necessary to display more than 5,000 artifacts already kept in stock in the museum. He sought an expansion plan from the curator of the museum and said that the facilities for visitors will be upgraded.
He said that the maintenance issues in the museum should be resolved within two weeks. He visited the galleries containing the history of the region. Additional Commissioner (Coordination) Amir Raza and Curator Maqbool Ahmed Malik were also present.

“Since the creation of the Crime Control Department in January 2025, the national media and human rights bodies have been highlighting incidents of extrajudicial killings by Punjab police,” said the petition filed by lawyers – Mian Dawood, Pervaiz Elahi, Rai Imran Khan and Nadeem Abbas Dogar.
The petition argues that the CCD has created a state of fear and panic in society with the impression that the police can, now, kill any person by declaring him a criminal after preparing his past criminal record by implicating him in already lodged FIRs through supplementary statements.
According to media reports, nearly 1,100 citizens have been killed in police encounters so far, it adds.
The petition argues that the superior judiciary, in multiple judgments, has already declared fake police encounters unconstitutional and illegal.
“Fake encounters are being used as an alternative to the criminal justice system,” it alleges.
The petition states that recent killing of a young lawyer, Zeeshan Dhaddi, at his residence by the police in Vehari is a shameful example of fake encounters.

 

It submits that the Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act 2022 was enacted specifically to curb fake encounters, which empowers the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to conduct an inquiry into every custodial death within 30 days.
The petition contends that the Lahore High Court in several judgments already directed the federal government and the Punjab chief minister to ensure the implementation of the law.
However, the citizens are still being labelled as suspects and killed in Punjab with impunity and the FIA has not conducted an inquiry into any custodial death to date.
The petitioners ask the high court to immediately halt all police encounters in Punjab and direct the FIA to conduct inquiries into police encounters conducted since the creation of the CCD.
The Punjab government, Punjab police, CCD, FIA, and the federal government have been made parties in the petition.

Tourists were among the dead in the blaze, which broke out at about midnight at a club in Arpora in the north of the coastal state.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a statement that the deaths were “deeply saddening”.
Goa, a former Portuguese colony on the shores of the Arabian Sea, lures millions of tourists every year with its nightlife, sandy beaches and laid-back coastal atmosphere.







“Today is a very painful day for all of us,” Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said in a statement, adding that “25 people have lost their lives and six have been injured.” Sawant told journalists that “three to four” tourists had died, without giving their nationalities.
“I have ordered a magisterial inquiry into the entire incident to identify the cause and fix responsibility,” Sawant added.
‘Fire show’
Video images from the Press Trust of India news agency showed rescuers carrying the injured or dead on stretchers down the narrow stone staircase of the Birch nightclub.
“Most people died due to suffocation in the basement and kitchen area,” Nitin V. Raiker, Goa’s fire chief, told Indian broadcaster CNN News18.
“I received information that there was a club party going on, and a fire show was organised in the club. The wooden parts of the club caught fire, and smoke spread throughout the building.”
Fires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.
In May, at least 17 people died after a fire ripped through a three-storey building in the Indian city of Hyderabad.
A month before that, a fierce blaze broke out in a hotel in Kolkata, killing at least 15 people. Some people clambered out of windows and onto the rooftop to escape.
And last year, at least 24 people died after a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat.</p><small>2025-12-07 05:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6934c70d883b9.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959658/beyond-the-notification-storm' target='_blank'><strong>Beyond the notification storm</strong></a><br><p>WHAT has been described by analysts and ministers alike as a storm in a teacup has subsided with the much-discussed/ awaited ‘notification’ now in the public domain. However, the notification does not say what caused the friction, if at all there was any, among the two elements of the hybrid set-up and who conceded ground, if anyone actually did.
Despite considerable speculation about the differences holding up the notification, with some ‘analysts’ suggesting a total breakdown was imminent, spelling an end to the hybrid set-up, there were others who were analysing the situation in a far more nuanced manner and insisting the doomsday scenario was grossly exaggerated and indicative of wishful thinking than fact.
After everything was so explicitly spelt out in the 27th Amendment, one couldn’t understand what room was left for friction. All that was nee­ded for the notification was a ‘cut and paste’ from the amendment, quite honestly. Not much more.
The amendment was in itself a reflection and recognition of the reality of the mutual need for the two rather unequal halves that make up the hybrid set-up, so where, how and why would the question of civilian reservations arise, let alone beggars (as in can’t be choosers) ‘taking a stand’?

After everything was so explicitly spelt out in the 27th Amendment, one couldn’t understand what room was left for friction.

If I ask you how significant the continuation of the current set-up is for its civilian element’s well-being, particularly in view of the last election, where its mass support seemed to have collapsed rather dramatically, when it had to be dragged across the finish line, despite every conceivable odd stacked against its main opponent, you’d say very. And you’d be spot on.
In an indication of how much the PML-N will be relying on one institutional leadership’s generous assistance in the hope of mid- to longer-term political survival and relevance is that the part now notified will remain in place for nearly two years beyond the next general election.
Another strong marker of how the hybrid system would stay in place came in the form of the recent acrimonious arguments between the jailed opposition leader and his tormentors where the language of the exchange descended into wholly unnecessary invective.

 

He may be the most popular politician in the country but must take the blame for framing his discourse in the coarsest of words and language, leading others to mimic him. This language pushes further and further any possibility of a national reconciliation and also pushes his adversaries closer together into one corner.
All else is irrelevant. Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who successfully and even heroically transitioned from being the proud protégé of a military ruler to a leader committed to upholding the principle of civilian supremacy seems also to have had a reality check.
He occasionally speaks to assert that he remains wedded to his beliefs but, having played a long innings that included dramatic comebacks, now seems reconciled to taking the backseat and tempering his rhetoric in the light of the ground reality for the sake of his chosen political successor-daughter’s political career.
His younger brother, the prime minister, seems content with the role of a globetrotter, flying to different destinations in the Gulf, Central Asia and further afield to shake hands and embrace various leaders and sign MoUs which our hapless nation must earnestly wish materialise one day soon in the concrete shape of FDI so their lives are bettered.
Against this backdrop and the taming of the judiciary via two consecutive constitutional amendments, one struggles to see what discord could have delayed the notification. A cynical friend suggested the likely cause of the delay was not discussed in the media. Incompetence.
He says with the ‘smooth’ passage of the 27th Amendment by a compliant parliament everyone whose job it was to ensure the notification was written up and ready from the ministries of law and defence to the JAG branch may have slipped into a smug slumber.
And suddenly awake when the notification, or more appropriately the delay in its being made pu­­blic, became an issue. “This is how close crisis-pro­­ne Pakistan always remains to its default sta­te,” he added. With social media platforming the wildest theories, even the more or less neutered electronic media could not contain itself and jum­ped in. And the storm raged. Then the bubble burst.
Enough about that. The current set-up may have ensured its longevity for the foreseeable future, but the question is whether it has what it takes to deliver. The country is facing challenges on every front. Whether the terrorism gripping large parts of two of the four provinces is a blowback of years of failed, even suicidal, state policies or foreign-fu­nded and instigated, it is asking blunt questions of those responsible for the security of the country.
And promises of economic growth, when the population is growing at a faster rate than the economy, also sound no more than empty words. The MoUs being signed every other day — provincial autonomy being eroded to facilitate foreign firms’ interest in our mineral resources (‘rare earth’ is the term in vogue) — have not seen too many dollars flooding in.
Even the trickle that is there is unlikely to change the lives of those who are the true owners of that wealth. Another assault on the constitutionally agreed provincial financial resources share seems underway with little concern about the consequences.
Now that the notification crisis is over, all of the above warrant serious thought if the real issues have to be addressed. It is our collective duty. If the word ‘patriotic’ was not so politicised and loaded, I’d say patriotic duty. But is anyone willing to go beyond the rhetoric to do their real duty?

Published in Dawn, December 7th, 2025</p><small>2025-12-07 04:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/6934c6d3a11a1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959657/new-internal-security-order' target='_blank'><strong>New internal security order</strong></a><br><p>THE Balochistan government’s decision to abolish the Levies force was part of a broader state strategy to “harmonise” internal security institutions in response to critical national security challenges. On similar grounds, a federal constabulary was established.
This restructuring process has been ongoing on federal and provincial levels, driven by the growing difficulty faced by premier security institutions in countering ‘foreign-influenced threats’, terrorism, and violent extremism.
What this process actually means for the future of law-enforcement agencies (LEAs) in Pakistan remains an open and pressing question. Will the centralisation and standardisation of security structures lead to more capable, accountable, and coordinated institutions, or will they further complicate the landscape of security governance? This is a question that will matter significantly in the coming years.
A few former police officers and security experts view this harmonisation process as occurring in parallel with global trends toward modernising security institutions, enhancing investigative capacity, strengthening responses to organised crime, and adopting new technologies.

 

Yet, Pakistan’s context remains burdened by deep structural problems, the police culture of moral policing, extortionist practices, and low public trust. These dynamics complicate any attempt at reform, raising concerns about whether organisational restructuring alone can transform entrenched attitudes and practices.
In this context, when state institutions burden LEAs with national security-related tasks, particularly those related to terrorism, violent extremism, and so-called foreign-influenced threats, the logic of security governance becomes more complex.
The term ‘foreign-influenced threats’ is vague, yet many among the security institutions increasingly interpret it through the lens of rising political mobilisation by movements such as the Baloch Yakjehti Committee in Balochistan, the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement in KP, and the Joint Action Committees (JACs) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB). These movements are often framed by security actors as being funded or influenced by foreign forces, including diaspora networks, and therefore as presenting risks to national security.
Political analysts and movement leaders reject this framing, arguing that the state’s anxieties are instead rooted in fears of popular uprisings similar to those witnessed in Bangladesh and Nepal.
Although Gen Z-led movements are gaining momentum globally, the uprisings in Bangladesh and Nepal were interpreted by segments of South Asian power elites as externally engineered, including by the US and Pakistan. Regardless of the accuracy of such interpretations, these narratives have contributed to shaping Pakistan’s internal security architecture.

Will centralisation and standardisation of security structures lead to more capable institutions?

For example, when the federal government an­­n­­ounced the transformation of the Frontier Con­stabulary into a ‘nationwide federal force’, its int­e­nded mandate included operating across all provinces, Islamabad, AJK, and GB. One explanation for this expansive jurisdiction is the state’s perception that local police forces in AJK and GB have been unable to contain the JAC protests, neces­­­sitating a more centralised coercive capacity.
This harmonisation process was formalised with the establishment of the National Intelligence Fusion and Threat Assessment Centre under the National Counter Terrorism Authority. The creation of Niftac was described as a step towards realising Nacta’s original objectives. In practice, however, Niftac has eclipsed Nacta, undermining its status and institutional relevance, despite expanding its footprint across all provinces. The irony is that a wing of Nacta has become so large that it has effectively subsumed the parent organisation.
If state institutions had wished to establish Niftac as an independent body, they could have done so and subsequently merged it with Nacta.
But Nacta was created through an act of parliament, meaning that any restructuring would have required legislative amendment and public debate. The more expedient strategy, therefore, was to create Niftac as a ‘wing’ of Nacta — while granting it a mandate that far exceeded that of the original authority.
Another development is the government’s plan to establish a National Cybersecurity Authority under the Cybersecurity Act, 2025, recognising that cybersecurity has become an integral component of the internal security domain.
The merger of the Levies into the police in Balochistan has raised significant questions, as competing narratives continue to shape the debate.
Critics argue that the Levies, despite limited resources and personnel, have historically performed better than the police across a vast and difficult terrain. They point to home department data showing that crime rates in Levies-administered areas are lower than in police-administered zones. This performance gap is particularly striking given the disparity in force size: the Levies operate with roughly 28,000 personnel, whereas the police have more than 42,000.
Most political parties in Balochistan have therefore rejected the merger, insisting that effective local security structures should not be dismantled merely for administrative uniformity. They also fear that the decision is driven less by performance considerations and more by the state’s anxieties over a rising insurgency and its desire to centralise coercive authority.
As mentioned, the purpose of harmonising the internal security infrastructure appears to be countering terrorism and violent extremism-related threats. Beyond that, it is increasingly aimed at addressing broader national security risks, including espionage, identifying actors linked to foreign influences, whether political, regional, or otherwise, and responding to activities deemed harmful to national security.
However, significant grey areas exist within this domain. Under such an expansive framework, any political or social movement can easily be labelled as ‘foreign-influenced’ rather than a legitimate, locally supported mobilisation.
This appro­ach extends across both kinetic and non-kinetic domains, yet what remains missing is recognition that many of these responsibilities traditionally fall within the core mandate of LEAs, particularly the police, whose primary functions are crime prevention and ensuring public safety and security.
The irony is that LEAs, especially the police, have drifted far from their foundational roles. Their increasing focus on moral policing and coercive enforcement has become more regressive, extra-constitutional, and marred by institutional corruption that continues to deepen.
The police have neither developed the capability to understand nor the capacity to implement their functions under evolving security paradigms. In the process, they have forgotten their core public-service mission.
While the roots of moral policing lie in the colonial era, its contemporary manifestation is influenced not only by state practices but also by the growing pressure of religiously motivated violent groups within society.

Hostilities began late on Friday, with officials saying the Afghan side had resorted to “unprovoked firing”. The Afghan Taliban, meanwhile, accuse Pakistan of instigating the hostilities at Spin Boldak.
Though the exchange ended, it illustrates that without a permanent mechanism between both sides, flare-ups can occur at any time, with the potential of evolving into larger confrontations. Kabul had also accused Pakistan of conducting strikes in November — an accusation the government has denied. A ceasefire was signed in October following mediation by Qatar and Turkiye after heavy fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan.
Perhaps one of the reasons that limited outbreaks of violence continue is that the negotiation process appears to be stalled. Turkish negotiators were due to arrive in Islamabad, but the visit has not materialised. As per the Foreign Office, “perhaps a lack of cooperation” from the Taliban is behind the delay. Pakistani and Afghan officials also met recently in Riyadh, but that process also seems to have stalled without producing any results. However, friendly states should continue their mediation efforts, and both Islamabad and Kabul should participate fully in these endeavours in order to arrive at a peaceful solution to the bilateral impasse. The alternative — continued hostilities — is in neither country’s interest.
Yet the key sticking point remains the Taliban’s refusal to act against terrorists based on Afghan soil, and in particular not attempting to stop them from conducting cross-border attacks. Pakistan has long been a victim of terrorist groups such as the TTP and BLA based in Afghanistan. But as recent events have shown, the security of other regional states has also come under threat due to the lax policies of the Afghan Taliban towards terrorist groups active in their country.

 

For example, a number of Chinese workers were killed in Tajikistan last month in attacks that originated from Afghanistan. Dushanbe has condemned the “illegal and provocative actions of Afghan citizens”. As this paper has previously argued, Pakistan, along with Afghanistan’s other neighbours, needs to communicate in unambiguous terms the need for the Afghan Taliban to clamp down on cross-border terrorism. If left unattended, the problem will grow, adding to insecurity across the entire region.
For Pakistan, along with continuing the process of mediation facilitated by friendly states, there is also a need to remain vigilant at the border. Yet Islamabad’s decision to allow UN humanitarian supplies into Afghanistan needs to be welcomed. As the FO spokesperson noted, Pakistan intends no harm to the Afghan people. Therefore, while remaining firm on its demand for Kabul to end cross-border terrorism, Pakistan should continue to facilitate humanitarian and people-to-people exchanges with Afghanistan.

Dawn talked to a number of veteran parliamentarians, constitutional experts and parliamentary reporters over the issue and found them almost unanimous in demanding that National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani should immediately recognise the democratic right of the opposition members by appointing their nominated persons as the opposition leaders in both houses of parliament.
The two key parliamentary offices have been lying vacant since August after the disqualification of Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with their conviction in the May 9 cases.
The PTI then nominated Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas for the opposition leader slots in the National Assembly and Senate, respectively.

Experts, lawmakers say this may erode parliament’s credibility, undermine democratic framework

During a recent session of the National Assembly, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, while responding to the opposition’s protest over the delay, declared the issue “sub judice”. He was apparently referring to the petitions filed by Omar Ayub and Shibli Faraz in the courts, challenging their disqualifications.
“In my opinion, there is no legal justification for delaying the declaration of the leaders of the opposition in the National Assembly and the Senate,” said Pakistan Institute of Legislative Development and Transparency (Pildat) President Ahmed Bilal Mehboob. He said the rules of business of the National Assembly did not provide for any timeframe for the declaration of the opposition leader, but the sense of Rule 39 was that the office should be filled on a priority basis.
Similarly, Mudassir Rizvi of the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) said the delay was eroding parliament’s credibility and would set a wrong precedent. He said future parliaments would struggle to restore their prestige due to this action. It may be noted a number of PTI lawmakers last year were abducted from parliament after they took shelter inside the building to evade arrest.

 

A number of PPP leaders, a key coalition partner of the PML-N in the Centre, also found it difficult to defend the delay.
According to PPP Secretary General Nayyar Bokhari, the rules do not provide any timeframe for the appointment of the opposition leaders as the appointments were at the discretion of the speaker and the Senate chairman. He, however, said that he personally believed that the speaker and the Senate chairman should nominate the opposition leaders as soon as possible.
Mr Bokhari, who has also served as the Senate chairman, refused to talk about the ‘sub judice’ stance taken by the speaker, stating that the NA speaker must be aware of some legal difficulties in this regard, which only he could explain in a better way.
Mr Bokhari recalled that the rules of both houses of parliament were changed after PPP’s Makhdoom Amin Fahim was not appointed as opposition leader in the 2002 National Assembly by then speaker Chaudhry Amir Hussain. Instead, he said, the speaker at that time nominated Maulana Fazlur Rehman as the opposition leader despite the fact that the Muttahida Majli-i-Amal (MMA) clearly had fewer members on the opposition benches than the Alliance for the Restoration of Democracy (ARD), mainly comprising the PPP and the PML-N.
Mr Bokhari said under the rules, now the speaker is required to seek the names of the opposition leader from the opposition members with their signatures and is bound to nominate the person having the support of the majority.
While Mr Bokhari refused to speak on the issue in categorical terms, PPP stalwart Raza Rabbani appeared to be more critical of the speaker and the Senate chairman for “unnecessarily dragging” the matter.
According to Mr Rabbani, the rules of procedure and conduct of the business in both houses are very clear and it is the duty of the custodians of both houses to fill the vacant positions of the opposition leaders without any delay.
Mr Rabbani, who had also once served as Senate chairman, however, did not agree with the notion that the absence of the opposition leader had no impact on the functions of parliament. He explained that the opposition leader had an important role in setting the agenda and business of the house.
He said the opposition leader had the privilege to get the floor whenever desired to speak on any issue. He said that according to his information, by-elections had already been held on the seats vacated by the two opposition leaders, so the two houses were complete and, therefore, he could not comprehend the “sub judice stance” taken by the speaker. He was of the view that the parliament was “incomplete” without an opposition leader.
Senior parliamentary reporter Javaidur Rahman termed the delay in the nomination of the opposition leaders a violation of the Charter of Democracy (CoD) signed by the PPP and the PML-N in May 2006. He said in the CoD, the role of the opposition leader had been enhanced and the two parties had also agreed to appoint him as the head of the powerful Public Accounts Committee of parliament.
Senior journalist M.B. Soomro, who is also president of the Parliamentary Reporters Association, regretted that it had been weeks since the opposition submitted an application to the National Assembly secretary with the signatures of 74 members to appoint Mr Achakzai as opposition leader, but the speaker had not yet initiated the process.
Mr Soomro said it seemed that some powerful circles did not want Mr Achakzai as opposition leader. He also expressed his surprise over the continued silence of political parties present in the parliament over the issue.
On the other hand, PTI leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser said even if, for the sake of argument, they agreed with the speaker’s stance that the matter was sub judice, then he should know that they had already withdrawn the petition filed by Omar Ayub. He said they had also handed over the documents in this regard to the speaker. Replying to a question, he said the speaker had not conveyed them verbally or in writing that he had some objection to Mr Achakzai’s nomination, adding that the speaker “cannot say it because it is against the Constitution”.

QUETTA: Calm returned to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border at Chaman on Saturday after heavy clashes occurred between the two sides a day earlier.
At least three civilians were injured in the clashes last night and were shifted to the district hospital in Chaman. On the Afg­han side, five people were inju­red, according to Afghan government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat.
According to officials, Afghan forces fired mortar shells on the Badani area, prompting security forces to retaliate. However, Afg­han Taliban spokesperson Zabi­hullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding.
Mosharraf Zaidi, the prime minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, confirmed the clashes.
“A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the Chaman border. An immediate, befitting [and] intense response has been given by our armed forces,” he wrote in a post on X early Saturday morning.
“Pakistan remains fully alert [and] committed to ensuring its territorial integrity [and] the safety [of] our citizens,” he added.
‘Fighting has stopped’
Chaman Deputy Commissioner Habibullah Bangulzai confirmed that fighting between Pakistani forces and the Afghan Taliban had stopped. He said that immediately after the Taliban attack, an emergency was declared at Chaman District Hospital.
However, the deputy commissioner did not comment on the human or property losses.
SSP Chaman Abdullah Cheema said all security measures had been taken and the situation was under control. Sources said a mortar shell lan­ded on a house and exploded, inj­uring a couple and their daughter.
The residents of the area said that a large number of families living in border villages were shifted to Chaman city.
“Heavy fighting started at 10pm and continued for over two hours,” an official of the local administration said. The clash comes amid stalled negotiations between Pakis­tan and Afghanistan after three rounds of talks in Istanbul could not yield any results.
Border clashes first broke out between the two nations on Oct 11. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism.
Pak-Afghan talks
Soon after the clashes on Oct 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha.
Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators from Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on Nov 6.
But on Nov 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.

The assessment, conducted as part of Fafen’s “Countering Disinformation Thr­ou­gh Information” campaign, emphasis­­es the role of proactive disclosures in str­engthening institutional transparency and curbing misinformation. A lack of official and authentic information fuels speculation, rumours, assumptions, and conjectures, all of which become major drivers of disinformation that undermi­nes institutional credibility, erodes public trust, and contributes to instability.
The assessment reviewed 190 public bodies, including 36 secretariat departments, 98 attached departments, and 56 autonomous bodies, against the proactive disclosure requirements of Section 5 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Right to Information (KPRTI) Act, 2013. The Act explicitly mandates the publication of 12 categories of information and emphasises the need for up-to-date, accessible information, including online.
Overall, autonomous bodies and secretariat departments showed the highest compliance at 64pc, while attached departments lagged behind at 50pc.
Among the secretariat departments, the Auqaf, Haj, Religious and Minority Affairs Department and the Minerals Development Department emerged as top performers, each disclosing 92pc of the required information. The Institute of Management Sciences (IMSciences), Central Prison Peshawar, and the Pesh­awar Development Authority (PDA) led among attached departments with 83pc compliance. Among autonomous bodies, the University of Agriculture, Peshawar, also recorded 92pc compliance.
However, the assessment found that nearly half of the public bodies fall below the 50pc mark. Twenty-seven Secretariat Depart­ments, seventy-three Attached Departments, and thirty Autonomous Bodies disclosed only 33-67pc of the required information. In addition, fourteen Attached Departments, two Autonomous Bodies, and one Secretariat Department disclosed merely 17-25pc.
Organisational information, such as a public body’s functions, duties, and structure, was the most widely available category, with 89pc of public bodies sharing these details. Legal frameworks governing public bodies were accessible on 84pc of the websites. Personnel information and details on public services were available on 76pc of the websites.
Significant gaps, however, persist in disclosures related to decision-making and financial transparency. Only 15pc of public bodies shared information about their decision-making processes or opportunities for public consultation.
Budget transparency was notably poor, with only 27pc publishing proposed and actual expenditures.

Addressing a groundbreaking ceremony of a mass transport system, Prime Minister Shehbaz said the recent election results in Punjab reflected the public’s trust in the PML-N leadership.
“In the next three years, the incumbent PML-N government has the mandate to serve the people,” he said, stressing that they should work tirelessly under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif.
In remarks broadcast live on national TV channels, he expressed optimism that, on the basis of hard work and the launch of development projects, the next election results across the country would be favourable for the PML-N.
“The journey towards progress and prosperity has just begun, and we will move rapidly along the path of development. In the next elections, owing to this hard work, the PML-N will achieve historic results,” he added.

Recent victory reflects people’s trust in PML-N, Shehbaz claims at groundbreaking of mass transit system project

The ceremony was attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar, federal and provincial ministers, parliamentarians, members of national and provincial assemblies, relevant authorities, and a large number of citizens.
The prime minister termed the groundbreaking of the mass transport system a major initiative to facilitate city dwellers, as well as residents of surrounding areas, calling it a key step in providing public relief. He said the project was a gift from the Punjab chief minister and would transform the entire district, providing immense relief to commuters, including students, patients, labourers, lawyers, and people from all walks of life.
He recalled Nawaz Sharif had launched development projects at a time when the country was “embroiled in slogans and politicking,” burying that style of politics. He said the former prime minister and chief minister had initiated road networks, health facilities, and numerous other economic initiatives, starting a new chapter in politics during the 1988 elections which, he remarked, continued under PML-N leadership. He said history would remember Nawaz Sharif’s achievements “in golden words”, including making Pakistan a nuclear power in 1998. Had that not been the case, he opined, the situation during the recent conflict with India in May would have been different.
Carrying forward Nawaz Sharif’s legacy, the journey of progress was advancing rapidly under the dynamic leadership of his daughter and Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz, he added.
He lauded the Punjab government’s initiatives, including the construction of a cancer hospital, the launch of metro bus services, the Clean Punjab campaign, pollution-reduction efforts, provision of housing for the homeless, assistance for flood-affected people, and the provision of missing facilities in schools.
The prime minister said that all these measures spoke for themselves and, like truth, could not be ignored even by political opponents.
CM Maryam, in her remarks, highlighted the key initiatives launched by the provincial government, saying the country had witnessed significant progress and development under the PML-N leadership. She also briefed the audience on the Gujranwala Mass Transit System project.

Police officials said unidentified individuals had planted an improvised explosive device (IED) on the track in the Nuttal area of Nasir­abad. Upon receiving information about the device, police and Frontier Corps personnel rushed to the site and cordoned off the area.
The bomb disposal squad also reached the location and safely defused the IED, Nasir­abad SSP Ghulam Sarwar Bhaou said. He added that the attackers wanted to target the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express, but timely action saved the train from a potential blast.
Trains halted in Jacobabad 
Meanwhile, the Jaffar Express arriving from Peshawar to Quetta and the Bolan Mail coming from Karachi were stopped at Jacobabad Railway Station due to security reasons.
According to railway officials, both trains were halted on Saturday at Jacobabad to ensure the safety of passengers. Authorities are assessing the situation, and services will be resumed once conditions are deemed secure.
Railway officials further stated that the Chaman Express, scheduled to run from Quetta to Chaman today (Sunday), has also been cancelled.

At the same time, market players believe it will be difficult for the State Bank to engineer a weaker rupee to boost exports, arguing that past experiences of devaluation failed to deliver a sustained increase in export volumes.
Some currency experts said the scope for further devaluation to support exports was limited, particularly as the US dollar itself has come under pressure against major global currencies.
“There is no mathematical calculation behind this expectation that the dollar may slip below Rs280 by the end of this month. It is the market sentiment and it happens at the end of the year,” said Atif Ahmed, a currency dealer in the interbank market. He believes the dollar will slip below Rs280 only for a brief period.

Experts warn against devaluation, say past episodes failed to increase exports

Other experts said dollar demand would remain steady but sentiment had improved after a $3 billion rollover from Saudi Arabia, which they expect to support the rupee.
“If anything, the risk right now is that the rupee may trade below 280 per dollar, which could destabilise export-based industries, whereas a mild depreciation would be the right way forward,” said Faisal Mamsa, CEO of Tresmark.
During the current fiscal year, the rupee has appreciated gradually, with more noticeable gains since July 31, when the dollar hit its peak for the year. On July 31, the dollar was traded at Rs284.27, compared to Rs280.42 on the last trading day of the outgoing week.

 

One dealer noted that the US dollar has already lost about 12 per cent against major international currencies, arguing that the rupee had effectively helped the dollar remain relatively strong and stable in the local market.
Exports, however, have been declining. They fell 15.4pc in November, swelling the trade deficit for the first five months of FY26 to $37.2bn and putting pressure on the current account.
The market has been rife with speculation that the government is under pressure to devalue the rupee to support exporters, but the currency’s gradual appreciation has dismissed such perceptions.
“Yes, the calls for a weaker rupee have grown louder. You hear the usual arguments: global demand is soft, INR (the Indian rupee) drifting towards 90 per dollar, exporters cannot price orders due to high costs, and a correction will magically ‘fix competitiveness’,” Mr Mamsa said.
The rupee had collapsed from 180 to 300 against the dollar in just two years — one of the sharpest devaluations in the region. But there was no meaningful export boom, no import compression beyond what the SBP manually enforced and no structural improvement.
“A few publications this week are again glorifying REER (Real Effective Exchange Rate) and implying that a weaker rupee is somehow ‘necessary’. It’s a familiar narrative: REER goes above 100, currency is ‘overvalued’, therefore devalue it. It’s an incomplete way to look at a modern FX (foreign exchange) market,” Mr Mamsa said.
Currency experts also pointed out that the IMF has not treated REER as a primary barometer for the exchange rate since 2018, but exporters continue to exert political pressure for devaluation to shore up margins.

Australia’s Foreign Minister Penny Wong said the officials were involved “in the oppression of women and girls and in undermining good governance or the rule of law” in Afghanistan.
Australia was one of several nations which pulled troops out of Afghanistan in Aug 2021, after being part of a Nato-led international force that trained Afghan security forces and fought the Taliban for two decades after Western-backed forces ousted them from power in 2001.
The Taliban, since regaining power in Afghanistan, have been criticised for deeply restricting the rights and freedom of women and girls through bans on education and work.
The Taliban government says it respects women’s rights, in line with its interpretation of Islamic law and local custom.
Wong, the Australian foreign minister, said in a statement the sanctions targeted three Taliban ministers and the chief justice, accusing them of restricting access for girls and women “to education, employment, freedom of movement and the ability to participate in public life”.
The measures were part of a new Australian government framework that enabled it to “directly impose its own sanctions and travel bans to increase pressure on the Taliban, targeting the oppression of the Afghan people”, Wong said.
Australia took in thousands of evacuees, mostly women and children, from Afghanistan after the Taliban retook power in the country, where much of the population now relies on humanitarian aid to survive.

The acting US ambassador, who called on the interior minister, offered her country’s full technical assistance for counter-narcotics operations and efforts to curb illegal immigration.
The meeting also focused on strengthening collaboration in intelligence sharing.
Speaking on the occasion, Mr Naqvi said that Pakistan had a clear and firm policy regarding illegal immigration.
He added said the identification of drug trafficking cases at airports remained a top priority.
“State-of-the-art scanning machines are being installed at all major airports across the country.”
The minister reaffirmed that the country was strictly implementing a zero-tolerance policy against narcotics.
“Even today, drugs originating from Afghanistan are reaching dozens of countries and destroying young generations,” he noted, adding that US technical support to bolster Pakistan’s counter-narcotics capabilities would be welcomed.
On the prime minister’s directive, the National Narcotics Coordination Centre would be set up soon, the interior minister informed the envoy.
ANF performance
During the meeting, a detailed briefing was given on the Anti-Narcotics Force’s (ANF) performance and ongoing operations across the country.
It was shared that under the annual counter-narcotics campaign, 134 tonnes of narcotics were seized, 2,001 suspects — including 75 foreign nationals — were arrested, and drugs worth $12.797 billion were confiscated.
It was further informed that in Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Sindh, 110 Afghan nationals were arrested and 40,659 acres of land were cleared to maintain a “poppy-free status”.

 

Ms Baker appreciated the performance of the ANF and said that the United States placed special importance on its relations with Pakistan and would continue cooperation in all areas.
The interior minister said Pakistan-US relations were vital for promoting peace and stability in the region, and that Islamabad was committed to further strengthening their long-standing bilateral ties.
The meeting was attended by the interior secretary, the ANF director general, its director enforcement, representatives of the US embassy, and other officials.

Judicial Magistrate Mohammad Abbas Shah issued a written order declaring all three accused as absconders and directed the issuance of permanent arrest warrants. 
The order states that the accused were repeatedly summoned but failed to appear before the court.
According to the written order, the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) has completed and submitted challans in the respective cases. The FIRs against the three were registered in July and August 2025 under relevant cybercrime and related offences.
The court has instructed that the permanent arrest warrants be executed in accordance with the law to ensure the accused are brought before the court to face trial.

Exits and downsizing reflect rising costs and policy uncertainty. While the growing use of digital and asset-digital models points to new ways to stay competitive, says the report ‘Diagnosis of Multinational Exits from Pakistan’.
According to the report, MNCs face both opportunities and challenges. The country’s large market and strategic location offer strong growth potential, but rising costs, unpredictable regulations, and weak infrastructure make operations difficult. These domestic issues, along with global business shifts, are pushing many MNCs to restructure, scale down, or even exit the market, it says.
Restrictions on foreign exchange and delays in profit repatriation have historically deterred foreign investors. Profit repatriation declined sharply from $1.7 billion in FY21 to $273m in FY23, limiting reinvestment potential. However, FY24 witnessed a remarkable recovery to $2.215bn, followed by $2.1bn in FY25, reflecting improved profitability in select sectors and strategic capital adjustments.

MNCs’ exit signal rising costs, policy uncertainty

Lengthy processes for permits, tax clearances, and customs approvals remain a persistent barrier. While reforms have aimed to streamline investment procedures, bureaucratic inefficiencies continue to slow operations and increase compliance costs.
High electricity tariffs, inconsistent supply, and outdated logistics networks elevate production and transport costs. Export-oriented firms face additional port delays and limited road and rail connectivity, which affect delivery timelines and competitiveness in international markets.
Despite targeted strategies, Pakistan is still perceived as a high-risk but high-potential market. Many MNCs adopt a “selective presence” approach, retaining profitable business segments, outsourcing non-core operations, or forming local partnerships instead of a complete exit. Investor confidence is shaped not only by macroeconomic trends but also by the clarity, predictability, and ease of doing business in the country.
Multinational companies in Pakistan operate in a landscape marked by both promise and challenge. While global market dynamics influence investment strategies, it is the domestic environment, rising costs, inflation, regulatory uncertainty, infrastructure gaps, and competitive pressures that largely determine operational choices.
High taxation, fluctuating energy costs, and administrative bottlenecks weigh heavily on profitability, compelling MNCs to rethink business models. Simultaneously, evolving consumer preferences and digitalisation pressures drive innovation and strategic adaptation. The significant rebound in repatriated profits in fiscal year 2024, sustained into fiscal year 2025, highlights both the resilience of MNCs and the opportunities in sectors that adapt effectively to these challenges.
Pakistan remains a dynamic and evolving market that continues to attract global attention, even as some MNCs restructure or adjust their operations in the country. Despite some operational downsizing, Pakistan continues to attract foreign investment across automotive, energy, finance, IT, e-commerce, and mining sectors.

The PAK-KOREA Tes­ting Laboratory for PV Modules and Allied Equipment lab was established jointly by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) and the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA).
The laboratory has been developed through a $9.5 million grant-aid project from KOICA, alongside a local Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) contribution of Rs185.8m. 
The lab will become operational after achieving accreditation to ISO-17025 standards, including IEC-61215 and IEC-61730. 
The Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA), an allied department of MoST, has already initiated the process to include solar panels in its list of mandatory items.
The PSQCA will conduct random testing of samples from each imported consignment through the new testing lab to ensure quality control of solar panels in the country.
KOICA constructed the laboratory and provided, installed, and commissioned all required equipment for solar panel testing. It also conducted a nine-month training programme to ensure smooth operation during and after project completion.
The PSQCA aims to achieve Certification Body Testing Laboratory (CBTL) status, enabling the lab to issue IEC compliance certificates. It will facilitate local PV panel manufacturers in exporting their products to Europe and Central Asia.
KOICA President Chang Won Sam and the Republic of Korea Ambassador Park Jae-Lark inaugurated the lab on Saturday. 
Mr Sam highlighted that sustainable, reliable energy is vital to Pakistan’s future.
“Country’s abundant sunshine offers a tremendous opportunity in solar e­­nergy, and I firmly bel­i­­e­­ve Pakistan is well-positio­ned to accelerate its transition toward clean and green energy.” He added that Korea aims to support Pakistan in strengthening its capacity to test and certify solar PV modules in accordance with international standards.
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1983, Korea and Pakistan have continuously streng­thened their partnership and expanded cooperation, he said. 
Dr Jaesang Park, pro­­ject manager at KOICA, expressed confidence that the testing lab will significantly contribute to Pakistan’s solar industry.

The message, recounted by five sources familiar with the discussion, including a US official, was conveyed at a meeting in Washington this week of Pentagon staff overseeing Nato policy and several European delegations.
The shifting of this burden from the US to European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation would dramatically change how the US, a founding member of the post-war alliance, works with its most important military partners.
In the meeting, Pentagon officials indicated that Washington was not yet satisfied with the strides Europe has made to boost its defence capabilities since Russia’s expanded invasion of Ukraine in 2022.
The US officials told their counterparts that if Europe does not meet the 2027 deadline, the US may stop participating in some Nato defence coordination mechanisms, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private conversations.
Some officials on Capitol Hill are aware of and concerned about the Pentagon’s message to the Europeans, one US official said.
No clarity on how US would measure Nato’s progress
Conventional defence capabilities include non-nuclear assets from troops to weapons and the officials did not explain how the US would measure Europe’s progress toward shouldering most of the burden.
It was also not clear if the 2027 deadline represented the Trump administration’s position or only the views of some Pentagon officials. There are significant disagreements in Washington over the military role the US should play in Europe.
Several European officials said that a 2027 deadline was not realistic, no matter how Washington measures progress, since Europe needs more than money and political will to replace certain US capabilities in the short term.
Among other challenges, Nato allies face production backlogs for military equipment they are trying to purchase. While US officials have encouraged Europe to buy more US-made materiel, some of the most prized US-made weapons and defence systems would take years to be delivered if ordered today.
The US also contributes capabilities that cannot simply be purchased, including unique intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance that have proven key to the Ukrainian war effort.
Asked for comment, a Nato official speaking for the alliance said European allies had begun taking more responsibility for the continent’s security, but did not comment on the 2027 deadline.
“Allies have recognised the need to invest more in defence and shift the burden on conventional defence” from the US to Europe, the official said.
The White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said: “We’ve been very clear in the need for Europeans to lead in the conventional defence of Europe. We are committed to working through Nato coordination mechanisms to strengthen the alliance and ensure its long-term viability as European allies increasingly take on responsibility for conventional deterrence and defence in Europe.”
European nations have broadly accepted US President Donald Trump’s demand that they take more responsibility for their own security and have pledged big increases in defence spending.
The European Union has set a target of making the continent ready to defend itself by 2030 and says it must fill gaps in its air defences, drones, cyber warfare capabilities, munitions and other areas. Officials and analysts said even that deadline is highly ambitious.
Washington-Nato relationship runs hot and cold
The Trump administration has consistently argued that European allies need to contribute more to the Nato alliance, but it’s not always clear where the president stands on Nato.

 

On the campaign trail in 2024, Trump frequently bashed European allies, and he said he would encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to invade Nato countries that did not spend their fair share on defence. But at the annual Nato leaders’ summit in June, Trump effusively praised European leaders for agreeing to a US plan to boost the annual defence spending target for member states to five per cent of gross domestic product.
In the months since, Trump has vacillated between a harder line on Russia — the bloc’s main opponent — and, more recently, a willingness to negotiate with Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. European officials have complained that they were largely cut out of those negotiations.
At a meeting of Nato foreign ministers this week, US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau said it was “obvious” Nato allies should take responsibility for Europe’s defence.
“Successive US administrations have been saying this in one form or another pretty much my whole life … but our administration means what it says,” Landau wrote on X.

In a blistering press conference on Friday, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry assailed Imran for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
Responding to the DG ISPR’s accusations in a press conference today at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said: “Do not drive away the people of Pakistan, they stand with Imran Khan and the PTI. Imran Khan is not a national security threat. He has kept the people united.”







Raja said there were many narratives in the country, including along ethnic and sectarian lines, yet Imran had rejected all of them to stand with the narrative of Pakistan, along with PTI’s supporters and voters.
“For God’s sake, don’t do this. You will not be able to minus Imran Khan, but God forbid if you do, it will be very difficult to keep this country’s interests united. If you attack KP and remove its elected government to install an unelected setup, then you yourselves will be responsible for the conditions that follow.”
Raja termed the DG ISPR’s press conference “unfortunate” and added that the party will not answer the accusation and charges levelled against the PTI founder.







“Today we are being told that the country’s most popular leader is a national security threat, which is ridiculous, but this has not been said for the first time.”
Referring to the establishment’s manoeuvring against former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in the 1990s, Raja said: “The institutions decided again and again that any popular leader of the people is a national security threat and it is necessary to remove them from the scene, but this did not happen. You cannot remove them from the hearts of the people through your decisions. The nation has always been aware and there is a reason it is standing behind Imran Khan. We are not mad, we know who has always been in control in this country.”
Raja elaborated that he wanted to set the context for everyone, noting that there have been countless times in the country’s history when it was pushed from democracy toward force and authoritarianism.
Referring to previous military dictatorships in the country, he said prosperity was always promised, and yet, they all ultimately failed.
The general secretary of the party said it was claimed multiple times during the past that democracy, law and the Constitution does not suit the country, and needs a stick, but the “ruler always left it weaker than before”.
Raja lamented that the party was frequently criticised as a ragtag group without understanding of affairs and what heights the country was being taken towards.
However, the PTI secretary general questioned whether the country needed to be forcibly developed through the use of power, noting that if this were the case, it would have already happened during previous periods of military rule.
Raja said there was a need for a “grand dialogue”, given the country’s current situation, and that the nation needed to be involved lest the past repeat itself.
“There will be no change, and we will go backwards.”
Referring to the constitutional amendments and the subjugation of the judiciary, he said the development was not even comparable to anything under previous eras of military rule.
Slamming censorship in the country, the senior PTI leader said that anyone speaking freely could be subject to the Peca law, inquiries, and more, referring to the trial proceedings of husband-and-wife lawyer duo Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chattha.
Raja said the PTI was ready to talk, but the people of KP and their chief minister should never be mocked or denigrated.
“Don’t put the future of the country or KP at stake in this battle of narratives. This is a very sensitive area, take the people along in the conditions that are there at the moment and the state of terrorism. The PTI is the biggest force in the country that can take it towards betterment.”
The PTI secretary general also seemingly criticised the party’s social media wing and supporters, who he said called the party out to respond or answer why it was not taking action. “We are sitting because the country is dear to us and we don’t want discord in the country,” Raja added.
He said the party and Imran would take every step required for the benefit of the country.
“It is very easy to respond to the brick with a stone but we will not do it because the country’s benefit is not in this.”
Former National Assembly speaker and PTI MNA Asad Qaiser also voiced a complaint with the DG ISPR’s remarks.
“There is great anger and heightened emotions in our province. Your words should have been appropriate. We think such words should be desisted from and will also demand that they are retracted because a whole society and province think it has been disrespected.”
Barrister Gohar calls for easing of ‘tone’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali criticised the DG ISPR’s remarks, calling them “inappropriate and wrong” and saying it was “unfortunate for democracy” that a senior officer would use such language against a major political party, its leadership, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister.







Gohar said that “there is an enemy of ours” who would be pleased by press conferences against each other, adding that this was why he had earlier said today’s would not be a confrontational press conference.
PTI Chairman said the party wanted to clarify that “some people are trying to incite fighting between the workers of a major party and members of a major institution”.
Gohar said such incidents should never occur, warning that “the beginning of any great destruction is always due to a few inappropriate words”. He added that ego must be set aside, space given to one another, and efforts made to move in a positive direction.
The PTI leader said there was still time for “tone to be eased” and for steps to improve the current situation. He called for Tuesday’s meeting with Imran to be allowed without restriction and urged that no politics be made over the ex-premier’s meetings with his sisters.
He maintained that the country deserved to prosper and grow, but if the current tense atmosphere and attitude continued, “then it won’t be minus-one, but minus-everyone, which should not happen”.
At the start of the press conference, Gohar welcomed everyone to what he said would be an “unusual” press briefing in response to the military spokesperson’s remarks against the PTI founder, saying it would have a “different tone”.
“We are not going to do a confrontational press conference or to respond to a brick with a stone, but it is very important to tell some facts to the people as charges have been levelled at us.”
He claimed that the PTI was the country’s largest political party and its leader was Imran, with the support of 70 per cent of the nation.
“It is necessary to tell the people what has happened to us in the recent past. From 180 seats, we were reduced to 91 seats, and now we are left with 76. Reserved seats were taken and there was violence against women and children. The injustices against us are a tale of their own.”
Barrister Gohar said the party had continued to endure in order to uphold democracy, adding that the PTI’s stance was rooted in democracy, peace and the rule of law, and that Imran Khan had always maintained that both Pakistan and its army belong to the people.
The PTI chairman said that despite going through a rough patch during the last year, it stood with the nation and the military and lauded their role.
The PTI chairman added that despite everything that happened with the passage of the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments, the party had hoped the situation might improve, but yesterday’s press conference was “deeply disappointing”.
Referring to Imran’s pending cases and delayed proceedings, he said the party began with a position of calling for his release and was now reduced to asking for meetings to be permitted with the PTI founder.
“All that we endured was for the sake of democracy and the country, but we say, if such conditions continue and such treatment with each other continues, then democracy will be the one to face the biggest loss.”</p><small>2025-12-06 17:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/061215276378c48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959542/14-terrorists-killed-in-kp-balochistan-intelligence-based-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>14 terrorists killed in KP, Balochistan intelligence-based operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday that 14 terrorists were killed in three separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan..
In a statement, the military’s media wing said nine khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij were killed on Friday.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It said an IBO was conducted in Tank on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement read.
In a separate IBO conducted in Lakki Marwat, “two more khawarij were effectively neutralised by security forces”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area,” the statement said.
Later in the day, the ISPR said security forces conducted an IBO in Balochistan’s Dera Bugti district and killed five terrorists belonging to the Fitna al Hindustan. The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists in all three instances.
According to the military’s media wing, the eliminated terrorists “remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces, law enforcement agencies and target killing of innocent civilians”.
It added that a counter-terrorism campaign under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam would continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of “foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the operations. According to a statement posted by state broadcaster PTV on X, he said that security forces were making big gains against terrorism under Azm-i-Istehkam.
“The nation stands with security forces against terrorism. We are determined to root out terrorism from the country,” he said.







President Asif Ali Zardari commended the “courage and timely action” of the security forces in “thwarting the heinous intentions of the terrorists,” PTV reported.
He stressed that “the nation’s resolve to eliminate terrorists will continue to stay intact until the menace is rooted out”.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also lauded the efforts of the security forces, stating that “security forces neutralised the militants with remarkable efficiency,” the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
He also praised their professionalism, courage, and the swift action taken. He noted that the “timely operations thwarted major threats and demonstrated the exceptional skill and commitment of Pakistan’s security personnel”.
“The nation takes pride in the bravery and professionalism of its soldiers,” he was quoted as saying. “Security forces remain fully determined to restore and maintain lasting peace in KP,” the minister added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Earlier this week, security forces killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district.</p><small>2025-12-06 14:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/06161431975f13f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959554/woman-daughter-stabbed-to-death-over-honour-in-karachis-gizri' target='_blank'><strong>Woman, daughter stabbed to death over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Gizri</strong></a><br><p>A woman and her teenage daughter were stabbed to death over “honour” in the Gizri area of Karachi on Friday night, police said.
Police said Kulsoom, 43, and her daughter Maryam, 11, were stabbed and killed by her husband, Samiullah. South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza said the double murder appeared to be an “honour” killing.
The suspect was arrested, and the knife used in the double homicide was also recovered and seized.
Police registered a case against the suspect on the complaint of the victim’s brother Faisal Khan.
Raza said the suspect stabbed and injured his wife and daughter in their home located near Noorani Masjid. The victims were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where they were pronounced dead.
DIG Raza said the suspect had “confessed” to the crime. He said the initial probe showed that the suspect was arrested around two and a half months ago in another case and was released on bail around three days ago.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
Man shot dead, other hurt
A man was shot dead while another was wounded in Lyari on Friday.
Chakiwara SHO Sajid Dharejo said two men were shot at and wounded in Bihar Colony. They were taken to the trauma centre of Civil Hospital Karachi, where Ahmed Wali, 40, expired during treatment, while Kamran Husain, 28, was admitted for treatment. He sustained a bullet wound on his leg, and his condition was out of danger.
The police suspected a personal enmity behind the incident.
However, Dharejo said the police would register a First Information Report (FIR) of the incident once the relatives approach it, to initiate formal proceedings and ascertain the motive and identity of the killers.</p><small>2025-12-06 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/06183004d610e1d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959570/victims-families-pardon-ihc-judges-son-in-hit-and-run-case' target='_blank'><strong>Victims’ families pardon IHC judge’s son in hit-and-run case</strong></a><br><p>A judicial magistrate on Saturday ordered the release on bail of the son of Islamabad High Court (IHC) Justice Mohammed Asif, after the victims’ families forgave him in the fatal accident case that claimed the lives of two young women.
The tragic incident occurred late at night on Monday near the Pakistan National Council of Arts in Islamabad when a black speeding sports utility vehicle (SUV) allegedly driven by Abuzar struck two girls who worked part-time for an event management company. The victims were travelling on a scooter when the speeding vehicle hit them, killing both on the spot due to severe injuries.
The accused, Abuzar, was remanded into police custody on Tuesday in the case.
He was produced before Judicial Magistrate Shaista Kundi upon completion of his four-day physical remand today. During the proceedings, the court recorded statements of the victims’ families.
The brother of one victim appeared in person, while her mother submitted her statement online. The father of the other girl also confirmed before the court that he had pardoned the accused.
After the statements were recorded, the court accepted the accused’s bail and ordered his immediate release.
According to the First Information Report (FIR) registered at the Secretariat Police Station on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Muhammad Asghar, the vehicle fled immediately after the collision.
Police traced the SUV through its registration number and located the suspect at a private hospital where he had reportedly gone for medical treatment. He was taken into custody, medical and forensic samples were collected, and the vehicle was impounded for examination.
On Tuesday, Judicial Magistrate Kundi had initially granted police physical remand of the accused after investigators requested more time to verify the medical report, conduct a vehicle inspection, and record eyewitness statements.
Sections 322 (manslaughter), 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way) and 427 (mischief causing damage) of the Pakistan Penal Code were invoked in the case.
With both families pardoning the accused before the court, the magistrate granted bail and directed that Abuzar be released.
In Islamabad in 2022, an SUV allegedly driven by the daughter of a Lahore High Court (LHC) judge ran over two persons near the Sohan bridge on the Expressway and the investigation into the case had remained stalled.
As per the details available in the judicial record, on June 8, Shakeel Tanoli and his colleague, Hasnain Ali, were going home at midnight when they were hit by an SUV allegedly driven by a woman.
In July, 2024, Inspector General of Islamabad Police Ali Nasir Rizvi informed the IHC that the vehicle involved in the hit and run case was driven by a woman and was in the use of Supreme Court Justice Malik Shahzad Ahmed.
In February this year, a local court in Islamabad acquitted Shanzay Malik, the daughter of the Supreme Court judge. The verdict was announced by Judicial Magistrate Adnan Yousuf, who accepted the acquittal application filed by Malik’s legal team.</p><small>2025-12-06 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637783-seven-year-old-dies-after-falling-into-open-manhole-in-lodhran' target='_blank'><strong>Seven-year-old dies after falling into open manhole in Lodhran</strong></a><br><p>

A chain of tropical storms and monsoonal rains has pummelled Southeast and South Asia, triggering landslides and flash floods from the Sumatran rainforest to the highland plantations of Sri Lanka.
More than 1,790 people have been killed in natural disasters unfolding across Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam over the past week.
In Indonesia’s provinces of Aceh and North Sumatra, floods have swept away roads, smothered houses in silt, and cut off supplies.
Aceh Governor Muzakir Manaf said response teams were still searching for bodies in “waist-deep” mud.

 

However, starvation was one of the gravest threats now hanging over remote and inaccessible villages.
“Many people need basic necessities. Many areas remain untouched in the remote areas of Aceh,” he told reporters.
“People are not dying from the flood, but from starvation. That’s how it is.”
Entire villages had been washed away in the rainforest-cloaked Aceh Tamiang region, Muzakir said.
“The Aceh Tamiang region is completely destroyed, from the top to the bottom, down to the roads and down to the sea.
“Many villages and sub-districts are now just names,” he said.
Aceh Tamiang flood victim Fachrul Rozi said he had spent the past week crammed into an old shop building with others who had fled the rising waters.
“We ate whatever was available, helping each other with the little supplies each resident had brought,” he told AFP.
“We slept crammed together.”
Aceh resident Munawar Liza Zainal said he felt “betrayed” by the Indonesian government, which has so far shrugged off pressure to declare a national disaster.
“This is an extraordinary disaster that must be faced with extraordinary measures,” he told AFP, echoing frustrations voiced by other flood victims.
“If national disaster status is only declared later, what’s the point?”
Declaring a national disaster would free up resources and help government agencies coordinate their response.
Analysts have suggested Indonesia could be reluctant to declare a disaster — and seek additional foreign aid — because it would show it was not up to the task.
Indonesia’s government this week insisted it could handle the fallout.
Climate calamity
The scale of devastation has only just become clear in other parts of Sumatra as engorged rivers shrink and floodwaters recede.
AFP photos showed muddy villagers salvaging silt-encrusted furniture from flooded houses in Aek Ngadol, North Sumatra.
Humanitarian groups worry that the scale of the calamity could be unprecedented, even for a nation prone to natural disasters.
Indonesia’s death toll rose to 908 today, according to the disaster management agency, with 410 people missing.
Sri Lanka’s death toll jumped on Friday to 607, as the government warned that fresh rains raised the risk of new landslides.
Thailand has reported 276 deaths and Malaysia two, while at least two people were killed in Vietnam after heavy rains triggered a series of landslides.
Seasonal monsoon rains are a feature of life in Southeast Asia, flooding rice fields and nourishing the growth of other key crops.
However, climate change is making the phenomenon more erratic, unpredictable and deadly throughout the region.
Environmentalists and Indonesia’s government have also suggested that logging and deforestation exacerbated landslides and flooding in Sumatra.</p><small>2025-12-06 12:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637777-us-offers-pakistan-support-to-curb-narcotics-illegal-cross-border-movement' target='_blank'><strong>US offers Pakistan support to curb narcotics, illegal cross-border movement</strong></a><br><p>

At least three civilians were injured in the clashes last night and were shifted to the district hospital in Chaman. On the Afghan side, five people were injured, according to Afghan government spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat.
According to officials, Afghan forces fired mortar shells on the Badani area, prompting security forces to retaliate. However, Afghan Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid claimed it was Pakistan that launched an attack on Spin Boldak, alleging that their forces were responding.
Prime Minister’s spokesperson for foreign media, Mosharraf Zaidi, however, confirmed the clashes.
In a post on X early Saturday morning, he said, “A short while ago, the Afghan Taliban regime resorted to unprovoked firing along the Chaman border. An immediate, befitting & intense response has been given by our armed forces.”
“Pakistan remains fully alert & committed to ensuring its territorial integrity & the safety [of] our citizens,” he added.
A senior official in Quetta also confirmed on the condition of anonymity that the exchange of fire started at around 10pm and continued till late at night.
The clash comes amid stalled negotiations between Pakistan and Afghanistan after three rounds of talks in Istanbul could not yield any results.
Border clashes first broke out between the two nations on October 11. Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism.
A day earlier, the spokesperson Foreign Office (FO) had reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to engage in talks with Afghanistan.
Pakistan-Afghanistan talks
Soon after the clashes on Oct 11, a temporary ceasefire was called on Oct 15, after the two sides came together to engage in dialogue in Doha.
Following the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On Oct 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on Oct 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an Oct 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
But on November 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the clashes.</p><small>2025-12-06 12:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/06161130c36f6f5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959553/qatar-pm-says-gaza-truce-incomplete-without-full-withdrawal-by-israel' target='_blank'><strong>Qatar PM says Gaza truce incomplete without ‘full withdrawal’ by Israel</strong></a><br><p>The nearly two-month-old ceasefire in the Gaza Strip will not be complete until Israeli troops withdraw from the Palestinian territory under a peace plan backed by Washington and the United Nations, mediator Qatar’s prime minister said on Saturday.
“Now we are at the critical moment … A ceasefire cannot be completed unless there is a full withdrawal of the Israeli forces, [and] there is stability back in Gaza,” Qatari premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani told the Doha Forum, an annual diplomatic conference in the Gulf state’s capital.

 

Qatar, alongside the United States and Egypt, helped secure the long-elusive truce in Gaza, which came into effect on October 10 and has mostly halted two years of fighting between Israel and Hamas.
Under a second phase of the deal, which has yet to begin, Israel is to withdraw from its positions in the territory, an interim authority is to take over governance, and an international stabilisation force (ISF) is to be deployed.
Arab and Muslim nations have been hesitant to participate in the new stabilisation force, which could end up fighting Palestinians.
Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, also speaking at the forum, said talks on the force were ongoing and critical questions remained as to its command structure and which countries would contribute.
But its first goal, Fidan said, “should be to separate Palestinians from the Israelis”.
“This should be our main objective. Then we can address the other remaining issues,” he added.
Hamas is also supposed to disarm under the 20-point plan first outlined by US President Donald Trump, with members who decommission their weapons allowed to leave Gaza. The group has repeatedly rejected the proposition.
‘Lasting solution’
Turkiye has indicated it wants to take part in the stabilisation force, but its efforts are viewed unfavourably in Israel, which considers Ankara too close to Hamas.
“I think the only viable way to finish this war is to engage faithfully and forcefully in peace talks,” Fidan said.
Sheikh Mohammed said Qatar and fellow truce guarantors Turkiye, Egypt and the US were “getting together in order to force the way forward for the next phase” of the deal.
“And this next phase is just also temporary from our perspective,” he said.
“If we are … just resolving what happened in the last two years, it’s not enough,” he continued, calling for a “lasting solution that provides justice for both people”.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty met with the Qatari prime minister on the sidelines of the forum to discuss the ceasefire, Cairo said on Saturday.
“The meeting addressed developments on the ground in the Gaza Strip, with both officials stressing the importance of continuing efforts to implement the Sharm El-Sheikh peace agreement,” the foreign ministry statement said, referring to the Red Sea resort town where the October deal was inked.
Egypt has announced plans to train 5,000 police officers for Gaza and is among the countries considered possible contributors of troops to the stabilisation force.</p><small>2025-12-06 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637760-ministers-back-ispr-dgs-fiery-presser-amid-ptis-criticism' target='_blank'><strong>'Free to respond with full force': Ministers defend ISPR DG's 'guarded' language</strong></a><br><p>

IndiGo has cancelled thousands of flights this week due to a shortage of pilots after it failed to plan adequately for new rules limiting pilots’ work hours.
The government responded on Friday, announcing special relief for the carrier and the operation of additional trains to help clear the backlog.
The Delhi airport posted on X on Saturday that flight operations were steadily resuming, but cancellations remained rife elsewhere.







‘Waiting for my luggage’
With IndiGo’s spate of cancellations, fares rose on flights operated by other airlines on popular routes. The government said it was capping fares to maintain pricing discipline, without disclosing details of the caps.
The Civil Aviation Ministry said it would “continue to closely monitor fare levels through real-time data and active coordination with airlines”.
Fares were last capped during the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.
The flight cancellations are the biggest crisis ever for 20-year-old IndiGo, which has an over 60 per cent market share in the world’s most-populous country and has prided itself on on-time performance while luring passengers with lower fares.
IndiGo acknowledges failing to plan properly for the November 1 deadline to implement the stricter rules on night flying and weekly rest for pilots.
On Friday, more than 1,000 IndiGo flights were cancelled. After the government announced the exemptions to the rules for IndiGo, the airline said it could return to normal operations between December 10 and 15.
On Saturday, IndiGo cancelled 124 flights in Bengaluru, 109 in Mumbai, 86 in New Delhi and 66 in Hyderabad, airport sources told Reuters.
The disruptions have upended weddings in India as many families and guests were stranded at airports.
Hundreds of passengers gathered outside Bengaluru and Mumbai airports on Saturday, some unaware of the cancellations, according to Reuters witnesses.
Satish Konde had to catch a connecting flight from Mumbai to the western city of Nagpur and had checked in before being told it was cancelled.
“I am waiting for my luggage to be returned,” he said.
Pilots call exemption ‘selective dispensation’
The new pilot rest and duty rules capped the number of night landings to two from six and restricted the maximum number of hours a pilot can fly in the night to 10 hours.
For now, IndiGo has been exempted from both measures until February 10.
The new rules also said that if a pilot takes a personal leave that cannot be not counted in calculating his weekly rest period of 48 hours.
That restriction too has been put on hold for all airlines, given the IndiGo crisis.
That has upset pilot labour groups, who told the government that safety must not be compromised to make up for IndiGo’s poor planning, the head of the Federation of Indian Pilots, C.S. Randhawa, told Reuters.
The Airline Pilots Association of India objected on Friday, calling the relief for IndiGo “selective dispensation”.
The norms “exist solely to safeguard human life,” the association said in a letter to the government.
Other major Indian airlines, including Air India and Akasa, have not had to cancel flights due to the new rules.</p><small>2025-12-06 10:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637746-nawaz-buried-slogan-driven-politics-with-development-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Nawaz 'buried slogan-driven politics' with development: PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

On Friday, Lt Gen Chaudhry — without once naming Imran — called the former premier “a mentally ill person”, “a narcissist” and “a security risk”, while stressing it was for the government to decide how to deal with him. He had accused him and his party of pushing a narrative designed to undermine the armed forces and destabilise the state.
In response, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali had expressed “disappointment” over the comments, stating that “PTI’s narrative has never been, nor will it ever be, anti-state”.
Speaking to the media in Sialkot, Asif recalled that Imran had used “harsh language” in the past for members of the opposition, insisting that the party had no right to object to the comments by the military’s spokesman.
“When they were in power, I remember, he (Imran) would engage in theatrics and sometimes don a dupatta to mimic leaders. He did that for Mehmood Khan Achakzai, who is with him today. He would also use derogatory language for women,” Asif said, adding that the incarcerated leader continued to do the same via statements made on his X account.
“If DG ISPR has given a reaction, I believe it is a guarded reaction,” he said.
The minister assailed the PTI for engaging in activities that were reflective of an “anti-state” narrative. He lamented that the party leadership did not “acknowledge” the sacrifices of the armed forces in the fight against terrorism.
“I have attended the funerals of many martyrs … I have never seen someone from the PTI there,” the defence minister said, urging the party to “speak in favour of martyrs and not terrorists”.
“Do not attempt to hold dialogue with terrorists or take a soft stance with them,” Asif warned, telling the PTI that “when you continue to adopt such an approach, this is exactly the kind of language that will be used against you”.
Asif was of the view that while the military’s spokesman was “still careful with his words, I, however, have the liberty to give you a hard-hitting answer”.
Referring to interviews given by Imran’s sisters to Indian media, Asif assailed the party for “engaging with the enemy”.
“How can they call themselves Pakistanis and patriots?” he questioned.
The defence minister further said that the PTI’s “sole ideology was to gain power”, alleging that they had no “allegiance to Pakistan”.
Referring to the May conflict with India, Asif pointed said, “All our neighbours expressed their sympathies on the martyrdom of our soldiers … they stood with us shoulder to shoulder during the war, but internally this one party here did not play any role in confronting the enemy.”
“The PTI leader has something to say about everything; why did he not say anything during the conflict for our soldiers and armed forces?” he asked.
“Even during times of war, they continued to criticise the armed forces leadership … how can such people now say that the DG ISPR should not have said this or that.
“He has every right to say it,” Asif emphasised.
In a warning to the party, the defence minister said: “Do your politics, hold protests, but do not threaten the sovereignty and honour of Pakistan.”
In his response to the military spokesperson’s comments yesterday, Barrister Gohar had said, “It is regrettable when state institutions and political figures label each other as mentally ill or perceive each other as threats.”
He had also reaffirmed the party’s commitment to the country in his remarks, dismissing allegations of PTI spreading an “anti-state” narrative.
“Pakistan belongs to us, and so does the army; we have demonstrated this in practice and will continue to do so.”
He had urged that the conduct of “certain non-stakeholders”, without specifying who he was referring to, should not become a cause of tension between PTI and the institutions.
Barrister Gohar had said Imran and his wife, Bushra Bibi, were incarcerated, and the overall situation would improve if permission were granted for meetings with them.
“The country cannot afford tension and chaos,” Gohar had said.</p><small>2025-12-06 10:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637738-justice-zafar-ahmed-rajput-sworn-in-as-shc-cj' target='_blank'><strong>Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput sworn in as SHC CJ</strong></a><br><p>

Justices Mansoor Ali Shah and Athar Minallah had resigned from the Supreme Court on November 13, hours after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari. Shah had assailed the amendment as “a grave assault on the Constitution of Pakistan” while Minallah said he had sworn to uphold not “a constitution” but “the Constitution”.
Meanwhile, Lahore High Court’s Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza had tendered his resignation two days later, saying: “After the 27th Amendment in the Constitution, I am not inclined as a matter of principle and in good conscience to continue as a judge.”
In a statement printed in Dawn on Saturday, 60 citizens and lawyers issued a statement saying: “We mourn presently, not at the resignations of Justices Shah, Minallah and Mirza — they have permanently etched their names on the short list of national heroes who prized principles over expediency — but at the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the high courts of Pakistan, and the entinguishment of the last embers of an independent judiciary.”
The statement included the names of lawyers Abid S. Zuberi, Jibran Nasir, Imaan Mazari, Asad Rahim, Sardar Latif Khosa, Salman Akram Raja, Zainab Janjua, Faisal Siddiqui and Salahuddin Ahmed.
Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan leader Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar was also included in the list.
The statement said that Mansoor “undisputedly ranks among the finest jurists ever produced by Pakistan”.
“He stood entirely peerless in his zeal for judicial reform and his vision to drag the creaking edifice of the Pakistan judiciary into the 21st century and transform it into an instrument for speedy justice for the common litigant,” it said.
“It is our judiciary’s and our nation’s misfortune that we have chosen to sacrifice him at the altar of short-term political expediency and the desire for personal advancement of others,” the statement said.
It went on to say that Minallah had been a consistent voice for the weak and disempowered, for the families of missing persons, for journalists muzzled by the state, for the opposition “tormented by the government of the day and for judges hounded by intelligence agencies”.
“He was one of the few judges possessed with sufficient self-awareness to be able to cast a critical eye on the judicial history of Pakistan,” it said.
“To be lauded by those on the receiving end of power and criticised by those wielding it, is a distinction for the conscientious constitutional judge,” the statement said.
It also noted his contribution to transforming the Islamabad High Court as a “citadel of judicial independence”.
Talking about Mirza, the statement said that he left behind an enduring example of a judge who “refused to let fundamental rights become casualties of turbulent times and became an anchor of constitutional steadiness”.
“In his decisiveness and integrity, he neither courted controversy nor shied away from difficult decisions,” it said.
“By choosing judicial defiance over judicial silence, he ensured that when history is written, his name will stand firmly on the side of constitutional courage as the only high court judge who resigned in protest against the pseudo 27th Constitutional Amendment,” it said.
The statement said that it was ironic that the judges were castigated by the “wielders of power, not for their own sin but for earlier sins of those whom they resisted”.
“Their fault lay in the steadfastness of their ‘no’ when others were willing to say ‘yes’,” it said.
“Their decision to preserve their constitutional oath and honour over office and privilege: to speak out instead of silently acquiescing to regression masquerading as reform; to stand instead of kneeling — is a spark to the conscience of a nation,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-12-06 09:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/061356129bdca66.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959548/adb-approves-381m-for-3-projects-concerning-agriculture-education-and-health-services-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>ADB approves $381m for 3 projects concerning agriculture, education and health services in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>The Asian Development Bank on Saturday approved three projects totalling $381 million concerning agriculture, education and health services in Punjab.
According to a press release, the development projects are aimed at fostering economic growth in the province.
“Investing in education, health, and agricultural mechanisation will play a transformative role in driving the growth of Punjab, a vital pillar of Pakistan’s economy,“ ADB Country Director for Pakistan Emma Fan was quoted as saying.
“These strategic investments will modernise agriculture, enhance human capital, and significantly improve livelihoods for millions of people across Punjab,” she said.
According to the handout, a $120m concessional loan and $4m grant have been allocated for the Punjab Climate-Resilient and Low-Carbon Agriculture Mechanisation Project to accelerate the province’s transition to modern, disaster-resilient, and low-carbon agriculture practices, benefiting 220,000 rural farm households.
“The project will help mechanise farming and provide alternative livelihoods for agricultural workers, including through boosting the knowledge and skills of 15,000 women. It will introduce a new financing model for farm mechanisation service providers to equip small-scale farmers with advanced machinery,” the ADB said.
The Bank also approved $107m for the Responsive, Ready, and Resilient Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Secondary Education in Punjab Programme.
“This includes a $7m grant from ADB’s Asian Development Fund and a $100m loan from ADB’s ordinary concessional capital resources. The results-based programme aims to modernise secondary education by enhancing inclusive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education across Punjab. The project, implemented by the Punjab School Education Department, will improve access to quality education for students across the province,” it said.
Further, the ADB approved a $150m concessional loan for the Punjab Nursing and Health Workforce Reform Programme to enhance nursing education, develop disaster-resilient training facilities, and strengthen health workforce governance in Punjab.
It noted that Pakistan faced a shortage of qualified nurses while the global demand for trained nurses was growing.
“Modernising the nursing sector will meet national and international demands. The results-based programme will focus on upgrading nursing curricula, expanding faculty development initiatives, and implementing a digital human resource management information system to align workforce planning with healthcare service needs. By expanding the pool of qualified nurses, predominantly women, the program will improve health service delivery across the province,” it said.
It said that key components of the nursing programme included the establishment of three centres of excellence in Lahore, Multan, and Rawalpindi.
“These centres will feature state-of-the-art simulation laboratories, digital learning platforms, and gender-responsive hostels, addressing Punjab’s demand for skilled healthcare workforce capable of meeting growing local needs and employment opportunities abroad,” it said.
Last month, the ADB had approved loans totalling $330m to Pakistan for the country’s Second Power Transmission Strengthening Project.</p><small>2025-12-06 08:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637747-karachi-court-sentences-man-to-39-years-for-raping-12-year-old-girl' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi court sentences man to 39 years for raping 12-year-old girl</strong></a><br><p>
