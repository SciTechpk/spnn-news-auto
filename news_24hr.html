The Indus AI Week 2026 is being held from February 9 to 15 (Sunday). The event’s website describes it as “Pakistan’s official national platform for artificial intelligence — where policy, innovation, talent and investment converge”.
“The Government of Pakistan is committed to investing $1 billion in AI by 2030, which will go a long way in building an AI ecosystem in our country,” the premier said while addressing the event’s inauguration ceremony in Islamabad.
Announcing further steps the country aims to take to keep up with modern technologies, PM Shehbaz said an AI curriculum would be introduced “not only in all federally-controlled or -run schools but all schools” of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB).
He emphasised that the plan would be implemented in remote parts of Balochistan as well to “pair our youth for leadership and digital economy”.



The prime minister further said the government would provide 1,000 fully-funded PHD scholarships in AI to students across the country by 2030, which is aimed at building Pakistan’s “world-class research centre fully capacitated”.
“Last but not least, we will launch a nationwide programme to train 1 million non-IT professionals in AI skills, enabling them to enhance productivity and improving livelihoods,” he added.

The SC had fixed for hearing 13 petitions related to Imran and his spouse Bushra Bibi, and said PTI’s memorandum seeking jail visitation rights for the party founder has been forwarded to the relevant executive authorities for consideration under the law.
Imran has been in jail since August 2023, convicted in a string of cases he says were politically driven following his ouster in a 2022 no-confidence vote.
The request for the meeting, submitted by senior PTI leader Latif Khosa, was rejected by a two-member bench comprising Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan.
The bench observed that such an order could not be passed without hearing the other side. Hence, a notice was then issued to the government for tomorrow (Tuesday).
Addressing Khosa during the hearing, CJP Afridi said that “we have to overcome the hurdle of the maintainability of the application”. “Keep in mind that you have cases pending in other courts,” he remarked.
“We believe that the case has become infructuous,” he said, recalling an Aug 24, 2023 order “against which the case was filed”.
The court “cannot issue any order regarding the meeting without issuing notice”, CJP Afridi added.
The SC also ordered the formation of a three-member bench to hear appeals against the PTI founder’s acquittal in the cipher case.
A three-member bench has also been ordered to hear appeals against the acquittal of PTI leader Shah Mahmood Qureshi in the same case. The Islamabad High Court (IHC) had acquitted Imran and Qureshi in the cipher case on June 3, 2024.
Hearing Imran’s bail petition in the Al-Qadir University Trust case, in which the former premier was sentenced to 14 years in prison in 2025, the court dismissed the PTI founder’s bail plea as infructuous.
According to a supplementary cause list issued last week, the petitions fixed for hearing for Monday included the Punjab government’s appeal against the granting of bail to the PTI founder and his wife.
Further, Imran’s appeal against the case registered against him under the Official Secrets Act and the National Accountability Bureau case against the ex-premier in relation to the Al-Qadir University Trust was also fixed for hearing.
Imran’s appeal against a Rs10 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was also set to be heard.
‘Sign of political victimisation’
Later, speaking to the media, Imran’s lawyer, Salman Safdar, maintained that hearing 14 petitions at once was a “sign of political victimisation”.
“The chief justice today heard all the petitions against the PTI founder’s cases,” he said.
Safdar maintained that the government had filed appeals “against every case in which the former premier had received relief”.
Recalling the cipher case, he said that “it was the most high-stakes trial in Pakistan, and you saw how it ended”, the counsel added.
He held that the SC had “always granted us relief”, adding that he “appealed to meet the chief justice”.
“In the past five months, we have only had a five-minute meeting” with the former premier, he said.
“Our cases are not being fixed for hearing, and there is a ban on our meetings,” Safdar lamented.
The lawyer asserted that “more than 300 cases” had been filed against the incarcerated former premier. He added that multiple bail pleas were pending before Additional District and Sessions Judge Afzal Majoka.
Safdar recalled that “a letter was written to the chief justice of the IHC this month”, but said that “IHC is not ready to fix any case for hearing”.
He claimed that, as IHC “had no standing at all”, such a case should be “directed to the SC”.
The IHC has been “reduced to a palace for show”, Safdar said.
Shifting his attention to the former premier’s health, he said that the defence had “not yet even brought up medical ground in the court” for bail.
“This does not mean that we should be kept in the dark about PTI founder’s health,” he added.







The former premier has been incarcerated since Aug 5, 2023, currently imprisoned at Rawalpindi’s Central Jail.
A two-page memorandum filed by the PTI on Friday alleged that Imran’s rights as a prisoner and a human being have been consistently violated during this period.
The PTI memorandum also highlighted the reports about “Imran being subjected to some secretive medical procedure at a hospital in Islamabad and keeping his relatives in the dark in violation of jail rules”.
Separately, PTI leader Salman Akram Raja, speaking to the media, said that the party had “submitted a memorandum that cases were not being fixed in the IHC”.
“The cases heard today were government cases, which were unnecessary,” Raja said, adding that the cases in which the party was seeking relief “have not yet been fixed”.
“Khan Sahib is not being allowed to meet us, and neither does he have any information regarding the facts,” he added.
“This is completely unfair.”
Addressing the matter of Imran’s health, he said, “We have been given an incomplete medical report.”
“We have no hope of getting justice at this point; however, we will keep knocking on the doors of the court,” he further said.</p><small>2026-02-09 09:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649895-govt-extends-deadline-of-hajj-visa-biometric-verification' target='_blank'><strong>Govt extends deadline of Hajj visa biometric verification</strong></a><br><p>

Since the latest conflict between Israel and Hamas broke out on Oct 7, 2023, Pakistan has sent numerous aid items intended for the Gaza Strip, which was besieged at least until a ceasefire was secured in October 2025.
According to NDMA, the consignment comprised 100 tonnes of tents and was sent with the support of Alkhidmat Foundation.
This was the 28th relief consignment sent by Pakistan, bringing the total volume of humanitarian assistance sent to 2,727 tonnes.
The relief goods were dispatched through a special flight from Allama Iqbal International Airport in Lahore to Egypt’s El Arish International Airport “for onward delivery to Gaza”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Punjab housing minister Bilal Yasin was a special guest at the dispatch, which was attended by officials of the NDMA and the foreign ministry, NDMA stated.
Pakistan had first sent aid, including medicines and tents, for the people of Gaza on Oct 19, 2023 — days after the Israeli bombardment began.
The activists who were behind the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), which was intercepted at sea by Israel in September 2025, said last week they will try again this year.
The organisers said they hope to bring 100 boats for their next attempt, carrying up to 1,000 medics.
Israel, which controls all access to the Gaza Strip, denies withholding supplies for its two million residents.

 

On Sept 27, 2025, Israeli drones hit the GSF — a collection of boats carrying humanitarian aid with rights activists, doctors, parliamentarians, journalists and others — as they entered the final stretch of their journey to Gaza.
The aid boats were carrying delegations from over 40 countries, including Pakistan, which aimed to distribute vital humanitarian aid such as baby formula, food, water and medicine to the malnourished, forcibly displaced and injured civilians suffering from almost two years of genocide, as classified by the United Nations.
Israel’s two-year relentless onslaught on the Gaza Strip killed more than 71,000 Palestinians, displaced most of its population and left much of the strip in ruins.
Israel faced tremendous international criticism over the resulting humanitarian crisis in Gaza, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and experts declaring its actions in Gaza as a “genocide”, which Tel Aviv rejects.</p><small>2026-02-09 08:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6989280210c97.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971975/sanaullahs-remarks-on-balochistan-trigger-row' target='_blank'><strong>Sanaullah’s remarks on Balochistan trigger row</strong></a><br><p>• PM aide’s contention that ‘innocents may get caught up’ in the wake of action following terror attacks prompts heckling, walkout• Dr Malik, Akhtar Mengal stress need for political, not military-based solutions
LAHORE: At a charged discussion about the situation in Balochistan, PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah ignited controversy when he implied that innocent civilians were bound to get caught up in the fallout of attacks such as the ones witnessed across the province on Jan 31.
The PM’s aide was speaking during a session, titled ‘Is There a Political Will to Solve the Crisis in Balochistan’, at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday.
The minister was part of a distinguished panel, which also incl­uded BNP-Mengal chief Akhtar Mengal and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch, and was moderated by Mujahid Barelvi.


PML-N leader Rana Sanaullah at the Asma Jahangir Conference on Sunday.

The controversy reared its head when Mr Sanaullah was responding to points raised by the other speaker regarding the treatment meted out to the people from Balochistan.
Referring to demands such as the abolition of checkpoints from across the province, he said that this could not happen unless terrorism and violence were rooted out.
“If incidents like Jan 31 happen, then security forces will take act­ion, and there is a possibility that some of the people taken into custody could be innocent,” he said.
This prompted a reaction from the audience, and some — like rights activist Sheema Kermani — got up from her seat and began to heckle the minister. He responded by chiding the hecklers, saying that their refusal to listen to him had ‘exposed them’.
Ms Kermani then walked out of the venue, with many people following suit. Speaking to Dawn outside the hall, she said: “Asma Jahangir must be turning in her grave”.
“Asma’s name is a symbol for people’s rights, for resistance, defiance and justice. If in this conference, you give a platform to such people who justify state violence, then we will not sit and hear it… If [Asma] had been here, she herself would have walked out and wouldn’t have let such persons speak.”
‘Political people’
Earlier, in his remarks, Dr Abdul Malik Baloch termed insurgency and enforced disappearances as the two major issues facing the province, which did not seem to have a solution. “Whenever I go to my area, four or five people come [up to me] daily, complaining about a missing person.”
The state and political leadership should find a solution to these issues, he demanded.
“If you deal with Balochistan as a security issue, then conditions would get worse by the day. If you involve political people and parties, then the situation may improve,” he suggested.
“For parties which have roots among the masses, in Balochistan as well as [Khyber] Pakhtunkhwa, space is shrinking on a daily basis,” he regretted.
He also regretted how those who got the votes from the people were not allowed to enter parliament, but others were sent there ‘symbolically’.
Dr Baloch, who was also part of the Pakistan Democratic Movement alliance, recalled that they had agreed on a number of points, including an end to enforced disappearances.
He called for political reforms and the handover of resources to the province, and stressed the need to protect the 1972 Constitution, the 18th Amendment and the National Finance Commission Award.
‘Military solution to a political issue’
At the outset, BNP-M leader Akhtar Mengal posited that while the Balochistan issue was a political one, successive rulers had tried to solve it through military means, and warned that continued reliance on the coercive approach could lead to further tensions.
Going into history, he recalled the original arrangement between the Khan of Kalat and the Quaid-i-Azam, where it was agreed that most administrative powers would remain with Balochistan. However, he regretted that this and subsequent pacts were not implemented.
He also referred to past periods of conflict, including operations under different governments, the killing of Nawab Akbar Bugti and the issue of enforced disappearances, which he said had deeply affected many families, including his own.
He also criticised recent political and electoral developments, alleging that mainstream Baloch political leadership had been sidelined, while expressing concern over restrictions on political activity, media access and civil liberties.
He also referred to jailed human rights lawyers and activists, Imaan Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, saying that they had been jailed for 17 years over a mere tweet, while those who had harmed the country and looted had not spent a single day behind bars, or were accorded A or B class prison facilities.
Sanaullah’s response
Responding to these grievances, Mr Sanaullah said nothing could be done about the past, as it could not be changed.
“Right now Balochistan had two crises, one is being represented by Akhtar Mengal and Dr Malik, and the other side being Bashir Zaib and his accomplices,” he said, referring to one of the leaders of the banned BLA.
“In my view, both these crises have different solutions and different demands. We are making a mistake by taking them as one.” He also maintained that enforced disappearances and violence in Balochistan started simultaneously, calling it a ‘chicken and egg story’, adding that they would also end together, just as they had started.

Cummins pulled out with a back injury and Hazlewood lost a race to be fit after sustaining Achilles and hamstring injuries.
With Mitchell Starc having quit the format, Australia will be without all three of their top quicks for the first World Cup in over a decade.
Ellis, the default leader of a pace attack featuring Xavier Bartlett and Ben Dwarshuis, said the new trio would be able to cover for the loss of their more experienced teammates.
“We’ve had 18-24 months of cricket together where the big three haven’t been playing and have had big workloads in the test arena,” he told reporters on Monday.
“I actually think we work together really, really well.
“We’ve all got different skill-sets and can gel together on the night in different phases of the game.
“A squad without ‘Hoff’ (Hazlewood) and Cummo (Cummins) is a strong squad obviously, but without them I feel like we’re just as well placed to go deep.”
Ellis will go into Australia’s opener against Ireland in Colombo on Wednesday without any recent match practice, having suffered a hamstring strain bowling for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Big Bash League.
In his absence, Australia were whitewashed 3-0 in a warm-up series against Pakistan.
Ellis has been used more as a specialist death bowler than a powerplay enforcer, but conceded his role might need to change in the absence of Hazlewood.
“Obviously, you have to take each game, conditions as they come. But losing one of the better white ball bowlers in the world in Hoff, things are always going to have to change,” he said.
“My role will try to be adaptable as much as I can.”</p><small>2026-02-09 08:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09123015e03587c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972051/fm-dar-underscores-importance-of-expanding-trade-economic-ties-with-the-eu' target='_blank'><strong>FM Dar underscores importance of expanding trade, economic ties with the EU</strong></a><br><p>Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar on Monday chaired a high-level inter-ministerial meeting to review measures aimed at strengthening Pakistan’s economic and trade cooperation with the European Union (EU).
According to a post shared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on X, the deputy prime minister underscored the importance of expanding trade and economic ties with the EU, noting that the bloc remains a key economic partner for Pakistan, particularly under the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP-Plus) framework.







Dar highlighted that Pakistan has completed four biennial GSP-Plus reviews and reaffirmed the country’s commitment to fully meeting its obligations under the scheme in order to expand mutually beneficial trade opportunities with the EU.
GSP-Plus is a trade initiative by the EU that allows developing countries to export goods to the region with reduced or zero tariffs, making their products more competitive in European markets.
Under the enhanced GSP-Plus scheme, countries that implement international conventions on human rights, labour rights, environmental protection, and good governance receive additional benefits, including duty-free access for most exports.
The GSP-Plus status has especially benefited Pakistan’s key export sectors in textiles, leather goods, and surgical instruments, which contribute significantly to the country’s foreign exchange earnings.
The meeting was attended by federal minister for law and justice, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, Secretary Foreign Affairs Ambassador Amna Baloch, and the secretaries of commerce, interior, overseas Pakistanis and human rights.
Pakistan’s ambassador to the EU and senior officials from relevant federal and provincial departments were also present.
At the meeting with the EU’s Ambassador to Pakistan, Raimundas Karoblis, in Jan, 2026, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to working closely with the EU on initiatives to enhance trade, particularly under the GSP-Plus framework.
The country was granted the GSP-Plus status by the EU in 2014, resulting in a 108 per cent increase in Pakistani textile exports to the EU due to concessional tariffs.
In October 2023, the European Parliament unanimously voted to extend the GSP-Plus status for another four years until 2027 for developing countries, including Pakistan.</p><small>2026-02-09 08:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649878-pakistan-seeks-stronger-ties-with-japan-after-takaichi-re-elected-as-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks stronger ties with Japan after Takaichi re-elected as PM</strong></a><br><p>

The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper was found guilty in December on two counts of foreign collusion under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing, as well as one count of seditious publication.
His sentence is by far the harshest handed out under the national security law, surpassing the previous record of 10 years given to legal scholar Benny Tai in 2024.
A summary document from the judges said they had settled on 20 years’ imprisonment “after considering the serious and grave criminal conduct of Lai”.
Two of those years will overlap with Lai’s existing prison term, meaning that he will serve an additional 18 years, the judges wrote.
Lai, who has been behind bars since 2020, sat impassively in the dock as his sentence was read out, an AFP journalist in the court saw.
As he was led away, he waved solemnly to people in the public gallery, including his wife Teresa, former Hong Kong bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen, and former Apple Daily reporters.
His defence lawyer Robert Pang, declined to comment on whether Lai would lodge an appeal, which can be done in the next 28 days.
Asked if the sentence was in line with expectations, Pang told AFP: “In these times I don’t know what to expect.”
Teresa Lai was grim-faced during the hearing and made no comment as she left the court, but the family condemned the sentence in a statement.
“Sentencing my father to this draconian prison sentence is devastating for our family and life-threatening for my father,” Lai’s son Sebastien said.
His daughter Claire called it “a heartbreakingly cruel sentence” given his declining health in prison, and if carried out, “he will die a martyr behind bars”.
‘Effectively a death sentence’
Rights groups also said Lai’s punishment amounted to a grave injustice.
“The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence. A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust,” Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.
Amnesty International called the case “another grim milestone in Hong Kong’s transformation from a city governed by the rule of law to one ruled by fear”.
Jodie Ginsberg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said “today’s egregious decision is the final nail in the coffin for freedom of the press in Hong Kong”.
British Prime Minister Keir Starmer previously said he had raised the issue of Lai, a British citizen, during his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing last month, while US President Donald Trump has also called for his release.
Beijing has dismissed critics as smearing Hong Kong’s judicial system, while Hong Kong authorities say Lai’s case “has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press”.
Staunch supporters
Dozens of former Apple Daily employees and others braved the cold to queue overnight outside the West Kowloon court for a spot in court, while journalists gathered outside the building’s entrance.
The mood was tense as police deployed dozens of officers, an armoured car and a bomb disposal van to the area.
“I think this is equivalent to sentencing Lai to life imprisonment,” Lam Ying-kit, a former history teacher in his 50s, told AFP.
Lai’s supporters, children, lawyers and rights groups have all raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison.
Lai was kept in solitary confinement at his own request to avoid harassment, according to prosecutors, while authorities maintain he receives “adequate” care.
Long a thorn in Beijing’s side, Lai was prosecuted under the national security law imposed by China on Hong Kong in 2020, following huge pro-democracy protests in the finance hub.
Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 following police raids.
Eight other defendants, including six Apple Daily executives, are due to be sentenced alongside Lai on Monday, all of whom pleaded guilty.
As of the start of the month, Hong Kong had arrested a total of 386 people for various national security crimes, with 176 of them being convicted.</p><small>2026-02-09 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/09114255891eac7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1972047/youtuber-ducky-bhai-indicted-in-gambling-app-promotion-case' target='_blank'><strong>YouTuber Ducky Bhai indicted in gambling app promotion case</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A judicial magistrate on Monday indicted YouTuber Saadur Rehman, alias Ducky Bhai, his wife Aroob Jatoi, and others over the alleged promotion of gambling apps on social media.
All the accused pleaded not guilty to the charges and decided to contest the trial. Magistrate Naeem Wattoo ordered the prosecution to present its witnesses at the next hearing.
Further proceedings will be held on Feb 23.
The National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) had registered the cases of several YouTubers and Tiktokers on charges of promoting gambling apps on their social media accounts.
The agency had arrested Rehman in August of last year. The Lahore High Court (LHC) had released him on bail on Nov 24.
The case is related to an inquiry dated June 13, 2025, and registered on the “receipt of information from reliable source(s)” that some YouTubers and social media influencers were promoting gambling and betting applications to the general public via their social media accounts for their own monetary benefits.
It was registered under sections 13 (Electronic forgery), 14 (Electronic fraud), 25 (Spamming) and 26 (Spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 read with sections 294 B (Offering prize in connection with trade) and 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducting delivery of property) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In December, Rehman had uploaded a nearly hour-long video to his YouTube channel in which he made allegations of physical and verbal abuse while in NCCIA custody.
In October, six NCCIA officials were given a three-day physical remand for allegedly misusing their authority, extorting money and taking bribes, after a case was registered against them on the complaint of Aroob Jatoi.
Meanwhile, in September, NCCIA Lahore Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry was removed from his post, reportedly over different controversies, including allegedly beating Rehman.</p><small>2026-02-09 07:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649833-court-indicts-youtuber-ducky-bhai-wife-in-gambling-betting-application-case' target='_blank'><strong>Court indicts YouTuber Ducky Bhai, wife in gambling, betting application case</strong></a><br><p>

The opposition alliance, the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), was locked in a direct confrontation with the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan.
The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) administration was running the affairs of the state with little room for opposition voices, an increasingly constrained press and an aggressive stance against any narrative seen as anti-establishment.
At the centre of this political standoff was the then leader of the opposition, Shehbaz Sharif, who had taken a hard line against the ruling PTI. During a lengthy and closely watched visit to Karachi in August 2021, Shehbaz spent three days meeting industrialists, businessmen, political leaders, intellectuals, media professionals and other stakeholders.
As his visit drew to a close, he invited a select group of journalists over a cup of tea at a local hotel — an informal setting that followed days of intense political engagement and quiet maneuvering.
Four years on, Karachi is still waiting
Ranging from foreign policy to the economy and from political uncertainty to the fast-eroding space for genuine democratic forces, he argued for the need of a political consensus keeping the audience gripped, unmoving, and fully attentive.
For Karachi’s journalists, the pleasant surprise came when Shehbaz Sharif spoke with rare candour about the neglect the city had long endured. He laid out his thinking on Karachi’s revival, outlining plans for its rebuilding and development, and spoke with calculated clarity about restoring the metropolis to its rightful status as the country’s financial capital.
“Believe [me] when I was chief minister of Punjab, I came to realise that funding or resources for development has never been an issue,” he cited before sharing his Karachi plan. “I have been here for three days meeting industrialists, businessmen, industrialists, political leaders, intellectuals, media persons, and many others. I firmly believe Karachi only needs political will and ownership to turn things around. We do have a strong, in-depth and comprehensive strategy for Karachi but let me share with you one thing very briefly.”
“The federal government would have to pump in more money every year for Karachi than what is allocated by the Sindh government in its annual budget for the city’s development. And this cycle should continue for 15 or maybe 20 years. Then we would be able to fix this city’s problems,” Shehbaz asserted.
His convictions were so firm that few dared to question his intentions or calculations. The formula put forward by the three-time chief minister of Punjab was accepted without scrutiny, leaving little room for dissent or debate.
When his statements began making headlines, many in Karachi believed their voices had finally been heard. There was a sense that the national leadership, if not immediately then eventually, would sit in Islamabad and work to address the city’s long-standing grievances.
More than four years on, however, those hopes have proven to be little more than wishful thinking. After serving 16 months as prime minister from April 2022 to August 2023 and returning to office again in March 2024, the expectations attached to his leadership remain unfulfilled for the Karachiites.
A story of stalled initiatives and unmet promises
Why have his ideas and commitments for Karachi yet to translate into tangible outcomes? Is this due to an apparent shift in approach, or are there concrete plans that may materialise in the coming years? When contacted by Dawn, Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal did not directly respond to these questions.
Instead, he pointed to the shrinking fiscal space available to Islamabad and the growing resource availability of the provinces over the years. Regardless of the views held by Karachi’s residents, experts, political parties, and other stakeholders, the federal minister maintains that the Centre is still “making a contribution” to the development of the metropolis.
“Federal government share in national development budget has shrunk from 50 per cent to 25pc, whereas provincial governments share has increased from 50pc to 75pc. Despite that, the federal government is making contribution towards the development of Karachi through billions of rupees worth projects like Green Line extension project, Site area development project and K-IV water project,” he said.
However, this explanation is contested by his predecessors, who were directly involved in planning and financing development initiatives for Karachi. They argue that the issue has been less about fiscal constraints and more about political prioritisation and continuity.
Among them is Asad Umar, who, as finance minister and later as planning minister during the PTI government, oversaw several federally funded projects for the city under the Karachi Transformation Plan, and maintains that viable, economy-linked initiatives for Karachi were not only conceived but taken to advanced stages before being stalled.
Questioning the argument of limited fiscal space, Umar said the issue was not the absence of resources but the consistency of federal priorities.
“If a sports stadium in Narowal (the hometown and constituency of Ahsan Iqbal) can be justified under the federal Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), then there should also be space for Karachi’s extremely critical, economy-linked projects from which the entire country would benefit,” he said.
He also referred to the Lahore-Bahawalnagar motorway, a project located entirely within one province, which had also been approved under the federal PSDP.
“If development spending is to be undertaken at the federal level, it should be applied consistently. Why is Karachi treated like a stepchild?” he asked.
Umar argued that Karachi’s economic importance alone warranted sustained federal investment.
“Karachi has a special role by far. It’s the largest revenue base, export hub, and industrial centre in the country. There is definitely a case for the Centre supporting Karachi in a meaningful way,” he said.
Referring to the PTI government’s ‘Karachi Transformation Plan’, Umar said the initiative comprised five major projects, two of which were completed during the PTI’s tenure.
“The first phase of the Green Line BRT was completed and significant road and drainage projects were also carried out under the package,” he said.
He said the federal government had assumed full responsibility for the K-IV water supply scheme, with a clear timeline for completion.
“We had planned to complete K-IV by September 2023, and the entire project was taken over by the federal government to ensure progress,” he said.
Two additional transport projects, he said, had reached advanced stages before work was halted. One involved a modern Karachi Circular Railway designed as a 42-kilometre system, including a 27-kilometre elevated track, modelled on systems such as Delhi’s. “All the preliminary work had been completed, and the project had entered the bidding phase,” he said.
The second was a dedicated rail freight corridor running parallel to existing railway lines from the port to Pipri. “This would have shifted freight traffic off city roads, significantly reducing heavy truck movement, easing congestion within Karachi and at the ports,” he said, adding that the project was in the design stage when progress stalled.
A closer examination of official budgetary allocations also raises questions about the scale and seriousness of Islamabad’s claimed contribution. Despite repeated references to flagship projects, the federal government has earmarked only Rs3.2 billion for the K-IV water supply scheme in the current fiscal year, which is far short of the estimated annual requirement of around Rs40 billion to keep the project on track.
Similarly, beyond a limited extension of the Green Line BRT covering only a few additional kilometres, there appears to be no major federally funded infrastructure initiative currently planned or underway for Karachi.
This growing gap between rhetoric and resource allocation has prompted criticism from political leaders, business representatives, and development experts, who argue that without sustained and substantial federal investment, the long-promised revival of the country’s largest city will remain elusive.
The funding paradox
Syed Aminul Haq, a senior leader of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) and a key ally of the ruling PML-N at the Centre, argued that the federal government has not completely ignored Karachi in recent years.
He pointed to a number of development initiatives, including the construction of three flyovers in the Central district, rehabilitation of Garden Road, and the induction of 52 fire tenders into the city’s fire brigade. According to him, these interventions helped address some of the city’s most urgent infrastructure and emergency response needs.
However, Haq acknowledged that these projects were initiated during the previous PTI government, when MQM-P was also part of the ruling coalition at the Centre. At the same time, he agreed that Karachi’s contribution to the national exchequer has not been matched by federal spending.
“Karachi generates around 66pc of the country’s federal revenue, and this alone justifies a much larger and sustained investment by Islamabad,” he said, adding that without a long-term federal commitment, the city’s structural problems would continue to resurface.
Beyond the political and policy debate, concern is also growing within Karachi’s business community, which increasingly views the city’s prolonged underinvestment as a risk to national economic stability.
In recent weeks, a group of 15-20 leading businessmen and experts from Karachi formed a committee, holding detailed discussions on how the city’s deteriorating infrastructure and governance challenges could be addressed. They studied the city’s problems and proposed practical solutions.
In these discussions, the participants also emphasised the need for the federal government to play a stronger and more consistent role in addressing Karachi’s infrastructure and development challenges, given the city’s critical contribution to national revenue, exports and industrial output.
Among those involved was prominent businessman Hanif Gauhar, who argued that without sustained federal involvement, Karachi’s economic potential could not be fully realised. “The federal government’s involvement in Karachi is far less than it should be. In such a large and economically critical province, the Centre needs to play a meaningful role,” he said.
“We have presented our findings and recommendations directly to Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Federal Minister for Board of Investment (BOI) Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh,” he confirmed, further stating that the committee is focused solely on identifying Karachi’s issues and suggesting actionable steps.
Highlighting the city’s disproportionate contribution to national revenue, Gauhar argued that federal investment should reflect this economic significance.
“This is exactly what frustrates us. This city generates the highest revenue, yet when we look at even the roads, the support is minimal. Ayaz Sadiq himself told us that his constituency received a budget of Rs38 billion. Just imagine if a single MNA gets Rs38 billion for their area, you can see tangible results. Why can’t Karachi, which contributes so much more, see the same level of federal attention?” he asked.
The issue is not just funding but also long-standing neglect and a lack of political will to address Karachi’s structural problems. Among those raising these concerns is City Council’s opposition leader Advocate Saifuddin, who said that the city’s grievances remain largely unaddressed despite repeated promises from both federal and provincial authorities.
According to him, the federal government has effectively “handed over” Karachi to the Sindh government, absolving itself of responsibility for the city’s long-neglected infrastructure and development needs.
“The federal government has shown no serious interest in Karachi. Projects that fall squarely under the Centre’s domain have either been ignored or left incomplete for years,” he said.
Questioning Shehbaz Sharif’s priorities, Saifuddin said the premier’s recent engagement with Karachi had been largely symbolic.
“The prime minister recently visited Karachi only to inaugurate new lounges and facilities at the Cantt Railway Station. This reflects the limited scope of federal interest in the city,” he said.
He also referred to “an unjust allocation” of development funds.
“Out of the federal PSDP of Rs1,100 billion, Karachi receives only around Rs40 to Rs50 billion. Based on population alone, the city’s share should be at least Rs200 billion and if revenue contribution is taken into account, it should be closer to Rs300 billion,” he said.
Comparing Karachi to Lahore, Saifuddin alleged a clear imbalance in federal spending.
“Lahore has been given far more development schemes than Karachi, while this city continues to receive a disproportionately small share,” he said and criticised both tiers of government. “The federal government has been unfair to Karachi, and whatever funds are transferred to Sindh are also insufficient when distributed for Karachi, whether measured by population or by revenue contribution. As a result, the city continues to suffer from systemic neglect.”
How Karachi slipped down PML-N’s priority list
While debates over funding, policy and governance continue, and criticism of the federal government for neglecting the city comes from both political and business circles, there is a growing sense even within PML-N ranks that the party’s interest in Karachi has been waning.
One example is Nasiruddin Mahmood, who was once the party’s face in the city as the general secretary of its Karachi chapter. But he quit the party in 2025, at a time when it was in power at the Centre, citing its continued apathy towards Karachi and its local party workers.
His exit served as a powerful indictment of the party’s attitude towards the country’s economic and revenue-generating hub, reinforcing the perception that Karachi has remained peripheral to the federal government’s priorities under Shehbaz. He claimed that the PML-N has long lost interest not only in governing Sindh but also in functioning as a meaningful political force there, with Karachi in particular having been largely neglected.
“In my view, the persistent electoral failures of PML-N across Sindh stem primarily from the lack of attention by the party’s central leadership,” he said. “During the 2024 election campaign, no key leader including Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif, or Maryam Nawaz, led any public rally or procession in Sindh. Moreover, Shehbaz, who was contesting from Karachi’s Baldia Town, left without even filing his nomination papers. His sudden withdrawal from the election deeply demoralised party workers. As a result, despite a significant political vacuum in Karachi, PML-N failed to win a single seat, while MQM won 15 seats and the PPP secured seven.”
Per Mahmood, the city’s influence within the party was much stronger when Mian Nawaz Sharif was personally active in politics. Over time, however, successive leadership transitions and political crises have gradually pushed Karachi down the party’s list of priorities.
“After 2015, following Nawaz Sharif’s political crisis, disqualification, imprisonment and subsequent departure to the UK, the city’s importance within the party gradually declined. When Shehbaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz later took over the party’s leadership, Karachi’s standing continued to diminish. By the time of the 2024 elections, it became evident that Karachi and Sindh more broadly held little significance for the party. This gives a clear indication of where Karachi ranks in their priorities,” he said.

Maxwell, currently serving 20 years in prison for trafficking girls to the disgraced financier Epstein, will face questions from prison via videolink, in a deposition by the House of Representatives’ Oversight Committee.
Though no new US prosecutions are expected after the latest dump of government files on Epstein, numerous political and business leaders have fallen into scandal or resigned as their ties to the convicted sex criminal were revealed.
The House Oversight Committee is probing Epstein’s connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.
Maxwell, however, is expected to invoke her right to not incriminate herself, guaranteed in the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution.
Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a minor. His extensive ties to the world’s rich and powerful, especially after he was released in 2009, have become politically explosive across the globe.
He died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children in what was ruled a suicide.
Maxwell’s lawyers have pushed for Congress to grant her legal immunity in order to testify in the deposition, but lawmakers refused.
Without that, her legal team said she would invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
“Proceeding under these circumstances would serve no other purpose than pure political theater,” her lawyers said in a letter.
The Trump administration has already come under criticism for its handling of her case.
Last year Maxell was moved to a minimum-security prison in Texas after meeting twice with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously served as US President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer.
Trump himself was a longtime Epstein associate, but has not been called to testify by the Oversight Committee, which is led by members of his Republican Party.
Also expected to be deposed by the committee are former president Bill Clinton and his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, both Democrats.
The Clintons have called for their depositions to be held publicly to prevent Republicans from politicizing their testimony.</p><small>2026-02-09 05:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/6989196fc3a0f.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1971928/horns-of-a-dilemma' target='_blank'><strong>Horns of a dilemma</strong></a><br><p>IN geopolitics as in physics, actions do cause reactions which, even though they may be opposite, aren’t necessarily equal or immediate. And these reactions, when they do become apparent, can be stunning. Take, for example, the sight of F-16 jets patrolling the skies above Mogadishu — not on a bombing run as may have been the case in the past, but as part of a ‘gift’ to Somalia from their Turkish allies. This means that Somalia, which has not had an air force since 1991, is now one of only three African countries to field F-16s.
Speaking of opposites, the last week also saw Saudi Arabia and Turkiye sign a far-reaching accord encompassing everything from economic ties to strategic cooperation, which is quite something considering the low ebb that relations sank to after the blockade of Qatar in 2017 and the 2018 murder of Jamal Khashoggi. Now these erstwhile rivals are on the proverbial same page when it comes to Yemen, Sudan and — crucially — Somalia.
Why is Somalia important? Situated on the Horn of Africa on the Red Sea coast, Somalia stands at the crossroads of critical maritime trade routes that connect Europa, Asia, the Middle East and Africa. This means that whoever has a foothold in Somalia can effectively choke trade and interdict vessels, much as the Houthis managed to do in the recent past.
What added urgency to Turkish and Saudi efforts to shore up Somalia militarily and diplomatically was in large part the Israeli recognition of Somaliland last year. Somaliland, a breakaway province of Somalia, has effectively been independent since 1991, and has since cooperated deeply with the UAE to develop its port of Berbera, which was intended as yet another node in the UAE’s network of ports and bases, all located at strategic choke points. The possibility of an Israeli deployment in Somaliland raises alarms in Saudi Arabia, which rightly fears an encirclement of sorts. Riyadh is now willing to act against any such possibility, as evidenced by the rout of the Southern Transitional Council in Yemen last year, a group that Riyadh claims is a UAE proxy. Had the STC succeeded in grabbing a large part of Yemen, Riyadh would be faced with the untenable scenario of a potentially hostile proxy in power on its terrestrial southern border and also across the Red Sea in Somaliland. Since then, Saudi-UAE ties have taken a serious downturn, with the latest signal of this being the withdrawal of several UAE defence firms from the Riyadh-based World Defence Show to be held this week.

 

This realignment brings Riyadh closer to Ankara, overcoming decades of mistrust and confrontation. Turkiye’s involvement makes sense not only due to its old antipathy towards the UAE’s strategic designs — a feud that dates at least as far back as the Arab Spring — but also its increased wariness of and confrontation with Israel, which views Turkiye as one of the only regional powers capable of checking its ambitions.

Whoever has a foothold in Somalia can effectively choke trade.

With the backing of two powerful regional nations, Somalia then acted against the UAE by annulling all agreements with that country, bringing Somali-UAE ties to their lowest ebb ever. Nevertheless, Somaliland stands defiant, and while the UAE has not officially recognised them as an independent state, the president of Somaliland was prominently in attendance at the recent World Governments Summit in Dubai, an appearance that naturally drew condemnation from Mogadishu. Now, with both Riyadh and Ankara loudly condemning Somaliland and reaffirming Somalia’s territorial integrity, the outlines of a new regional order, and of rival camps, can clearly be seen. It is also worth noting that the Somali air chief and interior ministers were both in Pakistan recen­t­­ly, and while So­­m­ali commentators and analysts are hinting at the prospect of military co­­operation and def­ence deals with Pa­­kistan, nothing is official at the moment.
But the ripples of this regional alignment are being felt as far as Libya and Sudan. In Libya, we can see clear efforts being made to wean off Gen Khalifa Haftar, the de facto ruler of large parts of Libya, from the UAE and while these efforts are largely being made by Turkiye, we should also note (again) that Khalifa Haftar was also recently in Pakistan. Then there’s Sudan, where the Sudanese army has scored some recent successes against the UAE-backed Rapid Support Force, and they have Turkish and growing Egyptian military support to thank for that. The lines have been drawn. The axes and alliances are broadly coalescing. And the reason all this is happening is because this is a reaction to unbridled Israeli aggression coupled with the UAE’s growing reach and influence. Moves and countermoves are in play and you shouldn’t be surprised if you hear of Ethiopian involvement soon. But that’s a topic for another day.

While China dominates the global supply of these minerals, the US is trying to catch up by rushing to strike mineral resources deals with several countries and taking other initiatives.
Over the decades, China built a near-monopoly in the extraction and processing capacity of rare earth minerals, which are used in electronics, electric cars, radars and military weapon systems. Last year, President Donald Trump saw how China pushed back against his tariffs by imposing curbs on exports of rare earth minerals. This threatened US industry and forced Washington to back down. He has since stepped up efforts to reduce dependence on China by seeking to develop alternate sources of supply and make new investments. His stated aim to seize Greenland is mostly driven by this.
Trump has also announced the establishment of a strategic critical-minerals stockpile, named ‘Project Vault’ worth $12 billion, in an effort to reduce the risk to manufacturers from supply disruptions, while his administration tries to deal with China’s dominance in rare earths and other metals. Last week, Washington hosted a critical minerals ministerial to which delegations from 50 countries were invited with the aim of forming a preferential trade bloc and seeking collaboration to diversify supply chains.
An insightful new book describes how China came to establish its ascendancy in the batteries sector by making strategic investments much earlier, while the US focused on oil and the technologies of the past. The Elements of Power by journalist Nicolas Niarchos is a fascinating tour de force of the development of the battery industry, evolution of the demand for lithium and cobalt, the scientific advances that were made and who profited from all of this. His story about the ‘age of batteries’ focuses on its innovative aspects, companies that spearheaded technological progress and the geopolitical implications. But it exposes its perils and moral dilemmas as well. For him, this is also a tragic saga “whose protagonists are some of the poorest people in the world” exploited by wealthy countries and predatory companies.

The global competition for critical minerals and metals is set to intensify.

The 20th century, Niarchos says, was powered by oil. But lithium-ion batteries make the modern world possible, being the “foot soldiers of the digital revolution”. They make powerful tech available for every aspect of life, powering cellphones, laptops, medical devices, electric vehicles, drones and jet engines among other things. The metals and materials that go into these batteries come from countries across the world.
He argues that understanding these batteries and how they are made are key to understanding how a new form of power is being created, “one that is measurable in dollars, strategic influence and volts”. He reminds the reader that 70 to 90 per cent of lithium-ion batteries are made in China. And “as with oil, battery power has become political power”. Indeed, the acquisition of critical minerals is driving geostrategic shifts and competition for resources not seen since the time of the Cold War.
Several chapters delve into the colonial history of exploitation and scramble for resources by powerful outsiders. Much of the book’s focus is on the Democratic Republic of Congo, which possesses around half of the world’s supply of metals. Faced with exploitation, conflict, corruption, intrigue and the miserable conditions in which miners work, its people live in poverty while others in far-off lands benefit and enrich themselves from the country’s mineral resources. This highlights a key theme of the book — how rich countries use these resources for their green energy transition (as they produce no emissions) to get away from reliance on fossil fuels and find an answer to climate change. But it comes at the expense of environmental damage and abuses, including child labour, where these resources are mined. As the author puts it, at the bottom of the supply chain “people have toiled in squalid conditions, in poverty and human bondage to extract the minerals needed to make these batteries”.
The chapters on how China achieved major milestones in the development of the battery industry are particularly insightful. They zero in on how Chinese companies such as BYD succeeded in producing devices to store power. The country’s production of electric vehicles surged by leaps and bounds. By 2024, it was able to produce a million cars in a single month. Describing Chinese investment activity in Africa, Niarchos highlights the surge in its investments by the early 2010s. This filled a void left by the US and Europe who myopically gave the continent the cold shoulder. Meanwhile in 2023, China’s CATL became the world’s largest producer of lithium-ion batteries.

 

Niarchos notes that Washington, a late starter with modest investment, began to take serious interest after Trump’s return to power. He appointed his daughter Tiffany’s father-in-law, Massad Boulos, as senior adviser for Africa. Although his book doesn’t cover this, one of Trump’s major initiatives is Pax Silica. This is designed to build reliable supply chains for technologies needed for AI, especially silicon and critical minerals. While trying to boost domestic production aided by state intervention and capital, Trump has sought bilateral deals with many countries to gain access to resources.
For Niarchos it is important to address the moral dilemma concerning the detrimental effects of the new ‘energy revolution’. There is no easy answer to this, but he argues that investing in environmentally responsible mining should be encouraged to meet climate goals. Above all, it is necessary to listen to the people from whose land minerals are acquired, to their needs, pollution concerns and aspirations for a better, healthier world. “Such people,” he writes, “are commonly erased thanks to big-stakes financial dealings and complex, often deadly geopolitical games in the cutthroat competition of resources.”
He is, of course, right. But whether or not this message of his book reaches the corridors of power of big countries and is ever acted upon is an open question. What is certain, however, is that the global competition and battle for mineral resources is set to intensify.

Brenton Tarrant, an Australian former gym instructor, admitted carrying out New Zealand’s deadliest modern-day mass shooting before being sentenced to life in jail in August 2020.
Now, the convicted killer argues that his “torturous and inhumane” detention conditions during his trial made him incapable of making rational decisions when he pleaded guilty, according to a court synopsis of the case.
Tarrant is being held in a specialist unit for prisoners of extreme risk at Auckland Prison, seldom interacting with inmates or other people.
“I did not have the mind frame or mental health required to be making informed decisions at that time,” Tarrant told the court, according to the New Zealand Herald.
Tarrant said his state of mind was such that he had considered trying to implicate President Donald Trump in the crime.
Life without parole
“What I said at the time is ‘perhaps I could go out and say there was a second shooter on the roof, perhaps I could say it was Donald J Trump’,” he said, according to national broadcaster RNZ.
If the Court of Appeal in Wellington upholds Tarrant’s conviction, it would hold a separate hearing later in the year to consider an appeal against his sentence.
His penalty of life imprisonment without parole was the stiffest in New Zealand history.
Armed with an arsenal of semi-automatic weapons, Tarrant attacked worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch on March 15, 2019.
He published an online manifesto before the attacks and then livestreamed the killings for 17 minutes.
His victims were all Muslim and included children, women and the elderly.
‘Not prepared’
There are heavy restrictions on who can be in court during Monday’s appeal hearing, with only counsel, media and court officials allowed.
Families and friends of those killed or wounded in the attacks have been invited to watch proceedings in Christchurch remotely by video with a one-hour delay.
Members of the public are also able to watch the hearing by video link with a one-hour delay at a separate courtroom in Wellington.
Aya Al-Umari, whose brother Hussein was killed by Tarrant inside the Linwood mosque, told Christchurch’s The Press newspaper she had thought “this is the end of it” when Tarrant was sentenced.
“Little did you know that you are allowed to do this six years later. I was not prepared to do this,” she said.
The hearing is being held before three Court of Appeal judges.
In most Court of Appeal hearings the judges reserve their decision to be published at a later date, meaning a verdict is unlikely this week.
After Tarrant’s livestream, Facebook said it removed 1.5 million videos that proliferated within the first 24 hours showing the harrowing viral footage.
Then-prime minister Jacinda Ardern quickly moved to tighten gun laws in the aftermath and put pressure on social media giants to curb online extremism.

So when World Bank president Ajay Banga said that employment creation will remain a “binding constraint on growth” over the long term, he meant that, instead of being a problem to be dealt with later, the lack of jobs will limit how fast the economy can grow.
His warning that the country must create some 30m jobs over the next decade shows the scale of the challenge. In fact, current growth patterns are moving in the opposite direction as the data shows. The average annual GDP growth of just 1.7pc between 2022 and 2025, combined with high inflation, has eroded real incomes and weakened labour demand. Agriculture, manufacturing, construction and wholesale and retail trade that traditionally absorb the bulk of the workforce and together employ more than three-quarters of workers have experienced a decline. Manufacturing, construction, and trade have all contracted, shrinking the economy’s ability to produce jobs when millions of young people are entering the labour market each year.
The consequences are visible. The latest Labour Force Survey shows that our unemployment rate has risen to 7.1pc in FY25, the highest level in 21 years. Other estimates present an even bleaker picture. The Population and Housing Census 2023 puts the unemployment rate at 22pc, which means the youth find no space to work and prefer to leave the country if they find an opportunity.

 

Variations in the estimated extent of the problem apart, the underlying trend is unmistakable: job creation lags far behind workers’ expansion. With the labour force growing by roughly 3pc annually, sustained growth of at least 5pc or higher is necessary to prevent further deterioration in labour market conditions. This mismatch between growing labour supply and shrinking labour demand explains why employment has become, as Mr Banga described, Pakistan’s “North Star” policy challenge.
Without rapid job expansion, the demographic dividend risks turning into a liability, as seen in outward migration and social stress. The record outflow of skilled professionals going abroad in a single year signals that the employment problem is not limited to low-skilled workers; it is affecting highly trained human capital as well.

 

Equally troubling is the interaction between weak employment growth and declining real incomes. Cumulative inflation in recent years has outpaced income gains, resulting in a fall in real per capita household income and a rise in poverty risks. At the same time, inequality trends suggest that whatever limited growth has occurred has been unevenly distributed. When growth is both slow and unequal, the labour market becomes the primary channel through which economic stress is transmitted across society.

Though newspapers across the United States have been facing brutal industry headwinds, Lewis’s management of the outlet was sharply criticised by subscribers and employees alike during his two-year tenure as he tried to reverse financial losses at the daily.
Lewis, who is English, has been replaced by Jeff D’Onofrio, a former CEO of social media platform Tumblr who had joined the Post as chief financial officer last year, the paper announced.
In an email to staff shared on social media by one of the newspaper’s reporters, Lewis said it was “the right time for me to step aside.” A statement from the Post said only that D’Onofrio was succeeding Lewis “effective immediately”. Hundreds of Post journalists — including most of its overseas, local and sports staff — were let go in the sweeping cuts announced on Wednesday.
The Post did not disclose the number of jobs being eliminated, but The New York Times reported approximately 300 of its 800 journalists were laid off. The paper’s entire Middle East roster was let go as was its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent as the war with Russia grinds on.
Sports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported. Hundreds turned out Thursday at a protest in front of the paper’s headquarters in downtown Washington.
Newspapers across the country have cratered under falling revenues and subscriptions as they compete for eyeballs with social media, and as internet revenue pales in comparison to what print advertising once commanded.
However, national papers like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal have managed to weather the storm and come out financially solid — something the Post, even with a billionaire backer, has failed to do.
In Lewis’s note to staff, shared on X by White House bureau chief Matt Viser, Lewis said “difficult decisions have been taken” during his tenure “in order to ensure the sustainable future of The Post so it can for many years ahead publish high-quality nonpartisan news.”

“She has been sentenced to six years in prison for gathering and collusion to commit crimes,” lawyer Mostafa Nili said, adding that she had also received a two-year ban on leaving the country. Mohammadi was also handed a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda activities and is to be exiled for two years to the city of Khosf in the eastern province of South Khorasan, the lawyer stated. Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently.
Nili expressed hope that due to Mohammadi’s health issues, she could be temporarily “released on bail to receive treatment”. He added that the verdict issued was not final and could be appealed.
Over the past quarter-century, Mohammadi, 53, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her vocal campaigning against Iran’s use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.
Mohammadi has spent much of the past decade behind bars and has not seen her twin children, who live in Paris, since 2015. In December 2024, she was released on medical grounds, initially for three weeks, due to “her physical condition after the removal of a tumour and a bone graft”, according to her lawyer. However, she spent much of last year outside of custody, continuing to make statements in spite of her lawyers’ fears she could be sent back to prison. On Dec 12, Mohammadi was held in Mashhad with other activists after speaking at a ceremony honouring a lawyer who had been found dead.

Anutin set the stage for the snap election in mid-December during a border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, a move political analysts said appeared to be timed by the conservative leader to cash in on surging nationalism.
It is a gamble that paid off for a prime minister, who — having taken over after premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the populist Pheu Thai Party was ousted over the Cambodian crisis — then dissolved parliament less than 100 days later.

Reformist party leader concedes defeat

“Bhumjaithai’s victory today is a victory for all Thais, whether you voted for Bhumjaithai Party or not,” Anutin told a press briefing. “We have to do the utmost to serve the Thai people to our full ability.” With more than 90pc of polling stations reporting, preliminary results released by the election commission showed the Bhumjaithai Party with a sizeable lead over the progressive People’s Party in second place, followed by the once-dominant Pheu Thai Party.
People’s Party concedes defeat
The leader of Thailand’s reformist People’s Party, one of three main contenders, conceded defeat in the country’s general election on Sunday. “We acknowledge that we did not come first,” Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut told reporters at his party headquarters in Bangkok.
“We stand by our principle of respecting the party that finishes first and its right to form the government.”
Power to govern
When Anutin dissolved parliament in December, he cited dysfunction and infighting between rival parties as making it impossible to lead a minority government.
While the Bhumjaithai Party was unlikely to win a majority outright, the results suggest it is in a strong position to push through campaign pledges, said Napon Jatusripitak, a political scientist at the Bangkok-based Thailand Future think-tank. Those include implementing a consumer subsidy programme and ditching an agreement with Cambodia over maritime claims.
“For the first time in a long time, we will likely have a government that has sufficient effective power to govern,” he said. “We are seeing what I would describe as a marriage of convenience between technocrats, conservative elites, and traditional politicians.” Critical to Anutin’s success were his embrace of nationalism and Bhumjaithai’s strategy of winning over politicians from rival parties in rural areas, analysts said.
“The scale of its victory was unanticipated, perhaps demonstrating that the more nationalist political environment and its ability to consolidate the conservative electorate all worked in its favour,” said Mathis Lohatepanont, an independent political analyst.
Opinion polls
With a message of structural change and reforms to Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, the People’s Party had led most opinion polls during the campaign season. But in a survey conducted during the campaign’s final week and released on Sunday, the National Institute for Development Administration projected that Bhumjaithai would be the winner with between 140 and 150 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, ahead of 125-135 for the People’s Party.
The progressive party’s earlier support for Anutin as prime minister was likely a severe miscalculation, undermining its own ideological purity and allowing Bhumjaithai to attain the benefits of incumbency, Mathis said.
Natthaphong said he did not see the election as the result of any mistakes by his party, but instead highlighted that its opponents had not been complacent. “I’m not blaming any factors. Our responsibility now has to be to focus on the grassroots,” he said. “We’ve done a lot already but haven’t been able to crack what they have. It wasn’t good enough.”
Constitutional referendum
Thai voters were also asked during the vote to decide if a new constitution should replace a 2017 military-backed charter that critics say concentrated power in undemocratic institutions, including a powerful senate that is chosen through an indirect selection process with limited public participation.
The election commission’s early count showed voters backing the referendum by a margin of nearly two to one. Thailand has had 20 constitutions since the end of its absolute monarchy in 1932, with most of the changes coming in the wake of military coups. The new government and lawmakers can start the amendment process in parliament with two more referendums required to adopt a new constitution.

Following up on the World Bank president’s visit to Pakistan last week, both sides reviewed progress under the country partnership framework (CPF) and discussed the way forward to further strengthen development cooperation. The discussions covered priority sectors including energy, education, health, climate resilience, debt-for-development swaps, fiscal reforms and infrastructure development.
Emphasis was placed on adopting a more focused approach, introducing clear performance trackers and ensuring robust implementation mechanisms to translate commitments into tangible outcomes.
Ms Bjerde reaffirmed the World Bank’s strong commitment to Pakistan’s 10-year development programme amounting to $20 billion, underscoring the Bank’s continued support for Pakistan’s reform and development agenda. She highlighted the importance of sustained engagement and effective execution to maximise the programme’s developmental impact.
Pakistan, KSA discuss investment
Mr Aurangzeb and Saudi Economy and Planning Minister Faisal bin Fadhil Alibrahim on Sunday discussed investments and tech talent collaboration on the sidelines of the conference.







According to another statement, the two sides reviewed follow-ups on matters relating to Saudi investments in Pakistan and broader bilateral economic cooperation. The Saudi minister highlighted the high-quality artificial intelligence and technology talent being produced by Pakistan, noting that it ranks among the top one or two globally. He said Saudi Arabia was keen to leverage Pakistani tech talent to support the Kingdom’s technological transformation.
In this context, he referred to US businessman and former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt, who has also acknowledged the strength and potential of Pakistani technology professionals.
Mr Aurangzeb said Pakistan was planning to create a structured pipeline of skilled human resources for key international markets, including Saudi Arabia, to generate economic impact for both sides. The Saudi minister also noted progress on the Gulf Cooperation Council free trade agreement and emphasised prioritising increased trade and exchanges with Pakistan.

The report said 47 members (14pc) were absent for the entire session.
Among cabinet members from the National Assembly, only one federal minister — Khalid Hussain Magsi of the Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) — attended all sittings, while seven ministers did not attend any.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif did not attend any sitting. Other prominent figures who missed all sittings included former PM Nawaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.
The federal ministers who did not attend a single sitting were Ahsan Iqbal, Abdul Aleem Khan, Syed Mustafa Kamal, Awais Leghari, Amir Muqam, Aurangzeb Khichi and Muhammad Moeen. Chaudhry Salik Hussain, Chaudhry Tanvir Hussain and Raza Hayat Hiraj atten­ded one of the seven sittings.
The report also noted that PM Shehbaz’s son Hamza Shehbaz, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani’s son Ali Musa Gilani, PML-Q chief Chaudhry Shujaat Hussain’s nephew Hussain Elahi, and Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s wife Musarrat Khawaja missed all sittings. JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman attended one sitting, while PPP leader Aseefa Bhutto attended three and missed four.
Leader of the Opposition Mehmood Khan Achakzai attended all four sittings after his appointment on Jan 16, and two of the three sittings held before it.
The sixth sitting recorded the highest attendance, with 222 MNAs (67pc of the current membership) present. The third sitting had the lowest attendance, with 135 MNAs (41pc) in the House.
On the day of the highest attendance, the House observed a private members’ day and passed the Elections (Amen­dment) Bill, 2025, and the Corporate Social Responsibility Bill, 2025.
The elections bill sought to limit public disclosure of legislators’ assets and liabilities, citing security and privacy concerns. The CSR bill laid down guidelines for corporate social responsibility expenditure by for-profit companies registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan. During the sitting with the lowest attendance, eight government bills were introduced and two ordinances were laid.
Committee powers
Meanwhile, Fafen urged parliament to strengthen the committee system by operationalising Article 66 of the Constitution. through legislation that provides enforceable oversight powers.
Fafen said the lack of enabling legislation under Article 66(3) had left committee powers largely “symbolic”, weakening scrutiny of the executive. It also cited concerns raised in International Monetary Fund (IMF) assessments regarding weak enforcement of oversight mechanisms, executive dominance and limited transparency.

ISLAMABAD: Amid a decline in the revenue-to-GDP ratio despite purported reforms, the four provinces reached close to meeting their IMF-dictated annual target of delivering a cash surplus to the Centre within the first half of the current fiscal year.
The official fiscal operations data released by the Ministry of Finance for July-December 2025 suggest the four provinces returned Rs1.18 trillion in cash to the Centre, just Rs285 billion short of the Rs1.464tr target set for the whole under the IMF’s $7bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
During the same period last year, the provinces had jointly produced over 50 lower surpluses worth Rs775bn against the budgeted target of Rs1.2tr.
With its larger fiscal muscle, Punjab led the provinces by providing Rs609bn budget surplus in six months, followed by Sindh’s Rs354bn. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s PTI government was not to be left behind as it extended Rs175bn surplus, while Balochistan also came up with Rs41bn bounty to the Centre.
This helped the federal government in containing fiscal balance in Rs542bn surplus when compared to Rs1.5tr deficit of last year — a turnaround of almost four times.
The six-monthly fiscal surplus came in at 0.4pc of GDP in the current year when compared to a deficit of 1.3pc of GDP last year. Despite this improvement, primary balance — the gap between total revenues and expenditures excluding interest payments — stood at 3.2pc of GDP when compared to 3.1pc of GDP last year, showing little improvement in government expenses despite the so-called rightsizing and administrative reforms.
Except for Balochistan, all three provinces appeared to be in competition and put in extra effort to create fiscal surpluses, given their healthy shares or were hampered by their institutional capacity to spend on their people. The Punjab government spared Rs610bn for the Centre this year, almost 83pc greater than Rs333bn of last year. Sindh provided Rs354bn this year against Rs264bn of last year, up 34pc.
Despite being an opposition administration, KP more than doubled (up 103pc) its budget surplus to Rs175bn this year when compared to its Rs86bn of the first half of last year. Balochistan had extended a surplus of Rs92bn to the Centre in the first six months of the fiscal year last year, but more than halved to Rs41bn in the current year.
On the other hand, the country’s revenue-to-GDP ratio dropped to 8.2pc in the first six months this year when compared to 8.5pc of the same period last year despite additional measures and so-called reforms.
The decline here was on both fronts, ie tax and non-tax. The data showed the tax-to-GDP ratio falling from 5.3pc in July-December of last year to 5.2pc this year. Non-tax revenue to GDP ratio also dropped from 3.2pc last year to 3.1pc this year, despite a 50pc increase in petroleum development alone to Rs823bn.
The Ministry of Finance data suggested the Centre’s own total revenue collection also dropped to 4.8pc of GDP from 4.9pc last year. This was mainly because of a decline in direct taxes to 2.3pc of GDP in the current fiscal, down from 2.4pc last year.
While the share of customs and excise duties remained unchanged at 0.5pc and 0.3pc of GDP, the general sales tax collection also fell to 1.6pc of GDP from 1.7pc last year. Provincial collection also remained static at 0.4pc of GDP.
On the expenditure front, total expenditure dropped to 7.8pc of GDP in the first half of the current year from 9.9pc of GDP last year, chiefly because of lower interest costs following the State Bank’s policy rate cut by half to 11pc from a historic 22pc a year earlier. Of this, current expenditure was down to 7.4pc of GDP as of Dec 31 this year when compared to 8.8pc last year.
The Ministry of Finance reported that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) collected Rs6.161tr during the first half of the current fiscal year, an increase of Rs536bn compared to the amount collected in the corresponding period of last year, a growth of 10pc.
Non-tax revenue was reported at Rs3.799tr, which included Rs2.428tr profit received from the State Bank of Pakistan. Petroleum development levy collection stood at Rs823bn, an increase of 50pc compared to the corresponding period of last year.
Provincial tax collection showed a robust 28pc growth to Rs569bn, an increase of Rs126bn compared to the corresponding period of the last fiscal. Provincial non-tax revenue was Rs155bn, showing an increase of Rs12bn compared to the corresponding period of the previous year, a growth of 8pc.

NEW DELHI: Indian farmers on Monday slammed a new US trade deal as “a surrender to multinational agricultural giants”, calling for the commerce minister’s resignation as Congress accused Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi of capitulating to US President Donald Trump over the “Epstein files” release.
Congress leaders claimed an Indian minister, a businessman and individuals close to the prime minister were mentioned in the files, along with Modi.

 

According to a report in The Hindu, the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) demanded Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal’s immediate resignation as soon as he explained the details of the bilateral pact.
Leaders of the union representing apple and cotton growers said any relaxation on the import of cotton would be disastrous for the economies of Jammu and Kashmir, Him­­­­achal Pradesh, Mah­ar­ashtra and Gujarat.
Talking to reporters at a press conference on Saturday, SKM leaders called the framework for the interim agreement on bilateral trade a “total surrender” to America’s agriculture sector.
They cited the inclusion of dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruit, soybean oil, wine and spirits in the joint statement.
The leaders warned that the animal feed market would be completely monopolised by US companies.
SKM leaders urged farmers across the country to join protest demonstrations on Feb 12 and to support a general strike of workers as a “befitting reply to the anti-people Modi government”.
The leaders said Goyal’s claim that the agriculture and dairy sectors were excluded from the agreement was incorrect.
“Dairy products are part of the FTAs signed with the UK, New Zealand and European Union and the fresh revelations have undoubtedly proved the Commerce Minister is consciously propagating falsehood and betraying the farmers and the entire people,” the SKM statement said.
“SKM considers the role of Commerce Minister as a traitor and demands his immediate resignation.”
The organisation demanded that Prime Minister Modi desist from signing the India-US Free Trade Agreement or face “massive pan-India united mass struggles”.
Farmers’ leaders highlighted tariff disparities, noting that US tariffs on Indian goods rose from zero in 2023-24 to 18pc, while Indian tariff rates on US agriculture products dropped from between 30pc and 150pc to zero. They said this would make Indian agriculture hang by the noose of US MNCs.
The SKM also questioned Goyal’s position that the animal husbandry sector had requested imported feed. The group said poultry groups were the ones demanding feed based on maize and soybean to reduce minimum support prices for domestic crops.
“We have heard that the animal feed in US may contain non-vegetarian items too. Why does the government want our cows to eat non-vegetarian food?” asked Rakesh Tikait, a prominent SKM leader.
The statement also targeted the ruling party’s ideological parent organisation.
“The RSS had been claiming no import of milk of animals fed with meat. That was a non-tariff barrier,” the statement said. “Now, the RSS has been made to eat its own claim by ‘Master’ Donald Trump and they have cowed down completely.”
M.Y. Tarigami, leader of the Apple Farmers Federation of India and a Jammu and Kashmir lawmaker, said the trade deal would devastate regional economies.
“We have been facing problems in apple cultivation due to lack of marketing facilities and climatic challenges,” Tarigami said. “Farmers in both the states are already in distress. This announcement will be a huge setback for apple and tree nut growers.”
“In a state like Jammu and Kashmir, where there are no other economic avenues such as industry, the only source of income was cultivation of apples and dry fruits,” Tarigami added. “The Union government does not care about farmers here and is working for their masters in the United States.”
Protesting against the government’s lack of transparency regarding the deal, the Congress party on Friday displayed a poster reading “Trap Deal” at the main entrance of the Parliament complex.
Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge told reporters that President Trump pressured Modi into signing the deal because of the Epstein files.
“The truth is that over the past few days, Narendra Modi has been troubled because matters related to him have come up in the Epstein files. After that, Narendra Modi surrendered before Trump and struck a trade deal,” Kharge said.
“He sacrificed the country’s farmers. Modi is making our people poor and making America’s farmers rich.”

LONDON / PARIS / NEW DELHI: British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney has quit, he said in a statement on Sunday, as pressure intensifies on Starmer over his decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as ambassador to the United States.
Starmer is facing what is widely seen as the biggest crisis of his 18 months in power over his decision to send Mandelson to Washington in 2024, after files showed the extent of Mandelson’s relationship to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The departure of McSweeney, 48, a political strategist who was instrumental in Starmer’s rise to power, is yet another blow to the government.
With polls showing Starmer is hugely unpopular with voters, some in his own party are openly questioning his judgement and his future, and it remains to be seen whether McSweeney’s exit will be enough to silence his critics.
“The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself,” McSweeney said in a statement posted on X by political correspondents.







“When asked, I advised the prime minister to make that appointment and I take full responsibility for that advice.”
Starmer sacked Mandelson last September over his links to Epstein. Mandelson is now under police investigation for alleged misconduct in office.
The UK foreign ministry said on Sunday it was reviewing an exit payment to Mandelson.
Mandelson received an estimated pay-out of between £38,750 and £55,000 ($52,000 and $74,000) after only seven months in the job as British ambassador to the US, according to a report in the Sunday Times.
Dalai Lama denies ties
The office of the Dalai Lama said on Sunday that he had never met Epstein, after Chinese media reported the Tibetan Buddhist leader’s name was mentioned in a cache of files released by the US government.
An AFP search of the files found the Dalai Lama’s name was mentioned more than 150 times with no mention of him meeting or interacting with Epstein.
“Some recent media reports and social media posts concerning the ‘Epstein files’ are attempting to link His Holiness the Dalai Lama with Jeffrey Epstein,” the leader’s office said in a statement posted on X.







“We can unequivocally confirm that His Holiness has never met Jeffrey Epstein or authorised any meeting or interaction with him by anyone on His Holiness’s behalf,” it added.
Forced to step down as IMA chief
Veteran French politician Jack Lang, a former minister, was forced out of a key cultural post — president of the Arab World Institute (IMA) — on Saturday as pressure grew on him over revelations in the latest release of the Epstein files.
He offered to resign in a letter to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who told reporters he planned to launch the process to name an interim president for the IMA.
But Lang continued to insist he was innocent of any wrongdoing.
Lang, who has headed the IMA since 2013, is the most high-profile public figure in France caught up in the latest release of private messages from the convicted sex offender.
“I offer to submit my resignation” at the next board meeting, the 86-year-old wrote in the letter, seen by AFP.
On Friday, French prosecutors said they had opened a preliminary investigation of Lang and his daughter Caroline over “laundering of aggravated tax-fraud proceeds” after they were mentioned in files related to Epstein.

“Criminalising the resistance, its weapons, and those who carried it out is something we should not accept,” Khaled Meshal said at a conference in Doha.
“As long as there is occupation, there is resistance. Resistance is a right of peoples under occupation … something nations take pride in,” said Meshal, who previously headed the group.
Hamas has waged an armed struggle against Israel’s occupation of the Palestinian territories. A US-brokered “ceasefire” in Gaza is in its second phase, which foresees demilitarisation of the territory — including the disarmament of Hamas — along with a gradual withdrawal of Israeli forces.

Top leader Meshal urges ‘Board of Peace’ to take ‘balanced approach’

Hamas has repeatedly said that disarmament is a red line, although it has indicated it could consider handing over its weapons to a future Palestinian governing authority.
Israeli officials claim that Hamas still has around 20,000 fighters and about 60,000 Kalashnikovs in Gaza.
A Palestinian technocratic committee has been set up with a goal of taking over the day-to-day governance in the battered Gaza Strip, but it remains unclear whether, or how, it will address the issue of demilitarisation.
The committee operates under the so-called “Board of Peace”, an initiative launched by US President Donald Trump.
Originally conceived to oversee the Gaza truce and post-war reconstruction, the board’s mandate has since expanded, prompting conce­rns among critics that it could evo­lve into a rival to the United Nations.
Trump unveiled the board at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss ski resort of Davos last month, where leaders and officials from nearly two dozen countries joined him in signing its founding charter.
Alongside the “Board of Peace”, Trump also created a Gaza Exe­cutive Board — an advisory panel to the Palestinian technocratic committee — comprising international figures including US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, as well as controversial former British prime minister Tony Blair.
On Sunday, Meshal urged the “Board of Peace” to adopt what he called a “balanced approach” that would allow for Gaza’s reconstruction and the flow of aid to its roughly 2.2 million residents, while warning that Hamas would “not accept foreign rule” over Palestinian territory.
“We adhere to our national principles and reject the logic of guardianship, external intervention, or the return of a mandate in any form,” Meshal said.
“Palestinians are to govern Pale­s­t­inians. Gaza belongs to the people of Gaza and to Palestine. We will not accept foreign rule,” he added.
Meanwhile, around 180 Pales­tinians left the Gaza Strip since Feb 2 when the Rafah crossing with Egypt was partially reopened, according to officials in the territory.
The Rafah crossing is the only gateway left for Palestinians in Gaza to the outside world that does not pass through Israel.
Between Monday and Thursday, 135 people crossed into Egypt from Gaza through the crossing, mostly patients and their companions, according to Ismail al-Thawabteh, head of the Hamas-run media office in the Palestinian territory. He said the crossing was closed on Friday and Saturday.
The Palestinian Red Crescent Society confirmed that 135 residents of Gaza had left through the crossing between Feb 2 and 5. On Sunday, another 44 people, including 19 patients, left the Gaza Strip through the crossing to Egypt, Mohammed Abu Salmiya, director of the territory’s main Al-Shifa Hospital, said.

LAHORE / ISLAMABAD / PESHAWAR / QUETTA: Most of the markets in Lah­ore and Islamabad were open on Sunday, despite a strike call by opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) in protest of alleged discrepancies in the 2024 general elections.
A partial shutdown was observed in Peshawar, while a complete shutdown strike was reported from Quetta.
The PTI, a part of the TTAP, had announced a strike for Sunday to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8, 2024, general elections, which it alleges were marred by rigging.
The party also said it will observe a day of mourning following Friday’s suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad that claimed at least 36 lives.
In the evening, the TTAP could not hold a torch-bearing rally outside Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque as planned, claiming road closures and the arrest of over two dozen workers.
Despite the alleged arre­sts of over two dozen workers — including eight women — and road closures, Senate Opposition Leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, former senator Mushtaq Ahmed, and other TTAP leaders Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, Akhu­nzada Hussain Ahmed Yousafzai and Amir Mughal managed to reach the site.
Mr Khokhar said, “It is the start of the movement and should not be considered as a one-day event.”
Mr Mughal, the PTI’s Islamabad chapter president, alleged that police had already started a crackdown on party workers. He claimed that over two dozen workers, including eight women, were taken into custody from Sector E-7, where Faisal Mosque is located.

However, police did not confirm the arrest of any PTI worker.
Mixed response
In KP, the PTI said it would hold rallies and processions at district and tehsil levels. Some traders and transport unions also agreed to join the party’s protest.
A partial strike was being observed in Peshawar’s interior city. Shops in Qissa Khwani Bazaar and other streets of the interior city were mostly open, but those in Hashtnagri and Rampura were closed.
PTI workers from across the city gathered at Hash­tnagri Bazaar from where they took out a protest. Upon reaching the historic Chowk Yadgar, the rally’s venue, the procession converted into a public gathering, which was addressed by the PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan and others.
PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said in a post on X that there was a shutter-down strike in Haripur Bazaar and a “total public transport wheel jam”.
Meanwhile, daily life in Karachi and other parts of Sindh remained largely unaffected on Sunday. How­ever, police blocked many roads across the city, especially in the areas leading to the Karachi Press Club and the Election Commission of Pakistan, to thwart any protest by the opposition alliance.
All Karachi Tajir Ittehad Chairman Atiq Mir told Dawn that although markets were shut, the reason was that it was a public holiday.
He said 100 markets at Jodia Bazaar, 50 markets in Saddar, 40 markets on Tariq Road and around 40 markets in Clifton and Defence Housing Authority (DHA) were closed.
But he clarified, “Generally, Sunday is a public holiday and most markets remain closed. However, vendors usually do business on Sunday.”
Nevertheless, PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh shared pictures, saying that Jackson Electronics Market was among the bazaars shut in Karachi’s Keamari district.
In Punjab, markets in Lah­ore exhibited the usual Sunday momentum, with rou­tine traffic movement obse­rved. Most markers remained closed due to Sunday and the Basant festival, which was in its last day.
The PTI’s Lahore chapter claimed on X at 11:45am that police had reached Sujawal Bridge in Sadiqabad to force people to open their shops.
Meanwhile, most markets in Islamabad and Rawalpindi remained open on Sunday as traders did not heed the PTI’s strike call. These included the main markets in different sectors and sub-sectors of the city.
While Sunday bazaars act as a litmus test for such calls by political parties, the H-9 weekly bazaar remained open. A Dawn correspondent reported that a large number of people were visiting the weekly bazaar.
Strike in Balochistan
Meanwhile, a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike was reported in Quetta. All shops, markets, shopping malls and bazaars were shut. Traffic on the roads was also thin, with some roads in the city closed due to traffic.
Mobile internet services have been suspended again, a Dawn correspondent reported.
Workers of the PTI and the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), headed by TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai, staged demonstrations in some areas of the city.
Arrests were also reported in the city. There were also reports about cops detaining several political workers who were forcibly closing shops and blocking roads.
In a post on X, PTI’s Balochistan chapter shared a list of 40 TTAP workers it claimed had been arrested so far.







Clashes also took place in the Brewery and Khaizi Chowk areas along the Western Bypass between police and political workers as they had blocked the road by burning tyres and putting up barricades.
The same situation was also witnessed in the Eastern Bypass area, which was closed in the morning, but people started their businesses and opened shops in the Bosa Mandi area after 1pm.
Reports reaching from Chaman, Qila Saifullah, Qila Abdullah, Pishin, Harnai, Duki, Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Muslim Bagh, Loralai, Barkhan, Usta Muhammad, Nasirabad and other areas suggested that small protest demonstrations of PTI and other parties, including PkMAP, were held.
PTI hails public ‘response’
In a statement on X, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja asserted that a strike was a “documented Constitutional method to express irritation with the system”.
He said the public could express their “hatred towards lies and oppression from their doorsteps” in this way. “Shop closed, vehicle jammed. No tyrant can compare to 250 million. Today is the day of a strike.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi congratulated all participating parties for a “successful” shutter-down and wheel-jam strike.
PTI leader Asad Qaiser also congratulated the nation on the “successful” observance of Feb 8 as a “black day”.
Talking to Dawn, he claimed that at a number of places, including Swabi, “powers that be forced people to open their shops and also threatened transporters that strict action will be taken if they do not bring their vehicles on the road”.
On the other hand, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said in a post on X: “ZERO protest/strike/shutter down in Punjab. ZERO.”

The crackdown, launched on the special directives of Inspector General of Police Balochistan Mohammad Tahir Khan also resulted in the safe recovery of six kidnapped persons during operations in Quetta and districts across seven ranges. 
Police recovered a large cache of weapons, including 135 pistols, 19 revolvers, 20 Kalashnikovs, 1,329 rounds of ammunition and 114 magazines. Officials said 148 cases were registered specifically against criminals, leading to the arrest of 147 suspects from whom weapons and ammunition were seized. 
Regarding narcotics enforcement, 204 cases were registered against drug peddlers, resulting in the arrest of 213 individuals.  

Six kidnapped victims, huge cache of illegal firearms recovered; thousands of kilograms of narcotics confiscated

Police recovered huge quantities of narcotics, including over 2,799 kilograms of hashish, 2,442 kilograms of crystal meth, also known as ice, and 1,687 kilograms of opium. Other seizures included 10 kilograms of bhang, 84 grams of heroin, 573 bottles of liquor and 129 cans of beer. 
During the crackdown, police recovered six stolen vehicles, 67 motorcycles, 24 mobile phones and 35 tola of gold. Officials said they also arrested 155 proclaimed offenders and 342 absconders, while detaining 841 suspects involved in various crimes. 
Authorities also seized 165,000 rupees in cash, 4,950 litres of Iranian diesel and 21,376 litres of Iranian petrol. Additionally, 2,010 cartons of Iranian cigarettes and 68 banned and illegal medicines were confiscated. 
Balochistan Police said they remain committed to protecting the lives and property of citizens and are utilising all available resources, with public cooperation, to “prevent crime and ensure a peaceful and secure environment across the province”.

The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion.
After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that.
Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told Dawn that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan.
They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.”
The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source.
They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.”
The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.”







Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings.
Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.







Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said.
The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter.







Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting.
Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials.







The high-level visits come a day after the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup commenced.
The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who refused to play in India citing security concerns, were replaced by Scotland.
Bangladesh remained firm on not taking part in the event after the ICC rejected their request to move their matches to Sri Lanka.
After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan gave its cricket team the nod to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.

 

In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.
It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.
“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.
A government source told Dawn at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.
According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.
“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.
Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.
It was reported earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.
Sri Lanka’s cricket board asked Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.
Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 economic meltdown.
Pakistan, who edged out the Netherlands in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.
Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again consult the government.</p><small>2026-02-08 21:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/649800-pm-shehbaz-expected-to-attend-first-trump-initiated-gaza-board-of-peace-meeting' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz expected to attend first Trump‑launched 'Board of Peace' meeting</strong></a><br><p>
