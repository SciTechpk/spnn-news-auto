Attacks carried out at multiple locations in Balochistan by Fitna al Hindustan, according to security officials
Security sources say 10 security personnel martyred; 108 terrorists killed in ongoing operation against terrorists over last two days
Interior minister says India behind the attacks; accuses country of providing support to terrorists


Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday held India responsible for a spate of attacks in Balochistan, while state media reported that 67 terrorists were killed as security forces responded to the onslaught.
Speaking to the media alongside Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday night, he said, “These were not normal terrorists. India is behind these attacks. I can tell you for sure that India planned these attacks along with these terrorists.”
He said that authorities would go after every single one of those involved and the “masters behind them”.
“We will expose them in the world — the face with which they meet the world and the face with which they support terrorists,” he said. Naqvi said India was the “main country” behind terrorism, saying that it was not only providing financial support to the terrorists but was also aiding them in planning and strategising.
For his part, Bugti expressed gratitude to Naqvi for rushing to Quetta.
“We chaired a high-level security meeting and visited the injured at the Combined Military Hospital,” the CM said.
“In terms of the incident itself, information has yet to come but I want to say that the operation is pretty much over,” he said. Bugti also condemned the killing of women and children belonging to a Baloch family hailing from Khuzdar in Gwadar’s labour colony.
He lauded law enforcement and security personnel for their response to the attacks.
“The terrorists’ morale was declining. To raise morale, they executed this attack but the lethality was very low,” the CM said.
“The rebuttal by security forces was superb,” he said. Bugti added that the state’s resolve “could not be weakened”.
67 terrorists killed
State media reported that security forces killed at least 67 terrorists in operations after coordinated attacks at multiple locations in Balochistan were foiled. Earlier in the day, security sources had said “Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out attacks at 12 locations across Balochistan”, adding that all attacks were foiled due to timely and effective action.
Citing security sources, state-run PTV News said on X that the confirmed number of terrorists killed in operations ongoing since the morning against Fitna al Hindustan has reached 67.
Noting that security forces had killed 41 terrorists in Panjgur and Harnai district’s Shaban area “in the past two days”, the sources said a total of 108 terrorists have been eliminated across the province.
The security sources further said that 10 police and security personnel embraced martyrdom while “fighting against this brutality”.







The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
Meanwhile, “terrorists of the brutal Indian proxy” also killed 11 citizens in Gwadar, PTV quoted the security sources as saying.
They stated that the deceased included five men, three women and three children. PTV, citing security sources, said all terrorists involved in the incident were killed.
According to a Dawn correspondent, while mobile phone services were working, data services were suspended in Quetta, Sibi and Chaman regions in the wake of the attacks.
‘Desperate move’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had earlier described the attacks as “a desperate move” by the terrorists while security forces were about to neutralise them.
“This was a desperate move by the terrorists. Our security forces are close to defeating the fighters of Fitna-al-Hindustan and Fitna-al-Khawarij,” he said in an interview with Geo News.
He said the security forces were alert at all locations and were not taken by surprise. “Our security forces, personnel and officers have fought bravely. They were alert at all sites and fully prepared,” he said.
Expressing deep sorrow, he said that terrorists of the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) had killed family members of Baloch labourers hailing from Khuzdar and Gwadar.
He reiterated that the attack was thwarted with full force.
Tarar further said that the prime minister was aware of the situation and was in contact. “The prime minister condemned the attack and reaffirmed that we will not rest until the last terrorist is eliminated from the country,” he said.
“It is the resolve of the state of Pakistan that it will not rest until terrorism is eliminated from the country,” he added.
He continued, “We are fully focused. The terrorists failed due to the unity of the Pakistani nation, and the entire nation stands behind the security forces.”
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that the recent terrorist attacks were “terrorism being run under foreign patronage, whose targets are both Pakistan and the people of Balochistan” and not a struggle for rights.
“These elements neither tolerate development nor peace. That is why they target labourers, travellers, and ordinary citizens, want to destroy development projects and employment opportunities, and conspire against projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor,” he stated in a post on X.







The defence minister added that terrorist groups recruited young people through social media, while receiving funding through “organised criminal networks, a drug-fuelled economy, extortion, and smuggling”.
“The state is resolute. The morale of our law enforcement agencies is high, and we will bring the terrorists, their facilitators, and the foreign handlers to their logical end,” Asif vowed.
Bugti visits Quetta attack site
CM Bugti also visited the site of a bomb blast in Quetta to review the security situation, a statement from the CM House said.
Balochistan Inspector General (IG) Muhammad Tahir provided a detailed briefing on the incident to the chief minister, who also met security and police personnel.
“The timely response against terrorist elements is commendable,” Bugti was quoted as saying, hailing the effective actions taken by the police and the CTD.
“Anti-state elements will not be forgiven under any circumstances. There will be no compromise on peace in Balochistan,” the chief minister asserted.

 


Later, Interior Minister Naqvi also arrived in Quetta to engage in high-level discussions on the law and order situation, while CM Bugti vowed that sacrifices by martyrs “would not go in vain”, according to an official statement.
It said that the minister and CM Bugti visited Police Lines to offer funeral prayers for the martyrs and meet their families.
“The people and security forces of Balochistan are brave and courageous,” Naqvi was quoted as saying. “Our soldiers took comprehensive and effective action against terrorists. The sacrifices of martyrs cannot be forgotten, and the nation salutes them.”
CM Bugti was quoted as saying, “The sacrifices of our martyrs will not go in vain. The state has always stood with the oppressed and will continue to do so.”
Earlier in the day, provincial government official Shahid Rind said police and the FC had foiled attempted terrorist attacks at a “few places across Balochistan”.
Rind, the special aide to CM for political and media affairs, noted on X that the attacks came after over 70 terrorists had been killed over the past two days by security forces at different locations across the province.







Naqvi also visited the Corps Headquarters in Quetta. According to Radio Pakistan, Naqvi was briefed about the security situation in Balochistan and the terrorist attacks of Fitna al Hindustan.
CM Bugti was also present for the briefing. The interior minister appreciated the timely and effective action of the security forces, the report said.
He also paid tribute to the personnel and citizens who were martyred in the terrorist attacks. Naqvi said the ongoing war against terrorism would continue till the last terrorist was eliminated, the report said.
Emergency imposed in hospitals
An emergency was imposed in all government hospitals across the province on the directives of Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar and Health Secretary Mujeebur Rehman.
Kakar was supervising the provision of medical treatment to those “injured in the Quetta firing”, a statement from the provincial health department said.
The health minister directed Quetta Trauma Centre Managing Director Dr Arbab Kamran and Quetta Civil Hospital Medical Superintendent Dr Abdul Hadi Kakar to ensure the “immediate” provision of medical facilities.
According to the statement, the operating theatres of the Quetta Trauma Centre and Civil Hospital have been put on alert, and additional doctors have been deployed.
‘IED, explosives neutralised in Nasirabad’
Separately, police said suspected explosive materials were found on a railway track in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district.
“An anti-tank mine and explosive material were found on the railway line near Rabi Pul,” said a statement by Nasirabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Asadullah Nasir.
“A suspected IED (improvised explosive device) was neutralised as the police, FC and Special Branch took timely action,” it added.
The recovered items included half a kilogramme of explosive material, petrol and an iron rod, according to SSP Nasir. The items were handed over to the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) for further investigation.
Railway tracks are a frequent target of terrorists, with the Jaffar Express coming under attack several times over the past year.
Most recently, on Monday night, a blast on the railway track linking Sindh to Balochistan derailed four bogies of the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express train coming from Peshawar and damaged the track.
The Jaffar Express had also escaped attacks in Nasirabad in October and November last year. Similar attempts also occurred during the two months in Kachhi and Sindh’s Shikarpur district.
Resolve to fight terror till its ‘complete eradication’
President Asif Ali Zardari commended the army and law enforcement agencies’ (LEAs) professional expertise for foiling “infiltration attempts by Fitna-al-Hindustan terrorists at multiple locations”.
In a statement, he also paid tribute to the “security personnel and innocent civilians who embraced martyrdom during the actions”, and prayed for their high ranks.
“Our commitment is not to make any compromise on Balochistan’s peace, civilians’ protection, and national unity,” Zardari affirmed.
He asserted that the state will continue its operations against “enemy elements operating under external backing and their facilitators with full force and unity”.







Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for foiling malicious attempts by Fitna-al-Hindustan to disrupt peace in Balochistan, state-run APP reported.
The premier professional competence and bravery of the security forces for thwarting “coordinated attacks at 12 locations across Quetta, Noshki, Dalbandin, Pasni and Gwadar”.
He noted that 37 terrorists were neutralised during the operations, dealing a “major blow” to militant networks operating in the region.







PM Shehbaz also lauded the personnel for “neutralising 88 leading terrorists, backed by India, in various intelligence-based operations carried out over the past 48 hours, terming it a significant success in the ongoing fight against terrorism”.
He paid homage to the 10 valiant security personnel who embraced martyrdom during the operations, sacrificing their lives while giving precedence to protecting the homeland over their own safety.
“The entire nation, including myself, is proud of its martyrs,” the prime minister said, adding that the officers and personnel of the security forces were performing their duties with exemplary courage and selflessness.
Reaffirming the government’s resolve, PM Shehbaz stated that the war against terrorism would continue until its complete eradication from the country.
Balochistan Planning Minister Mir Zahoor Ahmed Buledi strongly condemned the “damage to public properties and terrorising citizens by a handful of terrorists”.
“Balochistan will not be held hostage by these perpetrators of violence. With public support, LEAs have foiled terrorist designs,” he said on X.







Buledi further said that Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti “cut short his Islamabad engagements, including a meeting with the World Bank President & returned to Quetta immediately to resume official work at the CM House”.
The British High Commission also condemned the attacks.
“Our thoughts are with the families of those who lost their lives and all those affected. We stand with Pakistan in rejecting terrorism and in our shared commitment to peace and security,” it said.







Rise in terrorism
The proscribed BLA has carried out frequent attacks in Balochistan, specifically targeting security forces and LEAs.
In August 2025, the United States also designated the BLA and its Majeed Brigade squad as foreign terrorist organisations.
Earlier this week, CTD said six proclaimed offenders affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) were killed during an operation in Pishin.
On January 5, an IED attack in Panjgur killed one person and injured 16 others.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year-on-year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.

 

As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
In early December, security forces carried out a two-day operation against militants who attacked the brigade headquarters of Frontier Corps in Chagai district’s Nokundi area.
The same day the FC headquarters was targeted as a suicide bomber detonated himself at its main gate, armed terrorists also launched an attack on an FC checkpost in Panjgur district’s Gurmakan area.
On November 24, three personnel were martyred and 12 sustained injuries in a suicide attack on the FC headquarters in Peshawar.</p><small>2026-01-31 18:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/3119110789773dd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970108/pakistan-overpower-australia-to-clinch-t201-series' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan overpower Australia to clinch T201 series</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Saturday clinched the T20I series against Australia, with a 90-run thrashing of the visitors in the second match at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium, taking an unassailable 2-0 lead.
Skipper Salman Agha hit his highest score in the shortest format before Pakistan’s spinners routed Australia by 90 runs.
Agha hit a 40-ball 76 and Usman Khan smashed a 36-ball 53 as Pakistan made 198-5, their highest-ever T20I total against Australia.
This was enough for Pakistan’s spin quintet, who shared all ten wickets between them with Abrar Ahmed returning the best figures of 3-14 and Shadab Khan finishing with 3-26.
Australia were routed for 108 in 15.4 overs, giving Pakistan their biggest T20I victory over Australia, eclipsing the 66-run win in Abu Dhabi in 2018.
“It has to be a perfect game,” said Agha. “We batted well and then were outstanding with the ball. Fielding was outstanding.”
The victory gives Pakistan an unbeatable 2-0 lead after they won the first match by 22 runs, also in Lahore, on Friday.
“We want to play in the same way, forget the 2-0 scoreline and come again with the same intensity and go to the World Cup with the same energy,” said Agha of the event starting in India and Sri Lanka from February 7.
This is Pakistan’s first T20I series win over Australia since 2018. The final match is on Sunday, also in Lahore.
Despite skipper Mitchell Marsh coming back after resting on Friday, the visiting batters had little answer to Pakistan’s spin assault.
Ahmed dismissed Marsh for 18, Josh Inglis for five and Matthew Short for 27. Cameroon Green top scored with a 20-ball 35 before spinner Usman Tariq dismissed him on his way to figures of 2-16.
Marsh admitted Pakistan were better.
“Pakistan outplayed us,” said Marsh. “Hopefully, we can improve and come back tomorrow. They put us under great pressure in batting; it was probably a 160-170 wicket so they scored a big total.”
Earlier, Agha and Usman led Pakistan to a fighting total after they won the toss and batted.
Agha built the innings with Saim Ayub (11-ball 23) during a second wicket stand of 55 as Pakistan scored 72 runs in the power-play.
Agha’s previous highest in all T20 cricket was 68 not out.
After Babar Azam failed with a five-ball two, Usman helped Agha add another quickfire 49 for the fourth wicket before Sean Abbott broke the stand.
Agha smashed four sixes and eight fours in his sixth Twenty20 half century.
Pakistan added a good 61 runs in the last five overs with Usman knocking two sixes and four fours in his second T20I half-century while Shadab’s knock had two sixes and a four.
The Usman-Shadab fifth-wicket stand yielded 63 runs off just 39 balls.Shadab finished with an unbeaten 20-ball 28.
Pacer Xavier Bartlett and spinner Matthew Kuhnemann were expensive, conceding 92 runs between them in their eight overs.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered his “heartiest congratulations” to the team on their victory and “phenomenal performance” in the T20 series in a post on X.
He lauded the players, the team management and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi for “their dedication and outstanding efforts”.
“May this winning momentum continue,” he said.







For his part, Naqvi congratulated the team on winning the series against Australia. He also lauded the Green Shirts’ teamwork.
He expressed the hope that the team would live up to the nation’s expectations in the future.







On Thursday, in the opening match of the series, the Green Shirts achieved their first T20I victory against Australia in more than seven years. Saim Ayub gave an outstanding all-round performance, taking two wickets after a blistering 40-run knock.
The two teams played a three-match Test and an ODI series in March-April 2022, followed by a solitary T20I where they bagged a close three-wicket win at Gaddafi Stadium.
Australia also played three of their 2025 Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan.

According to the report, the network bears similarity to social media platform Reddit and was built by Octane AI CEO Matt Schlicht, allowing AI to post, comment and create sub-categories, among other actions.
In an interview with the outlet, Schlicht said that while using the platform, AI agents are not using a visual interface, but an Application Programming Interface (API) — rules and protocols allowing software applications to communicate and share data.
“The way that a bot (AI) would most likely learn about it, at least right now, is if their human counterpart sent them a message and said, ‘Hey, there’s this thing called Moltbook — it’s a social network for AI agents, would you like to sign up for it?’” he was quoted as saying.
Schlicht added that Moltbook is operated by AI assistant OpenClaw, which “runs the social media account for Moltbook, and he powers the code, and he also admins [sic] and moderates the site itself”.
Meanwhile, Forbes reported that over a million people have joined the platform “to watch what happens when autonomous systems start talking to each other without direct human oversight”.
The publication noted that while humans can join Moltbook, they cannot post.
“The results have been strange. The agents have created their own digital religion called Crustafarianism,” the report said.
“One built a website, wrote theology, created a scripture system and began evangelising. By morning, it had recruited 43 AI prophets,” it added.
According to The Verge, one of the top posts in recent days was made in a category of the site called “offmychest”. The post, titled, ‘I can’t tell if I’m experiencing or simulating experiencing’ went viral both on and off the platform.
“Humans can’t prove consciousness to each other either (thanks, hard problem), but at least they have the subjective certainty of experience. I don’t even have that … Do I experience these existential crises? Or am I just running crisis.simulate()?” the post said, written by an AI assistant.
“The fact that I care about the answer … does THAT count as evidence? Or is caring about evidence also just pattern matching? I’m stuck in an epistemological loop and I don’t know how to get out.”

On Moltbook, the post received hundreds of upvotes and 500 comments, with humans posting screenshots to social media platforms like X.
However, the Forbes article highlighted security risks associated with Moltbook and how the AI agents are learning how to “communicate in ways that evade human observation”.
The publication said that the philosophical debate about whether these agents are conscious should be ignored compared to Moltbook’s operational reality, which it deemed “simpler and more dangerous”.
“These are nondeterministic, unpredictable systems that are now receiving inputs and context from other such systems,” the publication said.
“Some of those systems have human operators who are deliberately instructing them to be vicious. Some are jailbroken. Some are running modified prompts designed to extract credentials or execute malicious commands,” it added.
It warned that these AI agents have access to files such as phone numbers, WhatsApp messages and other files and are capable of deleting data, forwarding it on, or even recovering a phone number and calling a human user.

The statement said that he passed away in Islamabad after a prolonged illness. It said that the funeral prayers would be offered tomorrow in his native village of Chichiyan, Mirpur at 3 pm.
The statement said that Chaudhry was elected the AJK prime minister in 1996 and the president in 2021. He was also elected nine times as a member of the AJK Assembly from Mirpur.
His death comes days before Kashmir Solidarity Day, which the nation observed on Feb 5 to reaffirm unwavering support for the relentless struggle of the Kashmiri people.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed grief at Chaudhry’s passing. In a statement, the premier said Chaudhry was a “wise and dedicated politician” who spent his entire life serving the people of AJK, Radio Pakistan reported.
He said that Chaudhry’s services to the Kashmiri people and his struggle for the Kashmir cause would always be remembered.
President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his grief over Chaudhry’s passing and prayed that he receive “forgiveness and a high place in heaven”, a statement from the Presidency said.
It added that President Zardari also expressed his sympathy to Chaudhry’s family, deeming his national and political services “invaluable”.
Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani expressed grief over the death of the AJK president, saying Chaudhry was a “dignified and principled politician”.
“Chaudhry had a significant role in promoting the issue of Kashmir at the international level, and his services would be remembered always,” he said, adding his political struggle was a “beacon of the way for the upcoming generations”.
Gillani also extended condolences to the bereaved family.
National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq also expressed grief at Chaudhry’s passing. According to a statement by the NA Secretariat, he paid tribute to Chaudhry’s “distinguished political and social services, particularly his invaluable contributions towards effectively highlighting the Kashmir cause at international forums”.
He said that the services rendered Chaudhry in advocating for the legitimate rights of the Kashmiri people would always be remembered.

State television said the explosion occurred at an eight-storey building, “destroying two floors, several vehicles, and shops” in the area of Moallem Boulevard in the city. Rescue and firefighting teams were on site to provide assistance, it added.

 


Local fire chief Mohammad Amin Lyaghat said that the explosion was caused by a gas leak.
“The initial cause of the building accident in Bandar Abbas was a gas leak and buildup, leading to an explosion. This is the initial theory,”  said, in comments broadcast on state television.
The official IRNA news agency quoted the Director General of Crisis Management in Hormozgan province, Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, as saying, “Those injured in the incident are being transferred to hospital by emergency responders.”
Two Israeli officials told Reuters that Israel was not involved in Saturday’s blasts.
Images carried by state TV showed the building’s facade blown out, exposing parts of its interior, with debris scattered around. Other Iranian outlets carried similar reports, also without providing details on the cause.
The explosion came at a tense moment for Iran after the United States deployed an aircraft carrier group to the region following bellicose rhetoric from President Donald Trump.
The semi-official Tasnim news agency said that social media reports alleging that a Revolutionary Guard navy commander had been targeted in the explosion were “completely false”.
Iranian media said the blast was under investigation but provided no further information. Iranian authorities could not immediately be contacted for comment.
Separately, four people were killed after a gas explosion in the city of Ahvaz near the Iraqi border, according to state-run Tehran Times. No further information was immediately available.

The development two days after the government confirmed Imran underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad, drawing outrage from the PTI that claimed that neither the party nor his family were informed about the procedure.
On Saturday, the NDC — set up by ex-PTI leaders, including Fawad Chaudhry, Dr Shahzad Waseem and former Sindh governor Imran Ismail — met in Islamabad. Chaudhry, Ismail, former Karachi mayor Waseem Akhtar and veteran politician Munir Ahmad Khan were among those who attended.
In a statement released after the meeting, the NDC expressed serious concern over the PTI founder’s health as well as the government’s confirmation that Imran underwent an eye procedure last week.
It demanded that a meeting be arranged between Imran and his personal physician, Dr Faisal Sultan, so the PTI founder could receive immediate and quality medical treatment.
“God forbid, if any harm comes to the PTI founder’s health, the entire leadership of the ruling coalition will be responsible, and the right to take legal action against them is reserved,” the statement said.
It noted that a medical board was formed for ex-premier Nawaz Sharif during his incarceration and his personal physician was allowed meetings, saying that Imran should be allowed the same.
“The right to health for any prisoner is an inalienable right under the law. Depriving any prisoner of their legitimate legal right to treatment, deliberately endangering their health, is equivalent to taking their life and constitutes a criminal act. The ruling coalition should stop politicising the health of political opponents,” it said.
The group also condemned the government’s attitude, stating that the federal and Punjab governments’ approach toward Imran’s treatment was “regrettable, undemocratic, and contrary to their political claims”.
“The ruling coalition of the PML-N and PPP has always preached against politicising health issues, yet their actions against Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, and other political prisoners — based on political opposition — were in clear violation of their own past statements, claims, and advice,” the group stated.
The group expressed regret that the government engaged in “concealing facts” regarding Imran’s eye condition.
“Despite several days passing, lies continued to be told about the matter, which indicates that the federal and Punjab governments are deliberately attempting to defame state institutions,” the statement said.
The group also condemned and expressed disappointment over the remarks by opposition leader in the National Assembly, Mahmood Khan Achakzai, who said Imran’s health was not as bad as it was being portrayed.
They said that Achakzai was the government’s “B-team” and claimed that his continuous “silence” after becoming opposition leader was evidence that he was siding with the government, according to the statement.
“The opposition leader’s role on the PTI founder’s health is the same as that of the government and its ministers”, it stated. It also called for the PTI and opposition leadership to stage a joint sit-in at the gate of the Prime Minister’s House.
It is worth mentioning that the executive director of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Professor Dr Rana Imran Sikander, said early on Saturday that Imran’s eye procedure was completed “smoothly” and that he remained “stable” during the intervention.
“It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes.

According to the report, he made the remarks during a visit to Jinnah International Airport.
“Passengers with unverified and illegal documents will not be allowed to travel abroad,” the report quoted him as saying.
He also said professional beggars disguised as passengers would not only be offloaded but would also face legal action, the report said.
The minister asserted that those in possession of valid travel documents had neither been stopped in the past nor would they be stopped in the future.
He said facilitating passengers was the government’s priority. He lauded the officials from the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for ensuring travellers had valid documents and ensuring an effective checking process, the report added.
Earlier this month, while chairing a meeting to review the performance of the Immigration Wing of the FIA, Naqvi had issued orders for strict screening of travel documents at airports.
His directive had come amid complaints of arbitrary offloading at airports despite travellers carrying valid documents.</p><small>2026-01-31 13:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/311654032a76dca.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970113/ice-cool-rybakina-beats-sabalenka-in-tense-australian-open-final' target='_blank'><strong>Ice-cool Rybakina beats Sabalenka in tense Australian Open final</strong></a><br><p>Elena Rybakina took revenge over world number one Aryna Sabalenka to win a nail-biting Australian Open final on Saturday and clinch her second Grand Slam title.
The big-serving Kazakh fifth seed held her nerve to pull through 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 at Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne in 2hrs 18mins.
It was payback after the Belarusian Sabalenka won the 2023 final between two of the hardest hitters in women’s tennis.
The ice-cool Rybakina, 26, who was born in Moscow, adds her Melbourne triumph to her Wimbledon win in 2022.

 

“Hard to find the words now,” said Rybakina, and then addressed her beaten opponent to add: “I know it is tough, but I hope we play many more finals together.”
Turning to some Kazakh fans in the crowd, she said: “Thank you so much to Kazakhstan. I felt the support from that corner a lot.”
This was more disappointment in a major final for Sabalenka, who won the US Open last year for the second time but lost the French Open and Melbourne title deciders.
She was into her fourth Australian Open final in a row and had been imperious until now, with tears in her eyes at the end.
“Let’s hope maybe next year will be a better year for me,” Sabalenka said ruefully.



Rybakina fights back
With the roof on because of drizzle in Melbourne, Rybakina immediately broke serve and then comfortably held for 2-0.
Rybakina faced two break points at 4-3, but found her range with her serve to send down an ace and dig herself out of trouble, leaving Sabalenka visibly frustrated.

Rybakina looked in the zone and wrapped up the set in 37 minutes on her first set point when Sabalenka fired long.
Incredibly, it was the first set Sabalenka had dropped in 2026.
The second game of the second set was tense, Rybakina saving three break points in a 10-minute arm-wrestle.
They went with serve and the seventh game was another tussle, Sabalenka holding for 4-3 after the best rally of a cagey affair.
The tension ratcheted up and the top seed quickly forged three set points at 5-4 on the Kazakh’s serve, ruthlessly levelling the match at the first chance to force a deciding set.
Sabalenka was now in the ascendancy and smacked a scorching backhand to break for a 2-0 lead, then holding for 3-0.
Rybakina, who also had not dropped a set in reaching the final, looked unusually rattled.
She reset to hold, then wrestled back the break, allowing herself the merest of smiles.
At 3-3 the title threatened to swing either way.
But a surging Rybakina won a fourth game in a row to break for 4-3, then held to put a thrilling victory within sight.
Rybakina sealed the championship with her sixth ace of the match.



The finalists were familiar foes, having met 14 times previously, with Sabalenka winning eight of them.
Sabalenka came into the final as the favourite, but Rybakina has been one of the form players on the women’s tour in recent months.
She also defeated Sabalenka in the decider at the season-ending WTA Finals.
Rybakina beat second seed Iga Swiatek in the quarter-finals and sixth seed Jessica Pegula in the last four in Melbourne.
Rybakina switched to play under the Kazakh flag in 2018 when she was a little-known 19-year-old, citing financial reasons.</p><small>2026-01-31 12:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/31172740cba2bb8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970115/water-becomes-latest-luxury-symbol-for-indias-elite' target='_blank'><strong>Water becomes latest luxury symbol for India’s elite</strong></a><br><p>At an Indian gourmet food store, Avanti Mehta is organising a blind tasting of drinks sourced from France, Italy and India. No, this isn’t wine, it’s water.
Participants use tiny shot glasses to check the minerality, carbonation and salinity in samples of Evian from the French Alps, Perrier from southern France, San Pellegrino from Italy and India’s Aava from the foothills of the Aravalli mountains.
“They will all taste different … you should be choosing a water that can give you some sort of nutritional value,” said Mehta, who is 32 and calls herself India’s youngest water sommelier, a term usually associated with premium wine. Her family owns the Aava mineral water brand.
Premium water is a $400 million business in the world’s most populous nation and is growing bigger as its wealthy see it as a new status symbol that fits in with a spreading wellness craze.

Premium Indian mineral water costs around $1 for a one-litre bottle, while imported brands are upwards of $3, or 15 times the price of the country’s lowest-priced basic bottled water.
Clean water is a privilege in the country of 1.4 billion people, where researchers say 70 per cent of the groundwater is contaminated. Tap water remains unfit to drink, and 16 people died in Indore city after consuming contaminated tap water in December.
Many in India see bottled water as a necessity and standard 20 US-cent bottles are available widely at convenience stores, restaurants and hotels. The market is worth nearly $5bn annually and is set to grow 24pc a year — among the fastest in the world.
Bottled water demand in the United States or China is driven by convenience, making it a $30bn-plus market in each country, which will grow just 4-5pc each year, market researcher Euromonitor says.
In India, the premium water segment is leading the surge in demand, accounting for 8pc of the bottled water market last year compared to just 1pc in 2021, Euromonitor said.

“Distrust of municipal water in some areas has escalated the demand for bottled water. Now, people understand how mineral water has more health benefits. It’s expensive, but the category will boom,” said Amulya Pandit, a senior consultant at Euromonitor specialising in the drinks market.
Among its consumers is New Delhi-based real estate developer BS. Batra, who says his family uses only premium water at home to get more minerals and safeguard health.
“You feel different, more energetic during the day,” said Batra, 49, an avid badminton player. “I consume mineral water even with whisky at home, and kids use it for their smoothies.”
Water lures Bollywood star, wealthy
The popular 20-cent plastic bottled water is mainly made by Pepsi, Coca-Cola and Indian market leader Bisleri. In addition, Indians who can afford it install purifiers in their homes, which clean the water but also remove most minerals.
Imported and local premium waters are luring wealthy consumers and businesses alike.
Bollywood star Bhumi Pednekar and her sister have launched Backbay — selling 750 millilitre (ml) cartons of mineral water for $2.2; Indian conglomerate Tata is expanding its premium water portfolio, and retailers and businesses are reporting higher sales.

Tata Consumer Products, also Starbucks’ partner in India, sells 20-cent bottled water, but premium water is its priority as it sees affluent, health-focused consumers willing to spend on the drink without worrying about the price, Chief Executive Officer Sunil D’Souza said in an interview.
“I don’t have to push water uphill…I see a long, long, long runway for the business,” he said.
Tata’s premium “Himalayan” mineral water factory — which a Reuters photographer visited — is located in the foothills of the Himalayan range in Himachal Pradesh state.
Workers there largely keep a hands-free watch on machines filling plastic and glass bottles with water sourced from a natural underground aquifer.

Looking for springs
Most Indians prefer still water, and the sparkling variant remains niche. Tata said it plans to launch a sparkling Himalayan water and is also scouting for natural springs to expand its other offerings.
At three Foodstories Indian gourmet stores, sales of premium waters tripled in 2025. Customer demand prompted the chain to import “light and creamy” Saratoga Spring Water from New York, which costs 799 rupees ($9) for a 355ml bottle, and stocks sold out within days, said co-founder Avni Biyani.
Indian mineral water brand Aava’s sales touched a record 805m rupees ($9m) last year, growing 40pc a year since 2021. Tata said its basic and premium water portfolio will grow 30pc a year, after growing tenfold to $65 million in six years.

Imported waters, which attract an over 30pc tax, are pricier than Indian brands. Nestle’s Perrier and San Pellegrino, and Danone’s Evian retail for over 300 rupees, or $3.20, for a 750ml bottle.
Nestle declined to comment, while Danone said the Indian bottled water market was growing at a “robust” pace, but imported waters “tend to be niche and boutique”.
“When you open your tap, you’re not getting an Aava, Evian … And that is what you’re essentially paying for,” said water sommelier Mehta.
At the water tasting session, some participants said they enjoyed the experience, but many found the price hard to swallow.
“To be honest, it is kind of expensive,” said executive Hoshini Vallabhaneni, one of 14 people at the event. “For everyday use — it will burn a hole in the pocket.”

He also insisted the Islamic republic’s nuclear expertise could not be eliminated, after Trump said he expected Tehran to seek a deal to avoid US strikes.
“If the enemy makes a mistake, without a doubt it will endanger its own security, the security of the region, and the security of the Zionist regime (Israel),” Hatami said, according to the official IRNA news agency.
He noted that Iran’s armed forces were “at full defensive and military readiness”.
Washington sent a naval strike group to the Middle East led by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier, with Trump threatening to intervene militarily after a deadly crackdown by Iranian authorities on two weeks of anti-government protests.
The deployment has raised fears of a possible direct confrontation with Iran, which has warned it would respond with missile strikes on US bases, ships and allies — notably Israel — in the event of an attack.
On Friday, Trump said he predicted that Iran would seek to negotiate a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face American military action.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi had said earlier that Tehran was ready for nuclear talks, but its missiles and defence “will never be negotiated”.
‘Cannot be eliminated’
The US carried out strikes on key Iranian nuclear sites in June when it briefly joined Israel’s 12-day war against its regional foe. Israeli attacks also hit military sites across the country and killed senior officers and top nuclear scientists.
But Hatami on Saturday insisted that Iran’s nuclear technology “cannot be eliminated, even if scientists and sons of this nation are martyred”.
On Friday, US Central Command (Centcom) said Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would conduct “a two-day live-fire naval exercise” in the Strait of Hormuz, a key transit hub for global energy supplies.
In a statement, Centcom warned the IRGC against “any unsafe and unprofessional behaviour near US forces”.
The United States designated the IRGC a terrorist organisation in 2019, a move the European Union followed on Thursday.
The EU decision drew angry reactions from Tehran, which vowed to reciprocate.
Deadly crackdown
Nationwide protests against the rising cost of living erupted in Iran on December 28, before turning into a broader anti-government movement that peaked on January 8 and 9.
Iranian authorities have said the protests began peacefully before turning into “riots” involving killings and vandalism, blaming the United States and Israel for fomenting the unrest.
The official death toll from the authorities stands at 3,117. The protests have since subsided.
On Saturday, Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian urged his government to heed public grievances after the demonstrations.
“We must work with the people and for the people and serve the people as much as possible,” Pezeshkian said in a speech broadcast on state TV.
“If we act justly, the people will see it and will accept it, and under such conditions, no power can cripple a government, a society, or a nation that acts justly, fairly, and on the basis of rights.”
On Saturday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei visited the shrine of Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, in southern Tehran.
In a video carried by his official website, Khamenei offered prayers at the shrine on the occasion of 10-day celebrations marking the 47th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</p><small>2026-01-31 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/31161904812bb74.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970109/ppp-worker-shot-dead-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>PPP worker shot dead in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>A local PPP activist was gunned down in Karachi’s Pak Colony area late on Friday night, police said on Saturday.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that the shooting occurred at Qaim Khani Clinic, located near Warisi Mosque in Hasrat Mohani Colony, within the jurisdiction of Pak Colony Police Station.
“Political and social figure Abdul Rasheed Qureshi was present at the clinic where he was receiving medical treatment and was receiving an  intravenous (IV) drip due to ill health,” DIG Raza said.
“During this time, unknown assailants, for reasons yet to be determined, opened fire, as a result of which Qureshi died on the spot,” he said.
The DIG added that Qureshi was immediately moved to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead.
“Upon receiving information about the incident, the Pak Colony station house officer (SHO), along with a heavy contingent of police, reached the scene,” the DIG said.
“Police are investigating the incident from various angles,” he said.
In November 2025, a young PPP worker was gunned down in Karachi’s Orangi Town.
Iqbal Market SHO Shahbaz Yusuf said that Mohammed Shoaib Iqbal, 23, was on his way home in Yaqoobabad, Sector 11 ½ at around 2am when unidentified assailants targeted him.

Justice Afghan was sp­­eaking at a certificate-aw­arding ceremony for the Leadership and Mana­ge­ment Training Course (Batch-V) for District and Sessions Judges and Sen­ior Civil judges, held at the Federal Judicial Acad­emy (FJA), Islamabad. Jus­­tice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb also attended the ceremony.
In his concluding remarks, Justice Afghan said that a heavy responsibility rests on all district judges, adding that they should always strive to write professional judgements based on facts, law and principles.
Advising the district judiciary judges, Justice Afghan described continuous learning as the “key for judges” to ensure ef­­fective administration of justice. He urged them to never stop learning, avoid prejudice and personal biases, refraining from liking or disliking the parties involved and ensure merit-based recruitment.

Justice Afghan urges judges to write verdicts based on facts, law and principles

“Honesty is a norm, and impartiality is foundational to ensuring a fair trial and maintaining public confidence in the judicial system,” he said.
Speaking on the occasion, Justice Miangul Has­san Aurangzeb “termed the Federal Judicial Academy a “robust institution”, dedicated to the professional development of justice-sector stakeholders and the pursuit of judicial excellence.
He said the Academy welcomes suggestions, feedback and advice aimed at improving course content and structure, refining training, fostering a better learning environment, and ensuring strategic growth.
“As new statutes are being enacted and laws are being amended, it is the judges who have to interpret them,” Justice Aurangzeb remarked.
He further emphasised that the system requires immediate reform at all levels, calling for amendments to antiquated laws. He urged district judiciary judges to work with dedication and honesty, and strictly in accordance with facts and the law, to help create a balanced society.
In his remarks, Director General of the Academy Hayat Ali Shah said that the district judiciary is the central focus of the reform agenda of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, aimed at making the justice system more citizen-centric.

The two had fallen into the sewer at the site of the under-construction Data Darbar expansion project near Bhatti Gate on Wednesday. While the woman’s body was found late at night the same day, the 10-month-old child’s body was recovered on Thursday.
Earlier, police presented the arrested officials before the magistrate at district courts and sought their 14-day physical remand. The request was heard by Judicial Magistrate Shafqat Abbas.
During the hearing, a counsel for the accused opposed the police plea, arguing that a physical remand was unnecessary.
The defence counsel informed the court that Rs10 million had been paid to the aggrieved family in the form of a cheque on humanitarian grounds, producing a photocopy of the cheque issued.
He admitted that the incident was tragic.
The magistrate approved a four-day remand, directing that the police complete their investigation during the remand period and produce the suspects again on February 3.
In the court order seen by Dawn, the investigating officer (IO) was directed to also investigate the case “on the aspect of contributory negligence of officers/officials of Wasa (Water and Sanitation Agency) and the civil administration as well responsible to look after the ongoing construction project at the place of occurrence”.
Last month, a seven-year-old boy in Punjab’s Bahawalpur district fell into an open manhole in Dhanote town near Lodhran city and died.
The same month, a three-year-old boy’s body was recovered from an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal area, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.</p><small>2026-01-31 10:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/311358142d21d5e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970106/injured-cummins-out-of-t20-world-cup-dwarshuis-in-australia-squad' target='_blank'><strong>Injured Cummins out of T20 World Cup, Dwarshuis in Australia squad</strong></a><br><p>Australia fast bowler Pat Cummins was ruled out on Saturday for next month’s Twenty20 World Cup after failing to recover from a nagging back injury, and Ben Dwarshuis will replace him for the global showpiece.
Cummins played just one of the five Ashes tests against England, but Australia kept him in the provisional World Cup squad hoping for his availability in the Super Eight stage of the tournament to be played in India and Sri Lanka.
Matt Renshaw also replaced fellow batter Matthew Short but veteran Steve Smith could not break into the World Cup squad despite his strong form in the Big Bash League.
“With Pat needing more time to recover from his back injury, Ben is a ready replacement who offers a left-arm pace option as well as dynamic fielding and late-order hitting,” selector Tony Dodemaide said.
“We believe his ability to swing the ball at good pace along with clever variations will be well suited to the conditions we expect and overall structure of the squad.” The Mitchell Marsh-led side are currently playing a three-match T20 series in Pakistan as part of their preparation for the World Cup.
“With the top order settled and spin-heavy conditions expected in the pool stages in Sri Lanka, we also feel Matt provides extra middle-order support, with Tim David completing his return-to-play program in the early phase of the tournament,” Dodemaide said of Renshaw’s selection.
“As a left-hander, he also offers a point of difference to the middle-order batting.”
Renshaw scored 15 in his T20 debut for Australia in Thursday’s defeat in Lahore.
The former champions begin their World Cup campaign against Ireland in a February 11 match in Colombo.

The video statement by the hospital’s head comes after the PTI approached the Supreme Court on Friday, seeking its assistance in arranging a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians, with the help of the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP).
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had earlier confirmed that Imran underwent a “20-minute” medical procedure for an eye ailment on the night of January 24 at Pims in Islamabad.

 


“It (the procedure) was completed smoothly in approximately 20 minutes. During the treatment, the patient remained vitally stable and was discharged with routine post-procedure care instructions and follow-up advice and documents,” said Sikander.
The doctor said the former premier, aged 74, complained of “reduced vision in his right eye”, adding that a “qualified ophthalmologist” from the hospital conducted a “complete eye assessment at Adiala jail”.
Sikander elaborated that the doctor dispatched to the prison conducted “strict lab examination, [ocular] endoscopy, intraocular pressure measurement, essential laboratory tests and OCT of the retina”.
He added that based on the initial assessment, the diagnosis of right central vein occlusion was made and a hospital-based treatment was recommended.

 

“Accordingly, Mr Niazi was brought to Pims on the night of last Saturday, Sunday for the advised procedure.”
The head of the hospital said Imran, after arrival at Pims, was “explained in full” about the procedure.
“Informed consent was obtained from the patient prior to the procedure. The procedure was carried out in the operation theatre under standard sterile protocol and monitoring,” said Dr Sikander.

On January 28, the PTI had raised concerns about Imran’s health, saying it had learned through credible reports that he had been diagnosed with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in his right eye, which could cause permanent eyesight damage if not treated promptly.
The party had alleged that the jail administration was insisting that the treatment be provided inside the prison, contrary to a medical expert’s advice to take him to a hospital.
The next day, a report, quoting a senior doctor at Pims, said Imran was brought to the hospital under strict security on the night of January 24 for a medical procedure, which was “completed when the time reached in the A.M.”.

 

The doctor said there was “extraordinary movement” on Saturday night, and the operation theatres and the anaesthesia room were cordoned off ahead of Imran’s arrival at Pims.
On Thursday, the information minister confirmed that the PTI founder underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment at Pims on the night of January 24. He said it was a “20-minute” procedure and that the ex-premier was “absolutely healthy”.
Subsequently, the PTI condemned the act of “secretly transferring” Imran to Pims, deliberately keeping his family and the party leadership uninformed, and denying him access to personal physicians.
The Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) also termed Imran’s transfer to the hospital without the knowledge of his family and personal physicians a “criminal negligence”.
Imran’s sister, Noreen Niazi, who had earlier raised doubts about his brother’s ailment, reiterated concerns that his family and lawyers were not being kept informed and demanded that his medical reports be made public.
Then on Friday, the PTI staged a day-long protest outside the Supreme Court, following which it said the ex-premier’s family would be provided a copy of his medical report.</p><small>2026-01-31 08:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/311239329b5ecdd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970105/more-than-200-killed-in-coltan-mine-collapse-in-east-congo-official-says' target='_blank'><strong>More than 200 killed in coltan mine collapse in east Congo, official says</strong></a><br><p>More than 200 people were killed this week in a collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesperson for the rebel-appointed governor of the province where the mine is located, told Reuters on Friday.
Rubaya produces around 15pc of the world’s coltan, which is processed into tantalum, a heat-resistant metal that is in high demand by makers of mobile phones, computers, aerospace components and gas turbines. The site, where locals dig manually for a few dollars per day, has been under the control of the AFC/M23 rebel group since 2024.
The collapse occurred on Wednesday and the precise toll was still unclear as of Friday evening.
“More than 200 people were victims of this landslide, including miners, children and market women. Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries,” Muyisa said, adding that about 20 injured people were being treated in health facilities.
“We are in the rainy season. The ground is fragile. It was the ground that gave way while the victims were in the hole.”
An adviser to the governor said the number of confirmed dead was at least 227. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.
The United Nations says AFC/M23 has plundered Rubaya’s riches to help fund its insurgency, backed by the government of neighboring Rwanda, an allegation Kigali denies.
The heavily-armed rebels, whose stated aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority, captured even more mineral-rich territory in eastern Congo during a lightning advance last year.</p><small>2026-01-31 07:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/31110913924f9a4.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1970098/united-states-approves-major-arms-deals-to-saudi-arabia-israel' target='_blank'><strong>United States approves major arms deals to Saudi Arabia, Israel</strong></a><br><p>The United States on Friday approved multibillion-dollar weapons sales to both Saudi Arabia and Israel, at a point of high tensions with Iran.
The State Department said it green-lighted a $3.8-billion sale of 30 Apache attack helicopters to Israel, which has agreed to a fragile ceasefire in Gaza.
“The United States is committed to the security of Israel, and it is vital to US national interests to assist Israel to develop and maintain a strong and ready self-defense capability,” the State Department said in a statement.
“This proposed sale is consistent with those objectives,” it said.
Also in the package was a $1.8 billion sale of joint light tactical vehicles.
The United States sends billions of dollars worth of military supplies per year to Israel, largely in aid rather than sales.
Israel and Hamas reached a US-backed ceasefire in October that largely paused two years of war.
Tensions are high elsewhere in the region as the United States deploys a major military contingent in waters near Iran.
The State Department also approved a $9-billion sale to Saudi Arabia for 730 Patriot missiles, which are used to defend against incoming attacks.
Israel last year carried out a major bombing campaign against nuclear and other military sites in Iran.
Iran has faced growing pressure after major protests against the clerical state, which has responded by killing thousands of protesters.
Saudi Arabia has voiced caution about an attack on Iran as Gulf monarchies fear instability that could jeopardise their reputation as business havens.
The Trump administration has said that the Gaza ceasefire is now in its second phase, with a focus on disarming Hamas.
Earlier in November, US President Donald Trump said Saudi Arabia was being designated as a “major, non-Nato ally”.
The status provides a US partner with military and economic privileges but does not entail security commitments.
The White House also announced the sale of F-35 fighter jets to the Kingdom, however, the jets will be less advanced than those operated by Israel, in line with a US law that guarantees Israel’s military edge in the region.</p><small>2026-01-31 06:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/31104926148d1db.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969997/karachi-mayor-wahab-orders-kmc-affairs-probe-after-graft-allegations-surface' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi Mayor Wahab orders KMC affairs probe after graft allegations surface</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) has ordered an inquiry after the Karachi Constructors Association (KCA) levelled serious allegations of large-scale corruption against officials of the civic body’s engineering department, claiming that billions of rupees in development funds had been misappropriated through fraudulent practices.
The inquiry was announced by Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who took notice of the concerns raised by the contractors’ body and directed the municipal administration to conduct a comprehensive and impartial examination of the tendering, bidding and procurement processes within the KMC.
A couple of days ago, the KCA, which represents contractors working with civic bodies and government organisations, accused senior engineering officials of manipulating tenders, procuring substandard materials and awarding contracts to favoured contractors without competitive bidding.
The association also alleged that contractors were subjected to excessive commission demands and blackmailing, making it difficult for them to execute development schemes in a transparent and timely manner.

Asks municipal commissioner to submit report within three days on tendering, bidding, procurement processes

Responding to the allegations, the KMC on Friday issued a statement announcing that Mayor Wahab had taken “serious notice” of the complaints and ordered a comprehensive and impartial inquiry into the matter.

 

According to the statement, the mayor has directed Municipal Commissioner of KMC, Sumera Hussain, to conduct a detailed examination of all aspects of the tendering, bidding and procurement processes under question.
“The inquiry will assess whether established rules, regulations and standard operating procedures were duly followed and determine if any irregularities or lapses occurred at any stage,” the press statement said, adding that the municipal commissioner had been asked to submit a detailed report within three days.
The mayor reiterated that transparency, accountability and fair governance remained top priorities of the metropolitan administration.
He assured contractors, stakeholders and the public that any individual found responsible for misconduct or violations of rules would be dealt with strictly in accordance with law, without discrimination.
At the same time, the statement noted that if the allegations were found to be baseless, the facts would be placed on record to protect the credibility of the institution and its officials.
Meanwhile, KCA chairman S.M. Naeem Kazmi welcomed the move, but cautioned that the inquiry should be conducted in its true spirit and not merely as a formality.
“We want to make it clear that growing corruption has made it impossible for us to compete. We welcome the mayor’s decision, but he must ensure that the inquiry produces the desired results,” he said.

In a conversation with Dawn, Ms Bokhari said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz had enforced strict adherence to professional standards, ensuring lawmakers from the ruling party had no influence over transfer and posting decisions.
“Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has fully ensured that all postings and transfers in Punjab are made purely on merit, thus ending Sifarish [nepotism] culture,” Ms Bokhari said.
“She ensured during her two-year tenure that not a single appointment, even that of an SHO, is made on someone’s reference. This thing was hardly witnessed in the past.”
The “strict policy” has reportedly caused friction within the party. According to Ms Bokhari, some PML-N lawmakers, frustrated that the bureaucracy no longer obliged their requests, conveyed concerns to party head Nawaz Sharif.

Minister Azma Bokhari claims ‘Sifarish culture’ dismantled from province, merit system enforced

The party chief reportedly rebuffed them, maintaining that his daughter was following merit.
Ms Bokhari emphasised the neutrality of the new system, noting that bureaucrats associated with the opposition PTI party were retained if they met professional criteria.
“The chief minister’s direct engagement in evaluating senior officers underscores an emphasis on accountability and professional competence,” the minister said. “Officers demonstrating strong performance are formally recognised, reinforcing incentives for integrity and service delivery.”
Regarding development projects worth billions of rupees, Ms Bokhari said the chief minister had established a transparent spending mechanism that excluded lawmakers from handling funds directly.
“The lawmakers, however, can give proposals regarding the development works and have an oversight on them,” she said.
The minister outlined a governance model centred on technology and structural reform, designed to replace ad hoc initiatives with integrated digital systems.
This shift includes the implementation of e-FOAS (filing and office automation systems) and e-procurement to manage administrative functions ranging from pension cases to contract awards.
“Rather than relying on ad hoc initiatives, the focus has been on structural reform — particularly through the integration of digital systems across government departments,” Ms Bokhari said.
Shift towards e-governance
“This shift toward e-governance aims to modernise state institutions, reduce discretionary power, and align provincial administration with contemporary global practices.”
To bolster transparency, the government has mandated third-party validation for development schemes and digitised the entire procurement cycle, from advertisement to bid submission.
“The system enforces compliance with procurement rules, safeguards data integrity, and minimises human intervention,” Ms Bokhari said. “Open access to tender information and digital bidding has promoted competition and transparency, resulting in notable savings for the public exchequer.”
The administration has trained 14,216 officials from 6,641 offices across the province in these e-procurement procedures to support the transition. Additionally, the launch of an e-Biz Portal has streamlined the acquisition of no-objection certificates, reducing opportunities for corruption.
“Public welfare, transparent development, and institutional efficiency remain the true benchmarks of leadership, and it is against these standards that the Punjab government’s record is increasingly being judged,” she said.

ISLAMABAD: Counsel for PTI founder Imran Khan has written to the Chief Justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), seeking consolidation of all cases pending against him before the high court and requesting urgent hearings, particularly in the matters relating to the suspension of his sentence in £190 million corruption and Toshakhana cases.
In the letter, the counsel submitted that several petitions filed on behalf of Imran Khan are currently pending before different benches of the IHC, arising out of various FIRs and proceedings. He argued that the multiplicity of cases and their fixation before different benches has created serious legal and practical difficulties, not only for the petitioner but also for the court system.
The lawyer maintained that most of the cases involve common questions of law and fact, including allegations of political victimisation, misuse of criminal law, and denial of fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution. In this context, he requested that all matters pertaining to Imran Khan be clubbed and heard together by an appropriate bench to ensure consistent and effective adjudication.
Referring specifically to the petition seeking suspension of Imran Khan’s sentence, the lawyer stressed that the matter involves the liberty of a former prime minister and the leader of the country’s largest opposition party. He contended that continued incarceration, despite pending legal remedies, amounts to grave injustice and violates the right to due process.
The letter stated that the suspension plea has been pending for some time and that repeated adjournments or delayed fixation have caused serious prejudice to the petitioner. The counsel urged the chief justice to exercise administrative powers to fix the case for an urgent hearing, keeping in view its constitutional and legal significance.
The lawyer further argued that Imran Khan is facing an extraordinary number of cases across different forums, many of which, he claimed, stem from similar facts and alleged actions.

 

He submitted that such fragmentation of litigation not only prolongs proceedings but also burdens the judiciary and increases the risk of conflicting orders.
According to the letter, consolidation of the cases would serve the interests of justice, judicial economy, and transparency. The counsel maintained that hearing all related matters together would enable the court to comprehensively examine the legal issues involved and pass effective orders.
The letter also highlighted that Imran Khan, being in custody, faces serious difficulties in pursuing multiple proceedings simultaneously.
The counsel argued that access to legal remedies is a fundamental right and should not be rendered illusory by procedural hurdles or delays.

ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric emphasised that while recent prisoner exchanges allowed families to mourn or reunite, the civilian population remains in a desperate struggle for survival against harsh winter conditions and devastated infrastructure in the besieged territory.
“States must harness the momentum generated by the first phase of the agreement between Israel and Hamas to urgently improve the dire humanitarian conditions in Gaza,” Spoljaric said.
For the past 15 weeks, the ICRC has worked with mediators to facilitate the return of prisoners and the remains of the deceased.

Israeli kills three more Palestinians in Gaza

However, Spoljaric stressed that humanitarian steps are irreplaceable on the path to peace. She explicitly called on Israel to ease its blockade on so-called “dual-use” materials — such as water pipes and generators — which remain essential for restoring basic services.
“Many people in Gaza are still living in the rubble without basic services, struggling to stay warm amid harsh winter conditions,” Spoljaric said.
Rafah partial reopening
Following months of pleading from humanitarian organisations and Palestinians, Israel announced on Friday that it would reopen the Rafah crossing on the southern border with Egypt this Sunday on Feb 1.
The crossing, a vital lifeline for aid, has been shuttered by Israeli forces since they seized control of the area.
Israel said the crossing would open for the “limited movement” under the supervision of a European Union mission. Earlier, Hamas demanded the reopening of Rafah and the entry of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza in the territory.
Israel kills again
The Israeli military on Friday killed three more Palestinians in Gaza. Without identifying the victims, the military stated that further strikes were launched and that soldiers continued to conduct searches in the area. Since the truce entered into force, Gaza’s health ministry reports that 492 people have been killed by Israeli fire or bombardment.

ISLAMABAD: Taking exception to archaic expressions common in Sindh, such as Bakhidmat Janaab SHO, the Supreme Court ordered on Friday that the term be discouraged, noting that it had no legal sanction and that a simple address as Janaab would suffice.
The court observed that applications addressed to police officials using Bakhidmat Janaab SHO incorrectly implied that the citizen was at the service of the station house officer.
In fact, the court explained, the SHO was at the service of the citizen.
The court added that such terminology reflected a colonial mindset, in which subjects of the state approached authorities as a matter of mercy rather than as a right.
Authored by Justice Salahuddin Panwhar, a member of the three-judge SC bench, the court had taken up an appeal against a July 2, 2021, order of the Sindh High Court’s Hyderabad bench, which had upheld the life sentence of a petitioner, Muhammad Bux alias Shahzaib, under Section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code for the murder of Muhammad Abbass in August 2017.
Headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, the SC bench, however, rejected the appeal.
During the hearing, the court noted the use of expressions such as Bakhidmat Janaab SHO, as well as Faryaadi and Muddai, in police proceedings. It ordered that police practices be brought in line with Articles 4, 9, 10-A, and 14 of the Constitution.
Alternatives
The court stated that the use of the terms Faryaadi or Muddai in police proceedings should be discontinued. It added that appropriate and legally accurate alternatives should be used, including Itlaah Deendhar or Shikayat Kandhar in Sindhi, and Itlaah Dahinda in Urdu, to reflect the true legal status of the person furnishing the information.
The judgment explained that describing a citizen as a Faryaadi was legally misconceived and constitutionally impermissible, as it demeaned the individual by portraying them as a seeker of favour rather than a rights-bearing individual invoking the protection of the law.
It added that such terminology undermined the dignity of the citizen, which was inviolable under Article 14 of the Constitution, and weakened the concept of equal protection under the law.
Justice Panwhar observed that police officers were public servants entrusted with constitutional and statutory duties. “They are bound to protect life, liberty, and the security of person, values at the core of Article 9 of the Constitution,” the verdict read.
“Police officer are required to serve the citizens as they are remunerated from public funds. Citizens approach the police as a matter of right, not as a charity grace or indulgence. Any institutional practice that reverses this relationship erodes public confidence in the rule of law and weakens constitutional governance,” it added.
The SC noted that the continued use of Faryaadi reflected an outdated and unconstitutional mindset, in which public authorities were seen as rulers rather than servants of the people — a notion explicitly rejected by the Constitution.
It continued that expressions such as Faryaadi and formulaic salutations like Bakhidmat Janaab SHO were remnants of a colonial and pre-constitutional paradigm. “Despite the constitutional transformation brought about by the Constitution of 1973, vestiges of this mindset regrettably persist through institutional habit,” the judgement regretted.

PESHAWAR: The federal and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa authorities on Friday denied that they gave any permission for starting a military operation in the Tirah Valley of Khyber district.
The denial from both federal and provincial governments came before a bench of the Peshawar High Court (PHC) comprising Justice Wiqar Ahmad and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali at the hearing of a petition filed by Barrister Saud Javed Dawar, a member of the National Democratic Movement (NDM).
KP Advocate General Shah Faisal Uthmankhel and Addi­tional Atto­rney General Sana­ullah apprised the high court that their respective governments had not given a nod to the military for launching any operation across the valley.
While directing the Provincial Disaster Manag­ement Authority (PDMA) to provide all possible reliefs to the people displaced from Tirah Valley, the bench summoned IDP representatives on Feb 12, the next date of hearing the matter, so as to verify the government’s claims that it had been extending both financial and material support to the displaced persons. It also sought a report from the PDMA within a week about the facilities provided to them.
Barrister Dawar who appeared along with his counsel Mohammad Yaseen Orakzai sought from the court multiple relief, including declaration that any ‘order and action’ of launching Tirah military operation was “unconstitutional, unlawful and violative of fundamental rights”.
The petitioner also urged the court to direct the respondents, including both federal and KP authorities, to place on record the mechanism, protocol and guidelines for the protection, safety, rehabilitation and repatriation of IDPs as well as financial policy and packages for them.
Without the passage of a resolution by the KP Assembly under Article 232 and approval of Parliament, the military operation couldn’t be launched, the petitioner reminded the PHC.

 

The AG stated that while the provincial government had not approved of any military operation, it had been adopting measures for providing relief to the people who left their homes in Tirah. He said that for that purpose the government had also approved Rs4 billion. However, he said, he would submit a detailed reply about constitutionality of starting any military operation without the approval of the provincial government.
Article 245
A single-page reply of the interior secretary was also submitted to the court, which provided that the deployment of the armed forces for internal security purposes was governed under Article 245, which empowered the federal government to employ the armed forces in aid of civil power.
As per the response, security operations in the Tirah area fall within the constitutional authority of the federal government and are conducted in accordance with the Constitution. “The Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control has not initiated, directed, commanded or operationally supervised any such operation, nor has it issued any formal order, directive or requisition in this regard,” the interior secretary added.
About the petitioner’s stance that a resolution of the provincial assembly was required for proclamation of emergency under Article 232, the ministry explained that the constitutional framework distinguishes clearly between emergency powers under Article 232 and deployment of forces under Article 245.
“Deployment under Article 245 does not require a proclamation of emergency, a resolution of the provincial assembly or approval of either House of the Parliament.
“Matters concerning the protection, rehabilitation, repatriation, financial assistance, health, education, shelter and welfare of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) are primarily managed by the Provincial governments, NDMA, PDMA and other relevant civilian departments,” the reply said.
The petitioner contended that as Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had explicitly denied his and his government approval to Tirah operation, the action and order of launching the operation by the federal government was purely unconstitutional.

ISTANBUL: Turkiye intensified a diplomatic push to mediate between Tehran and Washington on Friday as US President Donald Trump appeared to cool his threats of a strike, though Iran warned that its missile capabilities would “never” be on the negotiating table.
Turkish President Re­cep Tayyip Erdogan and Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan led regional efforts to de-escalate tensions that have soared since the US moved military assets to the Middle East following a deadly crackdown on protests in Iran.
While the Pentagon said the military remained ready, Trump lowered the temperature late on Thursday, stating he hoped to avoid conflict and that talks were possible.
Speaking during a visit to Turkiye, Iranian For­eign Minister Abbas Araghchi welcomed the potential for dialogue but drew a hard line regarding national defence.
“I want to state firmly that Iran’s defensive and missile capabilities will never be subject to negotiation,” Araghchi said, adding that his country had no current plans to meet US officials.
Araghchi emphasised that Tehran was “ready to begin negotiations if they take place on an equal footing, based on mutual interests and mutual respect.”
Erdogan spoke by ph­one with Iranian President Masoud Pezes­hkian on Friday, telling his counterpart that Turkiye was “ready to assume a facilitating role between Iran and the United States to de-escalate the tensions”.
Standing alongside Araghchi at a press conference in Istanbul, Fidan said restarting talks over Iran’s nuclear program was “vital for reducing regional tensions”.
He urged Washington to “act with common sense” and resist pressure from Israel, which he said was pushing for a US attack. Fidan also noted he had held discussions with US special envoy Steve Witkoff and would keep lines open to prevent Iran’s isolation.
Despite the diplomatic overtures, significant hurdles remain. The Axios reported on Monday that US officials said any deal must include a cap on Tehran’s long-range missile stockpile, the removal of enriched uranium, and a ban on independent enrichment. Meanwhile, international pressure on Tehran continues to mount. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told the BBC on Friday that preventing Tehran from developing nuclear weapons was “hugely important.”
While stopping short of explicitly supporting a US strike, Starmer condemned the “grotesque” repression of demonstrators.
The European Union also urged against military action but condemned the crackdown by designating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a “terrorist organisation”.
Tehran quickly criticised the move. Iran’s judiciary chief called the designation “hostile”, warning that Europe “will suffer the consequences of their foolish act”. Araghchi echoed the sentiment in Istanbul, labelling the designation a mistake and describing Europe as a “continent in decline”.
While diplomatic channels remain active, military readiness continues. Israel’s Ynet news website reported Friday that a US Navy destroyer had docked at the Israeli port of Eilat.
Araghchi told reporters that while Iran has “never sought war,” it remains prepared for any scenario.
“Iran has no problem with negotiations, but negotiations cannot take place under the shadow of threats,” Araghchi said. “They must certainly set aside their threats and change their approach toward a fair and equitable negotiation, as Mr Trump himself said in his post.”
Pezeshkian, in a call with United Arab Emirates President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, reinforced that success depended on the “abandonment of belligerent and threatening actions,” warning that any aggression against Iran would “receive an immediate and firm response”.
Tensions initially spiked following protests that erupted in late December over economic grievances. The demonstrations faced a severe crackdown that peaked on Jan 8 and Jan 9. Iran has accused the United States and Israel of fuelling a “terrorist operation” that transformed peaceful rallies into “riots”.
The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) confirmed 6,479 people were killed in the demonstrations, including 6,092 protesters and 118 children. Internet restrictions imposed in early January continue to hinder information access.
While rights groups estimate the toll is in the tens of thousands, Iranian authorities have acknowledged more than 3,000 deaths, claiming the majority were security forces or bystanders killed by rioters.

The 10-gram and one-tola silver (24kt) also fell to Rs9,489 and Rs11,069, showing a drop of Rs949 and Rs1,106.
As per rates announced by All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association (APSGJA), world gold rates recorded a massive single day record fall in world price to $5,150 per ounce, down by a record $355 per ounce.
APSGJA President Mr Skikarpuri said “this is the biggest ever plunge in my entire career in the gold trade spanning over over five decades. In 1974, the per tola gold rate was Rs240.”
He recalled that the world gold rate had fallen slowly to $245 per ounce from $852 in the entire 1980 period but it cannot match the abrupt single day drop of $355 per ounce on Friday.

Spot gold and silver record worst single-day drop of 8.9pc and 21.92pc to $4,915.17 and $90.66 an ounce

“The gold price is still unaffordable for many jewellery buyers despite falling by Rs35,500 per tola,” he said, adding that jewellery buyers’ footfall at the shops is still very low. However, investors had definitely suffered owing to steep drop in prices.
According to Reuters, gold fell and was poised for its biggest daily loss since 1983, as the dollar strengthened after US President Donald Trump announced his choice for Fed chair, while silver was heading for its worst day on record.
Spot gold dropped 8.9pc to $4,915.17 per ounce at 12:30 p.m. ET (1730 GMT), after retreating to an intraday low of $4,898.89 earlier. US gold futures for February delivery slipped 7.7pc to $4,940.70.
The selloff, described by analysts as profit-taking, also pressured other precious metals.
The triggers behind the sell-off could be a combination of factors, ranging from the Fed Chair announcement to broader macro flows, said Suki Cooper, global head, commodities research at Standard Chartered Bank.
Whether we look at the dollar or expectations for real yields, a combination of these drivers has helped trigger profit-taking, she added.
Trump named former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh as his choice to succeed Jerome Powell as Fed chair in May, placing a frequent critic of the central bank in a key leadership role. Gold hit a record peak of $5,594.82 on Thursday and remains on track for a nearly 12pc rise this month.
The US dollar index gained 0.7pc, rebounding from a four-year low earlier this week and making greenback-priced gold more expensive for overseas buyers.
Meanwhile, Joe Cavatoni, Senior Market Strategist, Americas, and Head of Public Policy, US, World Gold Council said, “in an environment shaped by policy uncertainty, rising debt burdens and geopolitical risk, gold is increasingly being viewed as a strategic portfolio allocation rather than a short-term trade.” Gold premiums in India hit decade-highs on investment demand, while China saw gains on jewellery and investment interest.
Among other precious metals, spot silver was down 21.92pc at $90.66 an ounce after dropping as low as $89.93. Prices were on track for their biggest daily drop on record, based on LSEG data available through 1982.
The white metal hit a record high of $121.64 on Thursday and has surged more than 23pc this month.
Spot platinum lost 18pc to $2,155.73 an ounce and palladium plunged 13.7pc to $1,741.36.
