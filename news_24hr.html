Saturday’s ceasefire, announced by US President Donald Trump, followed four days of tit-for-tat strikes between the nuclear-armed neighbours, as well as diplomacy and pressure from Washington.
The KSE-100 index opened with a gain of 9,929.48 points, or 9.26pc, to stand at 117,104.11 points from the previous close of 107,174.63 at 9:30am. Due to the massive gains, the PSX was suspended for an hour after opening to control excessive volatility.
Later in the day, the benchmark index reached as many as 117,327.78 points — 10,153.15 points (9.47pc) higher than yesterday’s close, at 3:15pm. This marked the highest intra-day gain (points-wise) — more than double the 4,700 points surge in November 2024.
Finally, the KSE-100 closed at 117,297.73 points, with a gain of 10,123.10 points (9.45pc) compared to the previous close.

“The market has reacted jubilantly to the ceasefire announcement after Pakistan established effective deterrence against India,” noted Yousuf M. Farooq, research director at Chase Securities.
“The PSX has saluted the Pakistan Air Force this morning with a surge of over 9pc in the KSE-100 Index,” he remarked, in reference to the PAF’s actions in response to India’s strikes.
Additionally, Farooq noted that the recent interest rate cut and the approval of $1 billion tranche by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) “further fueled investor enthusiasm”.
Commenting on the future investor mood, Farooq said market participants were now expected to shift their focus towards the upcoming federal budget for the next fiscal year, which is expected on June 2.
 
 

Samiullah Tariq, head of research and development at Pak Kuwait Investment Company Ltd, listed three main reasons for the robust market activity.
Other than the ceasefire and the IMF’s green light to the disbursement, Tariq mentioned US President Donald Trump’s recent statement on increasing trade with Pakistan.
After mediating the halt of hostilities between the South Asian arch-rivals, Trump not only offered his help in resolving the Kashmir dispute but also announced he would “increase trade substantially” with both Pakistan and India.
Pakistan’s international bonds also recorded strong gains today, adding as much as 5.7 cents in the dollar, Tradeweb data showed.
On May 8, when tensions deepened as Pakistan took down 25 drones sent by India into the country, the KSE-100 suffered the largest-ever plunge of nearly 6,500 points in absolute terms. The intraday low of 8,410 points was the second-largest single-day drop (points-wise).
Prominent industrialist Arif Habib, told Geo News at the PSX in Karachi, “We have already achieved macroeconomic stability, which has made Pakistan’s economic story presentable and better.”
He also highlighted the interest rate cut and the IMF’s approval as contributors to the positive market activity.
 


On the ongoing political situation, Habib said it was a good opportunity for “these political matters” to be discussed and settled in the parliament. “There will be no more obstacles for Pakistan’s progress then,” he stressed.
Awais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, pointed out the heightened possibility of further improving ties with Gulf countries due to Pakistan’s enhanced geopolitical position.
“This brief conflict has also demonstrated our military and technological superiority over India, strengthening our geopolitical position. As a result, it is likely to enhance ties with Gulf countries amid regional tensions and support growth in our defence and technology exports,” Ashraf told Dawn.com.
 
 

While noting the investor zest in light of the Pak-India “conflict ending with dominance”, he said the attention was now expected to shift towards improving macroeconomic indicators, including historically low inflation and a record-high current account surplus.
Pakistan’s consumer inflation rate plunged to an all-time low of 0.3pc year-on-year in April, while the $1.195bn current account surplus in March was the highest-ever monthly surplus.
Indian benchmarks eye best day in nearly a year
Meanwhile, Indian shares also rallied today.
India’s benchmarks jumped over 3pc and were on track to log their best session in almost a year after the country reached and held a ceasefire with Pakistan.
The Nifty 50 and the BSE Sensex gained about 3.25pc each to 24,787.8 and 81,958.04, respectively, as of 1:12pm IST (12:42pm PKT), on track to recover the 1.5pc they lost since India’s strikes on Pakistan on May 7.
 
 

If gains hold, the benchmarks will log their best single-day jump since June 5, 2024, when markets surged after the ruling National Democratic Alliance’s victory in the national elections.
“Assuming the ceasefire is adhered to by both countries, we keep all our macro forecasts unchanged,” Barclays said in a note.
“We see India grow at a solid 6.5pc year-on-year in FY25-26, benefitting from relative insulation to global trade uncertainty and strong progress in ‘trade talks’ with the US administration,” it added.
All 13 major sectors logged gains today. The broader small- and mid-caps rallied 4pc and 3.6pc, respectively.</p><small>2025-05-12 10:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12144433859552f.jpg?r=144535' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910531/bjp-workers-vandalise-karachi-bakery-in-indias-hyderabad' target='_blank'><strong>BJP workers vandalise Karachi Bakery in India’s Hyderabad</strong></a><br><p>The workers of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) vandalised Karachi Bakery in India’s Hyderabad over its name on Saturday, prior to the ceasefire announcement between the two neighbouring countries amid heightened tensions, Indian media outlet The Wire reported.
The vandals wore saffron shawls, stepped on Pakistani flags and chanted anti-Pakistan slogans, The Wire said, adding that there was footage of them striking the bakery’s sign with sticks, to target the word ‘Karachi’.
The escalation between the nuclear-armed neighbours began following the April 22 attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam, which killed 26 people. India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe. Following the allegations, India launched a series of drone strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties.
Both sides then launched missiles at each other, which stretched over the week before US President Trump announced that a “full and immediate ceasefire” was reached between the two countries.
A police official K Balaraju was quoted by The Wire as saying: “A couple of BJP workers showed up outside the Shamshabad Karachi Bakery within the RGI Airport Police Station limits at about 3 pm. They raised slogans and took issue with the bakery’s name. They tried to damage the signboard.”
He added that the suspects were detained but were later released as the owner did not want to press charges.

The bakery has been a renowned establishment in Hyderabad since 1953 and its name refers to the founder’s hometown prior to partition, according to The Wire. The outlet said that the bakery has continued to operate across India under this name despite various similar incidents during times of Pakistan-India tensions.
Speaking to The Indian Express, Balaraju was quoted as saying: “No employees at the bakery were harmed. No serious damage was done.”
Another branch of the Karachi Bakery was also targeted earlier, where the “protesters were seen planting tricolour flags”, the outlet added.
A manager of the bakery told The Indian Express, “We are an Indian establishment. We cannot be branded Pakistani.”</p><small>2025-05-12 09:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12135652eed78c5.jpg?r=140102' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910528/us-china-agree-to-slash-tariffs-in-trade-war-de-escalation' target='_blank'><strong>US, China agree to slash tariffs in trade war de-escalation</strong></a><br><p>The United States and China announced on Monday an agreement to drastically reduce tit-for-tat tariffs for 90 days, de-escalating a trade war that has roiled financial markets and raised fears of a global economic downturn.
After their first talks since US President Donald Trump launched his trade war, the world’s two biggest economies agreed in a joint statement to bring their triple-digit tariffs down to two figures and continue negotiations.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the weekend talks with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and international trade representative Li Chenggang as “productive” and “robust”.
“Both sides showed a great respect,” Bessent told reporters.
US President Donald Trump had imposed duties of 145 per cent on imports for China last month — compared to 10pc for other countries in the global tariff blitz he launched last month.
Beijing hit back with duties of 125pc on US goods.
Bessent said the two sides agreed to reduce those tariffs by 115pc, taking US tariffs to 30pc and those by China to 10pc.
In their statement, the two sides agreed to “establish a mechanism to continue discussions about economic and trade relations”.
China hailed the “substantial progress” made at the talks.
“This move… is in the interest of the two countries and the common interest of the world,” the Chinese commerce ministry said, adding that it hoped Washington would keep working with China “to correct the wrong practice of unilateral tariff rises”.
 


The dollar, which tumbled after Trump launched his tariff blitz in April, rallied on the news while US stock futures soared. European and Asian markets also rallied.
The trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has rocked financial markets, raising fears the tariffs would rekindle inflation and cause a global economic downturn.
‘Bodes well for the future’
The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, praised the talks on Sunday as a “significant step forward” that “bode well for the future”.
“Amid current global tensions, this progress is important not only for the US and China but also for the rest of the world, including the most vulnerable economies,” she added.
Ahead of the meeting at the discreet villa residence of Switzerland’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Trump had signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80% Tariff on China seems right!”
However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally, saying China would also need to make concessions.
The Geneva meeting came days after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Britain, the first with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs.
The five-page, nonbinding deal confirmed to nervous investors that Washington was willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties.
But Trump maintained a 10pc levy on most British goods, and threatened to keep it in place as a baseline rate for most other countries.</p><small>2025-05-12 09:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604172-india-resumes-operations-at-32-airports-after-ceasefire-with-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan asks Junaid Akbar to 'step down' as PAC chairman</strong></a><br><p>

The development spending stood at Rs448.6bn in the first 10 months (July-April) of fiscal year 2025, accounting for less than 41pc of Rs1.1 trillion revised budget allocation for the whole year.
The lack of spending suggests a large part of the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) — revised down from Rs1.4tr to Rs1.1tr — would remain unspent at the end of the fiscal year in June.
The ministry’s monthly data released on Sunday showed funds given to parliamentarians were the only exception to the otherwise paltry spending.

Finance ministry pushes back date to surrender unspent funds by a month

The utilisation of funds at Rs35bn was even higher than the first revised allocation of Rs25bn for the current year.
 
 

A mechanism devised by the finance ministry for the current fiscal year dictated the government should release 15pc of the budgeted allocation of PSDP in the first quarter, followed by 20pc in the second quarter, 25pc in the third and the remaining 40pc in the last quarter.
Under the mechanism, the estimated release for PSDP by April end should be at least 73pc of the annual allocation or around Rs805bn — almost two times the actual spending.
All the 36 federal ministries, divisions and their agencies could spend only Rs339bn in 10 months.
The Planning Commission, however, claimed it had authorised Rs638bn for disbursement to federal ministries in the first 10 months in line with the finance ministry’s instructions. However, only Rs339bn could actually be spent on the ground.
The provinces and special areas, merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, saw the least spending with Rs100bn — 36pc of their annual allocation of Rs277bn.
Water Resources Division, which had the single largest allocation in PSDP at Rs170bn, could spend only Rs72.5bn,  despite securing 100pc authorisation from the planning commission.
The two major corporate entities, National Highway Authority (NHA) and National Transmission & Dispatch Company (NTDC), spent only Rs109.4bn in ten months against their joint allocation of Rs255bn.
The power sector, on the other hand, utilised Rs53bn in ten months or around 55pc of Rs94.5bn annual allocation.
The climate change division spent only Rs1.5bn out of Rs5.256bn allocation.
The Planning Commission, which is actually the custodian of the development programme, could itself only spend Rs3.85bn out of the allocated Rs19bn.
The data showed at least five ministries — commerce, communications, narcotics control, religious affairs divisions and Special Investment Facilitation Council — failed to spend any money.
Early funds surrender
The finance ministry had already directed all other ministries and divisions to finalise revised estimates for the outgoing fiscal year, devise budget estimates for the upcoming year and “surrender anticipated savings” by April 30.
This was the first time that finance ministry had ordered surrendering funds sought two months before the end of the fiscal year. The move may disrupt routine operations of the public sector.
In the past, the last date for funds surrender used to be May 31 when the ministries, departments and corporations had clarity on their financing requirements for the last month of fiscal year.
The ministry said the deadline has been advanced on the directives of the Public Accounts Committee.

And the war takes its toll on all involved: both the aggressors and their targets.
The ongoing military conflict between India and Pakistan will indeed leave an adverse impact on the latter’s fragile, recovering economy, but it will not spare India’s either.
The heavy costs of the conflict for India will extend far beyond the battlefields and severely undermine its longstanding ambition to position itself as a global economic powerhouse and attractive destination for companies looking to shift production from China. The military damage would be nothing compared to the losses India’s economy would have to bear.
Finance Outlook India has argued that the military funding decisions of India and Pakistan reflected their economic objectives. India will spend $80 billion in 2025 to modernise its military forces. Pakistan’s defense expenditures are projected to reach $11bn which places financial strain on its struggling economy.
“Investing heavily in defence often diverts resources from critical sectors such as health and education, creating long-term economic challenges,” the website quoted Shazia Malik, a defence analyst at Global Security Solutions, as saying.

‘The potential for a devastating conflict with Pakistan remains a latent risk to India’s rise on the global stage’

The war between the countries creates lasting economic damages that surpass basic military budget costs, it added. “The disruption of trade combined with reduced investor trust leads to monumental economic costs, which hinder regional development. Both countries and the entire area will benefit from diplomatic initiatives taking precedence over military confrontation.”
 
 

The hostilities between the nuclear-armed neighbours flared up on Saturday morning after Islamabad launched retaliatory strikes against multiple military targets in India hours after a failed Indian attempt to target Pakistani air bases in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and Jhang.
Ever since New Delhi had hit six civilian targets in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir in unprovoked attacks under its ‘Operation Sindoor’ on May 7, Islamabad had constantly warned it against escalation and made its intent to use its right to retaliate at a “place, time and manner of our own choosing” quite clear.
At least 31 civilians, including minors and women, had lost their lives in the attacks. In response, Pakistan took down five Indian jets, including three French-made Rafael, besides destroying an Indian brigade headquarters.
However, India did not stop at that despite claiming that “it would not escalate from here”. During the next couple of days, it again violated Pakistan’s territorial integrity by launching kamikaze drone attacks in multiple cities across Punjab and Sindh before targeting airbases in the wee hours of Saturday.
Initial state media reports suggested that Pakistan had targeted key Indian military installations in a “befitting response” as part of its retaliatory operation “Bunyan-un-Marsoos” in response to “India’s initial attack, which was an assault on our homeland, people and sovereignty,” a federal government statement said, referring to the earlier Indian missile strikes against airbases.
 
 

At the time of writing this, the state media has reported that Pakistan had inflicted massive damage on India, destroying their S-400 defence system, strategic airfields, and military supply and storage sites in addition to rendering 70 per cent of India’s power grids inoperative in a cyber attack.
Commenting on post-Pahalgam hostilities between India and Pakistan, S&P Global Ratings had on Thursday said that the ongoing conflict between the pair posed increased risks to both nations’ credit metrics —though immediate credit rating impacts are not expected with potential sovereign credit support deterioration if tensions escalate. The report suggested neither nation would benefit from extended tensions.
A sustained military conflict would create obstacles for India in attracting international investors looking to reorganise their production operations there during the current uncertain economic climate. It said a prolonged conflict could complicate efforts by foreign investors looking to expand in the country and diversify their supply chains.
A note by Moody’s on Monday said that escalating tensions between India and Pakistan would weigh on Pakistan’s economic growth, adding higher defence spending would also impact India’s “fiscal strength and slow its fiscal consolidation”. “Our geopolitical risk assessment for Pakistan and India accounts for persistent tensions, which have, at times, led to limited military responses,” it added.
India has a lot at stake if any escalation on the border with Pakistan goes out of control and leads to a broader conflict, Abhishek Gupta, India economist with Bloomberg Economics, had said in a note. “That may dent investors’ confidence in India as a safe haven from Trump’s tariffs, and capacity constraints at the political level may shift the focus away from the economy.”
Although Pakistan’s economic woes have made it less relevant on the international stage, it still had the potential to disrupt India’s efforts to become an export-oriented nation that is a key piece of the global supply chain, especially as it looks to attract companies from China, according to Pramit Pal Chaudhari, South Asia practice head at Eurasia Group.
“This adds to your risk premium… For India, these add to the image that you don’t want,” a Bloomberg report quoted him saying. The report also quoted analysts from India that “the potential for a devastating conflict with Pakistan remains a latent risk to India’s rise on the global stage”.
At the heart of the conflict is the longstanding dispute over Kashmir. Many across the world anticipated an escalation of tensions as soon as India blamed Pakistan — without any evidence, though — for involvement in a deadly militant attack in Pahalgam, a tourist destination in occupied Kashmir, on April 22.
In spite of Islamabad’s denial and offer for its complete cooperation in a neutral probe into the event, the Narendra Modi government amped up its anti-Pakistan rhetoric led by the Indian media. New Delhi immediately downgraded bilateral diplomatic relations, completely cut off trade ties, and pledged to take “punitive” action against Islamabad.
More crucially, New Delhi unilaterally and illegally “held in abeyance” the 64-year-old Indus Waters Treaty, threatening to strangulate Pakistan’s economy and food security. The weaponisation of the water treaty against the lower riparian practically amounts to an act of war, as rightly pointed out by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
 
 

The political rhetoric by the Modi government also led to widespread anti-Muslim riots in India and Occupied Kashmir as people raised questions about security lapses and the BJP government’s Kashmir policy, including the revocation of the valley’s autonomy in 2019.
While wreaking major economic destruction across the two countries with worldwide consequences, further escalation in the armed conflict between the nuclear nations would lead to catastrophic human loss.
Even though several countries have been actively trying to convince India to de-escalate, the world does not seem to be taking it seriously. It is time for the world to effectively intervene to preempt any catastrophic outcome from the conflict.
UN Secretary-General António Guterres has correctly emphasised that “the world cannot afford a military confrontation between India and Pakistan.” The US has called upon both Pakistan and India to hold “direct talks” to bring down tensions and said it will support any effort, including a neutral probe, to ensure the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack are brought to justice.
But it has so far refused to intervene directly. The world must realise that when nuclear-armed nations are fighting, all it takes is a miscalculation or a mistake. The risk increases if you have a madman like Modi taking such decisions.

“The 12th PKK Congress has decided to dissolve the PKK’s organisational structure and end its method of armed struggle,” the group announced in a statement after holding its congress last week.
The PKK’s announcement to dissolve itself heeds a call by its founder Abdullah Ocalan, jailed on an island off Istanbul since 1999, who urged his fighters in February to disarm and disband.
In a letter, Ocalan urged the PKK to hold a congress to formalise the decision.
Days later, the PKK’s leadership accepted Ocalan’s call, declaring a ceasefire.
In a speech on Saturday, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan hinted that news about a dissolution could come at any moment, adding that his government was determined to “save our country from the scourge of terrorism”.
“We are advancing with firm steps on the path to the goal of a terror-free Turkiye,” he said.
 
 

The PKK, designated a terrorist group by Turkiye, the United States and the European Union, has waged an insurgency since 1984.
Its original aim was to carve out a homeland for Kurds, who make up about 20 per cent of Turkiye’s 85 million people.
Since Ocalan was jailed, there have been various attempts to end the bloodshed, which has cost more than 40,000 lives.</p><small>2025-05-12 07:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/12123713f3b3658.jpg?r=123730' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1910516/indias-virat-kohli-follows-rohit-into-test-retirement' target='_blank'><strong>India’s Virat Kohli follows Rohit into Test retirement</strong></a><br><p>Indian batsman Virat Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket on Monday, bringing down the curtain on a sparkling career in the longest format just days after captain Rohit Sharma did the same.
Kohli, who made his debut in 2011 and scored 30 centuries and 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85 over 123 tests, is expected to remain available for one-day internationals.
The 36-year-old quit Twenty20 Internationals immediately after India won their second 20-overs World Cup trophy in the West Indies last year.
“It’s been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket. Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on,” Kohli posted on Instagram.
“It’s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I’ll carry for life.”
“There’s something deeply personal about playing in whites. The quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.”
 
         View this post on Instagram            

In a post on X, the Indian Cricket Board, BCCI, announced the farewell of the former captain, saying that “His contributions to #TeamIndia will forever be cherished!”
 






While Kohli’s final Test wrapped up a 3-1 Test series defeat by Australia in January that saw India relinquish the Border-Gavaskar Trophy for the first time in a decade, he will be remembered most for his spell as captain between 2014-2022.
Kohli won 40 of his 68 tests in charge of India to become the country’s most successful skipper in the format and sits fourth in the list of captains with the most Test victories.
Only Graeme Smith (53), Ricky Ponting (48) and Steve Waugh (41) won more tests as captains.
India suffered only 17 defeats with Kohli at the helm as he guided the side to the final of the inaugural World Test Championship in 2021, where they lost to New Zealand.
He was also part of the team that lost the second World Test Championship final to Australia in 2023.
“I’m walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,” he added.
“I’ll always look back at my Test career with a smile.”

This entire region is known for rich mango orchards. Powerful summer winds usually visit the region by the end of April or early May. These storms proved to be quite unfriendly for mango crops at a time when mango orchard contractors as well as owners had begun preparation to send some varieties to the fruit market in the beginning of May.
By the looks of it, this summer has not boded well for Sindh’s mango crop from day one. The fruit suffered initial losses due to water shortages which were further disrupted by massive pest attacks on the trees. Now, wind storms have undermined crop prospects.
 
 

The meteorological department had recorded the speed of the storms at 30 nautical miles, or 54 kilometres per hour, in Hyderabad on the night of May 3, followed by another the next morning in Mirpurkhas, where wind speeds were recorded at 28 nautical miles, or 52km per hour, as the storm drifted eastward in Mirpurkhas.
Wind storms caused the dropping of considerable unripe mangoes, locally known as kairi. Wholesale market dealers and orchard owners said losses in orchards are significant and led to the arrival of unripe-mango-laden vehicles in Hyderabad’s wholesale market in large numbers.

Orchard farmers and contractors brace for financial losses as wind storms further disrupt water-starved and pest-ridden mango crops

“Dozens of vehicles carrying kairi arrived following the storms, which is unusual in May. Otherwise, unripe mangoes take some time to be marketed,” said Asif Arain, a fruit trader in the wholesale market. He said that their arrival had crashed the market as prices plummeted to Rs300 to Rs400 per 50kg bag, which were Rs2,000 to Rs2,200 per 50kg before the storm hit.
These damages to unripe mangoes, according to Mirpurkhas-based mango producer Taha Memon, would translate into bigger monetary losses for him and other growers as fruit setting had reduced following pest attacks. “Actually, this malformation due to diseases is increasing, which is being attributed to climate change, and it is becoming increasingly troubling for us every season,” he said.
From the growers’ point of view, irrigation water supplies in early February and March are of essence, for this is the critical time when flowering starts converting into fruit setting in trees. “I used tube wells to irrigate the orchard in the absence of irrigation water supplies from the barrage. But my experience is that subsoil water is not a better substitute for canal water that carries silt and is beneficial for soil and trees,” said Mir Shah Mohammad from Tandojam, one of the worst storm-affected areas in the Hyderabad region.
 
 

Mr Mohammad opined that unripe mangoes remained undersized, and if this is the case in other orchards, then it is going to have a negative impact on export potential. Lower production is already being feared, he said.
Given the situation, mango orchard contractors have revoked their contracts unilaterally on the grounds that they would incur more financial losses if they continue with the contract; they believe they won’t be able to earn enough profit to recover their investment at the end of the day.
“Landlords promise they will cooperate with contractors, but most of them don’t. A contractor bears the loss and has to pay the committed amount even if he doesn’t get the necessary production,” said Haji Umar Daraz, who has multiple orchards on contract while confirming that storm-related damages are immense.
The contractual system is common among mango orchard owners, in which a contractor pays a fixed amount to the landlord to manage the orchard, harvest the fruit with labourers, and sell it. These contracts involve millions of rupees annually. Contractors are usually blamed for not making serious efforts to manage orchards. But orchard owners avoid handling this laborious job, too.
Mango orchards, by and large, are managed under conventional practices without government backing to promote innovation, research, and development at farms. “We have been told high-density mango farming is good and gives better yields with minimum losses of miscellaneous nature. But no such model orchard is created by the Sindh Horticulture Research Institute in Mirpurkhas, the oldest research body on mangos,” argued Mahmood Nawaz Shah, an orchard owner.
According to Mr Shah, mango producers are performing in a vacuum. Farmers themselves have taken initiatives to plant high-density mangoes without any institutional support, and such farming is capital-intensive. Since it is a paradigm shift in mango farming, farmers have to wait for five to seven years to know whether it is any good.
Furthermore, Mr Shah agrees that the current landscape of orchards is not sustainable. “A mango festival has become an annual ritual which, to me, is a cosmetic exercise. It doesn’t benefit anyone. An ordinary orchard owner needs practical guidance about effective management of orchards to positively impact yields,” he contended.
 
 

In a high-density farm, up to 800 to 1,300 trees in an acre are recommended, as plant-to-plant spacing is reduced considerably when compared with 30-40 trees in an acre in a conventional farm. Nadeem Shah, a Matiari-based orchard owner, is one of the few farmers who had attempted high-density farming and gave it up. He explained that, considering the cost-benefit ratio, he could not keep high-density farms intact, as it involved expensive labour.
However, Ghulam Sarwar Abro’s experience with high-density farming is giving him good results where maximum trees in an acre offer greater yields than lesser, larger canopy trees in one acre. “Older trees ultimately face the natural ageing process as well, which compromises their yields,” he quipped.

And implicit in this recognition, in reality, is that the time for centralised, arbitrary control of the country’s economic affairs seems to be over. This is somewhat obvious from how the water canal issue was finally settled by consensus in the Council of Common Interests (CCI). That means that centralisation has to be based on participatory federal democracy.
During the April 28th CCI meeting, the federal government informed the four provinces that it was in the process of establishing the 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) to finalise the 8th NFC Award and also a new formula for distribution of resources.
 
 

The finance ministry says it spent Rs638 billion on health, education and social protection, which, under the constitution, are provincial matters. The amount does not include the development spending.
The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) government pressed the federal government in the CCI to call the meeting of the 10th NFC and announce an interim award, says Muzammil Aslam, KP’s Finance Adviser to the chief minister.

Government gears up to transfer various federal bodies to provincial control as per the 18th constitutional amendment

Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar recently stressed the need for revisiting the NFC Award and phasing out overlapping federal bodies that contradict the spirit of devolution.
Addressing the final session of the 38th Annual General Meeting and Conference of the Pakistan Society of Development Economists, Mr Dar said that various federal bodies should be transferred to the provinces as per the 18th constitutional amendment.

Many analysts believe that subjects now proposed to be devolved, such as health and education sectors, would be better managed by local bodies

The strengthening of federating units is inevitable for a strong federation, he said, adding that Pakistan is blessed with immense natural resources and all provinces have unique strengths and potentials. The new Agricultural Tax Law, to be enforced from July 1, it may be added, is estimated to yield additional provincial revenue of over Rs500bn in FY26.
 
 

The government has already written letters to the provinces and sought their nominations for technical members for the 11th National Finance Commission. Sindh has again nominated Dr Asad Sayeed as its technical member, while its finance minister will be the other constitutionally nominated member.
The KP government has not yet nominated its technical member for the 11th Commission, as it wanted the meeting of the 10th Commission before the budget to get its due share on account of net hydel profit and merged districts, explains Mr Aslam.
Furthermore, serious claims stating that Article 140A of the constitution (which binds the provincial government to transfer political, administrative and financial powers to the elected representatives of the people) has been ignored and the Supreme Court decision in this regard has not been implemented also flow from the centralisation of power and authority at the provincial level. Many analysts believe that subjects now proposed to be devolved, such as health and education sectors, would be better managed by local bodies.
“The time for centralised control is over; it is time to govern from the grassroots,” argue analysts at Dawn. When something as basic as a functioning union council is absent in over a quarter of Balochistan’s areas for more than two years after elections, it sends a clear message: the local government there is not a priority. The yet elusive goal of winning the hearts of the estranged people of Balochistan can start off from focusing on the resolution of this most fundamental problem, says a The Express Tribune editorial.
On May 1, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) issued a stern warning to the government over persistent delays in holding local government elections in Islamabad. Every time the ECP completes preparations, it said, new amendments are introduced. The Commission has threatened to issue binding directives to the government if it fails to act promptly.
The Punjab Local Government Bill 2025 is currently awaiting approval from the provincial assembly, now being considered by its Standing Committee. The bill provides for the abolition of the district government council, replacing it with a district authority with the deputy commissioner of each district serving as chairmen.
 
 

The District Executive Board will have the chief executive officers of all departments as secretaries and the heads of all departments, including the District Health Department, Education Department, Social Welfare Department, Population Control, Sports, Transport, Civil Defence, Public Health Engineering, Arts and Culture and Tourism Department, as its members.
The Speaker of the Punjab Assembly, Malik Ahmed Khan, claimed that all political parties were asked to sit together and prepare this bill to ensure that there was no objection from the opposition. “The bill has been severely criticised by PTI members, and even an unknown number of PML-N members oppose it.”
In KP, the representatives of local bodies told newsmen on April 25 that despite repeated assurances from the provincial government, essential administrative and financial support, including development funds, has been denied for two years, leaving the local government unable to address basic community needs.

At the time of writing, the people of Pakistan are united in their pride of their armed forces, particularly the air force. The most hard-core critics of military spending have seen the wisdom of a high defence budget when we have a hostile nation as a neighbour.
But in the end, who does war benefit? Not the civilians who fear for their lives and livelihoods while mourning those who are lost to conflict. Not the countries that spend billions in resources to prop up the militaries.
From 1956 to 2024, India spent $1.4 trillion on military expenditure, compared to $348 billion in Pakistan, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), an independent international institute that provides data based on open sources.
 
 

India is one of the top five military spenders in the world. Despite the massive difference in military spending, Pakistan has proven that it can do more with less.
The real winners in any war are not nations but arms manufacturers. In a world increasingly shaped by conflict, global military spending reached $2.72tr in 2024 — a 9.4 per cent increase from 2023 and the sharpest annual rise since the end of the Cold War, according to Sipri. This marks the 10th consecutive year of rising global military expenditure.
As governments continue to prioritise defence, often at the cost of education, healthcare, and public welfare, the long-term economic and social consequences are profound — something we have proof of in the malnourished children living in poverty and illiteracy.
In 2023, arms and military service sales by the 100 largest companies reached $632bn — a real-terms increase of 4.2pc from 2022.
‘The arms revenues of the Top 100 arms producers still did not fully reflect the scale of demand, and many companies have launched recruitment drives, suggesting they are optimistic about future sales,’ said a 2024 report by Sipri.
The hate that has led to blind conflict only serves to enrich the already rich while inflicting immense losses on those fighting. The only sane move, regardless of the enemy’s jingoism and the war drums whipping up a frenzy, is to de-escalate and walk the path of peace.

• Claims he was on duty with a pilot from Mian Mir area
LAHORE:  A driver serving in the Pakistan International Airlines’ (PIA)  Limousine service continues to face arrest and court hearings, ever  since he was picked up after being “spotted near the Lahore corps commander’s house” on May 9, 2023.
Shah Din, claims he was on official assignment, to pick up a PIA pilot from his residence in the Mian Mir locality.
He  drove from The Mall towards the cantonment area and, on the suggestion  of traffic police, proceeded towards Rahat Bakery and then turned  towards CMH Hospital to reach the airport.
There, he was  caught up in the crowd as PTI workers and supporters launched their  violent protest at the intersection outside the corps commander’s residence.
 
 

But in the meanwhile, he was spotted in the vicinity on  CCTV footage and through geo-fencing, and eventually booked and  arrested.
The PIA Lahore Airport scheduling officer had written a  letter to the SHO Sanda Police station soon after the arrest that the  driver was on an official duty to pick up cockpit crew for the Jeddah  flight on May 9, 2023 from his residence in Mian Mir. He requested the  police officer that the driver be released as he was not involved in any  illegal activities
The Airport Limousine Services (Pvt) Ltd also  issued a certificate in September, 2023 explaining that he was on  official duty on May 9. They requested that the driver be released.  However, the requests went in vain and the elderly driver is still  facing the unending ordeal.
Penning down the nightmare he is  facing, Mr Din has written a statement that he is working as a driver at  the Lahore Airport and in possession of a service record, official ID  card and official letter.
On May 9, 2023, he claimed to be on an official duty and picked up PIA Pilot Captain Salahuddin Yousaf from  his residence in Mian Mir Colony and left for the airport.
Near Rahat  Bakery, he said, he saw a massive traffic jam and he changed the route.
“I received calls from my home and told family members that he had  safely reached the airport and dropped the pilot for his Lahore-Jeddah  flight PK-759,” he stated and added that he reached home after  completing his duty. “All the information is available on the PIA  record.”
After four days, he said, police raided  his residence on May 14, desecrated the sanctity of four walls and  arrested him for riots on May 9. He was taken to Burki and investigated  for three days.
However, Mr Din stated that he was booked under  FIR 1570/23 (Mughalpura police station), produced before an  anti-terrorism court and eventually sent to the Camp Jail.
In a  two-page statement, Mr Din stated that he was granted bail on May 27 on an application filed by his children. However, he lame­nted that he  was re-arrested as soon as he came out of the jail. He said that he had  developed serious heart ailment due to mental and physical torture while  in detention.
Mr Din said he was later released but his  ordeal did not end as he was arrested for the third time on Oct 16 after  being booked in an FIR 96/23 at Sarwar Road police station and was kept  in jail for over six months before he was released on bail.
He said that he has so far attended 42 court hearings.

China decided to make contacts with the US side after taking full account of global expectations, national interests and appeals from US businesses and consumers.
China possesses strong resilience and ample policy tools to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests. It stands ready to work with the international community to jointly oppose all forms of unilateralism, protectionism and economic coercion.
Whether the road ahead involves negotiation or confrontation, one thing is clear: China’s determination to safeguard its development interests is unshakable, and its stance on maintaining the global economic and trade order remains unwavering.
The United States’ reckless abuse of tariffs has flagrantly contravened World Trade Organisation rules and destabilised the global economic order. Far from serving any legitimate purpose, these punitive duties represent a deliberate attempt to upend the multilateral trade system, inflicting damage on the rightful interests of countries around the world.

Beijing stands ready to work with the international community to jointly oppose all forms of unilateralism and protectionism

For the United States itself, its tariff offensive amounts to economic self-harm: while it cannot cure underlying structural problems, it has triggered financial market volatility, fueled domestic inflation, eroded industrial capacity and raised the risk of recession.
As the world’s two largest economies, China and the United States share a profound stake in ensuring the soundness and steadiness of their commercial ties. The US business and academic communities have consistently stressed that international trade is not a zero-sum game but should foster mutual benefit and shared success. US policymakers should heed these rational and objective voices, and take concrete steps to restore China-US trade relations to a path of healthy and stable growth.
Given mounting calls for economic stability, the decision to sit down for negotiations represents a positive and necessary step to resolve disagreements and avert further escalation. But as China has consistently emphasised, meaningful dialogue can only proceed on the basis of mutual respect, equal consultation and mutual benefit.
If Washington is truly committed to resolving trade frictions through dialogue, it must first confront the harm its tariff-driven policies have inflicted not only on the global trading system, but also on its own economy and citizens.
It must honor established international trade rules and adhere to principles of fairness and justice. Talks should never be a pretext for continued coercion or extortion, and China will firmly reject any proposal that compromises core principles or undermines the broader cause of global equity.
 
 

Confronted with US protectionism and economic bullying, China has deployed decisive countermeasures and rallied multilateral support through the United Nations and other global forums to amplify the call for justice. China’s actions defend not only its own legitimate development rights but also the shared interests of the wider international community, particularly smaller and developing nations.
China has taken note that some economies are also engaged in negotiations with the United States. It must be emphasised that appeasement cannot secure peace, nor can compromise earn respect. Upholding principled positions and defending fairness and justice remain the right way to safeguard one’s legitimate interests.
At its heart, this is not just a trade dispute — it is an encounter between two fundamentally different visions in this age of economic globalisation: one rooted in openness, cooperation and shared growth; the other driven by confrontation, exclusion, and zero-sum mentality.
The talks in Switzerland mark a crucial step towards resolving the issue. However, its ultimate resolution requires sufficient strategic patience and perseverance, as well as the international community’s steadfast support for justice. China entered the Geneva talks with confidence in its solid economic fundamentals. Its economy grew by 5.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2025; in 2024, its total goods imports and exports surpassed 43 trillion yuan (about 5.94 trillion US dollars), with a more diversified set of trading partners and improved export composition.
Meanwhile, policy innovation and market vitality are working in tandem: new fiscal and monetary measures, ranging from interest-rate cuts to targeted support for innovation and social welfare, have further bolstered growth prospects and strengthened China’s ability to weather external shocks.
At a time when globalisation is under strain and protectionism is on the rise, China has chosen not to lock itself up. Instead, it has doubled down on opening up, advancing trade and investment liberalisation with renewed determination and creating opportunities for shared development across the globe.
China’s position is clear: no matter how the global landscape shifts, it will remain committed to openness, using the reliability of its own development to help offset the uncertainties facing the wider world.
Trade wars and tariff battles yield no winners. A stable and constructive China-US relationship serves the interests of both nations and the world at large. It is through sustained dialogue, responsible management of differences and deeper win-win cooperation between the world’s two largest economies that the global economy can gain the confidence and momentum it urgently needs.

The new pope, elected on May 8, called for an  “authentic and lasting peace” in Ukraine, a ceasefire in Gaza, and the release of all Israeli prisoners.
Speaking in fluent Italian, Leo also welcomed the recent fragile ceasefire between India and Pakistan, negotiated overnight, and said he was praying to God to grant the world the  “miracle of peace.”   “No more war!” the pope said, repeating a frequent call of the late Pope Francis and noting the recent 80th anniversary of the end of World War Two, in which some 60 million people were killed.
Leo said today’s world was living through  “the dramatic scenario of a Third World War being fought piecemeal,” again repeating a phrase coined by Pope Francis.
Tens of thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square and on the Via della Conciliazione leading to the Vatican broke into applause at the call for peace on what was a joyous occasion despite Leo’s solemn message.

The new pontiff welcomes ‘fragile’ ceasefire between India and Pakistan

The new pope said he carries in his heart the  “suffering of the beloved people of Ukraine.”  Hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed direct talks with Ukraine aimed at ending the bloody three-year war, Leo appealed for negotiations to reach an  “authentic, just and lasting peace”.
The pope also said he was  “profoundly saddened” by the war in Gaza, calling for an immediate ceasefire, humanitarian aid and release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas.
Leo said he was glad to hear of the recent India-Pakistan ceasefire and hoped negotiations would lead to a lasting accord between the nuclear-armed neighbours. He added:  “But there are so many other conflicts in the world!”
Marching bands
Leo, the former Cardinal Robert Prevost, is the first US-born pontiff and was a relative unknown on the world stage before his election. He previously served for decades as a missionary in Peru before first becoming a cardinal to take up a senior Vatican role two years ago.
Leo’s first Sunday address coincided with a previously planned pilgrimage to Rome by marching bands from around the world. Minutes before the pope addressed the crowd, bands marched up the broad boulevard leading to the Vatican playing songs such as Y.M.C.A. by the Village People, the theme from the film Rocky, and music by John Philip Sousa, who composed the marching classic  “Stars and Stripes Forever”.
Peruvian Gladys Ruiz, who lives in Rome, was among the crowd in the square, estimated at more than 100,000 by Italian authorities. Calling Leo a  “Peruvian pope” Ruiz said his election is  “a great honour for us”. Leo has dual citizenship, having gained Peruvian citizenship in 2015.
Also present were Dennis Gilligan and wife Maureen from Boston, Massachusetts, visiting Rome for their anniversary. He said he had passed up an opportunity to see Pope John Paul II when he visited Boston in 1979.
“I regretted it all my life,” he said.  “This was very moving.”  The crowd was also entertained by bands from Italy, Mexico and other parts of Latin America who came to Rome for the ongoing Catholic Holy Year. In all of his appearances since his election, Leo has not made any mention of the country of his birth, angering some US conservative commentators.

PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan said India carried out a “shameful and unprovoked aerial assault” on Pakistan on the night between Tuesday and Wednesday.
The PTI leader said the “imposed and cowardly government” waited four days before issuing any official response to Indian aggression.
 
 

“This criminal delay led to the loss of precious lives and the blood of our brave martyrs is on the hands of imposed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his puppet administration,” said Mr Ayub, who is also the opposition leader in National Assembly.
The opposition leader, however, lauded the armed forces for their professionalism, while crediting former prime minister Imran Khan for modernising the PAF’s defence capabilities.
Imran’s release
Mr Ayub said former premier was the “strongest and most compelling voice” against Indian PM Narendra Modi’s ideology and Indian aggression.
“Only Imran Khan can lead Pakistan out of crisis and unite the nation — his immediate release is critical for Pakistan’s stability,” he said.
A post on PTI’s official X account also reiterated the demand for his release. “He fought Pakistan’s case with courage and conviction in 2019, and the nation needs his leadership now,” said the post.

The participants also condemned the Indian aggression, calling it a blatant provocation and a violation of international norms.
The rally, which began from the party office called Insaf House on Sharea Faisal, drew a large number of PTI workers and supporters from different parts of the city.
However, when the rally reached near the Finance & Trade Centre (FTC), it found the city administration and police blocked the main road leading to the ‘Red Zone’ by parking police mobiles and water tankers on Sharea Faisal.
The closure of the road caused a massive traffic jam. Consequently, the PTI rally had to change its route, made a left turn towards Kala Pul and reached Nishan-i-Pakistan near Seaview via DHA.

Party leaders and activists condemn Indian aggression, celebrate victory

The rally gained momentum as district-level PTI workers and supporters joined the main procession.
The rally was led by PTI-Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh and attended by city president Raja Azhar, Dr Masroor Siyal, Karachi General Secretary Arsalan Khalid and Senior Vice President Faheem Khan, along with other senior leaders.
The participants carried national and party flags, chanting slogans like “Pakistan Zindabad” and “Imran Khan Paindabad”.
The speakers and participants of the rally demanded the immediate release of the party’s founding chairman Imran Khan.
They described Mr Khan not only as a political leader but as the true voice of the people. They reiterated their commitment to peaceful protest and national solidarity.
In a symbolic move, the participants also hoisted an effigy of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi using a crane, as a message against what they termed India’s cowardly acts of aggression.
The crowd also chanted slogans against Modi and expressed their firm resolve to defend the country as a united nation.
Speaking on the occasion, PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh demanded the immediate release of former prime minister Khan, calling him “the true leader of the Pakistani nation” and “a symbol of resistance against oppression”.
He urged the judiciary and the government to uphold justice and democracy by ending what he described as political victimisation.
Mr Sheikh strongly condemned India’s recent actions, labelling them as a blatant provocation and a violation of international standards.
“We want to send a clear message today that the people of Pakistan stand united against any threat to our sovereignty,” he said.
“This rally is not just about protest — it’s a declaration that the nation stands with its armed forces and against the cowardly aggression of Modi’s government,” he added.
Later, the participants dispersed peacefully after offering prayers for national unity, the security forces and the early release of PTI’s jailed leadership.

• Utility spokesperson claims supply to city restored, areas getting water on schedule
KARACHI: While Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has recently taken notice of the water crisis and instructed the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) to restore normal supply, several localities in all the seven districts of Karachi have still been facing a severe water crisis since the leakage of an 84-inch main on Karachi University campus on April 29.
Despite the completion of the repair work on the ruptured line, water woes of the people across the city have yet to come to an end as restoration of normal supply to the affected areas has been delayed due to filling of the repaired line with water under low pressure.
Although the CM had directed the KWSC to restore normal water supply from Saturday, sources in the KWSC said that it might take several more days to resume proper supply.
The city that requires over 1,200 million gallons of water daily (MGD) got only 400 MGD water, or around 40 per cent out of the regular supply of 650 MGD, due to repair work for the past 12 days.
 
 

The persistent water shortage piled miseries on people in the sweltering weather, leaving many with no option but to buy water on exorbitant rates.
The affected neighbourhoods include Gulshan-i-Iqbal, Sheme-33, PECHS, Bahadurabad, Tariq Road, Chanesar Town, Jinnah Town, Liaquatabad, Nazimabad, Pak Colony, Golimar, Shershah, old city area, Landhi, Korangi, PAF Base Masroor, etc.
The KWSC had initially said that the repair work on the ruptured pipeline would be completed in 96 hours. However, the repair took more time due to replacement of 32-foot piece of the damaged line.
A spokesman for the water utility claimed that normal water supply to the city had been restored and different areas were being supplied as per the schedule.
However, residents in different localities said that there was not a single drop of water in their taps for the past 12 days, making their life miserable.
A resident of PECHS, Zaid Rabbani, said that no water had flowed in their locality since the water main burst at the university. “We somehow arranged water tanker, but after paying additional price,” he said.
Residents of several localities said that the water supply was restored in their areas for a very short time.
Tauseef Ali Shah, a resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, said the supply was restored hardly for an hour. “The pressure was also too low
and we could have only two buckets of water,” he lamented.
Sources in the water utility said the water pressure was kept low initially after the completion of the repair work as a precaution in view of the repair work on the damaged line.
They said the entire distribution network of the water utility had gone completely dried during the repair work and now the water level in different main lines in the city had got normal.
The sources said that the situation would normalise within a couple of days.
Leakages in main lines have been frequent as all main lines of different diameters, ranging from 48 inches to 84 inches, were laid in 1956 and 1971 across the city.

The ceasefire announced on Saturday allayed the fears of broader escalation but the wife of an Indian Border Security Force (BSF) trooper captured by Pakistan last month is perturbed about her husband.
She has asked her government if her ‘sindoor’ would be returned.
Sindoor is a vermilion mark worn mostly by rural Hindu women in their hair parting to depict their marital status.
Indian news publication The Wire reported that the family of 34-year-old Purnam Sau in Rishra, West Bengal, was hoping diplomatic efforts would help his return.
Sau, posted with the 24th Battalion of the BSF in Firozpur, Punjab, was deployed along the India-Pakistan border on April 23, when he assisted local farmers in evacuating a vulnerable zone and reportedly crossed the international boundary inadvertently.
The event took place at a time when tensions were high between India and Pakistan after 26 tourists were killed in a terrorist attack in Pahalgam on April 22.
Pakistani forces reportedly deta­ined him and later released a photograph showing him blindfolded, confirming his capture, The Wire said.
At their modest home in Rishra in Hooghly district, Sau’s family is reeling from shock and uncertainty. His wife, Rajani Sau, seven months pregnant, collapsed while narrating her ordeal.
“My husband has been captured by the Pakistani army. He is in their custody. They have released a blindfolded photo of him,” she sobbed.
“BSF officers visited our home and told us they are trying to bring my husband back. But now the situation is like a war. I don’t know what news will come next!”
Purnam’s last call to Rajani was on the night of April 22, hours before his arrest, when he checked in on her health, as he often did after night shifts.
“So many days have passed, and there’s still no word from him,” she said.
At the mere mention of Operation Sindoor, Rajani broke down, pulling her veil over her face as she wept, “Give me back my sindoor, government!”
Purnam’s father, Bhola Sau, a retired security guard, voiced frustration at the silence following initial military assurances.
“We went to Firozpur with my daughter-in-law, and the army officers promised they were trying [to bring Purnam back]. Now, there’s no update.”
Sau’s mother said her son “served the nation” for 18 years. “Today, we feel abandoned.”
The incident has united Rishra’s tight-knit, largely non-Bengali migrant community, descendants of jute mill workers from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.
Locals have taken turns to visit the family’s home, where TV screens blare news updates around the clock.
“We’re torn. On one side, war cries; on the other, we beg for peace and Purnam’s safe return. We’ll celebrate with sindoor only when he’s home,” shared Purnam’s brother, Shyamsundar Shau.
Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressed hope last Monday for a swift resolution from the Home Ministry. Hooghly MP Kalyan Banerjee confirmed he raised the issue with BSF commanders.

• Pakistan welcomes US offer, says settlement must be under UNSC resolutions
• FO says committed to regional peace, security, interested in boosting trade ties with US
WASHINGTON: As hostilities between Pakistan and India come to an end with the help of the US, Pakistan on Sunday welcomed a proposal by President Donald Trump expressing willingness to play an active role for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute by working with both South Asian countries with an aim to put an end to this perennial conflict.
Diplomacy and pressure from the United States helped secure the ceasefire deal on Saturday evening, but within hours of its coming into force, both sides started blaming each other for violations. The reported shelling died down by Sunday dawn.
President Trump, in a statement posted on his Truth Social platform on Sunday, praised the leadership in New Delhi and Islamabad for agreeing to a ceasefire and credited the US efforts for facilitating this “historic and heroic decision”. “I will work with both of you to see if, after a ‘thousand years’, a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,” the US president said in his message.
 


In a swift response to the remarks made by President Trump, Pakistan’s Foreign Office acknowledged with “appreciation the constructive role played by the United States, alongside other friendly states, in supporting the recent ceasefire understanding between Pakistan and India”.
The FO in a statement said that Islamabad appreciated President Trump’s expressed “willingness to support efforts aimed at the resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute — a longstanding issue that has serious implications for peace and security in South Asia and beyond”.
“Pakistan reaffirms that any just and lasting settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute must be in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions and must ensure the realisation of the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including their inalienable right to self-determination,” said the statement, adding that Pakistan was committed to engaging with the US and the international community to promote peace, security, and prosperity in the region.
“We also look forward to deepening our multifaceted partnership with the United States, particularly in the areas of trade, investment, and economic cooperation,” it added.
Mr Trump’s Kashmir statement came a day after India and Pakistan agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire along the Line of Control and International Border, following what the US president described as a “long night” of negotiations facilitated by Washington.
 
 

The ceasefire, which came into effect on Saturday, was endorsed by Indian and Pakistani officials shortly after the initial declaration by Mr Trump. Tensions had spiked after Indian forces struck targets in nuclear-armed Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir last week. The flare-up raised fears of a wider regional conflict.
Referring to the role his administration played in defusing the crisis, Mr Trump said, “I am very proud of the strong and unwavering leadership of India and Pakistan for having the strength, wisdom, and fortitude to understand that it was time to stop the aggression that could have led to the death and destruction of so many.”
He warned that “millions of good and innocent people could have died” if both sides had failed to seize the moment. “Your legacy is greatly enhanced by your brave actions. I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision,” he added.
While the Kashmir issue was not explicitly mentioned in the ceasefire announcement, Mr Trump emphasised his intention to stay engaged on the broader dispute. “I will work with you both to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be found regarding Kashmir,” he wrote, adding that he also intended to “increase trade substantially with both of these great nations”.
He also previously referred to Kashmir as a “thousand-year” dispute, a term initially seen as a mistake but later “interpreted” as a way of stressing the deep-rooted and complex nature of the conflict.
“I am very close to India and I’m very close to Pakistan, as you know. And they’ve had that fight for a thousand years in Kashmir. Kashmir has been going on for a thousand years, probably longer than that…” he told reporters last month.
 
 

Several senior US officials and Republican lawmakers celebrated the ceasefire and credited President Trump for what they described as a landmark moment in regional diplomacy.
“I am incredibly proud to serve alongside Vice President Vance and Secretary Rubio. This historic administration is working every day to achieve peace. The golden age is coming, and it starts with peace throughout the world,” said Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, who is expected to be nominated as US ambassador to the UN, said this was “progress toward stability in a historically volatile region. It won’t be easy, there will be violations, and much work remains to be done, but it is another step in President Trump’s commitment to peace.”
Although India has long resisted third-party involvement in Kashmir, Trump’s repeated references to the conflict — and his offer to work toward a resolution — mark a notable shift in US engagement with South Asia’s most enduring flashpoint.

• Indian military dodges question about loss of fighter jets
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s armed forces on Sunday said they struck 26 Indian targets in ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ to re-establish deterrence after India violated Pakistan’s airspace earlier this week and separately targeted air bases in early-morning strikes.
In a press conference alongside Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Director General Public Relations Air Vice Marshal Aurangzeb Ahmed and Naval Staff (Operations) Deputy Chief Vice Admiral Raja Rab Nawaz, Pakistan Army’s chief spokesperson Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared details about the operation.
He said the dastardly attacks began on the night of May 6 and 7, resulting in the loss of innocent civilian lives, including women, children and the elderly. He said one Pakistani aircraft was slightly damaged during the Indian missile attack.
“Twenty-six military targets, along with facilities in India used to target Pakistani citizens and entities involved in fomenting terrorism in Pakistan, were engaged in both Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and mainland India,” he said in the presser.
 


Gen Chaudhry said Pakistan’s response was a “textbook demonstration” of integrated tri-services, enabled by real-time situational awareness, network-centric warfare capabilities and seamless multidomain operations.
“The targets included air force and aviation bases at Suratgarh, Sirsa, Adampur, Bhooj, Nalia, Bathinda, Barnala, Halwara, Avantipura, Srinagar, Jammu, Mamoon, Ambala, Udampur and Pathankot — all of which sustained major damages,” he added.
The DG said Brahmos facilities, which had fired missiles in Pakistan and killed innocent civilians, were also destroyed.
 
 

India launched a series of strikes under ‘Operation Sindoor’ soon after the Pahalgam tragedy in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, in which 31 people were martyred. Pakistan’s military responded swiftly, downing five Indian jets, destroying Indian brigade headquarters, and check posts in the occupied Kashmir along the Line of Control.
The ISPR chief paid tribute to those who were martyred in the Indian aggression and their families, while praying for the speedy recovery of the wounded.
“We extend our heartfelt gratitude to every officer, soldier, airman and sailor of the Armed Forces of Pakistan who made this success on the battlefield possible through their courage, professionalism and sacrifice.”
The military spokesperson particularly thanked the youth of Pakistan — “who became the frontline soldiers as information and cyber warriors of the country” — and the media that stood as a “steel wall” against the Indian media. He also appreciated politicians for their support to the army during these times and lauded the premier for taking “destiny-changing decisions” during this testing time
War not an option

Responding to a question about who first requested for the ceasefire, the DG ISPR said: “Put it on record that Pakistan never requested for a ceasefire.”
He warned that there was no space for a war between two nuclear-armed nations. “if anyone wants to carve out this space for war, he is actually carving out the space for mutual annihilation,” he added.
He said: “This is why you saw how in this conflict Pakistan acted in a very mature manner and through conventional forces, we maintained escalation control, through conventional forces we gave them a two notch up response while also ensuring that the Pakistan forces employed on the counterterrorism operations … no pull is also exerted on them.”
IAF airfields hit
Air Vice Marshal Ahmed, while describing Pakistan’s response to the Indian Air Force, said the PAF’s response was based “on the time and place of own choosing”, displaying “bold, aggressive and unwavering resolve of the brave military leadership”.
 
 

“I must appreciate the leadership … they were resolute and clear in giving instructions to all of us and that is perhaps the reason why we were so sure about what we had to do,” he said.
“With unprecedented reach, precision and lethality, while avoiding collateral, the PAF hit maximum number of IAF airfields in a single operational package since 1971 because they crossed the international border,” the officer said.
“While reestablishing deterrence, Pakistan negated the setting of a new normal under the hegemonistic design of a supremacist regime through swift and effective response.”
Sea frontiers
Vice Admiral Rab Nawaz said the Pakistan Navy was able to defend the country’s sea frontiers from a “numerically superior enemy”.
He gave details of the navy’s readiness to thwart any attack from the sea. He said there was a hype that INS Vikrant (Indian fleet) was approaching Karachi. “We were keeping a very close eye on the activities at sea […] we were monitoring it from day one,” he added.
 
 

“On the night of May 6 and 7, it was close to Bombay and on May 9, it was essentially 400 nautical miles from the Pakistani coast and it retreated close to Bombay,” he said.
“If a carrier gets within 400 nautical miles, it simplifies our problem. The navy maritime air arm was proper ready to generate a response at all times. If there was any aggression from the sea we were ready to respond effectively,” he said.
Indian military dodges question
Indian military officers, meanwhile, said that the objectives of ‘Operation Sindoor’ were achieved, with ‘high-value terrorists’ being eliminated, but dodged a question whether they had lost a bunch of warplanes in the operation.
The officers, speaking at a press conference, provided key details on Operation Sindoor, its impact and results, saying that the “objective has been achieved”.
Air Marshal AK Bharti, DGMO Lt Gen Rajiv Ghai, Maj Gen SS Sharma and Vice Admiral AN Pramod addressed the press. Responding to reports that Rafale fighter jets were downed, Air Marshal AK Bharti did not confirm or deny the claims, stating instead that “losses are a part of any combat scenario”.
The Indian military said, “We are in a combat scenario and losses are a part of it. Question is that ‘have we achieved our objective’? Answer is a thumping yes. As for details, at this time I would not like to comment on that, as we are still in combat, and give advantage to (our) adversary. All our pilots are back home.”

The minister said during a visit of the Sukkur Barrage, the North-West Canal and the Kirthar Canal in Dadu that the replacement of the gates would reduce the weight by 3,500 tonnes. 
He said the work on the barrage’s infrastructure and the gates had been tested using modern machinery. The gates’ replacement work was expected to be completed by June, he said.
He stressed that there would be no compromise on the quality of the work, and all construction work must meet international standards. The Sindh government was committed to providing all necessary resources for the timely completion of the crucial projects, he said.
He expressed hope the completion of the projects would not only improve the irrigation system but also have a positive impact on Sindh’s agriculture and economy.
He directed contractors to utilise all their capabilities to complete the work within the stipulated timeframe.
The minister said in Sukkur that this project held immense importance for Sindh’s agricultural economy. Its successful completion would further help enhance the irrigation system, he said.
He instructed officials to strengthen monitoring mechanisms and promptly addressed any obstacles in the ongoing work.

The increasingly ugly trade spat between Washington and Beijing has rocked financial markets and raised fears of a global economic slowdown and an inflationary spike in the United States.
“We’ve made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade talks,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters in Geneva after the second day of discussions.
“The talks were productive,” he said, taking no questions but promising a “complete briefing” on the outcome on Monday.
In a statement on Sunday, which did not provide any additional details, the White House hailed what it called a new “trade deal” with China.
China’s Vice Premier He Lifeng told reporters the meetings had achieved “substantial progress,” echoing Bessent’s remarks, and described the atmosphere as “candid, in-depth and constructive.”
“This is an important first step,” he said, adding there were plans for a joint communique to be published Monday.
The two sides have agreed to set up a joint mechanism focused on “regular and irregular communications related to trade and commercial issues”, China’s international trade representative Li Chenggang said at the same briefing.
Asked if the communique would arrive before financial markets opened, Li replied: “If the dishes are delicious, timing is not a matter.”
“Whenever released, it is going to be big, good news,” he said.
The meetings marked the first time senior officials from the world’s two largest economies have met face-to-face over trade since Trump slapped steep new levies on China totalling 145 per cent, with cumulative US duties on some Chinese goods reaching a staggering 245pc.
In retaliation, China put 125pc tariffs on US goods.
“These discussions mark a significant step forward and, we hope, bode well for the future,” World Trade Organisation chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said in a statement shortly after her own meeting with He Lifeng.
“Amid current global tensions, this progress is important not only for the US and China but also for the rest of the world, including the most vulnerable economies,” she added.
Devil in the details
“It’s definitely encouraging,” Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) vice president Wendy Cutler told AFP after the talks had concluded.
“The two sides spent over 15 hours in discussions,” she said. “That’s a long time for two countries to be meeting, and I view that as positive.”
Ahead of the meetings at the discrete villa residence of Switzerland’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Trump signalled he might lower the tariffs, suggesting on social media that an “80pc tariff on China seems right!”
However, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later clarified that the United States would not lower tariffs unilaterally. China would also need to make concessions, she said.
The fact the talks are even happening “is good news for business, and for the financial markets”, Gary Hufbauer, a senior non-resident fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said in an interview while the talks were ongoing.
But Hufbauer cautioned he was “very sceptical that there will be any return to something like normal US-China trade relations”. Even a tariff rate of 70-80pc would still potentially halve bilateral trade, he said.
“The devil will be in the details,” said Cutler from ASPI. “Without the details, it’s hard to assess whether the meeting was successful or not.”
‘Great progress!!’
China’s vice premier went into the discussions buoyed by Friday’s news that China’s exports rose last month despite the trade war.
The unexpected development was attributed by experts to a re-routing of trade to Southeast Asia to mitigate US tariffs.
The Geneva meeting comes after Trump unveiled a trade agreement with Britain, the first with any country since he unleashed his blitz of global tariffs.
The five-page, non-binding deal confirmed to nervous investors that Washington is willing to negotiate sector-specific relief from recent duties. But Trump maintained a 10pc baseline levy on most British goods.
In a Truth Social post on Saturday, Trump said the talks had made “great progress!!”
“We want to see, for the good of both China and the US, an opening up of China to American business,” he added.

Faced with increasing attacks by militants, especially in KP and Balochistan, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations.
Khanzala Khan, spokesperson to Bannu regional police officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan, told Dawn.com that terrorists attempted to abduct three locals in the Landewa Gorobai area of Lakki Marwat.
“Local police immediately launched a search operation after receiving information about the incident,” Khan said. “During the operation, the police had a face-to-face encounter with the terrorists.”
The spokesperson added that terrorists opened fire on the police team, with a policeman sustaining a minor injury.
“However, the police and the DSP (Deputy Superintendent of Police) present at the scene fought bravely and pushed the terrorists back,” Khan said, adding that police recovered the three abductees. “Three terrorists were injured in the encounter and taken to the mountains by their companions. Two terrorists were killed on the spot.”
The spokesperson added that Lakki Marwat District Police Officer Jawad led a search operation to trace the escaped terrorists.
“Local peace committees cooperated fully with the police,” Khan added.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.
However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.</p><small>2025-05-11 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604084-at-least-two-cops-martyred-in-peshawar-blast' target='_blank'><strong>At least two cops martyred in Peshawar suicide blast</strong></a><br><p>

Noor, 27, was found murdered at a residence in Islamabad’s upscale Sector F-7/4 on July 20, 2021. A first information report (FIR) was registered later the same day against Zahir Jaffer, who was arrested from the site of the murder.
In February 2022, a district and sessions judge convicted Jaffer of murdering Mukadam, handing him the death penalty along with 25 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000. His household staff, Iftikhar and Jameel — co-accused in the case — were each sentenced to 10 years in prison, while all other suspects, including Jaffer’s parents and TherapyWorks employees, were acquitted.
According to the cause list available on the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s website, “the hearing on the appeal against Jaffer’s death sentence will be held on May 13.”
Justice Hashim Kakar will head a three-member bench, comprising Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim and Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, that will hear the case.
Noor’s father, Shaukat Muqaddam’s appeal against the acquittal of Jaffer’s father, Zakir Jaffer, is also set for hearing.
The appeals of the convicted co-accused in the case will also be heard.
According to the FIR registered by her father at the time of the murder, he had discovered that his daughter had been “brutally murdered with a sharp-edged weapon and beheaded”.
In March 2023, the Islamabad High Court upheld the death sentence for Jaffer and also converted his 25-year jail term into another death penalty.
In April 2023, an appeal in the Supreme Court was filed against the IHC decision to uphold the death sentence.
Last year, Noor’s father had urged the SC to take up the murder case pending for more than one and a half years in the top court.
Mukadam, a former diplomat, had addressed a press conference to mark the birth anniversary of his slain daughter and demanded swift justice from the top court.</p><small>2025-05-11 15:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/604063-punjab-schools-to-reopen-from-tomorrow-as-pak-india-tensions-ease' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab schools reopen today as Pakistan-India tensions ease</strong></a><br><p>
