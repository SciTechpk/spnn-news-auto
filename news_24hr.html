However, his comments were not linked to the blast.
Haq was ousted on Monday after he lost a no-confidence motion, with 36 members in the AJK Legislative Assembly voting in favour of it and two against it. He was replaced by PPP’s Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore as the new premier.
On Wednesday, an Indian propaganda account shared a video of Haq from his farewell address in the AJK Legislative Assembly on Monday, wherein he could be heard saying, “I have said it on record … if you don’t stop bleeding Balochistan, we will beat [India] from Lal Qila to Kashmir’s forests.”
The caption of the post read: “Big. Pakistan takes responsibility for Delhi blast … POK Ex PM Anwarul Haq says ‘I earlier said that if you keep bleeding Balochistan, we’ll hit India from Red Fort to the forests of Kashmir and we’ve done it, they’re still unable to count bodies’.”
It racked up 129,000 views.
Indian journalist Aditya Raj Kaul also shared the clip with the caption: “Former Pakistan Occupied Kashmir PM Chaudhary Anwarul Haq admits Pakistan’s role in Delhi Red Fort bombing, says I had warned earlier that we will hit India at Red Fort and our brave men have done it. Haq was PM till two days ago. Says India is unable to count dead bodies.”
His post gathered 641,600 views and 12,000 likes.
Other Indian accounts also picked up and shared the video with a similar claim, as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here.
The claim and clip were also carried by Indian media outlet ‘The Logical Indian’ with the headline “We Hit India from Red Fort to Kashmir’s Forests: Pakistani Leader Chaudhry Anwarul Haq’s Explosive Admission”.
Even mainstream news websites ran the video, including NDTV, DNA India and Financial Express.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and keen public interest in the relations between India and Pakistan.
Reviewing the entire farewell speech delivered by Haq on Nov 17, in which he provided a recap of his time as the AJK premier, showed that at the 17th-minute mark of his 28-minute-long address, he said: “The status quo that was given to me, I didn’t let it falter in any way.
“[…] I challenged Narendra Modi, I challenged his government, and I paid a price for it. I was the first person who said they are Fitna al-Hindustan and not Fitna al-Khawarij, and this is how these sentences changed. I said it in the Kashmir House that if they [India] do not stop bleeding Balochistan, we would beat them from Lal Qila to the forests of Kashmir,” he said.
Haq added that God kept his word when, only a few days later, the Pakistani Army defeated India. “And we defeated them in a way that they have still not been able to complete the counting of their jets,” Haq said. His jet comment referred to the India-Pakistan conflict in May earlier this year, during which Islamabad claimed to have shot down Indian jets in air-to-air combat with the neighbour.
The Nov 17 video shows that Haq was referring to his comments from an earlier speech. Further investigation showed that he had passed the same remarks during a speech on April 24 in response to what he called “Indian orchestrated violence in Balochistan”.
A keyword search yielded a news report by Dunya News dated April 24, 2025, with the headline “Destabilising Pakistan through violence will have repercussion: AJK premier”.
It quoted Haq as accusing India’s intelligence agency of orchestrating destabilising activities across the globe. “If you shed the blood of Pakistanis in Balochistan, be prepared to pay the price in Delhi,” he said, according to the report.
A video of his statement issued on April 24 was also shared on Instagram by Indian digital media account khabarpromax.
Furthermore, in a post on X, Dawn‘s correspondent in AJK also confirmed that Haq’s comments referred to Pakistan’s counterattacks in India in May. “It shouldn’t be mistaken for the recent Delhi car blast,” he added.
 






The above proves that Haq’s comments were not linked to the recent blast in Delhi; instead, he was recalling his comments from the past when he had said the same lines in response to terrorist acts in Balochistan.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that former AJK premier Anwarul Haq accepted responsibility for the recent Delhi blast is misleading. In the speech in November, Haq referred to his comments made earlier in April 2025, when he had threatened India with consequences for orchestrating attacks in Balochistan.

A statement issued by Kashmir Times editors Prabodh Jamwal and Anuradha Basin said that “coordinated crackdown on the Kashmir Times [is] yet another attempt to silence us”.
According to The Indian Express, the raid was carried out following the registration of a first information report (FIR) alleging the “organisation’s involvement in anti-national activities and attempts to spread disaffection against the country”.
As per “official sources, the FIR mentions alleged activities and communications that are under scrutiny for ‘potential threats to the sovereignty and integrity of India’”, the news agency said.
During the raid, SIA officials went through “documents, digital equipment and other material as part of the investigation,” adding that it began at 6am when the SIA officials called the newspaper’s manager, Sanjeev Kern, from his home to unlock the office.
The Indian Express quoted officials as saying that the SIA “is likely to question Anuradha”.
“The operation is part of the agency’s continuing action against networks suspected of aiding separatist narratives or unlawful propaganda.
“The SIA maintains that no platform — media or otherwise — can be permitted to be used for advancing seditious or anti-national content,” The Indian Express reported.
‘Another attempt to silence us’
In their statement, the editors of Kashmir Times called on the authorities to cease their activities against the news agency and termed the accusations made by the FIR as “baseless”.
They stressed that “criticising the government is not the same as being inimical to the state”.
The statement continued: “In fact, it is the very opposite. A robust, questioning press is essential to a healthy democracy. Our work of holding power to account, investigating corruption, and amplifying marginalised voices strengthens our nation. It does not weaken it.”
The editors claimed that they were being targeted because of their work.
“In an era when critical voices are increasingly scarce, we remain one of the few independent outlets willing to speak truth to power,” the statement said.
They alleged that the accusations against them were an attempt “to intimidate, to delegitimise, and ultimately to silence.”
“We will not be silenced,” the Kashmir Times’ editors said.
 






“We call on the authorities to immediately cease this harassment, withdraw these unfounded allegations, and respect the constitutional guarantees of press freedom,” they said, calling on the media fraternity to stand with them.
“We call on civil society, on citizens who value their right to know, to recognise that this moment is a test of whether journalism can survive in an environment of increasing authoritarianism,” the statement said.
The editors asserted that Kashmir Times — in circulation since 1954 — had always stood as a “pillar of independent journalism”.
“We have chronicled the region’s triumphs and failures with equal rigour. We have given voice to communities that would otherwise go unheard. We have asked difficult questions when others remained silent,” the statement read.
Vowing to continue their operations, the editors stressed that “journalism is not a crime; the state may have the power to raid our offices, but it can not raid our commitment to the truth”.
In 2020, the administration of India-occupied Kashmir sealed the offices of Kashmir Times “without any due process of cancellation and eviction”, its editors recalled.
“Our print edition was suspended in 2021-2022 after relentless targeting, but we continue the operation digitally,” the statement said.
CPJ terms raid ‘deeply troubling’
The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) termed the raid “deeply troubling” and demanded that the police “return any documents or other property seized” and ensure that the members of Kashmir Times are “not threatened with criminal charges for their work”.

“The raid on the Kashmir Times office is deeply troubling and raises concerns about increasing pressure on media outlets in Jammu and Kashmir,” said CPJ Asia-Pacific Programme Coordinator Kunal Majumder in a statement.
“Authorities must clearly explain the legal basis for this action and ensure that any investigation is conducted with transparency and full respect for due process. News outlets should not face punitive action simply for doing their journalistic work.”
 







Bhasin told CPJ in a phone call that she was not aware of any FIR filed against her and that Kashmir Times’ Jammu office has not been operational since 2022 due to financial difficulties.
She said the office contained only old computers and archival material from the publication, which was started by her father Ved Bhasin in 1954.
The media has always been tightly controlled in occupied Kashmir. Under incumbent Prime Minister Narendra Modi, press freedoms in India have steadily shrunk since he was first elected in 2014.
In 2020, India was ranked 142nd in the global press freedom index by media watchdog Reporters Without Borders, below Afghanistan and Zimbabwe.</p><small>2025-11-20 11:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20142838e235916.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956283/decision-on-city-names-for-two-new-psl-franchises-after-dec-15-pcb' target='_blank'><strong>Decision on city names for two new PSL franchises after Dec 15: PCB</strong></a><br><p>Amid rumours of two new city names being decided for the Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchises, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) announced on Thursday that the decision will be made after December 15.
PSL confirmed last week that two new franchise teams would be named from among Hyderabad, Rawalpindi, Faisalabad, Gilgit, Muzaffarabad and Sialkot. The list was finalised after the valuation reports for the two new teams were received by PCB.
“The PCB refutes news circulating in the media regarding the finalisation of the two city names for the new HBL PSL franchises.
 






“The PCB would like to clarify that, as per the process, the successful bidders will have the right to choose a team name from any of the city/team names (…) in the manner set forth in the bid documents,” the board said in a statement today.
“The PCB is pleased to note and welcomes the growing interest in acquisition of team franchise rights for two new teams for future editions of the HBL PSL.”
The board noted that the public advertisement for tendering of the team franchise rights was published on November 15.
“The deadline for submission of Technical Proposals is December 15, 2025 at 11am,” the board said.
PSL, which began in 2016 with five teams, expanded to six franchises with the addition of Multan Sultans in 2018. The inclusion of two more sides would mark its first major restructuring in seven years and push the total number of teams to eight.</p><small>2025-11-20 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634562-report-submitted-to-us-congress-stamps-pakistans-victory-over-india-in-may-pm' target='_blank'><strong>Report submitted to US Congress stamps Pakistan's victory over India in May: PM</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the terrorists belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna-al-Khawarij” were killed in operations conducted over two days, November 18 and 19.
Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)
The ISPR said an intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out in KP’s Mohmand district on the reported presence of terrorists. “During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij’s location and after an intense fire exchange, four khawarij were sent to hell.”
Another IBO was conducted in the Lakki Marwat district. In the ensuing fire exchange, “two khawarij were effectively neutralised by the security forces,” the ISPR said.
It added that during the third encounter in the Tank district, security forces killed one more terrorist.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored kharji found in the area,” ISPR the statement said, adding: “Relentless counter-terrorism campaign under the vision of ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country.”
The ISPR’s latest statement detailing the three operations in KP comes two days after it reported the killing of 38 terrorists in four IBOs conducted over a span of three days.
Of these operations, one was conducted in the Kulachi area of Dera Ismail Khan district, during which ten terrorists, including kharji ringleader Alam Mehsud, were killed.
Another operation was carried out Datta Khel in the North Waziristan district, where troops killed five more terrorists.
The remaining two IBOs took place between in Bajaur and Bannu districts, during which 11 and 12 terrorists were killed, respectively.
Last week, the ISPR said at least 24 terrorists were killed by security forces in three separate engagements in KP and Balochistan.
Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in terror activities, particularly in KP and Balochistan. The spike in incidents follow the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Last month, Islamabad-based think tank Centre for Research and Security Studies said that violence had surged in the country over the past three months due to a spike in militant attacks and intensified counter-terrorism operations.</p><small>2025-11-20 11:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/201453379a66b31.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956282/ecp-takes-notice-of-kp-cm-afridis-irresponsible-remarks-on-upcoming-haripur-by-election' target='_blank'><strong>ECP takes notice of KP CM Afridi’s ‘irresponsible’ remarks on upcoming Haripur by-election</strong></a><br><p>The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday took notice of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi’s “irresponsible” comments regarding the upcoming by-election for NA-18 in Haripur.
Addressing a public gathering in Abbottabad’s Havelian yesterday, Afridi had issued a stern warning to those attempting to manipulate or change the result of the by-election scheduled for November 23 (Sunday).
In a press release, the ECP said it had taken notice of the KP CM’s remarks, wherein he “threatened the district administration, police and staff deployed for the election, and incited the public present at the rally and the people in general”.
“Not only has the provincial chief executive’s irresponsible behaviour made holding a peaceful by-election in NA-18 Haripur difficult, it has also put the lives of the district administration, police, staff posted on election duties, and the voters in danger.”
 






The electoral watchdog has issued notices to CM Afridi and Shehrnaz Omar Ayub — PTI leader Omar Ayub’s wife — for violating the Elections Act 2017 and the Code of Conduct, summoning them tomorrow, the statement said.
Shehrnaz is contesting for the NA-18 seat left vacant after her husband lost it due to his disqualification in August, following his convictions in cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
The ECP noted that it had directed the provincial election commissioner to urgently meet with KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah and the police chief to “make the necessary precautionary arrangements”, and then submit a report to the ECP.
Afridi’s speech was “in direct contravention” of Section 170 of the Elections Act 2017 and Clauses 10 and 18 of the Code of Conduct issued by the ECP, the authority’s letter to the chief secretary noted.
The ECP further decided that if any individual or public office holder “attempted to interfere or disrupt the peaceful conduct of elections, strict legal action will be taken against them”. Similar instructions were issued to the Punjab election commissioner, as by-polls are also scheduled there.
The electoral watchdog also wrote a letter to Interior Secretary retired Captain Khurram Agha, seeking the deployment of civil armed forces and the Pakistan Army for “foolproof security arrangements” in the constituency to ensure peaceful polling.
The letter, written by ECP Secretary Omar Hamid Khan, noted that CM Afridi “used offensive language, which amounts to harassing and unduly influencing” election officials and thereby “may prevent them from effective performance of their duties”.
 
 

In his speech yesterday, the KP CM said that the country was on the verge of a major political development and accused “state institutions” of failing to fulfil their responsibilities. He said that justice was being denied and democratic norms were being undermined in the country.
Afridi urged state institutions to fulfil their constitutional responsibilities. He said that powerful forces should read the writing on the wall. The PTI leader predicted a decisive victory for Shehrnaz on November 23, claiming there was no real competition in the upcoming election.
The rally was also addressed by several PTI leaders, including Ayub, Senator Faisal Javed, MNA Junaid Akbar, MPA Iftikhar Khan Jadoon, former MNA Uzma Riaz and Momina Basit.
Shehrnaz to face PML-N’s Babar in Haripur by-poll
PTI-backed Shehrnaz is contesting an election for the first time as a replacement for her husband, who is running her campaign with the help of his cousins despite the fact that he is wanted by the Punjab police after his conviction.
The evolving political landscape of the rural-cum-large constituency, according to observers, is indicative of an interesting contest between Shehrnaz and PMLN’s nominee Babar Nawaz Khan.
Babar, who had earlier served as MNA during 2015-2018, has succeeded in winning the support of his party leaders, including Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s husband, retired Captain Safdar Awan.
On behalf of his wife’s government, Safdar has announced the construction of a 100-bed hospital and a stadium with Punjab’s funds in Pehdiyan village. He said that PM Shehbaz Sharif, during a meeting with him and Babar, had approved a Daanish School, a women’s university, a bridge on Tarbela lake and a job quota for Haripur.
According to observers, Haripur’s political landscape remains dominated by patronage rather than ideology. Not a single woman in the district’s history could ever make it to the provincial or the National Assembly in a direct election.</p><small>2025-11-20 10:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20134908abeebf6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956269/adb-approves-330m-loan-to-expand-clean-energy-transmission-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>ADB approves $330m loan to expand clean energy transmission in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>The Asian Development Bank (ADB) said on Thursday that it had approved loans totalling $330 million to Pakistan for the country’s Second Power Transmission Strengthening Project.
The ADB press release said the project was one of the government’s “top priority investments to expand the national transmission network and enable the evacuation of low-cost renewable and hydropower to major load centres”.
The bank said a new 500 kilovolt transmission line of approximately 290 kilometres would be constructed under the project, in addition to upgrading “critical grid infrastructure” feeding Islamabad and Faisalabad.
“These investments will address long-standing constraints in Pakistan’s north–south power corridor, enabling the transfer of up to 3,200 megawatts of clean energy from hydropower plants in the north of the country. This will help reduce reliance on imported fuels, improve energy security, and support Pakistan’s transition to a more affordable and sustainable energy mix,” the ADB said.
ADB said that the initiative supported Pakistan’s broader power sector reforms and contributed to state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms “by solidifying institutional, financial, operational, and governance improvements of the National Grid Company of Pakistan Limited (NGC) on its pathway to a modern grid operator”. It added that the NGC would serve as the executing agency for the project.
According to the press release, the ADB financing package comprises a $285m loan from the bank’s ordinary capital resources and a $45m concessional loan.
“This financing will help NGC expand and modernise transmission assets, strengthen institutional capacity, improve financial management, and advance public outreach and gender equity initiatives.”
The press release quoted ADB Country Director for Pakistan Emma Fan as saying: “This project represents ADB’s strong partnership with Pakistan and our shared commitment to accelerate clean energy transition and integration, and to achieve a resilient and sustainable energy sector. By expanding transmission capacity and enabling the delivery of low-cost hydropower, the project aims to improve access to clean energy in the power mix, reduce system costs, and support Pakistan’s long-term and sustainable economic development.”
The press release further stated that the Second Power Transmission Strengthening Project aligned with Pakistan’s National Power Policy (2021), Vision 2025, and Pakistan’s Nationally Determined Contributions (2021), which emphasised energy security, climate resilience, affordable clean power, and sustainable development.
“The new infrastructure will also lower technical losses, enhance grid reliability, and support the financial sustainability of the energy sector,” it said.
The ADB reaffirmed that it “continues to work with Pakistan and development partners to advance reforms, strengthen sector governance, and expand access to greener and more reliable electricity”.</p><small>2025-11-20 10:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634530-ecp-seeks-deployment-of-army-civil-armed-forces-in-na-18-by-polls-citing-kp-cms-threats' target='_blank'><strong>NA-18 by-polls: ECP seeks deployment of army, civil armed forces citing KP CM's 'threats'</strong></a><br><p>

It was over 30 hours of art. With a gripping story, a slick combat system and some of the most beautiful environments in gaming, it is one of the best games ever made.
When its sequel, Ghost of Yotei, was announced, it had very big shoes to fill. It not only had to match the last game in quality, but also offer something fresh to both new and returning players.

Yotei brings back what made the series’ first entry so beloved — highly detailed graphics, colourful and varied environments and a well-designed combat system.
While some could call it a copy or even lazy design, Yotei takes what made the first game great and improves on it. Tsushima had a solid foundation and a well-defined art design, so developer Sucker Punch did not need to make any radical changes.
As the old adage goes, if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
 


First impressions
When I started playing, I immediately encountered a bug with the audio.
At the very start, the protagonist, Atsu, delivers a monologue, but for some reason, it only played music and sound effects; no dialogue.
I found that I had to change my PlayStation 5’s audio settings, but this shattered the immersion at a critical part of the game. Sucker Punch claimed that this bug was fixed in a patch, but I’m still encountering the issue.
Your mileage may vary, but this left me rather annoyed. Thankfully, the rest of the game has been stable.

Despite this glitch, the gist of the story was conveyed well: Atsu’s family was murdered when she was a child by a band of ronin (Japanese for drifter) known as the Yotei Six. Their leader, Lord Saito, left her for dead, but Atsu survived, fought as a mercenary on the Japanese mainland and returned to her home of Ezo to avenge her family after 16 years.
Shame I couldn’t hear any of it.
The game’s prologue ends with Atsu killing one of the Yotei Six, The Snake (so really you’re hunting the Yotei Five). Called onryo by onlookers — a vengeful spirit in Japanese folklore — Atsu mounts her horse and rides into the sunrise, leading to the title drop.
It’s a fairly simple, albeit clichéd and predictable, story about vengeance at the outset. The cinematography, which pays homage to samurai films, makes Atsu’s hunt a truly cinematic one.
 


The sights and sounds of Ezo
After completing the prologue, you are immediately treated to what made the first game a work of art: the environments.
Ezo contains verdant green forests, golden trees and endless fields of colourful flowers under a beaming sun. Each plant appears to be animated, with individual blades of grass and flowers dancing in the wind. The vistas are just as beautiful as Tsushima’s, but improved by the PS5’s graphical power.
The map’s various biomes include sprawling grasslands, frozen tundras and crimson forests. All of them are beautiful and every frame in this game could easily be a painting, be it the serenity of the Yotei Grasslands or the chaos of a burning battlefield.
I’ve explored most of Ezo and have yet to find a truly ugly landscape.
Textures on character models, items and clothes are photorealistic. Weaving in fabric and engravings on weapons and armour are clearly and visibly rendered. Mud, dirt and snow will also accumulate on Atsu’s clothes as she runs.
In terms of sound design, whistling birds and the sounds of running rivers and other wildlife make the world feel alive, while a howling wind, which guides players to their objectives, can be heard through both the TV and the Dualsense controller’s speakers.

Similarly, in combat, there are very well-realised sounds of clashing steel and blades whipping through the air with an epic soundtrack in the background.
My only issue would be that gameplay runs at 60 frames per second and cutscenes at half that. Transitioning between the two is jarring because cutscene animations are visibly slower. This was in Tsushima and I was hoping it would not be here too.
Live and die by bow and blade
The combat system is identical to Tsushima. Normally, leaving such a crucial part of the experience unchanged from a previous entry would be problematic, but Tsushima had such a solid system that no changes were really needed.
Like the first game, combat involves breaking down an enemy’s stamina with slow, heavy attacks before closing in with light attacks to secure the kill. Animations look great and make combat not only fluid but stylish.
Once you get into the rhythm of parrying attacks and learn enemy animations, combat is very satisfying. I found myself openly engaging enemies on purpose because the combat is just that fun and taking down an entire group is an epic spectacle.
There are some differences to keep it fresh. Changing sword stances depending on enemy type returns but in the form of new weapons, like dual katanas, a spear and a kusarigama — a small scythe with a heavily weighted chain fixed to it.
 


Despite being ”new weapons”, conceptually these are the same as the first game’s stances. You are encouraged to use specific weapons on specific enemies, like dual katanas against spears. This entails quickly swapping between weapons to adapt to each enemy, forcing quick thinking and observation by the player.
While you can use any weapon against any enemy, using specific weapons for each enemy type makes defeating them easier. For some players who live by the rule of cool, this might feel restrictive.
However, while the combat is excellent, it’s sometimes unforgiving. Enemies can swarm and strike you faster than you can block or parry. It’s frustrating being interrupted or killed by an enemy with faster animations, greater numbers or because of a mistimed input. This could be a skill issue, though.

Predictable but personal
While Tsushima and Yotei share much, the plot is where the two games differ greatly.
Tsushima followed the samurai Jin Sakai, leading a guerrilla war against the Mongols invading Japan. Jin’s struggle between living by the samurai code and using “dishonourable” stealth tactics to liberate the island was gripping amid the epic backdrop of a major historical event.
Yotei’s story is far narrower in scope. You’re not fighting an army as much as a gang of troublemakers; it’s more grounded and personal.
 


As mentioned earlier, Atsu is out for revenge. Though nothing new, it’s well executed with some solid twists and Atsu’s internal struggle to find a life beyond hunting the Yotei Six.
The Six themselves — Lord Saito, the Oni, the Kitsune, the Snake, the Dragon and the Spider — are one-dimensional villains, but easy to hate through their cruelty and oppression of the locals. Killing each of them puts the player in a truly cinematic duel, which matches the gravity of the battle.
Score: 7/7 — Stop reading this and go buy it.
Ghost of Yotei has done something that is extremely rare for a sequel: improve on and surpass the original. In a market filled with sequels, remakes and reboots, a strong second entry is welcome.
Though slightly unforgiving, the combat system is a lot of fun to engage with and defeating a group of enemies single-handedly never gets old, especially against the backdrop of some of gaming’s most beautiful environments.
Beautiful to play through and satisfying to fight in, Yotei has earned its place in the collection of any gamer with a PS5. I hope it’s released on the PC and even the Xbox so that they, too, can experience this masterpiece. These 40 hours of art.

ATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah withdrew the warrants after Aleema appeared before the court and submitted a compliance report. The court directed her to furnish fresh surety bonds worth Rs1 million each, following which the warrants were cancelled.
The case pertains to a protest staged by the PTI in November last year and the court has issued arrest warrants for Aleema multiple times over her repeated absence. Aleema has denied any wrongdoing, maintaining that the charges are politically motivated.
At a previous hearing, the judge had also directed the relevant authorities to block Aleema’s national identity card (CNIC) and passport, and freeze her bank accounts.
During today’s hearing, Aleema moved an application seeking a reversal of the freeze on her bank accounts, including joint accounts associated with the National University of Modern Languages.
She argued that the freezing orders had caused her undue hardship and were issued without proper legal justification.
In response, Judge Shah issued notices to the prosecution, seeking their response on the application. The court is expected to examine whether the freezing orders were warranted and whether there was a sufficient legal basis to maintain them.
Subsequently, the judge adjourned the hearing until November 26, directing the prosecution to submit its reply before then.
The case
The case pertains to allegations brought under various sections of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA) in connection with protests and unrest linked to last year’s  November 26 protest.
The protest saw more than 10,000 PTI protesters surge into Islamabad, defying a ban on public gatherings and a lockdown to skirmish with 20,000 security forces enlisted to turn them back.
A day of clashes between security forces and protesters in the city’s Red Zone ended in the PTI leadership’s hasty retreat, with the party announcing that it was calling off its planned protest sit-in “for the time being”.
Subsequently, cases were registered against several PTI leaders under various sections of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 7 of the ATA. Two of these cases were registered at the Taxila police station and one each at the Sadiqabad and Naseerabad police stations.
Aleema, along with 10 others, was booked in the case registered at the Sadiqabad police station.</p><small>2025-11-20 08:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/20020522970d800.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1949963/all-that-glitters-the-rise-and-rise-of-gold' target='_blank'><strong>All that glitters: The rise and rise of gold</strong></a><br><p>“People with illegitimate or out-of-the-book funds can simply convert their rupees into gold by buying through the Sarafa bazaar. There is no rocket science to it,” says former Federal Board of Revenue chairman Shabbar Zaidi.
Gold prices have been on a rollercoaster lately. When the US-China trade talks seemed to be going well, the precious metal lost some of its lustre before rising back up again. Though not a new phenomenon, the pace of funds flowing into gold has quickened.
On October 20, international prices hit a record $4,328 per ounce, while in Pakistan, rates climbed to Rs448,649 per tola, according to Forex.pk. With no centralised local benchmark, prices vary across platforms. At the time of writing earlier this month, gold prices had fallen by about Rs24,000 to Rs424,197 per tola in Pakistan, and to $4,082 per ounce internationally.
The gold price in Pakistan today as per Forex.pk is Rs430,504 per tola and $4,067 per ounce internationally.
Silver losses
Where there are gains, there are also losses. Haji Muhammad Iqbal, a Lahore-based trader and jeweller, says most buyers don’t understand the swings. “Seasoned traders know when to hold or buy more. But in Pakistan, many buyers aren’t investors — they’re just following the trend.”
He recalls one customer who wanted to “invest” in a single gram of gold at Rs475,000 per tola. “I told him, what kind of investment is one gram?” he laughs.
Many women, too, have been selling jewellery to buy gold bars, assuming they’re making smarter investments. “But the math doesn’t add up,” says Iqbal. “Jewellery involves making charges and wastage, which are lost when you sell it.”
 
 

With gold unaffordable for many, some investors turn to silver. “Trading in silver is a very harmful business,” Iqbal warns. “People pay a premium of Rs2,000–2,500 per tola, hoping for quick profits. When prices fall, they first lose that premium — then face losses on the metal itself.”
He’s seen one kilo of silver drop from Rs600,000 to Rs450,000 within days. “The fluctuations are too sharp — they wipe out profits overnight.” Unlike gold, where losses can be recovered over time, silver’s volatility can leave investors with nothing.
Turning towards bullion
Historically, the US dollar has been considered the safest asset class, serving as a hedge against fluctuations in other currencies and asset classes. “During the 2008 financial crisis and the pandemic, the dollar went up because people believed everything else would collapse, but the dollar would remain strong,” says Ali Farid Khwaja, CEO of Oxford Frontier Capital and Co-founder and Chairman of KTrade Securities.
Now, however, the narrative has changed. With rising geopolitical tensions, Trump’s tariffs and the ongoing US government shutdown, confidence in the American system is eroding. Central banks and institutional investors are turning to gold as a hedge against the dollar, driving prices higher.
The Financial Times, citing the European Central Bank, reported: “The demand for gold by central banks remained at record highs in 2024, accounting for more than 20 per cent of global demand, in contrast to around one-tenth on average in the 2010s.” Gold appears poised to supplant US Treasuries as the world’s dominant reserve asset, placing bullion once again at the heart of the global monetary system.
When the US Federal Reserve (Fed) cuts interest rates, investors tend to move funds out of money market instruments and into gold. With expectations of Fed rate cuts building — and tensions between the US and China once again flaring up — gold prices continue to trend upwards.
As global prices rise, the average investment Joe follows suit. In essence, what central banks are doing at scale, ordinary Pakistanis are doing instinctively: protecting value by turning to gold. But while the recent surge in gold prices has been turbocharged, its rise has been a long time coming.
“About half a century ago, I sold gold worth Rs240 per tola. In the early 1990s, unofficially, I sold hundreds of thousands of tolas of gold for Rs3,300 per tola in physical form,” recalls All Pakistan Sarafa Gems and Jewellers Association President Qasim Shikarpuri, a veteran of the trade.
The glitter of gold has not tarnished over the last many decades.
Even recently, gold has outperformed all other asset classes. “If Rs100 had been invested on July 1, 2016, by August this year, it would have been worth Rs773, compared to the second-best option, the KSE-100 Index, which would be worth Rs365. A Rs100 investment in US dollars would have yielded Rs340,” says Faysal Funds CEO Nadir Rahman, in the podcast All Things Money.
Domestic macro winds for gold
Pakistan’s macroeconomic environment also favours gold buying. “Under the International Monetary Fund programme, there is increased scrutiny of the real estate sector,” says Khwaja. “A lot of that money from holding properties is now flowing into lockers and vaults in the form of gold.” Imagine vaults from the 1980s Bollywood era filled with gleaming gold bars, poised for a heist by the dashing, debonair lead.
In Karachi alone, 8,000-10,000 tolas are traded every day, estimates Shikarpuri, with money flowing in from many different businesses as well. Those who trade in other businesses, such as rice or apparel, have turned to gold because it is more profitable, especially in the tough macroeconomic conditions with limited opportunities.
“Never in my life have I seen gold increase by $100 every day,” says Shikarpuri, an old hat at the trade during the period when gold seemed to be scaling a new high every other day. As the US Federal Reserve slashes interest rates, gold will rise further, and money will flow from more productive activities towards bullion.
Add to that a cultural affinity for gold, ease of purchase — no identification or documentation required — and its liquidity: one can walk into a jewellery shop, buy gold, keep it at home, and sell it when cash is needed. No wonder there is FOMO when it comes to investment in the shiny metal.
Local trading avenues
Gold in Pakistan is traded through multiple channels. For investors and jewellers, the primary sources remain the Karachi Bullion Exchange and ARY Gold, while everyday buyers typically purchase gold biscuits directly from jewellery shops at slightly higher prices.
“Technically, in Pakistan, jewellery made from new gold should not be sold in shops,” says Khwaja. “Legally, jewellers are only allowed to take gold from consumers, make jewellery out of it, and sell it to you. Clearly, that is not the case in Pakistan, where jewellery as well as bullion is sold.”
Trading and purchases of gold also take place on the Pakistan Mercantile Exchange (PMEX), a regulated platform that allows gold commodity trading and purchases — including millitola, a smaller denomination designed for everyday investors. On October 14, PMEX recorded its highest-ever single-day trade volume of Rs128 billion, of which Rs84.6bn was in gold and Rs24.5 billion in silver — metals that generally move in the same direction.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

However, Khwaja explains that while PMEX is legal, its reach remains limited. The amount of gold it can sell is capped, and demand often exceeds supply. Moreover, because it is regulated and taxed, buying through PMEX is more expensive. “It’s easier and cheaper to buy gold from jewellers, which is what the man on the street in Pakistan knows and understands. People are familiar with physical gold; asking them to buy through PMEX offers no real incentive.”
The informal gold frontier
Spot buying — what Shikarpuri calls the ‘Satta mafia’ — also takes place informally on social media platforms like WhatsApp, though crackdowns by authorities have wiped out nearly 90pc of such activity.
 
 

Gold in Pakistan is among the cheapest in the world, says Shikarpuri. Perhaps, he explains, it’s because it is mined unofficially from Balochistan— from areas like Saindak and Reko Diq — and has been quietly entering the market over the past three years. At the time of the conversation last month, gold was underpriced by Rs10,000–12,000 per tola compared to global rates, and earlier this year it was discounted by as much as Rs19,000.
The demand for gold is an equation of many variables, the dollar not being the least of them. As the US-China ties blow hot and cold, and Trump upends the economic and political order as we know it, the price of gold fluctuates. And along with it, the fortunes of many small gold investors in Pakistan.

In the capacity of the chair of the Security Council ISIL (Daesh) and Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee, Denmark raised these concerns while briefing a UNSC meeting held in New York on Wednesday.
The presence of TTP militants in Afghanistan has long been a point of contention between Islamabad and the Taliban administration. Since the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul in 2021, Pakistan has accused the group of sheltering thousands of TTP fighters, who have escalated attacks on Pakistani security forces, particularly in the Khyber Pakhtun­khwa and Balochistan provinces.
Denmark’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Sandra Jensen Landi told the UNSC meeting that the TTP, “with its approximately 6,000 fighters, is another serious threat emanating from the region, receiving both logistical and substantial support from the de facto authorities”.
“The TTP has conducted numerous high-profile attacks in Pakistan from Afghan soil, some of which incurred mass casualties,” she added.
Landi also gave an overview of the evolving terrorist threat posed by Daesh, Al-Qaeda and their affiliates, drawing on the latest assessments of the Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team.
“The threat posed by ISIL (Daesh), Al-Qaeda and their affiliates remains dynamic and geographically diverse, with the highest intensity observed in Africa. ISIL, Al-Qaeda and their affiliates continue to step up their propaganda, exploiting social media platforms to glorify violence, recruit youth and raise funds. Their continued use of cryptocurrencies poses a growing challenge to sanctions implementation,” she said.
Landi further stated that after losses in the Middle East, Daesh had “pivoted towards Africa, where affiliates such as the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) have expanded activities and propaganda”.
“ISIL-Khorasan (ISIL-K) is one of the most serious threats in Central and South Asia, with at least 2,000 fighters under Sanaullah Ghafari. They continue to target Shia communities, de facto Afghan authorities and foreign nationals,” she said.
“Across regions, foreign terrorist fighter movements — particularly between Syria, Africa and Central Asia — remain a persistent concern for member states.”
Landi further said that Al-Qaeda’s central leadership remained weak and largely marginalised, while affiliates — including Jamaat Nasr al Islam wal Muslimin in the Sahel region of Africa — had “exploited local grievances to expand their reach and financing”.
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) also continued to incite attacks and raise funds, she highlighted.
“Overall, ISIL and Al-Qaeda have proven resilient, adaptive and opportunistic, exploiting regional instability, weak governance and emerging technologies to sustain relevance and project influence. These developments underscore the need for continued vigilance and close multilateral cooperation under the 1267 sanctions regime.”
Following Landi’s briefing, Pakistan’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Usman Jadoon was among those who addressed the meeting.
He highlighted that the global terrorism landscape continued to evolve, “adapting itself to a fast-changing world with new and emerging threats under the shadow of rapid technological advancement”.
“At the same time, the prevalence of prolonged unresolved conflicts, external interventions and root causes of terrorism, or euphemistically referred to as the ‘conditions conducive to terrorism’, remain unaddressed, giving continued life to the threat of terrorism.”
He said that as a frontline state in global efforts to counter terrorism, Pakistan had rendered invaluable sacrifices in its efforts to eradicate this menace, with over 80,000 casualties and billions of dollars in economic losses.
Al Qaeda was decimated largely due to Pakistan’s efforts, he said.
“Our valiant security forces and law enforcement agencies continue to counter the terrorism threat emanating from Afghanistan where entities like ISIL-K, TTP and its affiliates, BLA (Baloch Liberation Army) and the Majeed Brigade are thriving under the patronage of their hosts and backed by our principle adversary and net destabiliser in the region.”
Jadoon stressed that the 1267 sanctions regime — the UNSC framework for imposing sactions on Daesh and Al Qaeda — must reflect ground realities. “Its scope should be broadened to list individuals and entities, without any association with religion, nationality or ethnicity.”
He further said that it was necessary to deal with listing and delisting issues in a fair, transparent, judicious and impartial manner, and without political considerations.
“We must also ensure that the 1267 sanctions committee takes an objective view of all listing proposals that are brought before its consideration and not subject them to narrow political interests.”
Moreover, to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism, the UN’s counter-terrorism architecture “must also possess the necessary tools to designate violent, far-right, extreme right-wing, ultra-nationalist, xenophobic and Islamophobic groups around the world”, he said.
Failed Pak-Afghan talks on countering terrorism
Since 2022, Pakistan has seen a spate of attacks by the banned group, and security forces routinely engage in counter-terrorism operations along the north-western border to eliminate the threat.
The spike in incidents followed the TTP ending a ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowing to attack security forces, police, and personnel of law enforcement agencies.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have also come under strain in recent times as the TTP remains the main point of contention between the two countries. Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism.
But the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
But on November 7, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.</p><small>2025-11-20 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634528-27th-amendment-full-court-rejected-proposal-of-en-masse-resignation' target='_blank'><strong>27th Amendment: Full Court 'rejected proposal of en masse resignation'</strong></a><br><p>

The new ban for Indian aircraft has been notified just four days before a previous one is set to expire.
India and Pakistan have closed their airspaces to each other’s airlines since tensions between them escalated in late April in the wake of an attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 people. Islamabad most recently extended the airspace ban in mid-October till November 24.
The latest restriction went into effect from 2:50pm Pakistan time on November 19 (yesterday) to 4:59am on December 24, according to a Notam issued on Wednesday.
The bar will apply to all Indian-registered aircraft as well as any aircraft operated, owned, or leased by Indian airlines or operators, including military flights. The airspace closure applies from ground level up to unlimited altitude.
Pakistan’s airspace is divided into two flight information regions (FIRs) — Karachi and Lahore, according to a Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) document from 2022. The Notam applies to both the Karachi (OPKR) and Lahore (OPLR) FIRs.

On April 24, in response to India’s decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty after the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or Indian-operated airlines.
New Delhi, without evidence, had alleged that Islamabad backed the attack. Pakistan strongly denied any involvement and offered a neutral probe. Then, in early May, the nuclear-armed nations fought their fiercest military conflict in decades. Pakistan says it downed seven Indian jets during the conflict.
Financial toll from Pakistan ban
Amid a financial toll from a ban on Indian carriers flying over Pakistan mounts, Air India is lobbying the Indian government to convince China to let it use a sensitive military airspace zone in Xinjiang to shorten routes.
 
 

For Air India, the country’s only carrier with a major international network, fuel costs have risen by as much as 29 per cent and journey times by up to three hours on some long-haul routes, Reuters reported, citing a document submitted to Indian officials in late October.
The airline, owned by Tata Group and Singapore Airlines, estimated the Pakistan airspace closure’s impact on its profit before tax at $455 million annually — a significant amount given its fiscal 2024-25 loss stood at $439m.
Other Indian airlines, including IndiGo, also face higher fuel costs and longer journey times as they reroute international flights. On the other hand, the PAA also reported a shortfall of Rs4.1 billion in August, just over two months after closing its airspace to Indian-registered aircraft.</p><small>2025-11-20 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2010551066396fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956202/in-fresh-comments-on-pak-india-may-conflict-trump-says-pm-shehbaz-called-to-say-he-saved-millions' target='_blank'><strong>In fresh comments on Pak-India May conflict, Trump says PM Shehbaz called to say he ‘saved millions’</strong></a><br><p>In fresh comments on the military escalation between Pakistan and Indian in May, United States President Donald Trump has said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif phoned him to say that he had “saved millions”, adding that it took the threat of “350 per cent tariffs” to end the conflict.
Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared earlier this year when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was blamed on Islamabad, which denied the accusations. The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump in May, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries.
Addressing the US-Saudi Investment Forum on Wednesday, the US president said, “I’m good at settling disputes, and I’ve always been — I’ve done very well with that over the years.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

“India, Pakistan — they were going to go at it, nuclear weapons. I said that’s okay, you can go at it, but I’m putting a 350pc tariff on each country. No more trade with the United States,” he said.
“No, no you can’t do that,” Trump said, doing an impression.
“I said I am going to do it. Come back to me and I’ll take it down, but I’m not going to have you guys shooting nuclear weapons at each other, killing millions of people and having the nuclear dust floating over Los Angeles. I’m not going to do it,” he said, reiterating that it took the threat of a 350pc tariff to settle the conflict.
“No other president would have done that. Joe Biden doesn’t even know what countries we are talking about. He wouldn’t have any idea,” Trump said as laughter rang out.
The US president said that he settled five out of eight wars he has taken credit for ending by threatening tariffs.
“I tell you what, the prime minister of Pakistan called me … he actually said I saved millions — and he said in front of Susie. He said, ‘President Trump saved millions and millions of lives. He doesn’t even know that, but he saved millions of lives’.”
The person the US president was referring to appeared to be White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles.
Trump also said he had received a call from Indian PM Narendra Modi, recounting the exchange between the two, where the latter said that “we’re not going to go to war”.
“I said, ‘Thank you very much. Let’s make a deal’.”
Trump also recounted his role in ending other conflicts, including brokering a peace plan for Gaza in October, saying, “I’ve settled eight wars. I have one to go.”
However, he expressed disappointment in Russian President Vladimir Putin for his resistance to ending Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.
“I thought that was going to be my easy one, because I have a good relationship with President Putin,” he said. “But I’m a little disappointed in President Putin right now. He knows that.”
The US president also said that the Saudi crown prince wanted him “to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan” and expressed his resolve to turn his attention there, although it had not previously been “on his charts”.
“I just see how important that is to you … and we’re going to start working in Sudan,” he said to applause. “I didn’t think that that was one that was going to be so easy to do, but we’re going to start working.”
The US president has previously stated on several occasions that five to eight planes were shot down during the May conflict between the two neighbouring countries. He had also reiterated his praise for PM Shehbaz and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asum Munir, both of whom he met in Washington in September.
India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.</p><small>2025-11-20 06:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20103030fe5658c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956242/us-clears-93m-sale-of-javelin-anti-tank-system-excalibur-projectiles-to-india' target='_blank'><strong>US clears $93m sale of Javelin anti-tank system, Excalibur projectiles to India</strong></a><br><p>The US State Department has approved the sale of Javelin anti-tank missile system and Excalibur guided artillery munitions worth $93 million to India, the US Defence Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said on Wednesday.
The purchase of US defence equipment is India’s first under Washington’s foreign military sales programme since ties soured in August after US President Donald Trump doubled tariffs on Indian goods to 50 per cent as punishment for New Delhi’s purchases of Russian oil.
It follows a re-order this month of fighter jet engines made by General Electric to power more of India’s home-produced Tejas combat aircraft.
 
 

“This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by helping to strengthen the US-Indian strategic relationship and to improve the security of a major defence partner which continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia regions,” the DSCA said in a statement.
The Indian government had requested to buy up to 216 Excalibur tactical projectiles and 100 units of the Javelin system, the DSCA said. India already uses the Excalibur artillery ammunition in its M-777 Howitzer guns.
The principal contractors for the sales will be RTX Corp for the Excalibur projectiles and its joint venture with Lockheed Martin for the Javelin systems, the DSCA said.</p><small>2025-11-20 05:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634514-pakistan-becomes-dubai-airport-fourth-largest-market-with-32m-passengers' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan becomes Dubai airport fourth-largest market with 3.2m passengers</strong></a><br><p>

ISLAMABAD: The International Monetary Fund (IMF), in its long-awaited Governance and Corruption Diagnostic Assessment (GCDA), has highlighted persistent corruption challenges in Pakistan driven by systemic weaknesses across state institutions and demanded immediate initiation of a 15-point reform agenda to improve transparency, fairness and integrity.
The report, publication of which is a precondition for the IMF executive board’s approval of a $1.2 billion disbursement next month, estimates that Pakistan could boost economic growth by about 5 to 6.5 per cent over five years if it implements a package of governance reforms beginning within the next three to six months.
The GCDA seeks an end to special treatment for a few influential public sector entities in direct government contracts and transparency in the affairs and decision-making of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC). It also recommends tighter limits on the government’s financial powers without greater parliamentary oversight and streamlining of anti-corruption agencies. The government had been delaying the publication of the report since August.
“A unifying theme is the emphasis on increasing transparency and accountability in policy formulation, implementation and monitoring. This involves improving access to information and strengthening the capacity of state and non-state stakeholders to participate effectively in governance and economic decision-making,” the report said, calling for advancing rule-based governance.
It said Pakistan would obtain substantial economic benefits from improving governance, accountability and integrity along the lines recommended in the GCDA.
“Pakistan could generate between a 5pc to 6.5pc increase in GDP by implementing a package of governance reforms over the course of five years” beginning in three to six months, it said. The key areas include improvements in governance and anti-corruption, business regulation and regulation of foreign trade.
 
 

It said both the IMF and the government agreed that confronting and reducing corruption vulnerabilities was necessary for sustainable reform and that anti-corruption efforts are most successful when they combine initiatives to strengthen governance with initiatives to directly confront corruption and enhance integrity.
Indicators showed weak control of corruption over time with negative consequences for public spending effectiveness, revenue collection, and trust in the legal system.
The GCDA revealed systemic governance weaknesses across state functions and noted that the country was exposed to corruption risk generated by weaknesses in budgeting and reporting of fiscal information, and management of public financial and non-financial resources, particularly in capital spending, public procurement and the management and oversight of state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
It also identified an overly complex and opaque tax system administered by tax and customs authorities operating with insufficient capacity, management and oversight.
On top of this was a judicial sector that is organisationally complex, is unable to reliably enforce contracts or protect property rights due to problems with efficiency, antiquated laws, and the integrity of judges and judicial personnel.
Procurement, SIFC
The IMF demanded that all public sector procurements should eliminate preferences for SOEs, including special provisions for direct contracting and mandatory use of e-governance procurement for all state transactions within 12 months.
It called for immediately producing and making public the first annual report of the SIFC, including information on all investments it facilitated, including concessions provided (tax, policy, regulatory and legislative), along with detailed rationale and the outcomes.
It said that given its broad and disparate organisational functions and authority, it was essential for the SIFC to develop explicit protocols for undertaking its activities and enhanced transparency arrangements to enable effective oversight and accountability.
It also questioned the SIFC’s creation in the first place and the immunity its staff enjoyed in decision-making. It said the council was created by amendment in the Board of Investment (BoI) law to accelerate investment and privatisation efforts, but the BoI continued to exist.
 
 

It noted that corruption vulnerabilities also have a significant impact on the fiscal performance of the public sector. While other factors also contribute to public sector performance, Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio is low and falling, mainly due to the complexity of the tax system, frequent changes in rules, and low public trust in the government.
It also noted that the government retained significant discretionary power over how public money was spent, given significant differences between enacted budgets and how public money was actually spent, in an environment with limited public transparency or parliamentary engagement in budgetary matters.
Discretionary allocations are skewed towards districts represented in the government or the senior bureaucracy, reflecting the vulnerability of the system to political influence. This resulted in low return on public investment.

Trump, while repeating his false claim that Mamdani is a “communist,” said on his Truth Social platform that the meeting “will take place at the Oval Office on Friday”.
Mamdani’s spokesperson Dora Pekec confirmed the meeting in a statement.
 






“As is customary for an incoming mayoral administration, the mayor-elect plans to meet with the President in Washington to discuss public safety, economic security and the affordability agenda that over one million New Yorkers voted for just two weeks ago,” Pekec said on Wednesday.
Trump’s meeting with Mamdani marks the coming together of two men raised in the Queens borough of New York, but their similarities may end there.
 
 

While Trump frequently touts the record-breaking gains on Wall Street during his presidency, Mamdani’s view on the economy extends beyond the bullish financial markets in downtown Manhattan to an affordability crisis facing a city of over 8 million people.
As the first mayoral candidate to surpass the one-million-vote mark in New York since 1969, Mamdani campaigned on pledges of affordable housing and childcare, as well as free rides on city buses and city-run grocery stores.
Experts have questioned Mamdani’s ability to deliver on his idealistic and broad-reaching platform.
Virulently anti-immigrant Trump has derided Mamdani’s South Asian name, and threatened to cut federal funding for New York upon the Muslim’s election to run America’s largest city.
“Mandami, whatever the hell his name is,” Trump said recently — deliberately mispronouncing the Uganda-born politician’s surname.
Mamdani has not backed down from Trump, calling out the 79-year-old Republican during his victory rally earlier this month.
“Donald Trump, since I know you’re watching, I have four words for you — turn the volume up!” he said to his cheering supporters.
White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt later confirmed the president had indeed watched Mamdani speak.</p><small>2025-11-20 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20093240c59e53a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956110/karachi-to-become-5th-largest-city-in-world-by-2050-un' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to become 5th largest city in world by 2050: UN</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: The city of Karachi is expected to become one of the 10 largest cities in the world between 2025 and 2030 with a rapid population growth, which is expected to continue through mid-century.
According to the summary results of the ‘World Urbanisation Prospects  2025’, released by the United Nations, Karachi could rise to fifth place with a projected population of almost 33 million in 2050, overtaking Cairo (32 million), Tokyo (31 million), Guangzhou, China (29 million), Manila, Philippines (27 million), and Kolkata, India (24 million).
The report says the number of megacities quadrupled from eight in 1975 to 33 in 2025 — over half in Asia with 19 megacities, and projections indicate that there will be 37 megacities globally by 2050.
 
 

Fast-growing Dhaka is expected to become the world’s largest city by mid-century.
Meanwhile, Tokyo is projected to fall in rank from third in 2025 to seventh in 2050, as its population shrinks to around 31 million.
In 2025, the world’s most densely populated cities have more than 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre. Many of these densely populated cities are also among the world’s most populous, including Karachi with 25,000 people per square kilometre.
The global rural population is expected to peak sometime during the 2040s and then begin to gradually decline.
The two most populous countries, India and China, will also have the largest populations residing in towns between now and 2050.
From 2000 to 2025, the global population living in cities increased by 1.25 billion, but over half of this growth came from only a few countries.
India, China, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United States have collectively contributed over 500 million people to the global city population.
The world has become increasingly urban; more people live in cities today than in towns or rural areas.
In 1950, city living was relatively unusual: just 20 per cent of the world’s 2.5 billion people lived in cities, defined as population centres. Following many decades of urbanisation, cities are now (in 2025) home to 45 per cent of the world’s 8.2 billion people, more than double the proportion in 1950.
Rural communities are less densely populated than cities and towns.
Worldwide, more than 3,000 cities experienced population decline between 2015 and 2025, according to the report.

India last month upgraded its ties with the Taliban by reopening its embassy in Kabul that was shut in 2021, following the withdrawal of US-led Nato forces. New Delhi is also ramping up its aid to the country as it competes with China for influence.
Minister Alhaj Noor­uddin Azizi will hold talks with his Indian counterpart and the foreign minister, as well as with traders and investors, Afgha­nistan’s commerce ministry said in a statement.
“These meetings will focus on expanding economic cooperation, facilitating trade relations, creating joint investment opportunities, and stren­g­thening Afgh­anis­tan’s role in regional transit routes,” it added.
Landlocked Afgh­a­nis­tan is seeking access to grains, medicines and industrial goods following the closure of its border with Pakistan in recent weeks after armed clashes last month between the neighbours over cross-border terrorism.
In the past six months, Afghanistan’s trade through Iran has reached $1.6 billion, higher than the $1.1 billion exchanged with Pakistan, Afgha­ni­stan’s commerce ministry told Reuters.
“Advancing bilateral trade and investment ties are the key focus of the visit,” Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s foreign ministry, wrote on X along with a photograph of Azizi’s arrival in Delhi.

• IHCBA chief claims high court won’t be dislodged from current location, for now
ISLAMABAD: The Federal Cons­titutional Court (FCC), in a full court meeting, unanimously resolved to adopt the Supreme Court Rules 2025, mutatis mutandis, for its practice and procedure until it frames its own rules.
The decisions taken at the full court meeting, which was held on Nov 17 and approved by the FCC chief justice, have also been notified for implementation.
In pursuance of the decisions taken, it has been decided that every case, appeal, petition, or matter would be heard and disposed of by a bench consisting of no fewer than two judges, to be nominated by the FCC CJ.
 
 

Likewise, appeals arising out of judgements passed by a division bench will be heard by a bench comprising no fewer than three FCC judges, to be nominated by its chief justice.
The decisions also indicated that members of the bar enrolled as senior advocates of the Supreme Court, advocates of the SC, and advocates-on-record were entitled to appear before the FCC as senior advocates, advocates, and advocates-on-record, respectively, on a provisional basis until further orders.
The notification will take effect immediately and remain operative until modified or superseded. It has also been dispatched to the attorney general of Pakistan (AGP), the registrar of the SC and other courts, the law ministry, etc.
‘No relocation for now’
Meanwhile, a top office-bearer of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) said on Wednesday that the Islamabad High Court (IHC) would not be relocated from its prestigious Constitution Avenue site for now — temporarily ending a period of uncertainty that has gripped the capital’s legal community.
Syed Wajid Ali Gillani, president of the association, made the announcement after meeting Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar.
“The law minister assured us that the IHC would stay at the Constitution Avenue at least for the time being,” Gillani told Dawn, a statement he said was echoed by IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar.
The announcement comes amid a backdrop of significant upheaval, as the newly established FCC begins operations within the IHC building, a move that has triggered internal reshuffling and rumours of dissent among the high court’s judges.
The issue kicked off when the government decided to establish FCC at the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) building. The FSC judges were asked to move into courtrooms on the third floor of the IHC.
When the FSC judges resisted their shifting, the FCC was temporarily set up in the premises of the IHC.
However, sources said that the judges of the FCC wanted permanent premises and for this purpose, the IHC building was also among the options under consideration.
FCC CJ meets law minister, AGP
The situation reached a critical point on Tuesday night, leading to a series of high-level meetings.
FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan met the law minister and Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan in his chamber on Wed­nesday to discuss the issue.
This was preceded by a late-night meeting between the FCC CJ and IHC CJ Dogar to sort out the functioning of both courts sharing the same premises.
The tension was visibly on display during the recent oath-taking ceremonies for FCC judges.
While Justice K. K. Agha took his oath on Saturday in a “congested conference room”, his ceremony, and one held the day prior, were notably boycotted by a group of IHC judges.
Justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Babar Sattar, Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri, Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan, and Saman Rafat Imtiaz were absent from both events, a move that has drawn intense speculation within the legal circles.
Their collective absence fuelled widespread rumors throughout Saturday that several IHC judges were preparing to resign.
Although the staff of Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan denied rumors of his resignation after they circulated on social media, insiders suggest that the speculation may not be entirely unfounded.
Some sources indicate that a couple of resignations from the IHC are expected by the end of next month.
To accommodate the new apex court, the IHC administration has allocated seven courtrooms to the FCC.
This has necessitated a major reshuffle, including vacating the offices of the AGP and the advocate general of Islamabad.

But amid judges’ grumbling, a proposal to resign en masse to protest the amendment was met with mere silence.
The Nov 14 full court meeting, chaired by Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi, coincided with the elevation of four top court judges to the Federal Constitutional Court, and was convened a day after the resignation of two judges — Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Athar Minallah.
Prior to this, the CJP had also received letters from the two aforementioned judges, as well as Justice Salahuddin Panwhar, requesting a full court meeting for deliberation on the 27th Amendment to discharge their solemn duty to the Constitution.

Fly-on-the-wall account of judges’ conclave on judiciary’s response to 27th Amendment reveals misgivings over parliamentary powers

A source privy to proceedings said that the meeting was held in a tense atmosphere in the CJP’s chambers, as superior judges described the development as “a very sad day”.
The mood at the meeting became even more sombre when one of the judges questioned whether the Supreme Court was vested with any constitutional authority to restrain parliament from passing laws or constitutional amendments.
 
 

As judges debated the ramifications of the amendment, the CJP observed that instead of writing letters to him, the judges should have reached out to him directly, since his doors were always open, a source privy to the meeting revealed.
The full court meeting was attended by at least 13 judges: Justice Munib Akhtar and Justice Ayesha A. Malik did not attend the meeting, whereas Justice Musarrat Hilali was indisposed.
Four other judges, namely Amin­uddin Khan, Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq and Ali Baqar Najafi, had already been nominated as FCC judges.
‘Strong institutional response’
In the meeting, the judges noted with regret the resignation of their two colleagues and emphasised that the judiciary must come up with a strong institutional response.
When a few judges suggested sending a formal letter to the government, the CJP reminded them that judges should have approached him directly instead of writing letters.
As per the source, the CJP further said that the Supreme Court retained the power of judicial review to assess the constitutionality of legislation, but only after the passage of the law, not before it. Thus the court cannot stop parliament from making laws.
Upon insistence for a strong institutional response, one of the participants floated the idea that all of them, including the CJP, should tender their resignations if they wished to register a meaningful institutional protest beyond constitutional mechanisms, the source claimed.
The proposal, however, was met with silence, indicating a lack of agreement on part of the members attending the meeting. Subsequently, the meeting ended without a consensus.

Arshad was in a league of his own headed into the seven-man event; his personal best of 92.97m — which won him gold and the games record at the Paris 2024 Olympics, was head and shoulders above the rest of the field.
Predictably, he had the lead from the start and was the only competitor to throw more than 80m — prompting hearty Arabic praise from the commentators — though he looked disappointed after most of his throws.
The 28-year-old took home gold with a modest 83.05m throw on his second attempt, well below his 88.55m throw at the previous edition that won gold broke the games record.

Meanwhile, Yasir shifted gears in the sixth and final throw to win silver in 76.04m after overtaking Nigeria’s Samuel Adams Kure, who bronze in 76.01m.
The duo’s medals took Pakistan’s tally at the games to four; boxers Fatima Zahra and Qudrat Ullah both won bronze medals in their respective categories.
A sparse audience at the Prince Faisal Bin Stadium was seen clustered behind the javelin throwing sector, waving Pakistani flags and holding up their mobile phones to get a picture of the javelin superstars in action.
Arshad opened his campaign with a low 75.44m first throw before breaching the 80m mark on his second and third throws. However, by his fourth throw he had come back to 77.06m and had a no throw on his fifth attempt.
Javelin in hand, he turned to the crowd before his sixth and final throw and orchestrated the audience with rhythmic claps above his head.
The 77.98m final throw was inconsequential to his standings; he bent to the floor in prostration as he secured his gold medal before shaking hands with the other throwers zipping up their tracksuit jackets in the cool 20 degree weather that the capital offered them.
Eager fans thronged the six foot two inch star athlete to take selfies with him as he made his way to coach Salman Butt in the stands.

Yasir’s desire for an 80m plus throw will have to wait till next year; the 27-year-old registered modest throws of 70.32m, 74.43m, 72.82m, 73.78m and 71.79m to seal a bronze medal right from the first throw.
However, he snatched a comfortable silver from Nigeria’s Kure with a final throw of 76.04m to give Pakistan a one-two finish in the event.
Other competitors of the night included Guyana’s Leslain Alvino Baird, Sarvar Ismoilov of Uzbekistan, Abdulrahman Alazemi of Jordan, and Ali Al Abdulghani of the host nation, who finished seventh.
Speaking after the event, Arshad said it was the nation’s prayers that won him tonight’s gold medal.
“I’m quite happy because I won this accolade right after my injury. My focus now is on preparing for competitions in 2026, because prior to this I was consumed with my injury, surgery and recovery.
“I thank God for letting me get back to this level of fitness, and I congratulate the nation on this win.”
Yasir was not too far off from his personal and season’s best throw of 77.43m that won him a bronze medal at the Asian Throwing Championships in South Korea this August.
The duo last competed together in May at the Asian Athletic Championships in Gumi, South Korea, where Arshad won gold in 86.40m while Yasir finished eighth with a 75.39m throw.
This was Arshad’s third international outing of the year. His run at the Tokyo World Athletics Championships ended in 10th place owing to calf pain, for which he had surgery over the summer.
The games in Riyadh were an anomaly for most track and field athletes whose season ended in Tokyo. The Diamond League circuit was adjusted this year to end before the world championships.</p><small>2025-11-20 03:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/20080500271a2b7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1956184/pml-n-grouse-with-balochistan-cm-bugti-out-in-the-open' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N grouse with Balochistan CM Bugti ‘out in the open’</strong></a><br><p>QUETTA: The simmering differences between the PML-N and the PPP in Balochistan finally came to the fore, with members of both parties making conflicting claims about the fate of the provincial chief executive.
PML-N Senator Mir Dostain Khan Domki claimed on Wednesday that Mir Sarfraz Bugti would be removed as chief minister in the next few days, and that a new CM would be elected by the PPP — an assertion that was rejected by the party’s top leaders in Balochistan.
“The decision to change [the] chief minister has been taken and consultations among the political partner, the PPP, are underway for the selection of new candidate for this slot,” Senator Domki told an Urdu-language news agency.
Mr Domki claimed that CM Bugti has disappointed the central leadership of the PPP, PM Shehbaz Sharif, the federal government as well as the establishment, as he had failed to live up to their expectations.
He continued that the security forces were rendering sacrifices for restoring peace and order in the province, while the chief minister was involved in corruption and failing to govern effectively.
“According to my knowledge, the government-sharing formula of two and half years between the PPP and the PML-N would be completed in August next year. It was decided to bring a new chief minister from the PPP to complete the two-and-a-half-year term,” he said.
‘Baseless’
However, PPP Balochistan President Sardar Umar Gorgaij and provincial assembly parliamentary leader Mir Sadiq Umrani rejected the claim of the PML-N senator, saying that Mr Bugti enjoyed the complete support of all the coalition partners.
All speculations in this regard are “baseless and desire of a PML-N senator”, they noted in a statement issued on late Wednesday night. 
“The PPP central leadership has made no decision about changing the chief minister in Balochistan,” they noted. 
They said PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had already said the party did not believe in changing the chief ministers of the party.
“All coalition partners are with [CM] Sarfraz Bugti and they have no intention to change the PPP’s chief minister.” They said if Senator Domki had some reservations or complaints, he should take them up with CM Bugti.
“I reject all such claims and rumours,” Mr Gorgaij said.

• Omar Ayub’s seat among 13 up for grabs on November 23
ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Secretariat maintains that the disqualification of Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub is a sub-judice matter, even as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has announced by-elections in 13 constituencies, including Mr Ayub’s, on Nov 23.
The NA stance came in response to PTI leader Amir Dogar’s request, drawing the NA speaker’s attention to rules 39 and  9-B of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the NA, 2007,  which outline the procedure for the submission of names and the declaration of the opposition leader.
As stipulated under Rule 39(2), the speaker announces the date, time, and place for members of the National Assembly to submit their duly signed proposals for the appointment of opposition leader.
According to a response released by the NA Secretariat on Wednesday, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq has already made it clear that in line with parliamentary practice, such announcements were made on the floor of the house, allowing all members an equal opportunity to propose a candidate for the position.
He stated as he had not yet made any announcement regarding the schedule for submitting proposals for the opposition leader, no request or proposal could be entertained at this stage.
“The secretariat will proceed only once the requisite announcement is made by the speaker in accordance with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business 2007,” the speaker said.
Also, the NA secretariat referenced the Oct 29 order of the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench on the pleas (Omer Ayub Khan and others vs. FOP & Syed Shibli Faraz vs. FOP). Through this order, the SC set aside the earlier decision of the Peshawar High Court that had adjourned writ petitions sine die, and directed the high court to determine the maintainability of those petitions and dispose of them accordingly.
The NA spokesperson confirmed that as highlighted in the response letter, the matter concerning the disqualification of Mr Ayub, former opposition leader, was presently sub judice before the Peshawar High Court.
On the other hand, the ECP has drawn the attention of contesting candidates for by-elections in 13 constituencies of the National and the Punjab assemblies, announcing that no person shall convene, hold or attend any public meeting and no person shall promote or join in any procession within the area of the constituency during a period of 48 hours ending at midnight following the conclusion of the poll.
“Any person who contravenes these provisions of law shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with a fine which may extend to Rs100,000 or with both,” the ECP announcement said.
The constituencies are: NA-18 Haripur, PP-73 Sargodha-III, NA-96 Faisalabad-II, PP-87 Mianwali-III, NA-104 Faisalabad-X, PP-98 Faisalabad, NA-129 Lahore-XIII, PP-115 Faisalabad-XVIII, NA-143 Sahiwal-III 5, PP-116 Faisalabad-XIX, NA-185 D.G. Khan-ll, PP-203 Sahiwal-VI, PP-269 Muzaffargarh-ll.
Accordingly, the election campaign for by-elections in the above constituencies shall come to an end at midnight between Nov 21 and 22. The political parties and the candidates were requested to follow the provisions of law and exercise self-restraint so that the poll is held in an orderly and peaceful manner on Nov 23.
When contacted, political analyst Ahmed Bilal Mehboob, who is also president of Pildat, said if the matter of appointment of the leader of the opposition was sub judice as claimed by the NA speaker, then there was no harm in holding a by-election of any constituency including the one from which former leader of the opposition Omar Ayub had won.
However, he added, if the sub-judice matter was Mr Ayub’s election rather than his appointment as leader of the opposition, then the ECP should not have announced the schedule for the by-election in his constituency.

The pledge came during a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance where lawmakers also learnt of a plan by tax authorities to install artificial intelligence-based cameras across 17 major industrial sectors to combat widespread tax evasion. 
The discussion on dress codes was initiated by Senator Zarqa Suharwardy, who informed the committee that some Islamic banks were forcing female staff to wear abayas. 
“Pakistani women already use decent clothing and should not be forced to wear abayas at Islamic bank counters to give a religious look,” she said. 
The committee, presided over by Senator Saleem Mandviwala, concluded that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) should intervene. A representative of the SBP present at the meeting clarified that official dress code policies currently varied from bank to bank. 
Other committee members voiced strong opinions on the matter. Mr Mandviwalla noted that Islamic banks often charge higher interest rates than conventional banks under the guise of Islamic financing. Senator Farooq Naik called the reported mandate a violation of personal freedom. 
Compelling a female banker to wear an abaya, Mr Naik said, was like “forcing somebody to grow beard against his will”, but he questioned how the central bank could effectively police such internal bank policies. 
Minister of State for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani, stating he was unaware of “such an odd compulsion”, assured the committee he would raise the matter directly with the SBP governor.  
The committee members recommended the SBP issue a regulatory notification requiring banks to enforce a “modest, professional dress” code rather than a specific religious garment. 
In a separate matter, the committee was briefed on a major anti-tax evasion initiative. Chairman Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Rashid Langrial announced the agency would install AI-based video analytical cameras at production facilities in 17 major sectors after uncovering a significant tax theft. 
Mr Langrial told the committee the move was prompted by the discovery of an annual tax theft worth over Rs 30 billion in the tiles and ceramics sector alone. “AI based video analytical cameras were being installed at production units of 17 major sectors to control tax evasion,” he said. 
The chairman recounted facing opposition from a private Chinese firm that offered to increase its tax payments if it could be exempt from the camera vigilance, citing concerns over trade secrets.  
Mr Langrial said he rejected the offer, telling the committee that such a suggestion was a “breach of the parliamentary panel’s privilege”. 
He said the AI-based cameras would be deployed across all targeted sectors, including cement, sugar, tobacco and tiles.  
He reported the initiative was already showing success, with the sugar and cement sectors expected to contribute an additional Rs76 billion and Rs102bn in revenue this year, respectively. 
The committee also addressed a staggering Rs 375 trillion figure for financial irregularities reported by the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP).  
AGP representative Tafakhir Ali explained the sum was a “typographical error” in an executive summary and had been corrected to Rs9tr. He said a fact-finding inquiry into the error was underway.
