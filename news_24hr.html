Pakistan, who won the opening ODI by five wickets, posted a competitive 171-7 in 37 overs in a rain-truncated match but West Indies prevailed by five wickets to draw level in the three-match series.
Pakistan’s part-time duo of Saim Ayub and Salman Agha conceded a combined 66 runs in seven wicketless overs as West Indies cruised home.
“You could say our fifth bowler gave away too many runs but in recent years, Salman Agha and Saim Ayub have both bowled well for us,” Rizwan said after the match.
“Saim didn’t have the best day today, but he performed well in the T20Is. That’s just part of the game.”
Rizwan said they could not read the conditions and several rain delays did not help their cause.
“Honestly, the weather forecast has been completely different from expectations, and it’s hard to read.
“We’re keeping our options open and will finalise the XI after assessing the conditions.”
Pakistan had won the preceding Twenty20 series 2-1.</p><small>2025-08-11 07:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/111207008cf9b3f.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930162/7-dead-6-injured-in-gbs-danyor-as-landslide-hits-workers-restoring-water-supply' target='_blank'><strong>7 dead, 6 injured in GB’s Danyor as landslide hits workers restoring water supply</strong></a><br><p>At least seven people died and six were injured early on Monday when a landslide hit individuals working at a water channel in Gilgit-Baltistan’s (GB) Danyor city, rescue officials said.
The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge and melting glaciers have become more visible in GB, which has been facing heavy rains since late June.
The situation worsened when deadly floods swept across the Babusar area on July 21, causing landslides and damaging infrastructure. So far, 10 deaths have been confirmed across the region, with a dozen tourists missing.
Thirteen workers, mainly young people, were attempting to restore the water supply in the main water channel from Danyor nullah to Danyor town, which had been damaged due to the recent floods, when the landslide hit at 2am today.
“Thirteen workers restoring the water supply were buried under the rubble,” Gilgit’s Rescue 1122 said in a statement.
 
 

Stating the casualties, it said the injured were taken to a hospital. District Emergency Officer (operations) Abdul Basit was present at the site to supervise the restoration, Rescue 1122 added.
Muhammad Akbar, one of the residents who took part in the rescue operations, told Dawn.com that the bodies and injured had been moved to “various hospitals in Gilgit and Danyor”.
On July 22, a flash flood in Danyor nullah inundated residential communities and damaged crops and irrigation channels. The deluge also damaged link roads and suspension bridges, cutting road links to affected areas.
Hussain Akbar Shah, another local, said thousands of Danyor residents were facing a shortage of drinking water and irrigation water as the valley depended on water from the nullah.
A statement by the GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq stated that the total number of workers was 15, out of whom seven were confirmed dead.
An emergency has been declared at hospitals in Gilgit, the spokesperson added. “Our hearts are saddened by this unfortunate accident. Gilgit is in a state of mourning,” Faraq said.
Residents protest against govt ‘inaction’

Funeral prayers were later held for the workers who died in the incident. Residents also protested at Danyor Chowk against the incident, holding the government responsible for it.
Speaking to reporters, area elders led by former GB minister Muhammad Iqbal said the government had failed to res­tore the disrupted water supply despite repeated assurances.
The elders noted that although residents had managed to temporarily restore the pipeline, subsequent flooding destroyed it again, while the government had not started work on it. The protesters demanded that the government take action, or they would launch protests.
GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan expressed his condolences on the incident and announced compensation for the bereaved families.
“The families of those who died in the Danyor nullah [incident] will receive compensation as per the government policy,” CM Gulbar said, directing that the wounded be provided with the best medical treatment.</p><small>2025-08-11 07:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618285-search-underway-for-abducted-ziarat-assistant-commissioner-son' target='_blank'><strong>Search underway to recover abducted Ziarat assistant commissioner, son: Levies</strong></a><br><p>

•  Federal committee, including GB leadership, meets today to discuss resolution
GILGIT: The ongoing sit-in on Karakoram Highway (KKH) has disrupted travel and trade between Pakistan and China via Khunjerab Pass for the 22nd consecutive day on Sunday as deadlock between government and protesters persisted.
The federal committee constituted by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will meet on Monday (today) to make recommendations for resolving the issue. GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmed Mirza, PPP President Amjad Hussain Advocate, former GB chief minister and PML-N President Hafeezur Rehman have also been included in the committee.
Trade and travel between Pakistan and China, as well as business activities at the Sost Dry Port, have remained shut for the past 22 days.
The protest sit-in, called by the Tajir Ittehad Action Committee — backed by trade organisations, government and opposition parties, and religious groups in the region — is being staged at Sost, blocking trade activities between Pakistan and China in support of their demands.
Members of a committee formed by Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan to resolve the matter had met the protest organisers on Friday. They discussed the issues and prepared recommendations to present to the Prime Minister’s committee.
The protesters have given a two-point agenda to the committee. They demanded exemption of GB residents from income tax, sales tax, and other federal taxes on items imported from China through the Khunjerab Pass.  They also demanded Customs clearance of 280 consignments stuck at Sost Dry Port for over a year under a one-time amnesty scheme.
The protesters announced that they would not call off their protest until their demands are implemented.
Addressing the protest, Rehan Shah, PML-N Hunza president, said that the people of GB have long been demanding their constitutional and legal rights. He added that political, religious, and trade organisations — along with both government and opposition members in GB — support these demands.
He stated that GB has been deprived of constitutional and legal rights for the past seven decades.
Zahoor Karim, PPP local president, said the federal government should only collect taxes after giving GB representation in Pakistan’s National Assembly and Senate. He stressed that the “economic murder” of GB residents would not be tolerated.
“The FBR has introduced policies to deprive GB people of their economic resources. Trade between Pakistan and China has been closed for a year, and goods worth billions of rupees are stuck at Sost Port — some damaged by rain and others expired,” he said.
Protesters said that the majority of GB residents depend on cross-border trade between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass.

He was speaking to the media at a local hotel on Sunday after paying his respects to revered Sufi saint Shah Abdul Latif Bhitai on the second day of his three-day urs celebration.
MQM-Pakistan district organiser Zafar Siddiqui, MPAs Nasir Qureshi and Rashid Khan, Sharif Khan and other party leaders accompanied the governor.
“You will see the old MQM performing again and there will be same old discipline that will be seen which is its hallmark,” he said, and added that MQM was weakened and now people were realising this injustice with the party.
“Everyone realises that MQM sends common man, and not waderas, capitalists and jagirdars, to elected houses,” he remarked.
Governor Tessori observed that for the last 17 years, no development had taken place in Hyderabad.
“Only ‘bhai log’ will ensure development because ever since MQM people started using ‘saheb’ with their name, things went awry for the party,” he viewed.
When asked by a questioner what he was alluding to in back-to-back double entendre in his speeches, he said he would not unfold everything, but hastened to add: “Apkay hosh urr jaey gey jo honay ja raha hay”.
‘World’s biggest fireworks’
“We have biggest digital stage in Bagh-i-Mustafa which is being built for last five days,” he said, and added that soon Rahat Fateh Ali Khan would again be here to perform. “Sindh’s iconic singer Abida Parveen is to enthral audience in Pucca Qila at a separate event soon,” he said. He also announced that ‘world’s largest fireworks’ spanning over 90 minutes would be held at Governor House as part of the ongoing celebrations in Karachi.
Governor unhappy with Sindh govt over protocol
Governor Tessori said that Sindh belonged to him and he didn’t talk about a division.
“When I went to Bhit Shah [today] to pay respect to Shah Latif Bhitai, the culture minister didn’t receive me, although he was present there to see off the Balochistan chief minister. But before my arrival, he [the minister] had left,” he said. He said this showed who believed in division.
Hyderabad package
The governor reiterated that Hyderabad was all set to receive Rs10bn development package, of which Rs5bn for the year 2024-25 had been transferred to the Pakistan Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (PIDCL).

“Rule the world” suggests the global hegemony, in which Anglo-American “special relationship” has shaped global institutions, such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and Nato, and promoted liberal norms and upheld a rules-based international order.
Although metaphorical and unofficial, this phrase has outgrown its UK origins to embody a wider European worldview that crystallised during and after the Cold War.
The West’s victory in the Cold War with the collapse of the Soviet Union not only affirmed liberal democracy and capitalism as the dominant political and economic models — famously framed as the “end of history”, but also deeply entrenched within the broader European mindset the belief that the transatlantic alliance between Europe and the US is the cornerstone of Western global supremacy.
 
 

This phrase remains the key to understanding the unique convergence of intellect and might that influenced the Allied victory in World War II, the establishment of the postwar world order and the globalisation of Western universalism after the Cold War. Within European political circles, this convergence has led to a deep conviction that the Europe-US alliance is not merely historically successful but geopolitically essential.

Enduring legacy of ‘America First’ is visible in Washington’s strategic posture: evaluating alliances through cost-benefit lenses, resisting open-ended security commitments and replacing moral leadership with pragmatic bargaining

Over time, this conviction has hardened into what could be termed a doctrine of “transatlantic indispensability”. This belief rests on three pillars: First, European security remains fundamentally tied to US military guarantees; second, the stability of the global rules-based order depends on US leadership and muscle, supported by Europe’s strategic insight and normative legitimacy; and third, transatlantic cooperation is not merely beneficial but structurally irreplaceable.
Based on this geopolitical asymmetry, it is not hard to understand why Europe, despite its economic size and global ambitions, often responds differently in negotiations with the US and with China. Even when President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on European steel and aluminum, threatened European auto exports, and publicly questioned Nato, alongside pushing through a bilateral asymmetric and unbalanced deal, Europe’s core institutions and major powers did not retaliate with full force.
Instead, they chose strategic restraint with only verbal complaints, seeking to preserve the long-standing alliance and avoiding escalation. Europe’s acceptance of unfavorable terms indicates not just economic weakness, but strategic realism.
The US remains the exceptional enforcer of the liberal order and Western hegemony, a role cemented during World War II and the Cold War. This historical legacy continues to shape Europe’s strategic consciousness and dictate its policy choices.
A good example is the defence agreement approved by Denmark in June 2025, which grants the US’ unrestricted access to Danish air bases and stipulates that US military personnel will remain under US legal authority. This means they are, in many cases, exempt from Danish legal jurisdiction — especially regarding actions taken by US troops on Danish territory.
The agreement has sparked debate over possible conflicts with Denmark’s constitutional framework and concerns about the country’s capacity to hold US soldiers accountable for unlawful conduct committed within its borders.
In contrast, Europe has taken a much harder stance in trade negotiations with China, increasingly labeling it a “systemic rival”. The EU has imposed trade barriers, launched anti-subsidy investigations, and pushed for so-called reciprocity in market access and technology transfer. The rise of China is seen as not only challenging the global geopolitical status quo, but also undermining the fundamental assumptions that underpin the notion of transatlantic indispensability.
While Europe may view the transatlantic alliance as essential and rooted in shared interests, the Trump administration, together with a growing segment of US strategic thinking, sees it quite differently. This divergence in worldview poses a real challenge to the continued relevance of the phrase. For some in Washington during the Trump era, Europe is viewed not as a strategic partner but as a burden.
 


It is regarded as a group of wealthy nations benefiting from US security and market access without offering fair contributions in return.
What is rooted in Trump’s “Make America Great Again” agenda is a departure from the post-World War II transatlantic consensus, in which US leadership was seen as a long-term investment in global stability and Western dominance. Instead, Trump’s foreign policy leans toward transactionalism, strategic retrenchment and even admiration for “spheres of influence” defined by great powers, echoing a 19th-century style balance-of-power realism.
Europe’s continued strategic deference is to a US that is no longer the stabilising, multilateral, or predictable power it once was. Under the Trump administration, “America­nness” has been irreversibly transformed.
The enduring legacy of “America First” is visible in Washington’s strategic posture: evaluating alliances through cost-benefit lenses, resisting open-ended security commitments and replacing moral leadership with pragmatic bargaining.
Yet Europe, caught between its deep fear of Russia and economic and technological pressure from China, continues to defer to US leadership without building real strategic autonomy.
This subordination is unlikely to yield security or influence; instead, it risks accelerating Europe’s fragmentation and decline. The vision of a strong, united, and prosperous Europe is fading, being replaced by dependence without leverage in a world driven by power, not principle — a reality actively championed by the US.
Without unity, credible defence capabilities and a coherent foreign policy independent of Washington, Europe will remain reactive. The “America First” doctrine has revealed that this alliance is no longer taken for granted in Washington.
The old logic of the transatlantic alliance is being challenged by internal disillusionment within the West itself. Whether Europe can adapt to a new era of emerging powers and strategic competition or give way to a more fragmented and transactional world order remains one of the most important geopolitical questions of our time.—China Daily/ANN

Both sides had held multiple rounds of talks earlier this year, but the dialogue did not move forward due to a stalemate on PTI’s demands, including the formation of a commission for the May 9 violence.
Speaking on a private TV show, the Senator said in democracies, the opposition uses constitutional and democratic ways, not violent protest. He termed the PTI’s plan to organise a protest on August 14 as the continuation of the May 9 mentality. “The government is not worried about the PTI protest call as the public had already rejected the party and showed no support to the PTI’s protest call on Aug 5,” he added.
He lashed out at incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan for what he called ‘deviating from parliamentary and democratic norms’. He claimed the PTI was following its ‘undemocratic practices’ by boycotting the upcoming by-elections. He said that the PTI was already facing cracks in its ranks due to internal rifts and divisions.
He added all state institutions were functioning normally, saying the PTI was trying to paint a bleak picture of the government affairs.

The Ministry of Maritime Affairs on August 5 approved the ferry service lice­nce to an international ferry operator.
The UK-based company, Sea Keepers International, will operate ferry routes connecting Pakistan with Iran and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
The legal consultant will ensure that the ferry service operates within a robust legal framework, adhering to international maritime laws and best practices while addressing unique challenges of Pakistan’s maritime landscape.
The organisation will work closely with stakeholders to navigate regulatory complexities, promote safety standards, and foster sustainable practices that align with global maritime norms.
The launch of Sea Keepers International represents a historic moment for the country, opening new avenues for trade, tourism, and regional collaboration. RCIMLP will play a pivotal role in shaping the legal foundation of this transformative project, ensuring its long-term success and impact.
“We are honored to partner with Sea Keepers International on this groundbreaking initiative, and shall keep working with same enthusiasm to strengthen Maritime Legal Skeleton of Pakistan and the Middle East and North African region” said Attorney Muslim Bin Aqeel, CEO of RCIMLP.
“Our team is dedicated to providing comprehensive legal support to ensure the success of this pioneering venture, which will not only boost Pakistan’s maritime connectivity but also contribute significantly to the sustainable development of its blue economy,” Mr Aqeel said.

Six years on from the gigantic rally in Houston, Texas and then in Gujarat, India, where US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held hands together before an explosive crowd, the two are now fighting a war of words and tariffs. This is an incredibly destabilising moment for the flourishing and growing US-India relationship, and recovery from here will be difficult, if not impossible, most agree.
And crude oil is central to this feud.
When Western countries, led by the US, began boycotting Russian oil in 2022 in the aftermath of the Russian war on Ukraine, India saw an opportunity. Some 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude once destined for Europe were now available to India at a sweet discount.
India, which bought next to no oil from Russia in 2021, pounced. And ever since, New Delhi has remained one of Moscow’s biggest customers for crude.

New Delhi’s imports of Russian oil have irked President Trump as he pushes Moscow to strike a deal and end the war with Ukraine

Today, India imports nearly 2m bpd of Russian “sour”, heavy crude, representing 35-40 per cent of its total crude imports. This was a God-gifted opportunity to India, reducing its import bill at a time when its demand for petroleum products was continuing to grow rapidly.
Indian refiners made a killing by processing the discounted Russian crude into fuels, which were then exported to the world at full market price. For three years, Ukraine’s allies did not object to this business, and the strategy looked savvy. Now it is in jeopardy, putting at stake India’s burgeoning relationship with the United States under Trump.
As the US President is striving to tighten the screw on the Russian oil exports and push Moscow to strike a deal and bring an end to the war in Ukraine, India was seen on the radar as a villain. This happened at a time when the Indo-US relationship was already passing through tough times. Many issues were afflicting the relationship.
After five rounds of trade talks, India and the US were no closer to a deal. This was enough to irk the US. To put additional pressure on India at the bargaining table, President Trump began openly siding with Pakistan, India’s archrival on the geopolitical stage.
 
 

Pakistan and the United States reached a trade agreement, and while announcing the trade agreement, President Trump also added that a US oil major, to be selected, would help Pakistan unearth its massive (offshore) oil reserves. Trump also teased India by saying that maybe one day, India may buy oil from Pakistan.

Indian refiners made a killing by processing the discounted Russian crude into fuel, which were then exported to the world at full market price

In one of his other social media posts, he also said that India had a “dead economy.” President Trump’s words piqued India. Images in February of Indians deported by the US on military planes, their hands and legs shackled, horrified the country just days before Modi went to see Trump, seeking to stave off high tariffs.
The Indo-US relationship was also seriously tested in late 2023 when the US said it had foiled a plot with Indian links to kill a Sikh separatist leader on US soil. New Delhi has denied any official connection to the plot.
Further, while Trump continued to emphasise that he was instrumental in the ceasefire between India and Pakistan, Modi’s India emphatically continued denying it.
All this was enough to annoy the mercurial US President. The import of Russian oil turned out to be the last nail in the coffin. On August 6, President Donald Trump slapped an extra 25pc tariff on India — because Indians were continuing to buy Russian crude in huge volumes, despite the US-led sanctions. That additional tariff raises the total US tariff on Indian imports to 50pc — among the highest imposed by the US.
The new rate will come into effect on August 27, exactly 21 days from the date of the order.
In retaliation, India appears to be taking a firm position. A response from India’s foreign ministry reiterated that the tariff is “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”. “It is therefore extremely unfortunate that the US should choose to impose additional tariffs on India for actions that several other countries are also taking in their own national interest,” the brief statement read. “India will take all actions necessary to protect its national interests,” it added.
Yet, despite taking a firm public position, Bloomberg reported last week that the Indian government had told state-owned oil refiners to prepare alternatives to Russian crude. A Reuters report also said that two state-owned Indian majors had secured some 22m barrels for delivery in the next couple of months from non-Russian sources.
However, some other sources told Bloomberg that the Indian government is still assessing its position. Two senior Indian officials told The Times on August 2 that there has been no change in policy and that India would continue purchasing oil from Russia.
In the meantime, a Putin-Trump meeting is on the cards — possibly within days, raising expectations for a truce and diplomatic end to the war in Ukraine. What if the two agree on Ukraine, the ongoing war comes to an end, and the sanctions on Russia are lifted? That could mean that the additional 25pc tariff on India would also be gone.
And yes, any such move would take some pressure off Indo-US relations. But to get back to the heyday of Biden or even to the early days of the Trump 2.0 era seems very difficult, if not impossible. The relationship has taken a toll.

Although the details of those agreements remain limited, a closer look at them clearly shows that President Trump has leveraged the threat of his higher tariffs imposed on most countries on April 2 and the US’s economic power to force massive trade concessions and investments from its trading partners.
Broadly, Washington has used threat of steep tariffs to a) coerce its trading partners into pledging investments worth trillions of dollars in the US to finance the revival of its manufacturing industry; b) secure preferential access — in some cases duty-free and in others concessional — for its energy and agricultural exports; c) influence the global supply chains and national industrial policies of its trading partners; and d) isolate nations seen as violating American trade or geopolitical interests. In return for tariff relief and continued access for their goods to the US market.
The statements made by President Trump and the White House are also couched in a language which consistently uses such words as “historic,” “unprecedented,” “landmark”, and “massive, underscoring a clear attempt to frame those deals as a ‘win’ for American workers, farmers and businesses.
These announcements clearly tell a story of unfair and one-sided provisions, strategic coercion, and the imposition of US economic priorities on its partner nations. No attempt has been made in the announcements to conceal the fact that Washington has secured these trade pacts by putting pressure on its trading partners, including both its strategic allies and rivals, obscuring the fact that the rates imposed on April 2 were abnormally high to begin with.

At their core, the trade agreements suggest an ambition to re-anchor the global economic system around Washington’s priorities

The tariff rates may have been reduced from their peak, but they are still punitive. The focus of national versions of the agreement, meanwhile, has been on the reduction of the threat of tariffs that the US had imposed on the countries in April. This is despite the fact that in most cases, tariffs remain well above pre-April levels — even after reduction, and could further disadvantage them besides deepening their existing economic challenges.
The US conditions on “supply chain security” limit how much value-added processing can be done outside the exporting country, effectively punishing economies that rely on global production networks. Vietnam is among the most affected. Over 70 per cent of its exports are produced by foreign-invested firms, including American brands such as Apple, Foxconn, Intel, and Nike — many of which operate with globally distributed supply chains.
The new US rules impose an additional 40pc import tax on goods transshipped by any country, making it more challenging for these firms to export to the US unless a significant portion of the value is added locally. That constraint directly undercuts Vietnam’s industrial parks, which have become hubs for intermediate assembly and export.
A consistent demand across the new trade deals has been greater market access for American agricultural exports. With the US now running its third consecutive agricultural trade deficit — a first in 70 years — Washington is pushing to reverse the trend by shifting the burden on others instead of reforming domestic production.
Japan offers a case in point. Despite agriculture comprising just 1pc of its GDP, the sector holds major political weight. Yet under pressure, Tokyo has agreed to increase US rice imports by 75pc, rising from 346,000 tonnes to over 600,000 tonnes annually within a World Trade Organisation-mandated quota. This increase, while technically within the rules, threatens Japan’s fragile rice economy and may come at the expense of its neighbouring Asian suppliers.
Similar patterns are emerging elsewhere. Vietnam and Indonesia have granted the US zero-tariff access for selected agricultural goods. Other countries — including South Korea, India, Pakistan and the UK — have been pushed to open markets to different American agricultural exports.
Reluctance shown by New Delhi on this condition has resulted in a 50pc tariff on that country, making it the second economy after Brazil to attract the highest US import taxes in the world.
These terms introduce sharp competitive imbalances, exposing local producers to surges of cheaper US goods, often heavily subsidised at home.
Bloomberg reported earlier this year that each time a trade war begins, the US loses ground in the global agricultural market. In 2025, the US has found itself locked in disputes with China, Mexico, and Canada — the top three buyers of American agricultural products.
Together, these countries accounted for more than half of US agricultural exports last year. The escalating trade tensions have further eroded the competitiveness of US farm goods and intensified financial pressure on American farmers.
The deal with the European Union, hailed by President Trump as the “largest trade deal in history”, has sown differences in the bloc. At the heart of the controversy is a commitment by the European Union to invest $600 billion in the US economy and purchase $750bn worth of US energy over three years — a figure that far exceeds both current trade levels and market forecasts. For context, the total value of US oil and LNG exports in 2024 was $180bn. France has been especially critical, with its officials describing Brussels’ position as a “yield” to Washington.
Though specifics remain opaque, Bangladesh has likely agreed to new purchases of US goods — possibly including Boeing aircraft, wheat, soybeans, LNG, and cotton.
Although full details are yet to be disclosed, Pakistan has apparently agreed to broad openness to US goods and services — especially imports like cotton, soybean, and energy — and appears to have addressed at least some American concerns over non-tariff barriers to market access.
 
 

Media reports suggest the US has also been offered 4,100 tariff lines at zero rate, including 2,400 tariff lines available only to China. In a first, Pakistan’s refiner, Cnergyico, has also arranged a test shipment of one million barrels of US crude, expected to arrive in Karachi in October 2025.
At their core, these trade agreements suggest a deeper ambition: to re-anchor the global economic system around US priorities, even if it means constraining the growth of partner nations. Critics argue that this amounts to a form of economic coercion — partner nations must not only accept elevated tariffs but also submit to the US.
The unfair deals signify a new wave of ‘economic colonialism’ led by the US in the garb of trade policy. With the balance of power tilted in its favour, Washington is least interested in even the scales in the foreseeable future.

The most striking example of this is the extraordinary speed with which the special relationship between the US and India has been unravelling. In February, the familiar warmth of what Narendra Modi described as a “mega-partnership” was on display during his visit to the White House. The Indian prime minister was the second world leader President Donald Trump hosted after his return to power. Both effusively praised each other, and Trump talked about his “special bond” with Modi.
Nevertheless, there were signs during the visit of the friction that lay ahead. Amid the hugs and handshakes, Trump criticised India for having some of the highest trade tariffs in the world. Hours before Modi’s visit, Trump announced reciprocal tariffs to match those levied by other countries on US goods. He also said India was “a hard place to do business in”. During the election campaign, he accused India of being “a very big abuser” of trade and made it plain that acting on tariffs would be his top priority.
These signs of impending trouble were either ignored or underestimated by New Delhi. Several rounds of trade negotiations that followed were marked by sharp differences, especially over US access to India’s highly protected agricultural and dairy sector. But the Indian side still expected to reach a deal with its biggest trading partner. Instead, Trump unleashed a barrage of threats and invectives against India, castigating it for its “obnoxious” trade practices. In social media posts on X, he assailed India often in harsh language. Then just ahead of his Aug 1 deadline to conclude trade deals on reciprocal tariffs, he announced imposition of a 25 per cent levy on Indian imports and an unspecified penalty for India’s purchase of Russian oil and arms. He also ruled out further talks until the tariff dispute was resolved.
This left the Modi government reeling in shock from the additional tariffs decision, which it described as unwarranted. Trump also threatened additional penalties on India for being part of BRICS, which he characterises as being anti-America. Trump then dubbed India — along with Russia — as “dead economies”. Claiming India’s oil imports from Russia were “fuelling the Ukraine war” and with trade talks deadlocked, he imposed additional 25pc tariffs as penalty, ratcheting them to 50pc. India is the second-largest importer of oil from Russia, after China. Over a third of India’s crude oil imports come from Russia.

Trump’s coercive tariff actions have left India in a quandary.

Within less than six months, the strategic partnership between the two countries had plunged into a serious crisis that was driving it towards a meltdown. How did things come to this pass? There has been much discussion in the international media and think-tank community with analysts raising the question of whether this is a temporary blip or a fundamental reordering of the relationship. Most of the analysis comes down on the side of the latter, given the structural sources of their differences in a shifting geopolitical environment.
New Delhi seems to have made three major miscalculations and misjudgements which framed its policy and led to mishandling of the situation. One, it failed to see that Trump’s overwhelming priority was trade and not strategic issues, such as India’s role in America’s containment of China, which New Delhi thought would shield it from divergences on tariffs. India’s hubris about its strategic importance for Washington, nurtured over the decades, blindsided Indian officials to the fallout of the tariff discord on the relationship. They also failed to recognise Trump’s use of tariffs as a tool in pursuit of geopolitical interests.
The second miscalculation relates to the India-Pakistan crisis in May and Trump’s repeated declarations he brought that conflict to an end. New Delhi vehemently denied the US played a role, which contradicted both Trump and reality, and was to prove consequential for relations with Washington.
The fact that Trump mentioned his role at least two dozen times was part of his effort to burnish his credentials as a ‘peacemaker’. Modi himself declared “no country had mediated in the ceasefire”.
By repudiating Trump, New Delhi antagonised the US president, injured his ego and hardened his position, when he was already railing against India’s trade policies and Russian links. It was also gratuitous as acknowledging that role would not have cost New Delhi much. It could still have reiterated its traditional opposition to any US mediation on Kashmir. The sudden warmth in US-Pakistan relations also angered New Delhi, making it more obdurate in giving Trump credit for defusing the crisis.
Three, New Delhi failed to read the geopolitical calculations of a man who was upending just about every aspect of American foreign policy, unencumbered by past dynamics. For Trump, India’s value as a ‘counterweight’ to China didn’t seem to count for much, especially as his transactional approach was focused on striking a grand bargain with China and not seeking endless confrontation. As Ed Luce put it in the Financial Times, Trump “is undoing quarter of century of US policy of shoring up India as a counterbalance to China”. On Russia, the Indian government did not foresee that, frustrated by President Vladimir Putin on a Ukraine ceasefire, the mercurial US president would flip and shift his stance, as well as harden his position on countries that traded with it. New Delhi’s old think proved an obstacle in understanding geopolitical changes, much less managing them.
This has left New Delhi in a bind and scrambling for a strategy to deal with Trump, who has little tolerance for India’s avowed ‘strategic autonomy’. It condemned the latest US move as “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable”. So far, the Modi government has responded by expressions of nationalist rhetoric, pushing back against the US by continuing to buy oil from Russia, saying it won’t compromise on farmers’ interests and stepping up engagement with China. India’s dilemma is that if it concedes on tariffs, it loses face at home and hands an advantage to the opposition that sees Trump’s actions as “economic blackmail”. If it doesn’t, it risks lasting damage both to its economy and relations with Washington. The US-India ‘strategic alignment’ faces an uncertain and troubled future, for now.

And while there has been almost universal global condemnation of Israel’s latest moves, it is unlikely that the regime in Tel Aviv will change tack. Words alone will not stop the Zionist state’s bloodstained forays — only action will.
But action has been severely lacking, particularly where the Arab and Muslim states are concerned. For their part, most Western governments have solidly stood by Israel as the latter has murdered Palestinian civilians. As per the latest developments, the Israeli regime intends to create a ‘security perimeter’ in Gaza and bring in “an alternative civil administration that is neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority”. This is a dubious plan, which intends to replace Palestine’s two main representative parties with local Israeli collaborators that consist of armed gangs and looters with no credibility.
Yet it must be asked why, despite Israel’s mass murder and manmade famine in Gaza, Muslim and Arab states have done nothing to stop the bloodshed. At most, they have offered statements of shock and regret. What is worse is that many regional Arab and Muslim states continue to trade with Israel and maintain diplomatic relations.
In fact, one of Israel’s Arab neighbours has recently signed a multibillion-dollar gas deal with the Zionist state. Contrast this with what ordinary citizens in many Western states are doing to express solidarity with the besieged Palestinian people.
Hundreds of thousands of them have marched in London, Sydney and other cities to denounce the Gaza genocide, and demand accountability for Israel’s crimes. While their governments may be complicit in the genocide, large numbers of citizens in Western states are asserting ‘not in our name’. Elsewhere, some states with no cultural, geographical or religious links with occupied Palestine have taken brave steps. They include Bolivia, which has severed ties with Tel Aviv, and South Africa, which has filed a case against Israel at the ICJ. These states realise that they are linked to Palestine by the bonds of humanity, and cannot sit back and simply watch the livestreamed famine and holocaust unfold.
If the world — particularly the Muslim world — is serious about ending the nightmare in Gaza, and ensuring that no more Palestinian men, women and children are butchered by Israel, then solid action is needed. Until Tel Aviv agrees to an unconditional ceasefire, there must be a global arms and trade embargo of Israel. The Arab and Muslim states must lead the way to ensure Israel is unable to arm itself, or fund the genocide in Gaza through trade. Anything short of this will fail to stop the Palestinian holocaust.

Local residents and volunteers of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) told Dawn on Sunday that though displacement of residents from 16 areas of Lowi Mamund, including Tarkhoo, Irab, Gat, Agra, Khurchai, Dawagai, Kalan, Legharai, Kitkot, Gillai, Nakhtar, Zarai, Dambarai, Amanato and Zagai, began on Saturday, hours after talks between local militant commanders and Bajaur Amn Jirga for their return to Afghanistan hit a snag on Friday at their final meeting.
However, according to them, the exodus of people from these areas to different localities, mostly within the district saw a significant surge on Sunday, after members of the Bajaur Aman Jirga directed them to shift to safer areas on Saturday night.
 
 

Roads and pathways connecting 16 areas of restive Mamund tehsil remained congested with vehicles transporting residents and their belongings to safer areas throughout the day, said Sanaullah, a senior volunteer of Alkhidmat Foundation.

Significant rise in exodus seen after Bajaur peace jirga

According to reports, people of a number of areas of Mamund tehsil, including Damadola, Matoo, Inam Khooro Chinagi, left their homes on Sunday and moved to safer areas.
Most of the residents complained that  the government had not provided them transport and accommodation. We expected from the provincial government and district administration to provide free transport to us in this difficult time, but the government had failed to do so,“ they added.
Some fleeing residents also complained of being overcharged by transporters with fares reportedly much higher than usual.
’’A driver demanded Rs20,000 for a trip from Inam Khooro Chinagi to Sheikh Kalley in Khar tehsil, Rs16,000 more than the normal fare,“ said Haidar Khan.
There is no official count of the people displaced from their native areas over the past two days, but NGOs said around 2,000 families have been displaced since Saturday.
Taking to Dawn, they said that around 1,000 families have registered with their relief camps while as many families have shifted to other places without registration.
Sources in the district administration and NGOs  said that most of the displaced people had relocated within the district, with some taking shelter in homes, educational institutions and government buildings.
A district administration official told Dawn on Sunday, that 107 educational institutions, mostly in Khar tehsil, have been designated as shelters for displaced people, offering basic facilities.
Meanwhile, the district administration made arran­gements on Sunday to accommodate displaced persons with basic facilities.
According to a statement, the arrangements were finalised during a meeting of senior officials of the district administration with the representatives of NGOs in Khar.
It said the meeting was presided over by Assistant Commissioner Dr Sadiq Ali.
It further said that necessary directions were issued to participants of the meeting.  The participants were told to make proper arrangements for  the displaced families, adjusting them with their relatives, government facilities, private schools and at the sports stadium.
The meeting requested to the heads of NGOs to strengthen coordination to help maximum number of people in different areas.
The meeting also instructed the officials of the district education department, principals of colleges and private school owners to manage the influx of the families on priority basis.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet has already greenlighted plans for a major operation to seize Gaza City, triggering a wave of domestic and international criticism.
In a joint statement, the foreign ministers of the eight nations said the decision “will only aggravate the humanitarian crisis” and further endanger the lives of the remaining prisoners.
They estimated the operation could lead to an “unacceptably high number of fatalities and the forced displacement of nearly one million Palestinian civilians”, according to a copy of the statement released by Spain’s foreign ministry.
They also warned that the planned offensive and occupation of Gaza City would be “a major obstacle to implementing the two-state solution, the only path towards a comprehensive, just and lasting peace”.
Besides Spain, the statement was signed by the foreign ministers of Norway, Portugal, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta and Slovenia.
Foreign powers, including some of Israel’s allies, have been pushing for a negotiated ceasefire to secure the hostages’ return and help alleviate a humanitarian crisis in the strip.
Despite the backlash and rumours of dissent from Israeli military top brass, Netanyahu has remained defiant over the decision to seize Gaza City.

In an interview to The Wire, Yashwant Shinde alleged the plot was a calculated bid to inflame communal violence and kill thousands, only for the sake of political power.
“This was a conspiracy by some people in the RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal and BJP with extremely vile and perverse mindsets, solely for the sake of power,” Mr Shinde said. “They wanted to set the country on fire so that power would always remain with them.”
“Politically in coma, they exp­loited Ayodhya for 82-84 seats in 1989, their eyes lit up and then Kashmir to repeatedly boost Atal Bihari Vajpayee to prime minister,” he said.

Says Hindu-Muslims riots, attacks in Pakistan, and Kashmir were part of a plan to gain political power

Mr Shinde accused RSS leader Indresh Kumar of spearheading the plan, introducing him around 2000 to a group from Nanded and that group also underwent weapons training from the army, and there were plans to send them to Pakistan to attack civilians.
He claimed this group was training to build time bombs, with inst­ructions to target public gatherings like Muslim weddings and they went and committed these acts.
Mr Shinde recalled a bomb they were preparing accidentally exploded in Nanded in 2006, killing an RSS member. He alleged that those involved in the conspiracy included Rakesh Dhawde and Ravi Dev. Mr Shinde claimed operatives such as Pragya and Purohit were “pawns” who could be sacrificed to protect the real masterminds.
Mr Shinde, who joined the RSS in 1994, claimed he tried to derail the conspiracy from within but could not oppose it openly for fear of being killed.
After the Supreme Court dismis­sed his petition seeking a new investigation, he decided to speak publicly.

“We will wait for India to build a dam, and when they do so, we will destroy it,” he told members of the Pakistani-American community in Tampa, Florida. “The Indus River is not the Indians’ family property. We have no shortage of resources to undo the Indian designs to stop the river.”
Field Marshal Munir, who visited two US cities over the weekend, flew to Brussels, Belgium, on Sunday after completing his second high-profile trip to the United States in less than two months. Like his previous visit, he engaged with both political and military leadership in the host country.
Attends Centcom ceremony
In Tampa, the army chief attended US Central Command (Centcom) change of command ceremony. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), his engagements included the retirement ceremony of General Michael E. Kurilla, Commander of CENTCOM, and the Change of Command in which Admiral Brad Cooper assumed charge.

His visit to US highlights military cooperation, diaspora outreach

The ISPR said FM Munir praised Gen Kurilla’s “exemplary leadership and invaluable contributions in strengthening Pakistan-US military relations” and expressed confidence that Admiral Cooper “would take this partnership forward to address shared security challenges”.
 
 

On the sidelines, FM Munir met US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine and chiefs of defence from other friendly countries, inviting Gen Caine to visit Pakistan and reaffirming Islamabad’s role as a key regional security stakeholder.
Meets Pakistani-Americans
The army chief’s most closely watched appearance came later at a black-tie dinner hosted by Adnan Asad, Pakistan’s honorary consul in Tampa, attended by about 150 guests, including Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh, embassy officials, and prominent members of the diaspora.
The army chief described overseas Pakistanis as “a source of dignity and pride” and “a brain gain, not a brain drain,” crediting them with unwavering commitment to the homeland and quick mobilisation in national emergencies. He urged them to “remain confident in Pakistan’s bright future” and actively attract investment, highlighting untapped potential in mineral resources, energy, and emerging technologies.
He cautioned that social media, while powerful, was often exploited by anti-state actors to spread “manufactured chaos”. With 64pc of Pakistan’s population under 30, he said, the youth’s talent and energy would shape the country’s future.
Addressing the broader regional context, the COAS accused India of projecting itself as a “Vishwa Guru” while its intelligence agency RAW was involved in transnational terrorism — citing incidents in Canada, Qatar, and the arrest of Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav.
He condemned India’s “unprovoked aggression” across the Line of Control. Referring to the recent four-day war, he mocked New Delhi’s reluctance to admit battlefield losses. He thanked former US President Trump for his “strategic leadership” in preventing an India-Pakistan war and other global conflicts. He said held Kashmir was “not India’s internal matter but an unfinished international agenda”, vowing support for UN resolutions.
He told the Tampa audience that his second US visit marked “a new chapter” in bilateral ties, aimed at building a constructive, long-term partnership. He highlighted prospects for major investments from the US, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and China.
His trip came six weeks after his unprecedented lunch with President Trump at the White House — a privilege usually reserved for heads of state or government — which Bloomberg repo­rted may have influenced Indian PM Narendra Modi’s decision to skip a meeting with Trump during that period.

During negotiations of the Pakistani team with the US authorities on reciprocal tariffs, the US side has showed interest to invest in the mines and minerals, including copper, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan revealed in the latest report placed before the National Assembly.
As the US administration had imposed 50pc tariffs on import of copper, iron, steel and aluminum but subsequently refined copper was exempted from the 50pc tariff, “it will be more advantageous to export value-added copper (refined) to the US market”, the minister claimed.
Pakistan was endowed with substantial mineral resources, ranked fifth globally in terms of copper reserves, which had the potential to significantly reduce the country’s trade imbalance with the world, the minister said. He stated copper, a critical component in global technological advancements, especially in renewable energy systems and electric vehicles, was in high demand worldwide. But despite these vast reserves, the country has not fully capitalised on its mineral wealth due to a lack of investment in modern mining infrastructure and processing capabilities.

Geological Survey of Pakistan has been tasked with detailed geological mapping to identify untapped reserves, commerce minister says

At present, Pakistan exports raw copper ores primarily to China, while missing out on lucrative markets like the US, Europe, and the Middle East. “This underutilisation of its copper resources highlights the need for strategic development in the mining sector,” the commerce minister said, adding that Pakistan could enhance production efficiency and product quality by investing in advanced technologies for exploration and extraction, thereby increasing its competitiveness in the international market.
Mr Kamal reported that the government would play a crucial role in facilitating this transformation with the US investment and support. In this regard, the Geological Survey of Pakistan has been tasked with a detailed geological mapping to identify untapped reserves. The government would also be swiftly streamlining regulatory frameworks and addressing infrastructural gaps, such as mine access roads and dedicated power supply to attract private sector involvement and technological innovation.
The commerce minister said market reports suggested that global demand for copper would surge in the coming years, driven by its indispensable role in clean energy technologies. “Pakistan’s strategic development of its copper sector could not only meet domestic economic goals but also contribute to alleviating global shortages,” he said, adding that by focusing on value-added exports, such as refined copper, bars, rods, and alloys, rather than raw ores, Pakistan could capture greater economic benefits from its mineral resources.
 
 

“Through strategic investments and the adoption of modern technologies, Pakistan can unlock the full potential of its mineral resources. This would not only boost its export earnings but also position the country as a responsible and reliable supplier in the international minerals market, contributing to both national development and global sustainability efforts,” he said.
In response to the United States’ announcement of reciprocal tariffs on all countries, the government engaged with the relevant US authorities for reaching an understanding and reversing and changing the decision of reciprocal tariffs on Pakistan’s exports to US market, he said.
“After hectic negotiations with US authorities, the US has agreed to a tariff rate of 19pc, instead of earlier 29pc, on Pakistan’s exports to the US, which is lowest amongst Pakistan’s competitors in the US market” which now had the potential to increase share in the US market especially in textiles. The new tariff rates on Pakistan and other comparative economies will be instrumental in enhancing Pakistani goods penetration in the highly competitive US market.

Officials described the event as the most severe in the area since 2018. “The volume of today’s flood was the highest in the Nullah since 2018,” said Zubair Ahmed Khan, assistant director of the Gilgit-Bal­t­istan Disaster Mana­ge­ment Authority (GBDMA) for Hunza and Nagar.
The flood severed the main road link for much of Hunza’s population, with traffic diverted via the Sas Valley Road from Murtazabad, he said.
 
 

The torrent, fuelled by accelerated glacier melt, ripped through agricultural land, uprooted trees and damaged public and private property.
Houses damaged in Hassanabad
In Hassanabad, residents were left counting the cost. “The flood eroded land near multiple homes and put more than 50 houses near Hassanabad Nullah at risk,” Saleem Bercha, a local resident, told Dawn.
“Several homes have developed cracks. Ten houses were dismantled recently to try to save them from the water,” he added.
This latest destruction follows a similar Glof last month that damaged four homes and swathes of farmland.
Authorities said Sunday’s disaster struck after the Shishper Glacier’s water discharge was blocked for around an hour before bursting through, obliterating protective walls and damaging irrigation and drinking-water channels to Aliabad and nearby villages.
 
 

Elsewhere in GB, flash floods triggered by heavy glacier melt surged through Supultar Nullah in Nagar Khas, blocking the Hoper Valley road and cutting off a popular tourist destination.
The flood damaged irrigation systems, destroyed a bridge and severed the Hisper Valley road in Tokorkot village, where several homes are now under threat.
In Hunza’s Shimshal Valley, rising river levels damaged the only access road and the protective walls safeguarding it.
Across the region, restoration work on irrigation and water supply systems wrecked by recent cloudbursts, flash floods and Glofs remains stalled. Communities are facing acute shortages of drinking and irrigation water.
In Danyor, residents said the destruction of main water channels had left thousands without water.
“Crops and trees have dried up,” a resident said.
Volunteers are now working to repair the damage, as communities here depend almost entirely on glacier-fed water for survival.
Experts warn that unprecedented high temperatures and repeated heatwaves this year have accelerated glacier melt, making Glofs and extreme flooding more frequent.

If they did not receive a raise at the start of the financial year, it is possible that their income may have even been reduced by 25 per cent compared to what they received earlier this year thanks to the removal of a rebate that university teachers and professors used to get. The government had earlier announced that the rebate would be withdrawn because, according to officials, the IMF ‘rejected proposals of the FBR to allow [the] 25 per cent tax rebate to teachers and researchers from July 1, 2025’. Why bother having a government when the IMF runs economic policy?
Good faculty are singularly the most essential requirement for any university in order to be able to deliver quality education. The measures taken by the government, or by their minders at the IMF, will dissuade numerous qualified and competent men and, particularly, women, wanting to join the teaching profession in Pakistan. While the lack of quality faculty is a perennial problem in Pakistan, it is hardly the only one and there are numerous other challenges that undermine higher education.
While many commentators have expressed surprise that there are no Pakistani universities in the top tiers of the QS Ranking list, a global mechanism to assess research and teaching at universities — a methodology which has its own particular problems — what would have been surprising is if there had, indeed, been any Pakistani university in the top 350 of the world. There are around 270 institutions of higher learning that the HEC accounts for. Of these, around 170 are in the public sector, with the rest of them private universities. However, a huge predominance of such universities, if they can even be called that, give degrees rather than education. Pakistan’s so-called universities, for the most part, are degree-awarding institutions rather than centres and institutions of learning, ideas and critical thinking.
Almost all university administrators in Pakistan bemoan the fact that their institutions face serious financial constraints. This is true and there is little doubt that the financial resources made available by the HEC to universities have not increased in real terms in many years. However, given the very poor state of education and what universities deliver and produce, perhaps it is wiser not to waste more money on continuously poor outcomes. An increased budget to universities by the government would not necessarily produce better students; more buildings, certainly, but not quality students.

Perhaps it is wiser not to waste more money on continuously poor outcomes.

The few excellent universities which exist in Pakistan, some of which are in the private sector, are particularly dependent on student fees to be able to run their establishments, rather than on public handouts. As much as 60 to 65pcof their incomes arise from fees, and since they have the ability to raise their fees every year, they can ensure that they run their enterprises in a way which can provide better quality education. This also allows them to pay more to their faculty and attract better teachers.
Constituency-level and populist politics in Pakistan, and the fact that higher education is a very lucrative business, has given rise to the frayed belief that each electoral constituency or town must have its own university, regardless of the fact that there just aren’t enough good university teachers to go around. Who can forget the last day of the previous parliament, the 15th National Assembly, in August 2023, when as many as 25 universities, most of which were private, received approval? Those who teach at universities warned that such collusion between influential and rich ‘education investors’ and parliamentarians would spell greater disaster for higher education in Pakistan. Not surprisingly, such concerns have proven true.
Of the 270 or so universities in Pakistan, even by very generous standards perhaps 50 or so, at best, actually provide decent education, where students are taught to think, to be creative, to learn some professional skills — all in order to be able to find some kind of employment. Graduate unemployment exists not because there aren’t enough jobs but because students have not been sufficiently trained or educated.
A major cause for the continuing poor performance of higher education is also, ironically, the regulator and overseer of higher education in Pakistan, ie, the HEC. The HEC bureaucracy does not have the ability or scale to oversee the 270 universities in Pakistan. Worse still, they treat all universities alike: the 50 or so better institutions are clubbed together with the 100 or so least developed, poorest, ones.
One major intervention needed in the administration of the higher education sector is to distinguish between the different quality of universities. Universities are not alike and different categories need to be regulated differently, some perhaps not at all. If the HEC would leave better-quality universities to their own devices, not interfering in how these universities function, they would do us a great service. Say, a four-tiered ‘league table’, where struggling universities are supported much more, both administratively and financially, in order to raise their standards, would work better. The top 50 or so universities, which have some measure of quality, should be allowed to become more autonomous and efficient without much meddling. A once in five years certification could ensure that they meet well-defined standards.
Another way forward is to ensure that no further universities are constructed in every corner of the country. Instead, the focus should be on consolidating the existing, better ones. Ensuring quality, rather than constructing more substandard buildings with the ‘university’ banner attached to them, could be the way forward.
The so-called ‘demographic dividend’ with Pakis­tan’s youth bulge will, in a decade or two, be a middle-aged burden. Those fortunate enough to make it to university deserve a far better future.

This financing aims to ensure projects are well-prepared for ADB funding and implementation, potentially speeding up the process and disbursement of funds, according to the ADB.
The $8.32 million funding approved last week will contribute to the improvement of the irrigation infrastructure that that will enhance water availability and increase productivity of the agriculture sector in Punjab, and subsequently alleviating rural poverty, and improving food security and economic growth.
Agriculture production in Punjab has benefited from the Indus Basin Irrigation System (IBIS) that provides irrigation water to 15 million hectares of land, of which about 60 per cent lies in Punjab. The IBIS is the lifeline of the Punjab agriculture sector. However, deteriorated century-old structures and inefficient water management within irrigation schemes and on-farm resulted to the unreliable surface irrigation water delivery in the IBIS.

Move to accelerate disbursement of funds for priority projects

A document released by ADB privy to the project says some cultivable lands in Punjab remain outside of the IBIS and rely on unpredictable scarce rainfall or ground water that may lower the water table. Although the Punjab government has placed a high priority on improving irrigation infrastructure and its efficiency, additional efforts are required for improved agriculture productivity and water-use efficiency to achieve economic growth and food security in the province.
In 2019, the provincial government identified five priority projects to develop, rehabilitate and upgrade irrigation infrastructure that will enhance water availability and increase agricultural productivity. The national consulting firms had prepared feasibility studies for these priority projects, but the project designs fell short due to the lack of an integrated approach, lack of an analysis of alternative strategies for optimal use of water, lack of a comprehensive analysis of Punjab’s share of water, lack of project-specific climate change considerations and adaptation measures, and incomplete due diligence and economic evaluation.
The proposed projects were: rehabilitation and upgrade of Upper Jhelum Canal System; Dera Ghazi Khan Canal Irrigated Agriculture Improvement; remodeling of Rasul-Qadirabad, Qadirabad-Balloki, and Balloki-Sulemanki canals; second phase of Greater Thal Canal project; and harnessing of Hill Torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur.
Of the five priority projects, two are for the construction of new irrigation infrastructure and the development of existing irrigation infrastructure; and upgrade of water conveyance canals in the IBIS by remodeling of Rasul-Qadirabad, Qadirabad-Balloki, and Balloki-Sulemanki canals.

The clash occurred when troops advancing from Shawal Marrah area of North Waziristan into the Sirnarai area of Upper South Waziristan were ambushed by militants.  
During the clash, Sepoy Naveed embraced martyrdom and five other soldiers identified as Naik Amjad, Sepoy Abu Bakar, Sepoy Siyam, Sepoy Nasir and Sepoy Shaukat sustained wounds, sources confirmed. In the exchange of fire, security forces killed two terrorists and left three others wounded. 
The military’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, has not yet issued a statement on the incident. 
The slain soldier and the wounded personnel were moved to a military facility in Razmak for treatment. 
Officials said clearance operations are continuing in the area as authorities gather intelligence to identify the assailants and investigate their potential links to a recent surge in militant activity. 
Security in the tribal districts of North Waziristan, Upper South Waziristan, and Lower South Waziristan has deteriorated sharply over the past year.  
Residents have expressed deep concern over a rising wave of violence, with reports of increased bomb blasts, targeted killings, kidnappings for ransom, and attacks on security posts. 
In the Birmal area of Lower South Waziristan, the security situation is particularly alarming and has severely disrupted daily life.  
According to local sources, armed groups have disabled Wi-Fi systems, creating significant communication and coordination challenges for civilians and law enforcement agencies.

The quake was felt across several cities in the west of the country, including Istanbul and the tourist hotspot of Izmir, said officials, who are yet to comment on any potential damages or deaths.
Several buildings collapsed in the Balikesir province after the quake, according to images broadcast by Turkish media.
 






The quake hit at 7:53 pm (9:53pm PKT), with a 4.6-magnitude aftershock following several minutes later, according to AFAD.
The quake was also registered by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), which recorded the quake and the aftershock at a depth of 10 kilometres.

“All AFAD teams and the relevant institutions have immediately begun searches on the ground. No undesirable event has been flagged up till now,” Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X.
 






Turkey is crisscrossed by several geological fault lines, which have previously caused catastrophes in the country.
A quake in February 2023 in the southwest killed at least 53,000 people and devastated Antakya, the site of the ancient city of Antioch.
More recently, a 5.8-magnitude tremor in the same region resulted in one death and injured 69 people at the beginning of July.</p><small>2025-08-10 18:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/102305420f6109a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930012/muneeba-heroics-propel-pakistan-to-consolation-win-over-ireland-in-final-t20i' target='_blank'><strong>Muneeba heroics propel Pakistan to consolation win over Ireland in final T20I</strong></a><br><p>Player of the match Muneeba Ali’s hundred helped propel Pakistan women to a consolation win over Ireland on Sunday in the final Twenty20 International of the series that was won 2-1 by the Irish team.
Coming into this encounter, the Green Shirts were 2-0 down in the series, with Ireland winning the first T20I by 11 runs on Wednesday and four wickets on Friday.
Batting first at Clontarf Cricket Club Ground in Dublin, the Irish side got to a respectable 155-4 before centurion Muneeba and Aliya Riaz combined for an unbeaten 101 run partnership to make easy work of the Irish total — chasing it down with 14 balls to spare.
In the first innings, Irish allrounder Orla Prendergast continued with her good form in the series, scoring 64 runs not out of 46 balls.
 






Wicketkeeper Amy Hunter and Irish captain Gaby Lewis scored 29 and 36, respectively.
Muneeba started the Pakistani chase with three back-to-back boundaries off the bowling of Prendergast, the player of the match of the first encounter and winner of the player of the series award today.
One of the biggest hits of the series was hit by Muneeba over square-leg off Arlene Kelly in the fifth over of the innings.
The southpaw opener kept the momentum going, with the Green Shirts reaching the 50-run mark in just 5.1 overs — bringing up her half-century off just 29 balls.
The left-handed opener brought up her second century of the format with a single that got Pakistan over the line in the 18th over, reaching the milestone in just 68 deliveries.
She was adjudicated player of the match for the match-winning effort with the bat.
The series followed a productive month of preparation for Pakistan, who held a 17-day skills camp and a five-day pre-tour camp at the Hanif Mohammad High Performance Centre in Karachi before arriving in Dublin on August 3.
Ireland, meanwhile, entered the series high on confidence after a dominant showing against Zimbabwe women last month, where they swept both the T20I and ODI series at home.
Before participating in the 50-over ICC Women’s World Cup in September, Pakistan will play one series consisting of three matches against South Africa in Lahore from Sept 16 to 22.
The World Cup is scheduled to be held in India from Sept 30 to Nov 2, but Pakistan will play their matches of the global event in Sri Lanka under the hybrid model, according to which neither India nor Pakistan will visit each other’s venues due to political strains between the nuclear-armed neighbours.
Pakistan’s highly anticipated clash with arch-rivals India is scheduled for October 5, followed by encounters against defending champions Australia on October 8 and 2017 champions England on October 15.
The national side will then face New Zealand (October 18), South Africa (October 21), and co-hosts Sri Lanka (October 24) to conclude their round-robin stage.</p><small>2025-08-10 18:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/102106125ff3a77.png' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930003/rana-sanaullah-urges-pti-not-to-launch-protest-drive-on-independence-day' target='_blank'><strong>Rana Sanaullah urges PTI not to launch protest drive on Independence Day</strong></a><br><p>Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Sunday urged the PTI to stage their upcoming nationwide protest movement on any day other than August 14, as it is Independence Day and should be celebrated with the nation united as one.
On August 6, a message was posted on PTI founder and former premier Imran Khan’s X account, calling for the PTI to “take to the streets in full force against the ongoing fascism in our beloved homeland”. That message came in the wake of the PTI’s failed protests on August 5.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan with Shahzad Iqbal’, Sanaullah said that he had no issue with the protest going ahead but raised concerns about the timing.
“Protesting is their right, but to do it on August 14 would be upsetting and against our traditions,” he stated.
“On August 14, the nation will celebrate [Independence Day] with zeal, but the opposition has planned something on that day. They should not have their movement or protest on August 14; do it on the 15th, 16th, or 13th.”
The PM’s adviser lauded the opposition parties for “standing united” and “having coordination”, but raised an issue with them launching protests on national holidays.
“August 5 was the Day of Exploitation,” Sanaullah said, referring to the day observed by Pakistan to mark the Indian government’s move to strip occupied Kashmir of its autonomy.
“The nation was standing with their Kashmiri brethren and paying tribute to Kashmiri martyrs that day. They (the PTI) announced a big movement, and nothing ended up happening,” he said.
 


On August 5, police detained PTI protesters across the country after party activists took to the streets to officially kick off a nationwide movement for the release of Imran, who has been in jail for two years now.
Lahore Deputy Inspector General (operations) Faisal Kamran told Dawn.com: “More than 30 PTI activists trying to block roads in different areas of the city were taken into custody.” He denied reports of the police arresting hundreds of activists.
Meanwhile, PTI Balochistan President Dawood Shah Kakar claimed “several” PTI workers, including five leaders, were arrested after they gathered at a place in Balochistan’s Kohlu district for a protest.
The Rawalpindi administration banned all assemblies and gatherings until August 10 under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, citing an “imminent threat”.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Tehreek Tahafuz Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) chief Mahmood Achkazai, MNA Shandana Gulzar and others departed for Adiala Jail, where Imran is imprisoned but they were stopped by the Punjab police, with the TTAP sharing a video of Achakzai’s exchange with the personnel.
 






PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser announced that the second phase of the PTI’s efforts would take place on August 14, after which the party planned to head to Sindh. “We will unite the entire country to rid ourselves of this oppressive government,” he added.</p><small>2025-08-10 17:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/102213011368711.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930008/one-child-drowns-in-kps-swat-river-two-others-missing-officials' target='_blank'><strong>One child drowns in KP’s Swat River, two others missing: officials</strong></a><br><p>A child drowned on Sunday while her two siblings were missing in the Swat River in the Butkhela area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district, according to officials.
Malakand Assistant Commissioner Waheedullah Khan told Dawn.com that three siblings were bathing in the river when the incident occurred.
“A 12-year-old girl’s body was recovered from the river, while the search for her two brothers is continuing,” Waheedullah said.
Meanwhile, Nasir Khan, district emergency officer for the Rescue 1122 Malakand, said in a statement that the incident occurred near the Japan bridge in Butkhela, over the river.
“The three siblings drowned in the river and their ages were between 10 to 13,” Nasir was quoted as saying. “The search for the remaining two bodies will continue and civil defence teams are also taking part.
The Rescue 1122 official identified the recovered girl as 12-year-old Azra and her missing brothers as 10-year-old Bilal and 13-year-old Muhammad Sadiq.
“The search operation in the river has now paused and will resume early tomorrow morning,” Nasir added.
On July 31, a girl was rescued by locals while two were still missing after falling into the Indus River in KP’s Shangla district, according to the police.</p><small>2025-08-10 17:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618194-overseas-pakistanis-not-brain-drain-case-but-rather-brain-gain-coas' target='_blank'><strong>Overseas Pakistanis not 'brain drain' case but rather 'brain gain', says COAS Munir</strong></a><br><p>

With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure.
Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told Dawn.com: “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train. Fortunately, there was no loss of life.”
The incident occurred near the Spezand station in Mastung’s Dasht tehsil, when the train was heading from Quetta to Peshawar City station with 350 passengers on board.
“Security forces and rescue teams rushed to the site as soon as they were alerted about the incident, and began a search operation after cordoning off the area,” Kashif said.
 
 

“Four bogies of the Jaffar Express had been placed back on the track, while efforts were underway to restore the other two,” the official noted.
A relief train of the Pakistan Railways brought the 350 passengers back to Quetta, while bogies stuck on the track will be returned to the city as well, according to a later statement from Kashif, who said that all tickets will be refunded.
In a separate statement, Kashif said the services of the Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail were suspended till August 14.
The Bolan Mail will resume its operations on August 16 (Saturday), when it will depart from Karachi “in its proper turn” and will arrive in Quetta the next day, he added.
Today’s incident comes just three days after Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped a disaster in Balochistan’s Sibi, where a bomb planted near the track exploded just after the passenger train passed.
 
 

In another near-miss incident on July 24, a powerful explosion ripped through the Quetta-Sibi rail section, damaging a bogie of the Bolan Mail.
A July 28 derailment of the Jaffar Express train in Sindh’s Sukkur was initially attributed to an explosion — even by government-run media — but the Ministry of Railways later said a technical fault was the cause.
In June, a powerful explosion of a remotely controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks caused four bogies of the Jaffer Express to derail in Jacobabad. No one was hurt in the incident.
In April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was stopped at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.
Train services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were restored on March 27, after they were suspended due to the unprecedented hijacking of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.
The train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.</p><small>2025-08-10 13:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618159-iran-launches-direct-flights-from-quetta' target='_blank'><strong>Iran launches direct flights from Quetta</strong></a><br><p>
