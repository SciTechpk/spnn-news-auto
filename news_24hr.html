Footage circulating online showed the “360 Degrees” ride breaking in half, with the circular carousel crashing down from a height of several metres.
The Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV channel reported 23 injured, four of them seriously, in the accident on Wednesday.
The amusement park in Taif, southwest Saudi Arabia, has been closed and an investigation is underway, Al Arabiya added.
Saudi Arabia has been building multiple leisure and entertainment attractions as the long-cloistered desert country seeks to diversify its oil-reliant economy.
Among its so-called giga-projects is Qiddiya near Riyadh, billed as an “entertainment city” of theme parks and a motorsports racetrack.</p><small>2025-07-31 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/3114475449f73b5.jpg?r=145013' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802/may-9-riots-faisalabad-atc-sentences-omar-ayub-shibli-faraz-and-other-pti-leaders-to-10-years-in-jail' target='_blank'><strong>May 9 riots: Faisalabad ATC sentences Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz and other PTI leaders to 10 years in jail</strong></a><br><p>An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Faisalabad on Thursday sentenced PTI leaders, including Omar Ayub Khan, Shibli Faraz, Hamid Raza, and Zartaj Gul, to 10 years of imprisonment for their involvement in the May 9 riots.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
Out of 185 PTI workers accused, 108 have been sentenced by the court today.  PTI’s Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA), Junaid Afzal Sahi, was sentenced to three years in prison. Meanwhile, MPA Khayal Ahmad Kastro, Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Zain Qureshi, and former PTI leader Fawad Chaudhry have been acquitted in the cases.
Reacting to the development, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the party will challenge the decision in the high courts.
Speaking to the media in Islamabad today, Gohar said: “We will raise the issue with PTI Founder Imran Khan on the future course of action regarding whether we should return to the parliament or launch a movement.”
He said that the “political cases against PTI members were baseless”, adding that the PTI believed in running the system instead of believing in extremism.
“We do not believe in violence or incitement in politics. Those who have been convicted today do not believe in politics of violence.”
According to a copy of the court order — available with Dawn.com — “the prosecution has successfully proved its case without any shadow of doubt” against 17 of the accused, including the opposition leaders and Zartaj. They were sentenced to:


10 years rigorous imprisonment, Rs1 million fine under Section 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) read with Section 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC)

Meanwhile, 77 accused were acquitted because the prosecution “miserably failed to prove the alleged offence”.
In a post on X, the PTI condemned the sentences in the strongest terms and branded the cases “false, fabricated, and politically motivated”, adding that the opposition leaders in both houses were sentenced to prevent the party’s mass mobilisation on August 5.
“Through this decision, six of our National Assembly members, three Punjab Assembly members and one senator have been sentenced,” the party stated. “This decision is not only a clear violation of the Constitution and the law but also another dark stain on the face of justice.
“The judiciary’s continuous transformation into a rubber stamp at the behest of the state system, issuing such grave verdicts one after another under political pressure without transparent trials, evidence, cross-examination of witnesses, or the right to defence, is a dangerous trend that is completely undermining the credibility of the judicial system,” the statement added.
The PTI added that this is the “first time” opposition leaders in both houses of parliament have been sentenced “solely based on their loyalty to Imran Khan’s political narrative, public representation, and constitutional struggle”.
“The real purpose of these decisions is not to deliver legal justice but to make a concerted effort to prevent the public protest scheduled for August 5, which was announced by Imran Khan himself,” the party claimed.
 






“Today’s sentences and the warrants issued against several other leaders this morning are all links in the chain of fear that the state system harbours toward Imran Khan’s peaceful public movement.”
Moreover, the party branded the sentences “part of a systematic plan aimed at suppressing the public awakening and political consciousness emerging under Imran Khan’s leadership”.
However, the PTI wrote that these sentences only ignited their resolve, ahead of the protests slated for August 5.
“Imran Khan’s vision lives in our hearts, and our loyalty to it remains unwavering.
Our leaders and workers are ready for every sacrifice, because we believe that only those nations survive the darkness of oppression that resist,” the statement read.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan deplored the mass sentencing.
“While those involved in violence must be held accountable, the use of anti-terror laws to try civilians raises serious due-process concerns and is symptomatic of the continued erosion of democratic values. We reiterate that all those accused must receive fair, transparent trials in civilian courts and urge the state to refrain from using draconian laws to stifle political dissent.”
 






In May, an ATC in Islamabad sentenced PTI members, including MNA Abdul Latif, to 27 years of imprisonment for attacking a police station during the May 9 riots.
In December 2024, military courts had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.

Bajaur police spokesperson Israr Salarzai told Dawn.com: “The house of a citizen in Gohati Mamond was struck by a mortar shell, due to which four men were injured.
“They were taken to the Lar Khalazo Tehsil Headquarters Hospital for medical assistance,” he said, adding that the condition of one of the injured people was critical.
Earlier in the week, the Bajaur administration imposed a three-day curfew at 16 places in the district and initiated an operation against militants in the areas.  Salarzai added that the curfew was lifted in the district after a two-day operation against the militants.
KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced on Wednesday that a series of jirgas will be convened from August 2 to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.
Bajaur district, previously a hotspot during the peak of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan insurgency, is once again seeing a surge in militant violence.
On July 10, ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb and a police officer were killed there by unidentified gunmen. On July 2, a roadside bomb hit an official convoy in Sadiqabad, killing five, including an assistant commissioner and a tehsildar, and injuring 17 others, many of them police personnel.
On June 13, cross-border fire from Afghanistan killed a man and injured two women in Salarzai tehsil. In January, PTI lawmaker Anwar Zaib Khan claimed that militants from Afghanistan had captured 15 security checkposts within Bajaur.</p><small>2025-07-31 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/311713233b78529.jpg?r=171521' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927819/india-pm-modi-faces-opposition-fury-after-trumps-25pc-tariff-threat' target='_blank'><strong>India PM Modi faces opposition fury after Trump’s 25pc tariff threat</strong></a><br><p>Indian opposition parties criticised the government on Thursday, describing US President Donald Trump’s threat of a 25 per cent tariff as a diplomatic failure for New Delhi, while the rupee currency tumbled and equity indexes slid in response to the news.
The 25pc rate would single out India more harshly than other major trading partners, and threatens to unravel months of talks, undermining one of Washington’s strategic partners in the region, viewed as a counterbalance to China.
Trump said the tariff on imports from India would start from Friday, in addition to an unspecified penalty for Russian dealings and involvement in the BRICS grouping of nations.
In response, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it was studying the implications of Trump’s remarks and was dedicated to securing a fair trade deal.
“This development reflects a broader collapse of foreign policy under the Modi government,” a lawmaker of the main opposition Congress party said in a notice to the lower house of parliament, asking for a discussion on the matter.
The debate would focus on the “government’s economic and diplomatic failure in preventing the imposition of 25pc US tariffs plus penalties on Indian exports,” the notice added.
Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal was expected to brief the lower house later on Thursday, his office said.
“I don’t care what India does with Russia,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Thursday, adding, “They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care.”
Russia remained India’s top oil supplier during the first six months of 2025, accounting for 35pc of overall supplies.
Economists warned the steep tariff could hurt India’s manufacturing ambitions and trim up to 40 basis points off economic growth in the financial year to March 2026.
India’s benchmark equity indices, the Nifty 50 and BSE Sensex, fell as much as 0.9pc each in early trade before paring losses and trading flat.
The rupee was trading down 0.2pc at 87.6175 after touching its lowest in more than five months earlier in the day. The dollar’s rise gains momentum as the Fed signals patience on rate cuts.
‘Raw Deal’
India has received a “raw deal”, said Priyanka Kishore, an economist at Asia Decoded. “While further trade talks may bring the tariff rate down, it appears unlikely that India will secure a significantly better outcome than its eastern neighbours,” she added.
That would raise questions about India’s relative appeal as a China plus one destination, she said, referring to a strategy of diversifying supply chains through manufacturing outside China to reduce geopolitical and operational risks.
Trade talks continued, Trump said on social media, however, as nations face a Friday deadline to strike deals on reciprocal tariffs or have a US tariff slapped on their exports.
The US levy on India exceeds those agreed by some other nations in deals with the Trump administration. For example, the tariff on Vietnam is set at 20pc and on Indonesia at 19pc, with levies of 15pc on Japanese and European Union exports.
On Wednesday, Trump said Washington had reached a trade deal with India’s arch-rival Pakistan that Islamabad said would lead to lower tariffs on its exports, but neither side has yet revealed the agreed rate.
Since India’s short but deadly conflict with Pakistan in May, New Delhi has been unhappy about Trump’s closeness with Islamabad and has protested, casting a shadow over trade talks.
Despite former public displays of bonhomie between Trump and Modi, India has taken a slightly harder stance against the United States in recent weeks.
Trump has repeatedly taken credit for the India-Pakistan ceasefire he announced on social media on May 10, but India disputes his claim that it resulted from his intervention and trade threats.
“The government has destroyed our economic policy, has destroyed our defence policy, has destroyed our foreign policy,” opposition leader Rahul Gandhi told reporters.
The United States, the world’s largest economy, now has a trade deficit of $45.7 billion with India, the fifth largest.
Trump’s announcement and the lack of clarity on the penalty have created “considerable uncertainty”, said Krishan Arora, a partner at consultants Grant Thornton Bharat.
“India is also actively realigning its position in global supply chains through deeper trade and investment linkages with other countries - an effort that must now accelerate to reduce long-term vulnerabilities,” Arora said.</p><small>2025-07-31 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/31182932f2bebd8.jpg?r=184902' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927825/no-sugar-crisis-sufficient-stock-available-food-security-minister-rana-tanveer' target='_blank'><strong>No sugar crisis, sufficient stock available: Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer</strong></a><br><p>National Food Security and Research Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain asserted on Thursday that Pakistan continued to hold a surplus of sugar and categorically dismissed reports of a shortage due to exports as a misleading perception.
Pakistan is once again in the grip of a familiar affliction: the annual sugar crisis. In 2025, retail sugar prices have surged past Rs200 per kilogramme in many urban and peri-urban markets, despite official statements insisting on sufficient stocks.
In the 2024-25 season, Pakistan’s sugar production is estimated to be 6.8 million tonnes, while consumption is expected to be 6.6m tonnes, leaving a very little surplus and minimal opportunity for market swings. Rather than a problem of genuine scarcity, this crisis appears to be largely manufactured, fuelled by a toxic combination of speculative hoarding, market manipulation, weak governance, and poor regulatory oversight. The result is that consumers are burdened, farmers are shortchanged, and trust in public institutions continues to erode.
Addressing a press conference on the matter today, Hussain said: “A perception is being created as if there is a major issue regarding the availability, supply or pricing of sugar.”
He added that the government has launched a crackdown on hoarders and profiteers, including retailers and even mill owners were being checked, to control manipulation in the market.
Referring to criticism over the government’s initial approval of sugar exports followed by import plans, Hussain said these narratives ignored historical trends and factual data. Citing records from the past ten years, he explained that sugar exports were traditionally allowed soon after the crushing season and were occasionally followed by imports — except in one or two years.
The minister explained that the Sugar Advisory Board — which includes federal ministers, secretaries, representatives from all four provinces and industry stakeholders — approved exports last year on the basis of data.
At the beginning of the season, Pakistan had an opening stock of 800,000 metric tonnes. The crushing season yielded 6.8 million metric tonnes of sugar, while the country’s annual domestic consumption stood at 6.3m metric tonnes — leaving a surplus of 1.3m metric tonnes.
“To prevent a supply glut that could harm both farmers and millers, the government had allowed gradual sugar exports,” he said.
Contrary to concerns that exports would lead to domestic shortages or price hikes, the market experienced a decline in prices from Rs138/kg to Rs119/kg after the export decision in October 2024.
“This proves that the export decision was not responsible for any artificial shortage or price inflation,” the minister added.
He acknowledged that initial projections for the 2024–25 season estimated sugar production at 7m metric tonnes, slightly higher than the previous year. However, climate change adversely impacted agricultural output, including sugarcane yield. As a result, actual production dropped to 5.8m metric tonnes.
Responding to the shortfall, the prime minister ordered an immediate halt to further exports in January 2025. By the end of the crushing season on April 30, the total available stock, including a buffer of 0.5m metric tonnes, stood at 6.3m metric tonnes, which matches national consumption requirements.
Currently, the country holds around 2m metric tonnes of sugar, enough to meet consumption needs for the next three months.
The minister attributed recent price increases to market manipulation by mill owners, wholesalers, and hoarders, particularly following a rise in sugarcane procurement prices from Rs450 to Rs700 per 40kg.
He said the government intervened and negotiated with stakeholders to fix the ex-mill price at Rs165 per kg and the retail price at Rs173/kg.
To ensure compliance, the government has launched enforcement operations against violators across the supply chain.
“Implementation will take some time, but the system is in place and action is underway,” he said.
Currently, retail prices have stabilised between Rs172 and Rs173/kg, while ex-mill prices are holding at Rs165.
Hussain noted that sugar prices in Pakistan were broadly aligned with those in neighbouring countries.
The minister added that Pakistan earned $402m from the export of 750,000 metric tonnes of sugar last year. However, he acknowledged that earlier approval could have fetched higher export rates.
To manage domestic availability, the government approved sugar imports of up to 500,000 metric tonnes, although only 300,000 tonnes were expected to be brought in, costing approximately $150m.
Downplaying the sugar issue as overblown, Hussain urged media and policymakers to shift their focus toward strategic national developments.
“Our real priority should be landmark achievements such as the recent trade agreement with the United States,” he said. He also highlighted broader signs of economic recovery, citing improved foreign exchange reserves, a rising Pakistan Stock Exchange and declining inflation rates as indicators of better economic management.
PSMA says sugar mills supply commodity at Rs165/kg
Separately, the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) said that all sugar mills were supplying sugar at Rs165/kg ex-mill and the country had ample stocks of sugar till mid-November 2025.
In a statement, a PSMA spokesman said the sugar supply chain was affected due to divergent administrative measures taken by some government institutions, which had been redressed and the supply of sugar was continuing.
The statement said the sugar industry had previously clarified that all mills were supplying sugar to the domestic market at Rs165/kg ex-mill.
“Mills are only concerned with the ex-mill prices, while the retail price of sugar in the market is normally determined by market forces which is now being controlled by the government. As per media reports, sugar is being sold at Rs200/kg but according to sugar industry information, the commodity in most markets is available at the government-set price of Rs173 up to Rs175/kg.”
The spokesperson clarified that sugar dealers were buying sugar from mills at Rs165/kg ex-mill and instead of giving it to domestic consumers, they were giving it to industrial and commercial consumers at higher profits.
“Price gougers and hoarders were creating hurdles in the supply of sugar that they had purchased before the price was fixed. They are blaming sugar exports by creating the impression of an artificial shortage of sugar.
“Linking sugar prices to exports is completely against the facts. The government had allowed the export of sugar only in case of surplus sugar from the carry-over stock of the last two years that was available with the mills and further surplus sugar was produced in the crushing season of 2023-24. Mills had to sell sugar at a loss well below the cost of production, while meeting the government’s condition of Rs140/kg.
“Before sugar exports, all official estimates had shown a strong possibility that the next crushing season would see a good sugarcane yield and produce more sugar, but due to global warming and climate change, sugarcane production and its sucrose level dropped, which adversely affected sugar production.”
The statement said that in the previous crushing season, the sugar industry purchased sugarcane up to Rs700 per maund, which was Rs425 per maund in the crushing season of 2023-24. This provided substantial benefits to the farmers; however, it led to the sugar industry’s cost of making sugar increasing significantly.
“There was also a manifold increase in other production costs, due to which sugar mills had to suffer continuous losses over the past several years, and now 12 sugar mills were closed and up for sale. Baseless accusations of profiteering on the sugar industry are unjustified.”
The PSMA said that all such issues would be resolved by deregulating the sugar sector at the earliest, just as happened in the case of rice and maize sectors.

Last month, the government introduced new taxes on local and foreign e-commerce marketplaces, which made online shopping costlier for Pakistani customers. The government has also introduced new taxes on goods purchased online from outside Pakistan through the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025.
A notification issued by the FBR on Wednesday, and seen by Dawn.com, said: “The Digital Presence Proceed Tax shall not apply to digitally ordered goods and services supplied from outside Pakistan, by any person, which are chargeable to tax under the said act.”
In a post on X, Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja said: “We have removed the tax imposed on international companies doing e-commerce in Pakistan! Pakistan is open for business!”
 






Pakistan and the US finalised a trade deal on Wednesday night, expected to lower tariffs — although no figure was announced.
The Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025, had targeted online marketplaces that sell to Pakistani customers but have little to no physical presence in the country.
Under section 3 of the proposed law, every foreign vendor with a “significant digital presence in Pakistan” would have been charged a tax on goods sold online from outside Pakistan.
Typically, these vendors include online marketplaces such as AliExpress, Temu, and Amazon, among others.
Under the proposed law, customers would have been charged five per cent of the amount paid to the vendor for the purchase of goods from a foreign marketplace.
The tax would have been collected by banks, financial institutions, or payment gateways that facilitate transactions between customers and the online marketplace.
Customs were empowered to ensure that goods purchased online from foreign marketplaces were not delivered to customers unless the courier companies provided evidence of tax payment.
In an open letter to Aurangzeb on June 25, the US Chamber of Commerce’s US-Pakistan Business Council (USPBC) had expressed “deep concerns” with the new tax measure, saying it was a “discriminatory new tax” and should be withdrawn.
“We are concerned about the Act’s conflicts with international tax norms and the risk that it will discourage foreign investment in Pakistan,” it said.
“The proposed tax would be similar to digital services taxes (DSTs) in France and the United Kingdom, which the United States Trade Representative has found to be discriminatory against US companies, inconsistent with established principles of international taxing jurisdiction, and burdensome on US commerce.
“Recent experience demonstrates that such taxes are most likely to be borne by Pakistani consumers, who will face higher costs for goods and services. Furthermore, imposing such a tax could stifle expansion and job creation among local Pakistani companies that rely on digital tools supplied by foreign companies.”
The USPBC had said it was committed to working with Pakistan on policies that support economic growth and job creation.
“To maintain the certainty and stability necessary to support continued business investment in Pakistan, we respectfully urge policymakers to withdraw the Digital Presence Proceeds Tax Act, 2025. The act would not only disproportionately harm US companies and American digital exports but also undermine the robust US-Pakistan trading relationship at a critical juncture,” the council had said.</p><small>2025-07-31 12:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/311237028f521a2.png?r=144855' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927783/pakistan-says-deal-concluded-with-us-on-tariffs-trump-cites-oil-reserves-agreement' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan says deal concluded with US on tariffs; Trump cites oil reserves agreement</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the US finalised a trade deal on Wednesday night, expected to lower tariffs — although no figure was announced — while US President Donald Trump cited a pact aimed at helping develop Pakistan’s oil reserves.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is currently in Washington for negotiations on a tariff deal and also began meetings with senior US officials on Wednesday.
“In a landmark development, Pakistan and the United States finalised a trade agreement today aimed at boosting bilateral trade, expanding market access, attracting investment, and fostering cooperation in areas of mutual interest,” the Pakistani embassy in the US posted on X on Thursday morning.
Trump announced the deal on his platform Truth Social early Thursday morning.
“We have just concluded a deal with the country of Pakistan, whereby Pakistan and the United States will work together on developing their massive oil reserves,” Trump wrote.
“We are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling oil to India some day!”
There was no formal announcement from either side on what tariff rate was agreed upon, but the Pakistani embassy said the agreement “will result in reduction of reciprocal tariff especially on Pakistani exports to the United States.”
 






“This deal marks the beginning of a new era of economic collaboration especially in energy, mines and mineral, IT, cryptocurrency and other sectors,” the embassy said.
“The deal complements Pakistan’s existing efforts of broadening the scope of Pak-US economic ties and to include partnerships at the US states level. The agreement enhances Pakistan’s access to the US market and vice versa.”
The deal was reached during a meeting of Aurangzeb, US Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, and US Trade Representative Ambassador Jamieson Greer. Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul and Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh were also present during the meeting.
The Pakistan embassy said the deal is expected to spur increased US investment in Pakistan’s infrastructure and development projects.
“This trade agreement underscores the commitment of both nations to deepen their bilateral relationship and explore all avenues for strengthening trade and investment ties.”
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif thanked Trump for his leadership role in finalising the “historic US-Pakistan trade agreement”, saying in a post on X that  “this landmark deal will enhance our growing cooperation so as to expand the frontiers of our enduring partnership in days to come.”
 






Early this morning, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also confirmed the trade deal but provided no details.
 






Aurangzeb called the deal a “win-win” for both countries.
“Today marks the culmination of the journey we started a few months back,” he said in a video message released by the Ministry of Finance on Thursday.
Aurangzeb reflected on the progress made since the talks related to the tariffs began, highlighting efforts to address non-tariff barriers, correct the trade imbalance, and review tariff lines on both sides.

“We had a very constructive final round of discussion which then lead to finalising the trade deal, which was later on announced by President Trump.
“From our perspective, it was always going beyond the immediate trade imperative. The whole point of this is that trade and investment have to go hand in hand,” the finance minister said.
He expressed his gratitude to several people and entities for their involvement in the process.
“The role of the private sector is prominent, because when we were trying to figure out how to reduce or end the trade imbalance, the private sector was the first constituent who came up and said they will help,” Aurangzeb said.
He thanked the commerce secretary and Ambassador Sheikh, and their respective teams, saying, “Where we stand today is because of our teamwork.”
While reiterating Trump’s message in his post, Aurangzeb called it a “real win-win situation for Pakistan and the United States”
“We are in a good place today in Pakistan in terms of where we have arrived before August 1, and for that, I congratulate everyone.
“I think we have come a long way from where we were to where we are today in terms of our overall strategic partnership between Pakistan and the US. It will, God willing, go from strength to strength as we go forward.”
Pakistan, which Washington has designated a “major non-NATO ally” in its effort to counter China’s influence in the region, faced a potential tariff of 29 per cent declared in April that was later suspended for 90 days to allow trade talks.
Last week, Dar said both nations were “very close” to a trade deal that could come within days, after he met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday.
They discussed expanding trade and ties in critical minerals and mining, the two sides said afterwards. Other Pakistani officials have also visited for talks in recent weeks.
Under Trump, Washington has sought to renegotiate trade deals with many countries, which he threatened with tariffs for trade relations he calls unfair, a characterisation many economists dispute.
US total goods trade with Pakistan was an estimated $7.3 billion in 2024, the office of the US trade representative says on its website, up from about $6.9bn in 2023.
In 2024, its goods trade deficit with Pakistan was $3bn, up 5.2pc from 2023.
Rabbani demands govt take Parliament into confidence
Meanwhile, former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani criticised the development, saying that it was “a sad day for transparency and good governance, when the people of Pakistan come to know through a tweet of the US President that an oil exploration deal has been finalised.”
He said the government must realise that such deals and projects were governed under Article 172 of the Constitution and the provinces had 50 per cent ownership of all lands, minerals and other things of value.
“The federal government should immediately take Parliament into confidence on the new Western-oriented initiatives.
“It should call a meeting of the Council of Common Interests and take provinces into confidence on such and other projects,” he said in a statement.

Alvi, along with other KE employees, was accused of workplace harassment by the company’s former chief marketing and communication officer, Mahreen Aziz Khan, said the order issued by provincial ombudsman Justice (R) Shahnawaz Tariq.
In her application, Khan had accused Alvi, Chief People Officer Rizwan Dallia, Chief of Security Col (R) Wahid Asghar, and Member of the Board of Directors and Chairman Board HR Committee Khalid Rafi, of “causing harassment, intimidation and mental agony”.
The ombudsman’s order said that Alvi had “committed harassment, created a hostile environment and caused mental agony at the workplace to [Khan] and her team”.
Consequently, Alvi was penalised under Section 4(4)(ii)(c) of the Protection against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, and ordered removed from his service instantly, along with a penalty of Rs2.5 million, which shall be paid to Khan as compensation within 30 days of the order being passed.
It said that if he failed to pay the fine amount within the stipulated period, it would be recovered as land revenue in terms of the Land Revenue Act, 1967, through the concerned deputy commissioner from Alvi’s moveable and immoveable properties, including bank accounts.
It also said that his CNIC and passport would be be blocked through Nadra and the Ministry of Interior till recovery of the fine. The order said it was self-executory and in case of its non-compliance, contempt proceedings under Section 10(1)(vi) of the act would be initiated against the concerned delinquent officers.
The order can be appealed in the high court.
Regarding the three others accused, the order said: “There is no direct evidence for committing harassment to the complainant; therefore, they are discharged from the allegations of harassment as alleged by the complainant.”
Alvi responded to the development in a series of posts on X.
“I have always upheld the values of integrity and dignity in professional interactions, and I deeply believe in fostering safe and inclusive workplaces for all.
“The recent verdict is deeply distressing to me,” he said.
 






“While I respect the legal process and the institutions that uphold it, I must, in good conscience, state that the findings do not reflect the truth of the situation as I experienced it.
He added: “This has been a painful journey — not just professionally, but personally.”
Alvi said he was currently reviewing the decision with his legal counsel and would be exercising his right to appeal.
“It is for anyone who feels wronged to be heard. I remain committed to ensuring that the truth is fully brought to light, through all lawful means available,” he said on X.
Meanwhile, Khan’s legal adviser, Barrister Talal Wasif Qavi, released a statement on her behalf.
“This judgment affirms that no one who disrespects the daughters of this nation deserves to hold any office — public or private. It is a clear message that power cannot shield misconduct.
“Across Pakistan, working women face harassment in silence. This case proves they no longer need to be afraid. Justice is possible,” the statement read.
“This decision serves as a beacon of hope for every working woman who has been forced into silence. We stand with all women who speak out — and will continue to fight until dignity and safety are guaranteed in every workplace.”
Alvi was reappointed as the CEO by KE’s board of directors on July 7.
In 2020, he and other senior KE officials were booked after another citizen died from electrocution in Karachi. Following the incident, the government formed a special committee to streamline KE operations and called for the removal of its top leadership over poor service during the monsoon.
Sources said government board members had pushed to replace Alvi and the distribution head with professionals capable of handling crises and ensuring efficient service.</p><small>2025-07-31 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/31122233c76f556.jpg?r=122531' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927782/pakistan-successfully-launches-remote-sensing-satellite-foreign-ministry' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan successfully launches remote sensing satellite: foreign ministry</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan successfully launched a remote sensing satellite from a launch centre in China on Thursday that aims to strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities, according to a Foreign Office statement.
Pakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China which has supported it through many investments and development projects such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), termed as a “lifeline” for the country’s economy.
“In a major milestone for space exploration and technological progress, Pakistan today successfully launched its Remote Sensing Satellite from the Xichang Satellite Launch Centre (XSLC) in China,” a statement by the foreign ministry said.
The satellite was launched by Pakistan’s national space agency, the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco), in collaboration with the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) and Microsat China, according to the ministry.
According to the statement, the satellite “will provide high-resolution, round-the-clock imaging, significantly strengthening Pakistan’s capabilities in urban planning, infrastructure development, disaster management and mitigation, agricultural monitoring, food security, environmental protection, deforestation tracking, climate change analysis, and water resource management”.
The ministry said that the satellite represented a “cornerstone of an integrated Earth observation system”.
 
 

“With this latest success, Pakistan reaffirms its position among the community of space-faring nations, leveraging innovation to pursue a more secure, sustainable, and prosperous future,” it added.
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar commended the dedication of the engineers, scientists, and technical teams from Suparco, CETC and Microsat China for their “exemplary cooperation and unwavering commitment to the mission”.
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal also congratulated the nation and the Suparco team on the successful launch of the satellite.
“We are deeply grateful to China for its unwavering support and cooperation in this project,” he said.
He confirmed that the satellite had successfully entered its designated orbit and would soon begin delivering data.
“We are committed to restoring Pakistan’s leadership in space technology,” Iqbal added. “With China’s help, we plan to send a Pakistani astronaut into space next year. By 2035, we will also successfully complete our lunar mission and land on the moon.”
In a post on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Suparco on the successful launch and thanked Chinese partners for their contributions to the project.
“This achievement showcases the soaring heights of Pakistan-China cooperation, extending beyond borders and into outer space, driven by a shared vision to harness space technology for the betterment of humanity,” the PM wrote.
“The satellite will have wide-ranging benefits for CPEC as well as applications for use in agriculture, urban planning, disaster management, mapping of transportation networks and data acquisition in different environments.”
 






President Asif Ali Zardari also congratulated the Pakistani scientists on successful launch of remote sensing satellite, saying, “Pakistan is proud of the capabilities of its scientists.”
He called the milestone “a bright symbol of Pakistan’s growing space capabilities”, extending his gratitude to the Chinese government for its cooperation in the successful launch of the satellite.
Suparco Chairman Mohammad Yousaf Khan said that the new satellite would serve national priorities and “contribute meaningfully” to Pakistan’s sustainable socio-economic development.
China’s space programme has rapidly advanced over the years, achieving milestones like the Tiangong space station and lunar sample-return missions. Its BeiDou satellite system and reusable rocket development underscore growing technological prowess.
In April, PM Shehbaz expressed Pakistan’s desire to enhance cooperation with China in the field of space technology, adding that China remained the country’s “most reliable and strategic partner”.
In May, Pakistan became the first foreign nation to join China’s space station training programme, sending two astronauts for training under a landmark agreement with the China Manned Space Agency.</p><small>2025-07-31 12:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/311654338132330.jpg?r=165547' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927816/trump-says-tariffs-are-making-us-great-and-rich-again' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says tariffs are making US ‘great and rich’ again</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the sweeping tariffs he has imposed on nations around the world were making the country “great and rich again”, as governments raced to strike deals with Washington less than 24 hours before an August 1 deadline.
“Tariffs are making America great and rich again,” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.
“One year ago, America was a dead country, now it is the ‘hottest’ country anywhere in the world,” he added.
 


A day earlier, the US president imposed new tariffs to punish or favour several major trading partners — the latest round of sweeping measures that have roiled markets around the world.
South Korea squeezed in at the last moment, securing agreement on a 15 per cent tariff for exports to the US — significantly below the 25pc that Trump had earlier threatened to introduce.
But Trump also announced crippling 50pc tariffs on Brazil and a 25pc levy on Indian exports, while warning Canada it would face trade repercussions for planning to recognise a Palestinian state.
The 15pc rate on Seoul — Washington’s key security ally — was equivalent to levies determined from US trade deals with Japan and the European Union.
He added that South Korea had committed to investing $350 billion in the US, as well as the purchase of “$100bn worth” of liquefied natural gas (LNG) or other energy sources.
Seoul’s presidential office said tariffs on automobiles — one of Seoul’s key exports — would also stay at 15pc.
Trump hit Brazil with high tariffs as well as sanctions against the judge overseeing a trial of his far-right ally Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of attempting a coup in Latin America’s biggest economy.
But he delayed its implementation from Friday to August 6, and crucially exempted many products from the prohibitive levy, including orange juice, civil aircraft, iron ore and some energy products.
Canada trade threat
He had threatened to wield US economic might to punish Brazil — and its Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, in particular — for what he has termed a “witch hunt” against former president Bolsonaro.
Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said he would defend “the sovereignty of the Brazilian people in the face of measures announced by the president of the United States”.
Among Trump’s latest announcements were a 25pc duty on Indian goods to begin on Friday — slightly lower than previously threatened — after talks between Washington and New Delhi failed to bring about a trade pact.
India would face an unspecified “penalty” over purchases of Russian weapons and energy as well, Trump said.
“I don’t care what India does with Russia. They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.
“We have done very little business with India, their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world,” he added.
 


Canada’s trade relations with the US also came under threat after Prime Minister Mark Carney announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September.
“Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine,” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform. “That will make it very hard for us to make a trade deal with them.”
 


‘Big day for America’
He also signed an order on Wednesday to impose previously threatened 50pc tariffs on certain copper products and end a tariff exemption for low-value shipments from abroad.
It left out products like copper ores, concentrates and cathodes, bringing some relief to the industry.
As Trump’s deal deadline neared, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News that Washington had struck trade deals with Cambodia and Thailand, but provided no details of the accords.
The US tariff hikes due on Friday were initially announced in April as part of a package in which Trump slapped a minimum 10pc levy on goods from almost all trading partners — citing unfair trade practices.
This rate was set to rise to varying levels for dozens of economies such as the European Union, Japan and others, but Washington twice postponed their implementation as financial markets gyrated.
The US leader insisted on Wednesday that the August 1 deadline “will not be extended” any further.
So far, Britain, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, the EU and South Korea have reached initial deals with Washington to secure less punishing conditions.
While the US and China earlier slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s products, both sides are working to further a truce maintaining duties at lower levels.
Although Trump has promised a surge in government revenues from his duties, economists warn that higher tariffs can fuel an uptick in inflation and weigh on economic growth.</p><small>2025-07-31 12:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/31151041a7c9955.png?r=151115' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927806/us-oil-partnership-could-embark-pakistan-on-transformative-path-say-experts' target='_blank'><strong>US oil partnership could embark Pakistan on ‘transformative path’, say experts</strong></a><br><p>Experts have welcomed the announcement of a trade deal struck between the US and Pakistan on Wednesday night that includes a partnership in developing oil reserves in the country.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is currently in Washington for negotiations on a tariff deal and also began meetings with senior US officials yesterday.
United States President Donald Trump said early on Thursday that his administration has struck a trade deal with Pakistan that includes joint development of the country’s “massive” oil reserves.
“We are in the process of choosing the oil company that will lead this partnership. Who knows, maybe they’ll be selling oil to India someday!” Trump said on social media.

Additional details of the agreement were not immediately available; however, local experts welcome the development with a positive note.
Local oil industry experts see Trump’s “massive” oil reserves statement with hope.
Muhammad Iqbal Jawaid, a Karachi-based oil industry expert, viewed the development as “encouraging” for Pakistan’s “untapped” oil and gas sector, which has a “huge” potential to grow.
“Pakistan enjoys a huge untapped potential for oil and gas, but it requires massive resources that we don’t have. If the US comes into the picture, it could lead to a major breakthrough,” Jawaid told Anadolu.
Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, along with tribal districts near the Afghanistan border, have bright prospects in terms of oil and gas exploration, he added.
He went on to say that Pakistan had strong prospects of having offshore energy reserves, which could be tapped with the help of major global companies.
Sharing a similar view, Wasi Khan, another oil industry and energy expert, said that Islamabad had not been able to tap its “true” potential in the oil and gas sector due to inadequate infrastructure and under-investment.
“I see this development in a positive commercial context. Greater international cooperation in Pakistan’s energy sector can bring in more investment, advanced technology, and healthy competition, all of which serve Pakistan’s interests,” he told Anadolu.
Security challenges
Khan said that in Pakistan’s case, exploration efforts have remained limited so far, primarily due to resource constraints and law and order challenges in onshore regions.
However, offshore areas are free from such limitations and represent a significantly under-explored frontier, he added.
Endorsing the opinion, Jawaid observed that the law and order in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa needs to be improved to attract international investment in the local energy sector.
The South and North Waziristan districts, together with other adjoining areas, are believed to have been sitting on major oil and gas reserves, which remain untapped due to security issues.
The two provinces, including the tribal districts, have long been the hotbed of militancy, where security forces are fighting against Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and ethnic Baloch separatists.
The mineral-rich Balochistan is a key route for the multi-billion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project.
Transformative path
Pakistan’s proven oil reserves are currently estimated at 353 million barrels, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).
Its current oil and condensate production stands at 60,000 barrels per day.
With an annual oil import bill of over $12bn, the country imports fuel mainly from Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, and China.
It has also started importing crude oil from Russia on a small scale.
 
 

The EIA once estimated that Pakistan holds up to 9bn barrels of technically recoverable shale oil. This assessment may well have formed the basis for Trump’s remarks on Pakistan’s energy potential, according to Khan.
He observed that if approached with serious intent and supported by “capable partners such as American expertise”, Pakistan could embark on a transformative path much like Saudi Arabia once did.
“There, five major US oil companies (Chevron, Texaco, Exxon, Mobil, and Gulf Oil) joined forces, eventually forming Aramco (the Saudi state oil company) and discovering one of the largest oil reserves in the world,” he added.
“Pakistan’s offshore potential deserves the same scale of ambition and commitment,” Khan further said, adding that he is “very hopeful” about the country’s untapped oil potential.</p><small>2025-07-31 11:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/31142240e6f15f2.jpg?r=154440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927804/pml-n-rejects-rumours-of-nawaz-sharif-becoming-president-terms-them-table-stories' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N rejects rumours of Nawaz Sharif becoming president, terms them ‘table stories’</strong></a><br><p>PML-N Senator Irfanul Haque Siddiqui has strongly denied rumours that party chief and ex-PM Nawaz Sharif intends to run for president or is making a political comeback.
His statement comes amid speculations earlier that President Asif Ali Zardari would resign from his post. However, the news was rejected across the political spectrum.
Speaking on Dawn News programme ‘Doosra Rukh’ on Wednesday night, Siddiqui categorically denied any such developments, saying, “Nawaz Sharif has neither expressed a desire to become president, nor has there been a discussion about it.
“There is no truth to speculation that Nawaz Sharif is trying to change the system to become president himself. These are baseless, table stories.”
He added that there was a time when it was inconceivable that Zardari would become the president, but the decision was made due to the situation, timing and political climate.
Siddiqui had earlier also denied reports of Zardari’s resignation. Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Geo Pakistan’, he said: “Reports that Zardari is resigning, Imran’s sons are coming, Nawaz Sharif is going to Adiala … these are not news. They are bogus, table stories.”
He had said, “Zardari has not created any difficulties for the government, and understands his constitutional responsibilities as head of state”.
The PML-N leader had said his party had “no trouble” working with the president and there was no credible reason to remove him from office. “We have a coalition with the PPP. Why would we bring down this system?” he questioned.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had also rebutted rumours of President Zardari being asked to resign, terming it a “malicious campaign”.
“We are fully aware of who is behind the malicious campaign targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and the chief of army staff,” Naqvi wrote on X.
“I have categorically stated that there has been no discussion, nor does any such idea exist about the president being asked to resign or the COAS aspiring to assume the presidency,” he asserted.
He said the president enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces. He quoted President Zardari as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”
Naqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability.</p><small>2025-07-31 11:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616650-atc-sentences-omar-ayub-shibli-faraz-and-others-to-10-years-in-may-9-riots-case' target='_blank'><strong>Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, Zartaj Gul among others handed 10-year jail term in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

Per the statement, Pakistan Rangers (Sindh) and Police, acting on sensitive intelligence information, conducted a joint operation in the Korangi area of Karachi.
“During the operation, six suspects involved in international drug trafficking were arrested,” the statement said. “Among them was Irfan alias Irfanullah, an Afghan national and a key member of the network. This year, he had been using intercity buses and trucks to transport drugs to various parts of the country.”
It said that for the past several months, the suspects had robbed trucks transporting cargo from Karachi to other parts of Pakistan, kidnapped drivers, and moved them to an undisclosed location.
“After stealing the items from the loaded trucks, they would leave the vehicles in an isolated location in Karachi.”
The statement further said that law enforcement recovered 308,308 narcotic pills, three digital scales, a counting machine, two mobile phones, three identification cards used for smuggling, and a modern weapon from the suspects during the operation.
The suspects were part of a group comprising 20-25 individuals. The arrested suspects were wanted in cases registered in police stations in different areas of Karachi. They have been handed over to the police for further investigation, it added.
Earlier this week, three terrorists, including the mastermind behind the November 2024 attack on Chinese engineers, were killed during a counterterrorism operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area.
Additional Inspector-General of Police, Counter-Terrorism Department, Azad Khan, said the slain terrorist was identified as Zafran, while two of his accomplices were also killed in the operation.
Senior CTD official Raja Umer Khattab said that the operation was jointly carried out by the CTD and personnel of intelligence agencies.

Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
In Lakki Marwat’s Sarai Naurang tehsil, three people were reported dead, including two women and a 15-year-old boy, when the roof of a room in their house collapsed amid heavy rain, according to a Rescue 1122 statement.
The Rescue 1122 team has cleared the debris and recovered the bodies of the deceased from the site of the incident, which were transferred to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Sarai Naurang, said the statement.
Meanwhile, in a separate incident in Bannu, at least two others — including a man and a young boy — were injured when the roof of their house collapsed due to heavy rain, according to a Rescue statement.
“The injured were immediately provided first aid as Rescue 1122 rushed to the site of the incident after the control room received reports of rain-related roof collapse in the Faqirabad Chowk area of Bannu,” said the statement.
The injured were transferred to the nearby hospital, it added.
Bannu Rescue 1122 spokesperson Ikram Wazir, in a statement, said that “rescue teams are on alert to ensure the protection of life and property in case of an emergency.”
In a similar incident, in KP’s Tank district, a 35-year-old man sustained “serious injuries” after the roof of a room in his house caved in as a result of rain, as per a statement issued by the media coordinator of Rescue 1122 in Tank.
“The injured was rushed to the District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ), Tank,” it added.
On July 26, the Pakistan Meteorological Department had forecasted downpours from July 27 to 31 in KP, while the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) directed district administrations to act immediately, ensuring minimum damage to public life and property.
The advisory cautioned that heavy rainfall, windstorms and lightning could damage weak structures like roofs and walls of mud houses, electric poles, billboards, vehicles and solar panels.
On July 29, Flash floods triggered by heavy rain swept through Naran in KP’s Mansehra district, where rescue teams had to evacuate 160 stranded tourists.
Last week, 250 tourists and passengers stranded at the Babusar Highway were rescued by the Diamer district administration, volunteers, police, Rescue 1122 and the army, according to a spokesperson.
The national death toll from monsoon-related casualties surged to 234 since late June, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority. Of the 234 deaths, 79 were men, 42 women, and 113 — nearly half of the total — were children.</p><small>2025-07-31 06:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616625-diplomatic-triumph-pakistan-hails-historic-trade-pact-with-us' target='_blank'><strong>‘Diplomatic triumph': Pakistan hails historic trade pact with US</strong></a><br><p>

Continuous monsoon rains and accelerated glacier melting have significantly increased water inflows into major rivers, raising concerns of widespread flooding.
According to PDMA, the Chenab River at Marala is currently experiencing high level, with an inflow of 206,000 cusecs and an outflow of 179,000 cusecs.
Meanwhile, the Indus River has reported low-level flooding at key locations, including Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma, and Taunsa. At Tarbela, the inflow has surged to 286,000 cusecs, with an outflow of 270,000 cusecs. Similarly, Taunsa recorded an inflow of 310,000 cusecs, Kalabagh 300,000 cusecs, and Chashma 345,000 cusecs, indicating rising pressure on the river system.

Rains, glacier melt raise flood threat; urban flooding forecast in Lahore, Gujranwala, Pindi

The authorities warned that the Sutlej, Ravi, and Jhelum rivers, though currently at normal levels, could swell further due to the forecast rains.
The PDMA also highlighted that hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan remain stable for now, but the next 24 hours may see a dangerous surge in water levels.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia has directed district administrations to remain on high alert, particularly in vulnerable areas where flood contingency plans have already been activated. The PDMA control room and district emergency operation centres are operating round-the-clock to monitor developments.
Reservoir levels are also under close watch, with Mangla Dam at 57 per cent capacity and Tarbela Dam at 87pc. Additionally, Indian dams on the Sutlej, Beas, and Ravi rivers are reportedly at 43pc capacity, raising concerns about potential cross-border water releases.
The PDMA urged the public to exercise extreme caution, advising against bathing in rivers or canals and avoiding unnecessary travel during adverse weather conditions.
PDMA also issued a monsoon rain alert in different areas of Punjab for next 24 hours. It forecast heavy rains in Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Mandi Bahauddin, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Gujrat, and Sialkot.
The PDMA also issued an alert to the commissioners and deputy commissioners of these respective districts to take measures and deal with the situation.
The PDMA also forecast urban flooding alert for Lahore, Rawalpindi and Gujranwala. The alert was also issued about rising water levels in rivers Chenab, Ravi and Jhelum. The river flood could also generate high water in canals of these areas.
There is a low level flood situation in the Baein rainwater drain in Narowal. The Sutlej River is also experiencing an increase in water flow at Ganda Singh.
PDMA also released a monsoon rains fact sheet. The Met office recorded 83mm rain in Jhelum, 81mm in Rawalpindi, 49mm in Mandi Bahauddin, 48mm in Mangla, 42mm in Gujrat, 39mm each in Gujranwala and Sialkot, and 33mm in DG Khan.
The monsoon fifth spell will continue till July 31.
During the current year, 162 people lost their lives due to rain in Punjab and 563 others were injured. As many as 214 houses were damaged and 121 cattle also died.
Most of the people lost lives due to roof collapse and electrocution and the government also announced compensation for the families of the deceased persons.
The government also announced financial help for the farmers over their crops damage.

According to a report by Topline Securities, the country will need to arrange a net financing of $10bn, comprising $6bn in principal and $4bn in interest, after accounting for expected rollovers and refinancing.
In a briefing to analysts and researchers after announcing a status quo in the monetary policy on Wednesday, State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmed said foreign exchange reserves are projected to reach $15.5bn by December 2025 and $17.5bn by June 2026. Any proceeds from international bond issuances, such as Eurobonds or Sukuk, would be over and above this target.
The governor added that Pakistan is due to repay $1.8bn in FY26 on account of two maturing Eurobonds — one of $800 million and the other of $1bn.

Islamabad must arrange $10bn net external financing in FY26; SBP says total repayments reach $26bn

Encouragingly, the country’s external debt composition has improved, with multilateral lenders now accounting for 50pc of public external debt (combined State Bank and government holdings), up from 43pc in June 2022. Debt maturity profiles have also seen improvement.
To manage repayments, Pakistan is expected to once again seek rollovers from key partners including China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, as it did in FY25. Analysts remain optimistic about the government’s ability to secure these rollovers, citing a current account surplus and stronger foreign exchange reserves.
Housing scheme
Governor Ahmed also announced that a new Housing Scheme has been finalised in consultation with the SBP. Approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) and awaiting cabinet ratification, the scheme will soon be circulated to banks to stimulate lending and activity in the housing sector.
Topline’s report revealed that the SBP purchased $20bn from the interbank market over the last three years through direct intervention. While no official figure was released for FY25, banking sources estimate the SBP bought around $9bn in the last fiscal year to stabilise reserves.
The governor affirmed that remittance-linked incentives for financial institutions would continue, in line with directives from the Prime Minister. However, the government has decided to rationalise these incentives to banks going forward.
No stimulus for industry
The central bank’s decision to maintain a high policy rate has drawn criticism from the business community. Younus Dagha, Chairman of the Policy Research and Advisory Council (PRAC), said the decision fails to provide the stimulus needed for economic revival.
Despite a disinflationary trend, the real interest rate stands at 7.8pc —among the highest in the region. This is seen as a major constraint on private sector investment, industrial growth, and overall competitiveness. In contrast, regional peers maintain lower real rates: India (3.4pc), China (2.9pc), Bangladesh (1.5pc), Vietnam (0.9pc), and Indonesia (3.4pc).

An official at the Civil Lines police station identified the woman as Farida Chandio, resident of Rasool Abad locality, and the children as three-year-old Usman and two-year-old Sadaf.
When she jumped into the canal, policemen present on the spot rescued and shifted her to the women’s police station.
Later, police produced her in the court of the fourth additional and sessions judge. Farida told the court that five years ago, she was married to Shahid Hussain Chandio. 
She said her husband was of a suspicious nature and used to abuse her physically over false accusations, putting her and children’s lives at risk. She requested for protection. The woman refused to return to her husband or go with her brothers and instead wished to stay at a shelter home (Darul Aman) for some time. 
She was shifted to Darul Aman after the court passed an order.

• Police say couple moved to Karachi eight months ago
• Investigators suspect woman’s relatives behind brutal killings
• CM, home minister order inquiry and arrest of culprits
KARACHI: A man and his wife, who had married of their own free will in their native town of Lasbela over five years ago, and their minor son were murdered on the outskirts of the metropolis on Wednesday, police said.
They identified the victims as Abdul Majeed, 30, Sakina, 25, and their four-year-old son, Abdul Nabi, and said they were axed to death in their home in the Ghaghar Phatak area within the remit of the Steel Town police station.
Area SHO Aslam Billu told Dawn that an alleged killer phoned Majeed’s brother, Imam Bux, telling him that they had killed the family and that he should go there and bury them.
He said that Imam Bux and Majeed’s other brother, Qurban, had been living with the victims in Karachi but had recently returned to their home in Lasbela for agricultural purposes.
Qurban phoned his friend, Munawar Abro, to visit his brother’s home and ascertain the facts. When Abro reached there, he found the three family members brutally murdered inside their home. He informed the brothers and the police, who arrived at the scene and shifted the bodies to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.
Investigators collected two axes used in the murders and other evidence from the crime scene. SHO Billu said they suspected that the couple and their son might have been given sedatives before the killing, as neighbours told police that they had not heard any cries or sounds.
He said that during the initial probe, it transpired that the couple had married of their own free will in Lasbela a couple of years ago and Sakina’s parents were reportedly against the marriage.
The couple, along with their son, had moved to the city around eight months ago, he said.
The SHO added that there were also reports that Sakina’s family had reached an “understanding” and they had also visited them in the city around a month ago.
He said that Sakina’s brother had also been seen shopping with the couple in the Ghaghar Phatak area on Tuesday.
However, it appeared that the relatives had not truly resolved their differences with the couple as preliminary investigations revealed the triple murder was allegedly carried out by Sakina’s relatives, the SHO said.
The police were awaiting for legal heirs to lodge an FIR and initiate formal legal proceedings.
Meanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and ordered an immediate inquiry and the arrest of the killers, said a spokesperson.
Separately, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar also ordered an inquiry to ascertain every possible aspect of the gruesome murder and the immediate arrest of the killers.
The home minister also directed that peace in the area be ensured, the spokesperson added.

These grievances surfaced during a public hearing held by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), on the Central Power Purchasing Agency’s (CPPA) request for a Rs8.7bn refund — equal to 65 paise per unit — to consumers due to lower-than-expected fuel costs in June. Nepra members Amina Ahmed and Anwar Maqsood Khan presided over the session.
Several industrialists, referencing a recent meeting with Field Marshal Asim Munir, lamented that the prime minister’s announcement in March of Rs7.41 per unit tariff relief was not time-bound, yet its impact had dwindled. The actual reduction now stands at just Rs1.15 per unit in base tariff terms. As a result, applicable power rates have surged from around Rs30 per unit to Rs34-35 from July onwards.
Amir Shaikh, a Lahore-based businessman, said a promised Rs1.71 per unit reduction — based on an additional Rs10 per litre petroleum levy — should have remained intact since the levy is still being collected. “Even the gas levy on captive power plants was meant to lower power tariffs, but this hasn’t been implemented,” he said.

Leaders warn of industrial shutdowns as power tariffs rise to Rs35 per unit despite earlier relief promises

He told the hearing that during discussions with the field marshal, the business community had pointed out that power rates fell to Rs29-30 per unit following the prime minister’s announcement, but have since climbed to Rs35. This contradicts the Special Investment Facilitation Council’s (SIFC) commitment to reduce industrial power tariffs to 9 cents (around Rs25 per unit) in the current fiscal year.
“Instead of a reduction from Rs29 to Rs25, rates have risen back to Rs34-35, or 11-12 cents per unit,” said Mr Shaikh. He urged the government to acknowledge this reversal and adopt corrective measures.
He also highlighted that the inclusion of fertiliser subsidies in RLNG pricing was making electricity generation more expensive. “The industrial sector is already on the brink, and these hikes could push it into over-closure,” he warned. He further questioned whether the Power Division’s promise to abolish the 1.5pc electricity duty from July 1 had been officially implemented, though no government representative responded.
A representative from the FPCCI and a Karachi-based industrialist said that falling demand from the national grid — driven by the rapid adoption of solar energy — had improved the financial outlook of distribution companies. As solar generation replaces expensive fossil fuel-based power, it also helps cut transmission losses, especially in high-loss areas.
“The real efficiency gains in Discos are coming from solarisation,” he said, noting that this transition is reducing both fuel costs and technical losses.
Karachi-based businessman Arif Bilwani criticised the government’s failure to follow through on its promises regarding renegotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs). “There was a lot of hype about cheaper electricity from revised IPP contracts, but none of it has materialised,” he said, adding that it appears as though the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum and the 747MW Guddu power plants have been effectively written off.
Responding to the concerns, CPPA CEO Rehan Akhtar said the energy mix in June was broadly in line with expectations and that overall fuel costs were slightly lower than reference projections. He said this minor saving resulted in negative fuel cost adjustments, partly due to the retirement of older, inefficient government-owned plants.
Regarding Neelum-Jhelum, Mr Akhtar confirmed that the plant would remain non-operational for about two years due to technical issues identified in a recent study.
He said the negative fuel cost adjustment reaching consumers would amount to 15 paisa per unit, factoring in the 65 paisa negative adjustment in August, replacing June’s 50 paisa adjustment.
Mr Akhtar added that power consumption in June was 2pc higher than the same month last year and 7.6pc more than in May 2025. Total electricity delivered to distribution companies stood at 13,310 gigawatt hours (GWh), up from 12,367 GWh in May and 13,071 GWh in June 2024.
He said average fuel cost for June 2025 was Rs7.68 per unit, down from Rs9.25 in June last year, against a reference cost of Rs8.33 per unit.

Traders, affiliated with Pakistan-China trade through Khunjerab Pass, have been protesting at the Sost Dry Port and blocking the Karakoram Highway, the land route between Pakistan and China, demanding an end to what they call federal taxes on goods imported from China.
The protests, which have paralysed trade and travel through the Khunjerab Pass, began over what traders describe as discriminatory FBR policies and the non-clearance of consignments imported from China.
Protesters are demanding exemption for GB residents from paying sales tax, income tax, and other federal taxes on goods imported from China.

Pakistan-China trade and travel suspended; thousands of travellers stranded, including Chinese nationals

In response, a notification issued by the FBR announced the committee’s formation to addr­ess the “tax grievances of people of Gilgit Baltistan”.
According to the notification, the committee will “evaluate the grievances of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on the issue of charging of sales tax, income tax and federal excise duty on import of goods from China through Khunjerab Pass for consumption in Gilgit-Baltistan.”
The seven-member committee comprises the member customs (operations), member-IR (policy), director general (R&A), the GB secretary of finance, the chief collector (north) and the chief IR (policy).
The committee’s mandate is to examine the levy of taxes on goods meant for consumption within GB’s territorial jurisdiction.
It is also tasked with devising a “transparent implementation mechanism” for any available exemptions and suggesting “robust checks against misuse of any exemption”.
Additionally, the committee will identify the HS codes and quantify the annual quantities needed for local consumption within GB, keeping in view per capita import of such goods for the rest of the country.
It will also consider mechanisms for clearance of baggage at Sost and enforcement measures at Khunjerab Pass to ensure consumption of exempted goods in GB only.
The committee will consult with local stakeholders to weigh different options, including the collection of duties and taxes on behalf of the GB government, and is expected to submit its report within seven days.
Due to protests, thousands of passengers scheduled to travel to China through Khunjerab Pass remain stranded as transportation via the pass has been suspended for a third day.
Many Chinese nationals who planned to travel to Xinjiang province through Khunjerab Pass have also staged a protest sit-in in Sost town, demanding to be allowed to travel.

The committee meeting held on Wednesday was chaired by Senator Attaur Rehman, and featured heated discussions on mismanagement faced during Haj 2024, and the issue faced by Shia pilgrims.
The committee discussed the ban imposed on pilgrims intending to travel by land route to Karbala (Iraq) via Iran to take part in Arbaeen rituals.
MWM Senator Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, who is also a member of the committee, emphasised that the protection of pilgrims’ religious rights is the fundamental responsibility of the government, and that matters of worship fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Religious Affairs and not the Ministry of Interior.

Religious Affairs secy says govt exploring options of ‘alternative route’ by sea; panel demands removal of Saudi Arabia-based DG Haj over ‘mismanagement’

He said the interior ministers of Iran, Iraq, and Pakistan recently reached an understanding to facilitate pilgrims willing to travel by land and by air to holy places in Iraq and Iran.
Senator Abbas warned that maintaining restrictions on pilgrims’ travel to Iraq by land route would result in the loss of people’s money of at least Rs50 billion.
 
 

The secretary of the Religious Affairs ministry informed the committee that talks were continuing on alternative routes, including via sea, but expressed security concerns over the Afghanistan route. He, however, assured the committee that all possible facilities would be provided to pilgrims.
Senator Abbas opposed the alternative route idea of the secretary of religious affairs, adding that at this stage, if a new alternative route is adopted, it would place an additional burden of Rs48 billion on the pilgrims intending to visit Iraq.
He said the government had not taken the committee into confidence regarding the tour operators’ policy.
In response, Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf assured the Senate committee that consultations would be held and that all concerns would be addressed.
Haj mismanagement
The report of sub-committee related to mismanagement during Haj 2024 was presented by the convener of the sub-committee, Senator Aun Abbas.
The report of the sub-committee exposed severe lapses in coordination between the ministry of religious affairs and the Haj Organisers Association of Pakistan (HOAP).
Senator Aun Abbas also expressed concern over the DG Haj’s three-year tenure, alleging that he wielded exceptional authority in the affairs of the pilgrimage.
Senator Bushra Anjum Butt, member of the sub-committee, raised the issue of overseas Pakistanis who were misled by private Haj operators until the departure of the final Haj flight. She condemned this act and said this is damaging the image of Pakistanis abroad.
The third member of the sub-committee, Senator Danesh Kumar, criticised the Religious Affairs ministry for the lapse of quota of 64,000 Haj pilgrims and recommended to fix the responsibility over the culprits.
He termed such acts criminal and demanded strict disciplinary action against people involved in such a heinous activity.
The report also highlighted that the current procurement committee followed a controversial approach in awarding the ‘Mashaer Services’ tender to Al-Rajhi Tawafa Company, instead of adopting a transparent and competitive bidding process and it entered into direct negotiations with Tawafa companies.
The Senate panel recommended the government to immediately remove the DG Haj, based in Saudi Arabia and appoint an Arabic-speaking officer familiar with Saudi systems.
The committee further demanded audit of Al-Rajhi contract by the Auditor General of Pakistan and dissolution of the current procurement committee.

• New building codes for all new structures with more than 4 floors; rainwater systems mandatory for residential, commercial & industrial structures
• Ex-mill sugar rate fixed at Rs165/kg, retail price at Rs173/kg
ISLAMABAD: The federal cabinet on Wednesday took several key decisions, including the approval of Haj Policy for 2026, National Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy and the Green Building Code of Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif fixed ex-mill rate and retail price of sugar at Rs165 and Rs173 per kilogram, respectively, amid the nationwide shortage of the commodity.
Presided over by PM Shehbaz, the cabinet approved the Haj Policy for the next year, allocating a 70 per cent quota to the government and 30pc to private operators. Notably, private companies that failed to fulfill their responsibilities in the previous year will now be required to accommodate affected individuals in 2026.
The meeting approved third-party validation for all Haj operations, real-time monitoring of payments and application processes under private operators, mandatory minimum of 2,000 pilgrims per private company, 1,000 seats reserved for hardship cases, enha­nced digital tools including Pak Haj mobile app, digital wristbands, and mobile SIMs for better tracking and service delivery, transparent selection of assistants through competitive testing, emer­g­e­ncy compensation mechanisms and upgraded lodging and food arrangements.
National AI Policy
In another major decision, the cabinet unanimously approved the National AI Policy 2025 to create a complete AI ecosystem in Pakistan.
The policy aims to democratise access to artificial intelligence, enhance public services, and open up new employment and innovation avenues.
“Our youth are Pakistan’s greatest asset. Providing them with education, skills, and equal opportunities in AI is a top priority,” said the prime minister.
The AI policy outlines to train 1 million AI professionals by 2030, establish an AI Innovation Fund and AI Venture Fund to boost private sector involvement, create 50,000 AI-driven civic projects and 1,000 local AI products in the next five years, distribute 3,000 annual AI scholarships.
 
 

Additi­onally, it aims to facilitate 1,000 research projects, promote inclusion of women and differently-abled individuals through accessible education and financing, strengthen cybersecurity and national data security protocols, promote global partnerships and compliance with international AI regulations.
However, an AI Council and a comprehensive Master Plan and Action Matrix will oversee the policy’s implementation.
The cabinet also ratified decisions made in earlier sessions of the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and the Committee on Legislative Business, held on July 8, 17, and 25, respectively.
Building codes
The federal cabinet also approved the Green Building Code of Pakistan (GBCP) and the Rainwater Harvesting Provisions for Building Code of Pakistan.
These new national standards will ensure green, energy-efficient and water-conserving buildings.
The GBCP applies to all new buildings, with four plus floors, emphasising energy conservation, solar design, green roofs, energy efficient lighting, and integration of renewable energy sources etc.
 
 

It mandates the use of eco-friendly materials and Building Information Modeling (BIM) for efficient building management, significantly reducing energy consumption and enhancing indoor environmental quality.
The Rainwater Harvesting Code applies to residential, commercial and industrial buildings, mandating systems to collect, filter, and reuse rainwater.
This initiative aims to address Pakistan’s escalating water scarcity by promoting groundwater recharge and reducing dependency on municipal water supplies.
The codes, now approved as Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) Bye-Laws, align with the United Nations Sustainable Devel­op­m­ent Goals (SDGs).
They represent a pivotal move toward sustainable, climate-resilient infrastructure and will be greatly beneficial for a greener, energy efficient and more climate-resilient Pakistan, improving better quality of life for Pakistani citizens as well as the planet.
Sugar price
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif warned that any violation of the agreed sugar prices will lead to severe action as no one would be allowed to exploit the public economically.
The premier, chairing a meeting, underscored the government’s commitment to ensuring fair prices and protecting citizens from economic exploitation.
The PM issued strict directives for the enforcement of the agreement reached between the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and the government.
 
 

According to the agreement, the ex-mill price of sugar is set at Rs165 per kilogram, while the retail price must not exceed Rs173 per kilogram.
The officials also briefed the PM on ongoing operations against those involved in creating an artificial shortage of sugar.
The government reiterated its resolve to continue crackdown on hoarders and manipulators in the market.

Additionally, a two-kilometer stretch of the main road and a three-kilometer water channel serving a powerhouse were affected, as well as numerous livestock, cattle sheds, and 18 irrigation channels.
 
 

The floodwaters also struck eight motorcycles and six cars.  The flood also damaged the water channel for the main power station and disrupted telephone and mobile networks in the area.
Many affected families have been shifted to safer areas while officials have begun assessing the damages.
A complete assessment of the disaster will be possible in the coming days, officials said.
“The communication is cut off; therefore, it is difficult to know the damages,” Yaqoob Tai, a local resident of Ghizer, told Dawn.
Experts said GB has experienced unprecedented disasters this year, noting that the frequency of cloudburst-triggered floods, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and rapid glacier melting has increased.
At least 10 people have died and 12 tourists have gone missing in various recent events across the region.
The Babusar valley and Thore in Diamer have been the worst-hit areas.
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Depart­m­e­­nt issued an alert warning of more potential flooding.
The department said a wet spell is likely to affect GB in the current week, with scattered rain, thunderstorms and isolated heavy falls expected.
It warned that the weather increases the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in the region’s vulnerable glaciated areas.
The PMD suggested all concerned authorities “remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation”.

On Tuesday, the Bajaur administration imposed a three-day curfew in several places in the district as an operation against militants was launched in the areas, prompting a fiery response from the CM.
CM Gandapur, who has been opposed to the idea of fresh military operations in the province, said in a heavily-edited video message iss­u­ed after the KP apex committee meeting that the for­ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as “guests” and with respect.
 






He pointed out that militants tend to take shelter in residential areas, from where they targeted the security forces, while retaliation by the forces to root them out results in collateral damage.
“They are doing this to create distrust between the people and the armed forces. This is why we need to expel them from our cities. We will not tolerate their presence in populated areas.”
He said the militants would not be allowed to hide inside residential areas and action would be taken against them and their facilitators. He emphasised that public support was essential in the fight against terrorism and praised the police and the security forces for their role in eradicating terrorism.
Jirgas from Aug 2
CM Gandapur also said that jirgas at the divisional level would start on August 2, with all stakeholders coming together to alleviate people’s reservations and concerns.
“Following these jirgas, there will be a grand jirga, where we will present our policy, a plan and future steps and discuss it with stakeholders and government officials,” he said, while expressing his opposition to any major offensive that could lead to mass displacement. He, however, reiterated that action would be taken in case militants were present in any area. He said their strategy would also ensure that no collateral damage would occur.
 
 

“In order to avoid any damages while eliminating militancy, we will go with the action plan which will not cause any loss to life and property,” he said.
The CM blamed the ‘enemy countries’ for conspiring against Pakistan as well as orchestrating deliberate campaigns to sow distrust between the government, the public, and the security forces, saying the “conspiracy must be exposed and countered”.
‘Concerted efforts’
Separately, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s Secretariat read that the meeting agreed that public trust must be secured to effectively counter militancy. The participants underscored the need for enhanced coordination among civil administration, police, security forces, and intelligence agencies to carry out decisive operations.
It read that during the meeting, the participants unanimously acknowledged that militancy had become a threat that could only be eliminated through concerted efforts by the government, the public, and state institutions. They noted that militants were a common enemy and all stakeholders desired their elimination, the statement read.
The meeting, chaired by CM Gandapur, was also attended by Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, KP police chief Zulfiqar Hameed, Additional Chief Secretary Abid Majeed, Peshawar’s Corps Commander Lieutenant General Syed Omer Ahmad Bukhari, lawmakers from the merged districts, and senior government officials.
‘U-turn’ on operation
The video statement on Wednesday came in complete contrast to the one issued by CM Gandapur on Tuesday night following a PTI parliamentary meeting, in which he vowed to take stringent measures, such as the withdrawal of the Action in Aid of Civil Power Regulations 2011.
He had said the KP Assembly would discuss if the armed forces’ presence in the province under the said ordinance had borne fruitful results or harmed trust between people and the armed forces.
“The KP government, workers of founder PTI Imran Khan, stand by the people and we will go to any extent. I direct all the deputy commissioners not to impose curfew unless permitted by the KP home department,” CM Gandapur had said in his fiery video message. He said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district, adding that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces.
 
 

Though the CM took a U-turn, his party, the ruling PTI, denounced the Bajaur operation, alleging that the decision bypassed the constitutionally elected government and it was nothing but a “dangerous replay of past mistakes”.
PTI opposes operation
PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, in a statement on Wednesday, lambasted the government for “squandering” the hard-won peace.
He urged the government to recognise the growing anger and resentment among the people of KP. “This repetition of failed strategies while expecting different outcomes is the height of strategic insanity,” he said, adding, “Such reckless actions will only deepen the alienation of an already traumatised and marginalised population, with catastrophic consequences for both this government and the nation’s stability.”
