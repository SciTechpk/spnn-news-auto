Authorities have arrested 11 people in connection with the city’s worst blaze in nearly 80 years as they investigate possible corruption and the use of unsafe materials during renovations at the Wang Fuk Court complex.
Rescue operations at the site in the district of Tai Po, near the border with mainland China, concluded on Friday, though police say they may find more bodies as they search the burnt-out buildings as part of ongoing investigations.
The fire started on Wednesday afternoon and rapidly engulfed seven of the eight 32-storey blocks at the complex, which were wrapped in bamboo scaffolding and green mesh and layered with foam insulation for the renovations.
Search For Bodies Continues
Authorities have said the fire alarms at the estate, home to more than 4,600 people, had not been working properly.
Hong Kong leader John Lee, other officials and civil servants, all dressed in black, stood in silence for three minutes early on Saturday outside the central government offices, where flags were lowered to half-mast.
Condolence books have been set up at 18 points around the former British colony for the public to pay their respects.
“Our most heartfelt thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones and with those that are now living with shock and uncertainty,” Britain’s King Charles said in a statement about the “appalling tragedy”.
At Wang Fuk Court, police officers from the disaster victim identification unit, wearing white overalls, helmets and oxygen masks, entered one of the charred buildings to continue their search for remains.
They climbed over mounds of bamboo scaffolding that had fallen during the disaster and around large puddles of water created after firemen doused the buildings for days to try to lower the temperatures inside.
Families and mourners gathered to lay flowers while some faced the grim task of looking at photographs of the dead taken by rescue workers.
Authorities said on Friday that only 39 of the 128 dead had been identified.



Hong Kong’s Lee has said the government would set up a HK$300 million ($40m) fund to help residents while some of China’s biggest listed companies have pledged donations.
Hundreds of volunteers have also mobilised to help the victims, sorting and distributing items from nappies to hot food.
They formed teams to collect, transport and distribute goods in round-the-clock shifts and have set up a sprawling support camp for displaced residents beside a shopping mall across from the complex.
Domestic workers from Indonesia and the Philippines were also caught up in the tragedy.
Hong Kong has around 368,000 such workers, mostly women from low-income Asian countries who live with their employers, often in cramped spaces.
Indonesia said six of its citizens died in the incident.
The Philippines said one of its nationals is critically injured, another is confirmed missing, and 28 are thought to be residents of the area but their whereabouts are unknown.
Deadliest Blaze Since 1948
The fire is Hong Kong’s deadliest since 1948, when 176 people died in a warehouse blaze, and has prompted comparisons to London’s Grenfell Tower inferno, which killed 72 people in 2017.
Residents of Wang Fuk Court were told by authorities last year that they faced “relatively low fire risks” after complaining repeatedly about fire hazards posed by ongoing renovation, the city’s Labour Department told Reuters.
The residents had raised concerns in September 2024, including about the potential flammability of the protective green mesh contractors had used to cover the bamboo scaffolding, a department spokesperson said.
Hong Kong’s anti-graft body said it had arrested eight people on Friday including an engineering consultant, a scaffolding subcontractor and an intermediary.
Earlier, police arrested two directors and an engineering consultant of Prestige Construction, a firm identified by the government as doing maintenance on Wang Fuk Court for more than a year, on suspicion of manslaughter for using unsafe materials, including flammable foam boards blocking windows. Prestige did not answer repeated calls for comment.
Public anger over the fire has so far been muted, a stark contrast to mass pro-democracy protests of 2019 that prompted Beijing to tighten its grip on the city.
Yet some frustrated volunteers handed out flyers near the estate on Friday, demanding proper resettlement of affected residents, an overhaul of government oversight of construction projects, and an independent probe into the blaze.
As with other major fire incidents like Grenfell, analysts say pressure for answers may quickly spread beyond the construction firms to government regulators.
The Hong Kong government has traditionally staged open inquiries into large-scale tragedies, often headed by an independent judge.</p><small>2025-11-29 06:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/291100288a8174f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958139/egypts-foreign-minister-due-in-pakistan-today-on-2-day-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Egypt’s foreign minister due in Pakistan today on 2-day visit</strong></a><br><p>Egypt Foreign Minister Badr Ahmed Mohamed Abdelatty will arrive in Pakistan today on an official two-day visit, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Saturday.
In a statement, the FO said Abdelatty was undertaking the visit at the invitation of Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar.
“The visit reflects the longstanding and cordial relations between Pakistan and Egypt, grounded in common faith, cultural affinity, and shared perspectives on regional and international issues,” it said.







The FO further stated that the visit “will contribute to further strengthening the strategic direction of Pakistan–Egypt relations and placing them on a broader trajectory, with a focus on political, economic, defence, cultural, and people-to-people cooperation”.
It said that Abdelatty will hold a “tête-à-tête meeting and delegation-level talks” with his Pakistani counterpart.
“The two sides will review the full range of bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and international developments, including the situation in Gaza,” the FO said.
His visit is “expected to reinforce Pakistan–Egypt cooperation and further advance the longstanding partnership between the two brotherly countries.”
In May, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi had reaffirmed Egypt’s desire for stronger bilateral ties with Pakistan in a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
In October, PM Shehbaz, along with FM Dar, had visited Egypt for a crucial peace summit on Gaza in Sharm el-Sheikh, joining a host of world leaders for the signing of the ceasefire agreement.
Later the same month, Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir had visited the country and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to improved defence and military cooperation with Egypt.</p><small>2025-11-29 06:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636299-pakistan-reaffirms-support-for-palestinian-self-determination-on-solidarity-day' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan reaffirms support for Palestinian self-determination on solidarity day</strong></a><br><p>

A team of NCCIA produced the journalist before the magistrate at district courts and sought his physical remand for 30 days. The investigating officer said physical custody of the suspect was required for the recovery of social media accounts and completion of investigation.
A counsel for the suspect opposed the remand request, saying the journalist was illegally offloaded and arrested from Islamabad airport when he was going abroad to attend a United Nations conference.
He said the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) told a court in Islamabad that there was no case registered against the journalist. But later he was booked in the cybercrime case.
The counsel argued that there was a delay of 24 hours in the production of the suspect before the court. He said the suspect had not committed any offence. He pointed out that the alleged derogatory remarks were made by PTI activist Sanam Javed, who was a guest in a programme hosted by the journalist for a digital media channel.

 

In his order, Magistrate Naeem Wattoo noted that the record shows that the suspect is nominated in the FIR registered on Aug 5 and an inquiry has been decided against him.
He said the suspect was even declared a proclaimed offender after obtaining arrest warrants from the court.
“Therefore, it cannot be said that this case was registered for justifying his arrest on alleged offloading,” the magistrate held in his order, approving a four-day physical remand of the journalist.
The magistrate directed the NCCIA to produce the suspect again on Dec 2.

Information Minister Atta Tarar’s assertion prompted an indignant response from the PTI, which maintains that their court-decreed schedule of meetings — on Tuesdays and Thursdays — is not being honoured.
In separate remarks, Parliamentary Secretary Barrister Danyal Chaudhry also termed the KP CM’s demand “to seek political guidance from a convicted individual… a clear violation of prison laws”.
But what does the jail manual actually say about prisoners’ visitation rights, and do political prisoners enjoy more leeway than others? These and other ancillary questions have doubtless popped up in the minds of many observers.

Visitation, phone calls allowed to prisoners are linked to their ‘good behaviour’, meaning the jail superintendent has the discretion to allow or disallow meetings

Former and current prison officials Dawn spoke to said that all prisoners in Punjab’s jails — including political prisoners — are allowed meetings with five people per week, including their lawyers and relatives. In addition, they are allowed 30 minutes of phone time per week.
Even condemned prisoners are eligible to meet their lawyers and family members once a week, along with 30 minutes of phone time, which is exercised through the several public call offices (PCOs) that are operational in Adiala jail.

 

Officials say jail authorities have the ability to conduct ‘automatic monitoring’ of prisoners’ phone conversations, so they can listen to any communication made by any prisoner, when necessary.
In addition, political prisoners are kept in special cells under strict security, and their medical check-up is supposed to be conducted on a daily basis to ensure that they are in good health.
‘Subjective’ rules
However, the rules stipulate that these meetings are linked to the “prisoner’s behaviour”, i.e. their obedience to prison rules, making their enforcement necessarily subjective.
According to officials, certain serious offenses, such as terrorism and involvement in anti-state activities, could render an inmate ineligible for these provisions.
A retired senior officer from the prison department told Dawn that according to the rules, the decision whether or not to allow an incarcerated or under trial prisoner access to his/her lawyers or relatives was at the discretion of the concerned jail superintendent.
If the incarcerated prisoner’s behaviour is ‘not good’, it will be up to the jail authorities to disallow meetings or telephonic conversations.

 

In addition, the visitation rights of any prisoners, especially political ones, can be suspended if the government apprehends unrest or a law and order situation.
This could be a major stumbling block for the PTI, as prison authorities have repeatedly complained about the conduct of Mr Khan’s visitors, especially taking issue with the press conferences that Aleema Khan or others hold after meeting with the incarcerated party founder.
In recent weeks, these have often culminated in sit-ins and protests outside the prison, which the jail authorities could cite as a potential law and order risk.
In his remarks, Barrister Danyal Chaudhry maintained that jail meetings are only possible under judicial orders. However, the PTI maintains that in spite of a court-ordered meeting schedule, jail authorities were arbitrarily disallowing meetings with the inmate.
However, PM’s aide Senator Rana Sanaullah seemed to strike a softer note, voicing his support for meetings between incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan and his family members, albeit subject to certain conditions.
“There should be permission for meetings and they should definitely take place, but a 90-minute press conference cannot take place after an hour’s meeting; no law allows this,” he told Geo News on Friday.
Past precedent
One official said that many political prisoners — like PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, his daughter Maryam Nawaz and son-in-law Safdar Awan — had availed the telephone facility during their imprisonment, thanks to ‘good behaviour’.
The PML-N leader used to keep a stopwatch with him while talking to his family members or others to monitor the time, he recalled.

 

In addition, a seasoned journalist who had visited several political prisoners in different jails across the country in the past — such as Javed Hashmi and ex-PM Yousuf Raza Gilani — said that visitors were only allowed to meet prisoners with their consent.
He explained that, on scheduled meeting days, prisoners generally provide the jail authorities with a list of their guests or visitors, which is then scrutinised and approved by the jail superintendent.
At times, the journalist recalled, they had to identify themselves as “family members” or “a friend of the prisoner” to avoid being denied access.
Party infighting over who controls the all-important list, which contains the names of those who would be allowed to meet the prisoner has also not helped the PTI’s cause, as Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and Barrister Ali Zafar have previously found themselves at odds over the issue.

According to The Guardian, the autopen, which was patented in the US in 1803, is a robotic device that replicates signatures of a person using real ink.
The decision comes amid a broader political offensive, including renewed attacks on immigration and personal criticism of Biden.
Trump has often sought to drum up outrage over Biden’s alleged use of autopen to sign pardons, executive orders and other documents — accusing Biden of being too senile to govern while in power.
In a post on his social media platform Truth Social on Friday, Trump wrote: “Any document signed by Sleepy Joe Biden with the Autopen, which was approximately 92 per cent of them, is hereby terminated, and of no further force or effect.”







“The Autopen is not allowed to be used if approval is not specifically given by the President of the United States,” he said.
Trump insisted that “the Radical Left Lunatics circling Biden around the beautiful Resolute Desk in the Oval Office took the Presidency away from him”.
“I am hereby cancelling all Executive Orders, and anything else that was not directly signed by Crooked Joe Biden, because the people who operated the Autopen did so illegally,” he said.
He claimed that “Joe Biden was not involved in the Autopen process and, if he says he was, he will be brought up on charges of perjury”.
The autopen is widely accepted in Washington as an administrative tool, but Trump has said their use under Biden proves the then-president was mentally incapacitated and not in control of the White House.
Biden was 82 when he left office, while Trump is 79 and due to leave office in January 2029.
Previous presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower and Gerald Ford to Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden have all used the device for routine correspondence, and in some cases for urgent legislation while travelling.
Obama famously used the autopen in 2011 to sign an extension of the Patriot Act while abroad, and George W. Bush also relied on it extensively for letters, condolence messages, and routine certifications.
For decades, the device has been considered a practical convenience, not a constitutional issue.
In 2005, the US Department of Justice issued a legal opinion confirming that a president’s approval, rather than physical signing, is what validates executive actions.
Legal and political implications
Trump’s declaration challenges long-standing legal precedent.
In US administrative law, the validity of a presidential action rests on intent and approval, not the method of signature. Courts have consistently upheld this principle for decades.
Legal experts say that without concrete evidence that Biden did not authorise the documents, Trump’s blanket cancellation order is likely to face immediate judicial scrutiny.
Federal agencies, still bound by the Administrative Procedure Act, could be caught in uncertainty over which rules remain valid.
If courts rule that autopen signatures are legally equivalent to handwritten ones, many of Trump’s cancellations could be struck down.
Politically, the move reinforces Trump’s effort to delegitimise the previous administration and consolidate power in the Oval Office.
It mirrors his public vow to “take back control from the Deep State” and forms part of a broader strategy to dismantle Biden-era policies on immigration, climate, education, workplace rules, and foreign aid.
Democrats have criticised the move as a manufactured legal crisis, while Republicans argue it corrects a “procedural abuse”.
Congressional Democrats are expected to challenge the decision through hearings and potential legislation.
Impact on foreign relations
The cancellations could also affect US relations abroad, creating uncertainty over the validity of executive actions.
Biden-era commitments — including climate cooperation, refugee resettlement, student visas, trade facilitation, and security coordination — may now face ambiguity.
Diplomatic observers note that foreign governments may seek clarifications about bilateral agreements and cooperative frameworks.
Officials in Washington have expressed concern that retroactively voiding executive actions could undermine long-term confidence in US policy continuity, with implications for allies and partners, including countries like Pakistan, where immigration and visa matters are of direct concern.
Trump’s focus on the autopen highlights the highly personalised and confrontational nature of current US politics.
While the immediate legal effect of his actions remains uncertain, the decision adds to domestic political polarisation and introduces potential disruption in international relations.

Additional input from AFP</p><small>2025-11-29 05:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/29095027510dd6a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958008/punjab-introduces-major-reforms-in-traffic-act' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab introduces major reforms in Traffic Act</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Punjab government has introduced 20 major reforms in the 60-year-old Traffic Act, aiming to bring about better traffic management in the province.
Under the new reforms, if any vehicle is repeatedly fined for violations, it will be auctioned.
“Government vehicles involved in the violation of traffic rules will face heavy penalties, as no one is above law,” Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz said in a meeting here on Friday.







A briefing was given on a modern traffic management system, road safety measures, and submission of challan reports regarding use of helmet, rooftop passengers, and other violations.
A 30-day grace period was granted to eliminate one-way violations across Punjab.
“U-turns will be redesigned to make roads safer and more organised. It was agreed that compensation (Diyat) must be provided immediately to the families of those who die in accidents.”
Marriage halls will not be allowed to operate without proper parking arrangements, ensuring parking is mandatory.
A decisive crackdown will be launched to end underage driving. “In case of underage driving, the vehicle owner may face imprisonment of up to six months,” the meeting was told.







A province-wide crackdown has been ordered to end the practice of passengers riding on bus rooftops.
“For traffic improvement and public safety, motorcycle rickshaws will be completely banned on five model roads in Lahore.”
The CM gave a 30-day deadline to the traffic department to improve Lahore’s traffic situation.
She said: “Vehicles travelling to other cities will face an action if found speeding to reach destinations faster. The traffic situation must be improved in Lahore and all other cities within a month. No exemptions will be allowed as every offender will have to pay fines. I am giving the traffic police last chance to perform otherwise we will have to create a new department.”
She said traffic violations and persistent chaotic traffic were equivalent to weakening the writ of the state.

Seemingly without any formal announcement or warning, its officials recently started deplaning or denying boarding to passengers travelling abroad.
When affected citizens started to raise a hue and cry on social media, the agency, instead of clarifying its position or explaining the rationale behind its actions, which were allegedly causing losses to the tune of hundreds of thousands to affected travellers, initiated a sweeping crackdown on social media accounts through the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency, accusing them of “systematic and baseless propaganda” that was intended to spread “provincial hatred”.

 

It seemed like a bit of an overreaction. If the FIA felt that it was justified in its campaign to prevent suspicious individuals from travelling abroad, then it need only have issued an explanatory statement to dismiss the “propaganda”. Most of the reasons eventually provided seemed understandable, even if not reasonable. These could have been shared earlier so that travellers were also better prepared.
The FIA has said passengers were only being denied boarding if they had incomplete or fraudulent travel documents, had provided “suspicious or unclear information”, or if they were suspected of “being under the influence of human traffickers or illegal agents”. The first reason seems reasonable enough to the extent that a traveller’s basic documents, like visas and passports, must always be in order.

 

However, the other reasons provided are less so, especially as they are not referenced to any hard rules or laws and seem open to interpretation. What is ‘suspicious’ or ‘unclear’ information? What does “being under the influence of human traffickers” even mean?
Unless some rules are established and publicised, the agency would be well-advised to proceed with caution. It must not harass travellers based on mere suspicion. Not every individual will come up to its standards of an ‘ideal traveller’. Those who do not, should not be treated as criminals.

Leading the charge on a point of order, Leader of the Opposition Ali Khurshidi of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan decried the heavy traffic fines and demanded that a house committee be formed to address the issue.

 

He said that the decision to impose heavy fines through the faceless e-ticketing system was made in a great haste. “Bike riders are [mostly] poor people; how can they pay challans worth thousands of rupees?” he asked.
He said that Karachi was among the three worst cities in the world with a dilapidated civic infrastructure. “The fines should be reduced,” he demanded.

Home minister agrees to opposition leader’s proposal regarding formation of house body to review hefty challans

Mr Khurshidi also expressed concern over the absence of traffic police on city roads and said that it’s an “organised conspiracy” leading to traffic jams.
Responding to Mr Khurshidi’s point of order, Home Minister Zia Lanjar insisted that the government’s intention was to improve traffic conditions and save lives.
Giving a cautious response over his reservations on heavy fines through e-challan system, he said that the government’s goal was to benefit the people of Karachi and improve traffic conditions.
He said that the new system aimed to reduce accidents and traffic jams. He emphasised the importance of the use of helmet and said that people riding motorcycles without helmet are being fined for Rs2,500.
Mr Lanjar said that the city’s traffic system was improved after the implementation of the new system.
He said that a staggering Rs710 million in pending e-challans remained uncollected. “The government’s stance is clear: first-time offenders can expect leniency with an apology, but repeat offenders will face double the penalty,” he added.
The minister agreed to the opposition leader’s proposal regarding formation of a house committee to address concerns and meet with traffic administration, inviting opposition input.
Call attention notices
In his call attention notice, MQM-P lawmaker Sabir Qaimkhani drew attention to the fact that toll tax was also being collected from local citizens of Hyderabad at the Detha Toll Plaza on Mirpurkhas Road.
Parliamentary Secretary for Works and Services Department Farrukh Shah said that there were orders of the Supreme Court that tax should not be collected from villages within five kilometres of any toll plaza. “If tax is being collected from the residents of local villages, we will take action,” he assured the MQM-P lawmaker.

This week, just as Ame­ricans were rushing to travel for the Thanksgiving holiday, a shooting took place at a metro station close to the White House.
It is alleged that Lakanwal, who had travelled thousands of kilometres from his home in Washington state, shot a female member of the National Guard, who died later, and a male guardsman. Other Natio­­nal Guard members shot and injured Lak­anwal, ending the attack. Nati­onal Guard members have been deployed in Wash­ing­ton, D.C. since the past several weeks on the orders of President Donald Trump to address what he has called a “crime emergency”.
Reports reveal that 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who entered the US in 2021 through the Operation Allies Welcome initiative, was granted asylum this year. He had worked with the CIA in Afghanistan before the Taliban returned to power. This fact is of no use to the Trump administration that has pounced on the attack as a means of questioning the entry of Afghan refugees fleeing Taliban rule into the US.

 

In the hours after the attack, officials of the Trump administration, such as FBI director Kash Patel, alleged that thousands of refugees had been admitted to the US under the Biden administration and questioned the vetting process. In fact, refugees and visa holders coming to the US undergo thorough vetting. Politically, this spin on the unfortunate and tragic attack has provided Trump an opportunity to reinforce his anti-immigrant rhetoric — a welcome break for a beleaguered administration under criticism for its poor economic numbers.
In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Trump stated: “We must now re-examine every single alien who has entered our country from Afghanistan under Biden, and we must take all necessary measures to ensure the removal of any alien from any country who does not belong here, or add benefits to our country.” He said, “If they can’t love our country we don’t want them.”

Trump has been given an opportunity to reinforce his myopic stance.

The crackdown then proceeded swiftly. In a post on X, the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service announced that “processing of all immigration requests relating to Afghan nationals is stopped indefinitely… .”
Media reports say the pause is likely to affect all Afghan nationals trying to stay in the US by seeking asylum or even through a green card. It will even affect Afghans who helped the US in its 20-year war in Afghanistan. Many of them remain stuck in third countries waiting for their visas to be processed through the Special Immig­rant Visa programme, one of the few pathways left for Afghan refugees who were promised safety in the US for their role in the war.

 

On Thursday, Trump posted on his Truth Social platform: “I will permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to fully recover.”
The crackdown on immigrants has been the centrepiece of this administration’s highly visible and intentionally horrific actions since day one. The attack — while tragic — was not unlike many other shootings that take place daily in the US. But it has given the administration another argument to stop all immigration to the US particularly where it involves black and brown immigrants.
Just a few days before this announcement, the USCIS ordered that Haitians in the US, who enjoyed TPS or temporary protected status owing to the upheavals in that country, would no longer be able to avail it after early next year. The crackdown on Afg­hans (and there are rumours that this will extend to Som­­­ali refugees) fits in­to the larger Trump­i­­an vision of the Uni­ted States as a white and Christian nation.
The losers, of cou­r­se, are the Afghans who chose to side with the Americans and believed that their safety would be assured. This one act committed by one man — who may well be mentally ill rather than radicalised — is enough to doom them all.

 

Just as the colonists once did so too are the neo-colonists doing — abandoning their promises and rendering the sacrifices made for them worthless as they move on to new missions and forget old wars. This is particularly true given that the ascendance of the Taliban in Afghanistan is a constant reminder to the US that a two-decade war and trillions of dollars were largely a waste of resources and yielded no victory at all.
Thousands of Afghans and others will likely now never get to the US. In a seeming instant, their presence has been tainted, they have been labelled unwanted and they will once again have to find some way to fend for themselves in a hostile and xenophobic world.

KARACHI: After going underground in Pakistan as an illegal alien for 18 years, a 65-year-old Sri Lankan woman, will now be able to return home to her children in Colombo, thanks to concerted efforts by Edhi Foundation, Saylani Welfare Trust and human rights advocate Zia Ahmed Awan.
Speaking at a press conference at the Edhi headquarters at Meethadar on Friday, Rashina could not hold back her tears as she thanked all for coming to her aid. “I’m a poor woman. The government of Pakistan had imposed a 22 lac rupees fine on me for illegally overstaying in Pakistan. I didn’t even have money to pay for my return ticket to Sri Lanka, what to say of the heavy fine,” she said. “But God is great. God sent me help in all these people who made it possible for a destitute widow to reunite with her orphaned children,” she said.
Sharing her story, Rashina said that she is a born Muslim from Sri Lanka, who found employment as a telephone operator at a travel agency in Kuwait. It was there that she met Javed Iqbal of Mian Channu, Punjab. “We fell in love and got married. Later, we moved to Saudi Arabia where we lived for some 15 years. We have three children, two daughters, Mumtaz and Aneesha, and a son Mohammed Rafay,” she said.
In Saudi Arabia, later, when her husband lost his job, he desperately tried to find another but being unable to do so he was deported to Pakistan while Rashina was deported to Sri Lanka with their children. “Leaving my children in the care with my family in Colombo, I came to Pakistan on a visit visa to meet my husband in Mian Channu. But his family would not accept me. We left Punjab to come to Karachi where we found a small rented place. I know I should have returned to Sri Lanka when my visa expired but by then my husband had become seriously ill. His liver was failing. Then he passed away. That was in 2007. I have tried to return home to my children since then but I couldn’t without first paying a 22 lac rupees fine imposed on me for overstaying my welcome,” she informed.

Rashina set to reunite with family in Colombo following legal aid and charity support

“Having no place to go I would turn up at Saylani Welfare Trust for meals. There I met a volunteer, Anis Abdul Hafeez, who offered me a place to stay with his family in Surjani Town because I had no place to stay. When I fell sick, I reached out to Saylani again, and their chief trustee Arif Lakhani arranged for my heart bypass surgery. My hospital stay and medical bills were also taken care of by Saylani. They also tried to find me legal help. But we were getting nowhere. Not knowing what else to do, I started protesting outside the Karachi Press Club,” she said.
Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi said: “That was when some journalists alerted my son Saad Edhi about Rashina’s plight. “I then reached out to our regular legal counsel Advocate Zia Ahmed Awan for help,” Faisal Edhi told Dawn.
Advocate Zia Awan said that they reached out to the Ministry of Interior but to no avail. “Hope finally came when we approached the Constitutional Bench of the Sindh High Court which ordered for the Interior Secretary to appear before it. That was when Rashina’s hefty fine was waived and she was ordered to leave Pakistan within 15 days,” the able advocate reported.
As Arif Lakhani of Saylani had already got her Sri Lankan passport renewed, it was only a matter of him buying her a one-way air ticket to Colombo. With that arranged, Rashina is now all set to board her flight back home from Karachi on December 2.
“You are all welcome to Colombo. You will stay with me there. My children, who are half Pakistani, and I will love to have you,” Rashina told Zia Awan, Faisal Edhi, Arif Lakhani, Anis Abdul Hafeez and even the members of the media who had come to cover her story.
Speaking on the occasion, Faisal Edhi and Advocate Awan urged the government to look into waiving off the hefty fines imposed on aliens stuck in this country only because they don’t have money to pay the fines.
“When they want to go home we should also not let such hurdles come in their way,” Faisal Edhi said.

The recent by-election in six national and seven Punjab assembly constituencies was no exception. These seats — with the exception of the National Assembly seat NA-129 in Lahore — had fallen vacant after the conviction, and subsequent de-seating (as per the law), of some PTI-supported legislators. The Lahore NA seat became vacant after the demise of Mian Azhar, a senior PTI leader.
The PTI had decided that since it did not consider the conviction and disqualification of its legislators legitimate, it would boycott the by-election except for the seat in Lahore which did not become vacant because of the incumbent’s disqualification.
NA-18 in Haripur was, unlike the other 12 constituencies located in Punjab, a part of KP and had fallen vacant after PTI MNA and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub was convicted and subsequently disqualified. The election in the constituency was not boycotted either but it is not clear whether the party granted an exception to this constituency because it was located in KP and therefore felt more confident of winning this seat.

 

This constituency turned out to be the only one where a keen contest was observed and the 42 per cent voter turnout closely matched the 45pc in 2024. Although TV reports of partial constituency resu­lts indicated a very close contest between the PTI and PML-N candidates who had been exchanging the first and second positions for quite some time, it was the PML-N candidate who eventually won — with a big margin of about 40,000 votes. The same candidate had lost to the PTI candidate by a margin of 80,000 votes in 2024.
Among the constituencies boycotted by the PTI, NA-185 in Dera Ghazi Khan was probably the only one where a lively contest was observed. Apparently, it was possible because two traditional rival tribes of the area — the Legharis and the Khosas — were facing off.

 

Mehmood Qadir Leghari, as an independent candidate, had secured over 49,000 votes and was runner-up to the PTI’s Zartaj Gul in 2024, but he almost doubled his tally to 93,000 as the PML-N’s candidate and won the by-election. The PPP’s Dost Muhammad Khosa, who had secured over 26,000 votes in 2024, also increased his votes to over 39,000 in the by-election as runner-up. As the voter turnout was about 33pc compared to about 50pc in 2024, it seemed that PTI voters had at least partially abstained in this contest.
In the remaining national and provincial assembly constituencies, PTI voters effectively boycotted the by-polls as voter turnout plummeted to an average 28pc in 13 constituencies, which is half of the 56pc turnout in 2024. PML-N candidates increased their polled votes in 13 constituencies from 698,459 or 27pc of the total votes polled to 957,945 or 64pc of the total votes polled — an increase of over 37pc.
Fortunately, the by-elections passed off without any incident of major violence but, as usual, there are charges of poll rigging by the unsuccessful candidates, mostly in NA-18 (Haripur), NA-129 (Lahore) and NA-185 (Dera Ghazi Khan).
The electoral process in Pakistan, sadly, doesn’t enjoy a great deal of public trust. It is, however, difficult to pass judgement on the fairness of the recent by-elections as no evidence about the alleged rigging has been made public. An analysis of the by-election results can, therefore, be undertaken based on the official results.

It is difficult to comment on the fairness or otherwise of the recent by-elections at this stage.

The most interesting contest took place in NA-129 Lahore, in the heart of Punjab, where decisive future electoral battles will be fought. It was surprising that a close contest was not witnessed in this constituency where only 19pc voters turned out compared to 54pc in 2024. It seems that PTI voters had decided on their own to boycott the by-election, despite the fact that a PTI-supported candidate was in the field.
The PML-N candidate won the election with a comfortable lead of about 34,000 votes by securing around 61pc of the total votes polled. The same PML-N candidate could secure only 34pc of the votes and was defeated by a margin of about 32,000 votes less than two years ago. There is ample room and need for analyses of this turnaround.
The key question remains why PTI voters did not come out to vote or why the party failed to mobilise them despite the fact that their candidate was in the run. Are voters disillusioned with Pakistan’s electoral system or the leadership of their party or both? Or are they in a neutral zone of transition before they switch to the other side as is a common phenomenon in such cases?

 

The answer to these questions may also explain whether public opinion in Punjab is undergoing a change.
Are the efforts of the federal and Punjab governments to project their performance through an onslaught of media publicity making the desired impact? Is it recovery from the brink of bankruptcy and relative economic stability? Is it overpowering India in the short May conflict? Is it successful diplomacy after the war, which led to US President Donald Trump praising the Pakistani civil-military leadership and Saudi Arabia signing a defence pact with Pakistan? Is it the almost-daily inauguration of projects and programmes in Punjab?
Or is it the PTI’s despondency that its leader may not come out of prison and the party may not come to power in the near future? Or is it a combination of some or all of these factors affecting voters’ mindset? Electoral results of a single constituency may not be sufficient to reach a definite conclusion and we may have to wait and observe some upcoming contests.

Capital formation cannot by revived simply by doling out regulatory, legislative and policy concessions to a privileged few, while keeping the playing field uneven for the rest. The example of the Special Investment Facilitation Council is instructive in this regard.
More than two years after its creation, the SIFC — a special purpose vehicle with enough authority to effectively override regulations and policies in order to facilitate foreign investment — has delivered less than what was hoped. The irony is that even after recognising the limitations of their approach, policymakers appear determined to persist with it.
Reflecting on the SIFC’s efforts to attract FDI at a Pakistan Business Council conference in Islamabad, its national coordinator hinted at a ‘strategic shift’ in approach. At the moment, the shift appears limited to an acknowledgement that foreign investors will come only when local investors are engaged. Full support was offered to local “sectoral tycoons”, but the SIFC has yet to commit itself to the long-standing structural reforms needed to improve the investment clime.

 

If anything, Pakistan’s investment crisis is holding back its future, despite the country’s economic potential and abundant business opportunities. Low investment carries serious consequences: it weakens productivity, heightens reliance on imported goods and, in Pakistan’s case, it remains a major driver of recurring balance-of-payment troubles.
Although the economy has stabilised under the IMF programme over the last couple of years, growth cannot be expected to take off unless policymakers start looking beyond short-term fixes and resolutely pursue deep reforms to lift investment to the regional average.
Historical data shows a steady decline in both private and public investment in Pakistan. In contrast, regional economies have consistently expanded private investment in infrastructure and productivity while successive governments in Islamabad relied on consumption-driven growth spurts, instead of addressing structural impediments to capital formation. Even Sri Lanka boasts a significantly higher investment-to-GDP ratio of nearly 23pc.
No country can hope to attract sustained investment by selectively offering incentives to compensate for an uneven playing field marked by policy inconsistency, bureaucratic red tape, opacity, inequitable taxation, weak institutions and regulatory unpredictability.

 

The recent exit of several multinationals from the country underscores this reality: they did not leave due to lack of business opportunities but because policy and regulatory obstacles made operations increasingly unviable.
Unless the government reforms the investment regime to guarantee every investor — local or foreign, small or large — an equal opportunity to succeed based on their market performance, it will not be able to stem this trend.

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Imran Shoukat and SSP Serious Crime Investigation Wing Imran Qureshi detailed the successes at a press conference at the Police Lines, emphasising a broad crackdown on crime to protect citizens’ lives and property.
In one major success, the Serious Crime Investigation Wing dismantled an interprovincial gang that stole vehicles from Sindh and brought them to Balochistan, arresting four members and recovering 20 vehicles.
The wing also solved five blind murder cases and arrested suspects in several robberies, seizing stolen goods, cash, weapons, mobile phones and a large quantity of narcotics.
Overall, Quetta police arrested 12 suspects in various murder, theft and robbery cases. The arrests included three suspects in the murder of Imad Kakar: a woman identified as Atiya Rehman, Roman Ilyas and Babar Ali.

The shop from which the unlicensed murder weapon was purchased has been sealed, officials said.
Detailing other operations, DIG Shoukat said police arrested suspects Abdullah and Ibrahim for looting more than Rs20 million from a warehouse after holding a guard hostage in the Sariab area. More than 80 per cent of the stolen goods were recovered.

 

In a separate house robbery case, police arrested Fayyaz Ali, Sabir Ali and Muhammad Salman, recovering over Rs7m in gold jewellery, valuables and cash. In another incident, suspects Najibullah, Janan and Rahmatullah were arrested for snatching Rs11.8m, which was also recovered.
Officials said cases have been registered against all arrested suspects and legal proceedings have been initiated.
DIG Shoukat issued a stern warning against illegal activities, linking them to terrorist financing and vowing to hold his own officers accountable.
“Money generated from drugs and illegal Iranian petrol is being used for terrorism,” Shoukat said, adding that station house officers (SHOs) have been directed to eradicate all illegal activities, including gambling and the sale of Iranian petrol.
“If illegal activities are found during raids, the SHO of that area will be suspended and action will be taken against him.”
Both officials paid tribute to officers who have died in the line of duty and stressed that public support is crucial for lasting security.

The move must be carried out before the next routine flight, according to a separate bulletin to airlines, threatening cancellations or delays during one of the busiest travel weekends of the year in the United States and beyond.
Airbus said in a statement a recent incident involving an A320-family aircraft had revealed that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls.
“Airbus acknowledges these recommendations will lead to operational disruptions to passengers and customers,” it said. Industry sources said the incident that triggered the unexpected repair action involved a JetBlue flight from Cancun, Mexico, to Newark, New Jersey, on Oct 30, in which several passengers were hurt following a sharp loss of altitude.
Flight 1230 made an emergency landing at Tampa, Florida, after a flight control problem and a sudden uncommanded drop in altitude, prompting an FAA investigation. JetBlue and the FAA had no immediate comment. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency is due to issue an emergency directive mandating the fix, Airbus said.
For about two-thirds of the affected jets, the recall will result in a relatively brief grounding as airlines revert to a previous software version, industry sources said.
Still, that comes at a time of intense demands on airline repair shops, already plagued by shortages of maintenance capacity and the grounding of hundreds of Airbus jets.

Meanwhile, there were reports about two blasts at Major Chowk in Mastung.
Officials confirmed the two explosions and said no loss of life was reported. After the blasts, an exchange of fire took place between armed men and security forces.

ISLAMABAD: Amid a noisy protest in the Senate for a second day by PTI senators, the government on Friday assured the House that former prime minister Imran Khan was in good health with no threat to his life and blamed Afghan and Indian media for circulating “false” reports about Mr Khan’s health.
The ruckus by PTI lawmakers, alarmed by social media reports about Mr Khan’s condition, dominated the day’s proceedings. They chanted slogans and hit their desks, demanding that family members, doctors and lawyers be allowed to meet with Mr Khan after what they called a “complete blackout for weeks”.
Syed Ali Zafar, the PTI parliamentary leader in the Senate, sought an explanation from the government about the reports.



“The tension level of the public has risen so high that there will be an explosion if the matter was not resolved immediately,” Mr Zafar warned. He added that the party’s senators would not participate in proceedings until a minister provided a clear response.
“We will not become part of the proceedings till the minister concerned comes and responds,” he said before PTI senators staged a walkout.
While the government gave no assurance on allowing visits, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry rejected the social media reports as baseless.

 

Imran Khan “is in good health, facing no threat to his life, and is being provided with all facilities”, Chaudhry said, relaying information from the superintendent of Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi, where the ex-premier is being held.
The minister claimed Afghan media initially spread the “fake stories,” which he said were then amplified by Indian media.
The minister’s statement failed to satisfy the opposition. “We will not let the proceedings continue,” one lawmaker said. “You cannot threaten like this,” Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani responded.
The proceedings were briefly adjourned when the House was found to be one member short of a quorum. After business resumed, PTI members continued their protest, chanting “release Imran Khan”.
Meanwhile, the government laid the money bill — the Income Tax (Third Amendment) Bill, 2025 — before the House, to make recommendations on it to the National Assembly, as required under Article 73 of the Constitution.
The chair referred the bill to the Standing Committee for Finance and Revenue for further consideration
Later in the session, PTI Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, when called upon to move an item on the agenda, spoke instead on Imran’s health and rejected claims that meetings with the former leader were taking place, saying their leader had been kept behind bars unjustly and on frivolous charges.
The session chairman, Shahadat Awan of the PPP, eventually deferred the remaining agenda items after a minister expressed an inability to respond in the noisy environment. He then adjourned the House to meet again on Monday at 4pm.

• Execution of Palestinians in Jenin termed ‘summary execution’
• E4 condemns settlers’ violence in occupied West Bank
JERUSALEM/DAMASCUS: Israeli military killed 13 people in a raid on a village in Syria on Friday which Damascus called a criminal attack, and in the occupied West Bank it injured three Palestinians in its ongoing operation in a Palestinian refugee camp.
The Israeli military claimed six soldiers were wounded, three of them severely, during an incursion in the village of Beit Jinn.
Israel frequently bombed Syria when it was ruled by Assad and stepped up its military operations in the country after he was ousted, citing goals that include keeping fighters away from the frontier.
Syrian state news agency SANA, which reported 13 people killed and dozens wounded, said Israeli forces shelled Beit Jinn and Israeli troops entered the village. Residents confronted the Israeli forces, which responded, leading to “violent clashes”.

 

Syria’s foreign ministry said the Israeli attack killed more than 10 civilians, including women and children, damaged property and forced residents to flee their homes, accusing Israel of committing a “full-fledged war crime”. Walid Akasha, a local official in Beit Jinn, denied there were any terrorist factions there.
Meanwhile, Najat Rochdi, the UN’s Deputy Special Envoy for Syria, condemned Israel’s incursion as “a grave and unacceptable violation of Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, further destabilising an already fragile environment”.



Three injured in West Bank
Separately, Israeli continued its military operation in Far’a refugee camp in occupied West Bank, injuring three people on Friday. According to Al Jazeera, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society transported three injured people out of Tubas.
Israeli tank fire injured one child in the Rafah area, according to local Palestinian media reports. Israeli forces have started tearing down homes and buildings in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank.
The operation follows an earlier warning from the Israeli military that troops would raze 24 structures in the camp, which it said is required for “operational” purposes.
‘Summary execution’
The United Nations said on Friday that the killing of two Palestinians, shot dead in occupied West Bank while seemingly surrendering to Israeli forces, was an “apparent summary execution”.
“We are appalled at the brazen killing by Israeli border police yesterday (Thursday) of two Palestinian men in Jenin,” UN rights office spokesperson Jeremy Laurence told reporters in Geneva, calling the incident “yet another apparent summary execution”.
He said UN rights chief Volker Turk was calling for “independent, prompt and effective investigations into the killings of Palestinians”, and for those responsible for killings and other violations in Israeli-occupied West Bank to “be held fully to account”.







Meanwhile, France, Germany, Italy and UK have demanded Israel to abide by international law and protect Palestinians in West Bank as illegal Israeli settler attacks reached their peak in nearly two decades.
According to Middle East Monitor, the foreign ministers of four countries, commonly known as the E4, in a joint statement strongly condemned the massive increase of settler violence against Palestinian civilians and called for stability in the occupied West Bank.

ISLAMABAD: Dema­nd­ing that the government allow the jailed Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) fou­n­der Imran Khan to meet his sisters and party leaders, the opposition alliance warned the authorities on Friday of countrywide protests if the government did not mend its ways.
“We have stopped Sindhis, Baloch, Pashtuns, and Punjabis from taking to the streets against the government and its policies; otherwise, they would come out and create problems for the rulers,” said Pakhtu­nkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) President Meh­mood Achakzai during a joint press conference with other opposition leaders outside Parliament House.
He said the government had turned parliament into a rubber stamp and that National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq was taking dictation from elsewhere. He said people were being killed in the tribal areas, yet the NA speaker did not allow the opposition to speak on this grave issue.
He questioned why Imran Khan was kept in jail and why he was not being allowed to meet his sisters and party leaders. “The chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is sitting outside Adiala Jail, but no one is paying any heed to his request to meet the PTI founder,” he said.
Democracy buried
Speaking on the occasion, PTI leader Asad Qaiser said democracy had been buried in the recent by-elections.
He claimed that the results of a by-election in Haripur, where the wife of former opposition leader Omar Ayub was contesting, had been changed. “The result on Form 47 was different from the one altered on a computer,” he alleged.
Barrister Gohar said the opposition wanted to remain part of parliament and the democratic system, but the alleged rigging in the by-elections had made this difficult.
“As far as I know [Imran] Khan, he will not allow us to be part of parliament anymore,” he added.

In a statement issued in Geneva, the human rights chief said the latest constitutional amendment, like the 26th amendment last year, had been adopted without broad consultation and debate with the legal community and wider civil society.
Turk warned that the amendments run counter to the separation of powers that underpin the rule of law and safeguard the protection of human rights in Pakistan.
“Under the changes adopted on November 13, a new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) has been given powers over constitutional cases, replacing the previous authority of the Supreme Court, which will now only deal with civil and criminal cases,” the statement read.
It added that the systems for appointing, promoting and transferring judges changed in a manner raising “serious concerns about undermining the structural independence of Pakistan’s judiciary”.
Turk noted that the president and prime minister had already assigned the chief justice and the first set of FCC judges.







“These changes, taken together, risk subjugating the judiciary to political interference and executive control,” Turk was quoted as saying.
“Neither the executive nor legislative should be in a position to control or direct the judiciary, and the judiciary should be protected from any form of political influence in its decision-making.
“A core measure of judicial independence is a tribunal’s insulation from political interference by the government. If judges are not independent, experience shows that they struggle to apply the law equally and to uphold human rights for all in the face of political pressure.”
The UN also noted that the 27th amendment establishes lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrest for the president, field marshal, marshall of the air force and admiral of the fleet.
“Sweeping immunity provisions like these undermine accountability, which is a cornerstone of the human rights framework and democratic control of the armed forces under the rule of law,” Turk was quoted as saying.
“I am concerned that these amendments risk far-reaching consequences for the principles of democracy and rule of law which the Pakistani people hold dear.”

 

On November 13, the president signed the 27th Constitutional Amendment into law hours after the Senate approved the bill for the amendment after voting on it for a second time amid the opposition’s protest.
Announcing the result, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani said 64 votes had been cast in favour of the bill and four against it. “So the motion is carried by the votes of not less than two-thirds of the total membership of the Senate, and consequently, the bill stands passed.”
The House first voted on the bill clause by clause and then by division. While clause-by-clause voting was under way, slogans of aain ki tabahi, na manzoor (destruction of the Constitution, unacceptable) filled the house, prompting Gilani to say at one point, “No slogans”.
The bill was initially presented in the Senate for voting on November 10 and passed the same day. It was then referred to the NA, which approved it with some amendments yesterday. Therefore, the proposed legislation was again presented in the Senate to consider the latest changes.</p><small>2025-11-29 02:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/290713363208540.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1958092/cybersecurity-act-essential-to-national-security-says-it-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Cybersecurity Act essential to national security, says IT minister</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Information Technology (IT) and Telecom Shaza Fatima Khawaja said the Cybersecurity Act 2025 was essential for national security and reflected the government’s whole-of-nation approach to cybersecurity, marking a major reform initiative.
She noted that the Act will establish the National Cybersecurity Authority (NCA) to lead nationwide incident response and thr­eat intelligence, while exp­ansion of the Pakistan Computer Emergency Res­ponse Team (PKCERT), and the development of secure digital public infrastructure under the Digital Economy Enhancement Project (Deep) will further strengthen national cyber resilience.
Ms Khawaja was add­ressing a gathering at FAST National University, Islam­abad, on the theme ‘Securing Pakistan’s Digi­tal Frontier: CyberShield, Policy & the Future’. The event was hosted by the FAST Public Policy and Res­earch Society (FPPRS).

 

She added that Pakis­tan’s long-term objective is to build a cyber-resilient, innovation-driven dig­ital nation where secure infrastructure, technological excellence, and human cap­ital development adva­nce together.
The minister underscored that Pakistan’s digital transformation is accelerating at an unprecedented pace, bringing with it the critical responsibility of safeguarding national digital infrastructure and citizen data.
She highlighted Pakistan’s Tier-1 ranking in the ITU Global Cybersecurity Index as a reflection of the collective commitment of the government, academia, and youth toward building a secure digital future.
The minister said Pakistan is rapidly advancing toward AI-driven cybersecurity, dark-web moni­toring, and cloud security under the Cloud-First Policy, along with secure digital identity frameworks.
She also referred to the recent Marka-i-Haq, calling it a defining moment in which the armed forces, national institutions, and cyber experts stood united with remarkable resilience.

 

She emphasised that Pakistan’s effective and coordinated cyber warfare response during this period demonstrated exceptional national strength and technological capability, adding that Marka-i-Haq proved the cyber domain is the first line of defence in the modern era, and Pakistan has shown it can safeguard its digital frontiers with confidence and competence.
The minister also toured FAST-NU Islamabad’s IC Design Lab along with Director Dr Waseem Shahzad, Dean Dr Sadia Nadeem, and Fast Public Policy and Research Society (FPPRS) President Zainab Inam Cheema, and met scholars enrolled in Ignite’s flagship training initiative, “Training in IC Design & Verification.”
Under this Ignite-funded programme, 30 young engineers — including seven female participants — are undergoing a rigorous 10-month training course covering IC design, verification, and fabrication processes.
Implemented by FAST-NU, the programme offers hands-on training aligned with global semiconductor industry standards.

ISLAMABAD: With a 256 per cent surge in current account deficit, the government on Friday expressed cautious optimism over the country’s economic outlook with stubborn inflation in 5-6pc range due to pressure on food prices and agriculture production.
In its economic update and outlook for November, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) said the industrial activity continued to strengthen amid implementation of reforms.
However, all major fiscal indicators — FBR collection, non-tax revenue, budget surplus and primary surplus — were down as percentage of GDP. The report showed the tax-to-GDP ratio was slightly lower at 2.96pc in first four months of 2025-26 when compared to 3pc last year. Non-tax revenues were also reported at 2.32pc of GDP against 2.63pc in comparable period.
Fiscal surplus was also down this year at 1.63pc of GDP against 1.65pc last year while primary surplus was reported at 2.7pc this year when compared to 2.8pc last year.
The ministry said the crop outlook showed mixed trend and hoped the ‘adequate input availability and government support measures’ to stabilise supplies as the rabi season progressed.
The current account deficit swelled to $733 million during July-October 2025-26 from $206m recorded last year, showing an increase of 255.8pc, the MoF said but claimed that the current account deficit remained “within the expected range, on the back of steady export growth and strong remittance inflows despite the increase in import demand to meet the production requirements”.
Overall, the economy is projected to maintain its positive momentum, supported by continued structural reforms, digital transition, governance improvements, on the back of ongoing efforts toward fiscal discipline and macroeconomic stabilisation, the report observed.
It said the key indicators were showing improvement as fiscal discipline was maintained through stronger revenue mobilisation and prudent expenditure management. However, the report showed expenditure growth at 11.9pc outpacing revenue growth of 11.4pc.
It said the higher remittances and expanding Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector and IT exports strengthened the economic outlook. Backed by healthy realisation of State Bank of Pakistan’s profits due to record interest rates, the ministry said the public debt declined by over Rs1.371trillion, marking the first quarterly reduction in more than five years.
“This decline reflects strategic use of surplus funds for early retirement of costly debt, thereby reducing refinancing and rollover risks and strengthening macroeconomic stability,” it noted.
Elaborating the mixed agriculture outlook, the report said the sugarcane production for the current season had been estimated to show an increase of 0.6pc to 84.74 million tonnes from 84.24m tonnes last year despite floods.
On the other hand, cotton output is estimated at 6.85m bales, down 3.3pc from 7.08m bales. Similarly, rice production declined by 3.2pc to 9.41m tonnes from 9.72m tonnes and maize production by 6.7pc to 8.43m tonnes from 9.03m tonnes last year.
However, mung and chillies production increased by 14.9pc and 0.5pc to 150,800 and 114,400 tonnes, respectively, from last year.
During 4MFY26, agricultural credit disbursement increased by 18.6pc to Rs845.3bn from Rs712.8bn last year.
The imports of agricultural machinery and implements increased by 23.5pc to $49.3m during from $39.9m in 4MFY25. The LSM output rose 4.1pc during July-September of the current fiscal year with 15 sectors recording positive growth, including textile, wearing apparel, non-metallic mineral products, food, coke & petroleum products, electrical equipment, automobile and tobacco.
On the positive side, service exports grew by 15.9pc to $3bn compared to 12pc import growth to $4.2bn, with a service trade deficit of $1.2bn against $1.1bn. IT exports were up by 19.6pc to $1.4bn.
The report confirmed that during the first quarter of FY26, net federal revenues increased by 2.4pc to Rs4.117tr compared to Rs4.019tr last year. However, the FBR’s collection rose 11.4pc to Rs3.835tr during 4MFY26. On the expenditure side, total outlays increased by 11.9pc during July-September to Rs2.779tr. Consequently, the federal fiscal balance recorded a second time surplus of Rs1.338tr, compared to a surplus of Rs1.536tr. The primary balance also improved in absolute terms, posting a surplus of Rs3.497tr, up from Rs3.202tr in the corresponding period.
Merchandise exports increased by 2pc ($10.6bn) in first four months but were overwhelmingly outpaced by 9.6pc growth in imports ($20.7bn), resulting in a $10.1bn trade deficit, compared to $8.5bn last year, showing a 19pc surge.
Remittances increased by 9.3pc to $13bn, led by inflows from Saudi Arabia (24.2pc share) and the United Arab Emirates (20.7pc). Net FDI inflows declined by 26pc to $747.7m in first four months led by $226.7m from China and $120m from Hong Kong.

Based on existing tax rates, informed sources said the ex-depot price of high-speed diesel (HSD) is expected to drop by about Rs3.70 per litre (about 1.4pc), depending on the final calculation, while the petrol rate would also come down by about Rs4.3 per litre or 1.5pc.
Petrol and HSD prices have increased by about Rs12.50 and Rs29 per litre, respectively, since June 1, 2025.
The ex-depot prices of Kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) are also estimated to reduce by Re1 (0.3pc) and Rs6.35 per litre (3.7pc), respectively. The kerosene and LDO rates currently stand at Rs194.34 and Rs170.80 per litre, respectively.
The ex-depot petrol price currently stands at Rs265.45 per litre, which may come down to Rs261.75. Petrol is primarily used in private transport, small vehicles, rickshaws, and two-wheelers, and has a direct bearing on the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-class households.
The ex-depot price of HSD stands at Rs284.44 per litre, which may drop to Rs280 per litre on Dec 1. Most of the transport sector runs on HSD.
Its price is considered inflationary, as it is mostly used in heavy transport vehicles, trains, and agricultural engines such as trucks, buses, tractors, tube wells, and threshers, which push up prices of vegetables and other eatables. Transporters had already increased their fares by about Rs27 per litre between May and August and have not reversed the increase despite a Rs9 per litre cut.
The government is currently charging about Rs100 per litre on petrol and about Rs96 per litre on diesel. Although the General Sales Tax (GST) is zero on all petroleum products, the government is charging Rs78 per litre on diesel and Rs82 per litre on petrol and high-octane products on account of the petroleum development levy and the climate support levy. This also includes Rs2.50 per litre CSL.
The government is also charging about Rs16-17 per litre in customs duty on petrol and HSD, irrespective of whether they are locally produced or imported. In addition, about Rs17 per litre distribution and sale margins are going to oil companies and their dealers.
Petrol and high-speed diesel are the major revenue spinners, with monthly average sales of about 700,000-800,000 tonnes, compared to just 10,000 tonnes of kerosene demand.
The government recovered about Rs1.161 trillion through the petroleum levy alone in FY25 and expects this to jump by about 27pc to Rs1.470 trillion during the current fiscal year.

Imran has been in jail since August 2023, serving a 14-year sentence on corruption charges. His family and party members have protested outside Adiala Jail in recent days, demanding a meeting but have been repeatedly denied despite orders from the courts.
Imran’s sister Aleema Khan filed a contempt of court petition against the Adiala jail superintendent and others over their failure to comply with an earlier Islamabad High Court (IHC) order that reinstated a twice-a-week meeting schedule for the incarcerated former premier.
Speaking on the matter in an interview on Geo News show ‘Naya Pakistan’, Sanaullah said: “There should be permission for meetings and they should definitely take place, but a 90-minute press conference cannot take place after an hour’s meeting; no law allows this.”
He further said that political discussions could also not take place in the meetings, saying that no law allowed a prisoner to lead, plan and guide movements on the outside from jail.
The senator maintained that it was not permitted for family members to hold press conferences outside the prison premises and for a barrage of messages to appear on social media against the state and officials.
Sanaullah argued that the IHC’s order to facilitate meetings was also contingent on similar conditions as he laid out.
“They (Imran’s family and legal team) should sit down with jail authorities and settle matters,” he said, saying that the process of meetings should be better conducted without violations from either side.
Sanaullah later said the meetings were not being allowed because they were not being conducted in accordance with the law. “The meeting should be in accordance with the law,” he maintained, reiterating that there should be no violation from either side.
The contempt petition was filed after Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, along with several other PTI members, staged an overnight sit-in outside Adiala jail in Rawalpindi. The sit-in was staged as CM Afridi was denied a meeting with Imran for the eighth time on Thursday.
Previously, Imran’s sisters, including Aleema, had also staged sit-ins outside the prison in Rawalpindi on multiple occasions after they were barred from meeting the former premier.
The PTI ended its latest sit-in on Friday morning, with the KP CM announcing that they would be approaching the IHC, where Aleema filed the contempt plea.
Meetings not subject to whims or wishes: Barrister Aqeel
Speaking later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said meetings could not be held on anyone’s ‘whims or wishes’.
He said meetings could only be held under existing prison rules and the prerogative in this regard rests with the superintendent.
Malik added that the prison administration could curtail a prisoner’s privilege to have meetings “in the public interest” if a necessary cause was found.
However, he did not elaborate on the criteria by which the Adiala jail superintendent decides when to allow meetings or not.
Malik also maintained that the rules prevented any political discussion.
Questioned about the KP chief minister’s threat to launch a protest on Tuesday if a meeting was not allowed, the minister said the government would take the necessary measures in such a situation.</p><small>2025-11-28 19:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636237-sindh-private-schools-asked-to-relax-uniform-policy-amid-cold-weather' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh private schools asked to relax uniform policy amid cold weather</strong></a><br><p>

The announcement marks an escalation in charges facing the assailant, identified as 29-year-old Rahmanullah Lakanwal, who the US media said was part of the “Zero Units” — a CIA-backed Afghan paramilitary force.
“There are certainly many more charges to come, but we are upgrading the initial charges of assault to murder in the first degree,” Jeanine Pirro, the attorney for Washington, DC, told the Fox News programme ‘Fox & Friends’.
“It is a premeditated murder. There was an ambush with a gun toward people who didn’t know what was coming.”
Pirro’s announcement comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi pledged on Thursday to “seek the death penalty” against Lakanwal, describing him as a “monster.”



Pirro said Lakanwal opened fire with a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver on a group of guardsmen on patrol just a few blocks from the White House on Wednesday, the eve of the Thanksgiving holiday.
Sarah Beckstrom, a 20-year-old West Virginia National Guard member deployed in the US capital as part of Trump’s crackdown on crime, died from her wounds, the president said on Thursday. He said the other soldier wounded in the attack, 24-year-old Andrew Wolfe, was “fighting for his life”.
“We still have hope,” Pirro said of Wolfe. “He’s still in critical condition. We are doing everything we can to assist his family.”
The shooting has brought together three politically explosive issues: Trump’s controversial use of the military on American soil, immigration, and the lingering legacy of the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan — America’s longest war.
‘Rigorous reexamination’
Late on Thursday, Trump pledged on Truth Social to “permanently pause” migration from “all Third World Countries” and threatened to reverse “millions” of admissions granted under his predecessor Joe Biden, in a new escalation in his anti-immigration stance.
When asked which specific nationalities would be affected, the US Department of Homeland Security pointed AFP to a list of 19 countries — including Afghanistan, Cuba, Haiti, Iran and Myanmar — facing US travel restrictions under a previous order from Trump in June.
Separately, Joseph Edlow, Trump’s director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said on Thursday he had ordered a “full-scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.” When asked to specify the countries, the USCIS referred AFP to the same list of 19 countries.

More than 1.6 million US green card holders, roughly 12 per cent of the total permanent resident population, were born in the countries listed, according to the latest immigration data available on the agency’s ‘Eligible to Naturalise Dashboard’ analysed by AFP.
Afghanistan, which has over 116,000 green card holders, is also affected by a total halt of immigration application processing, ordered by the Trump administration after the shooting.
CIA director John Ratcliffe said the suspect, Lakanwal, had been part of a CIA-backed “partner force” fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan.
He added that he had been brought to the United States as part of a program to evacuate Afghans who had worked with the agency after the Taliban toppled the American-backed government in 2021.
Lakanwal had been living in the western state of Washington with his family and had driven across the country to the capital, officials said.
The heads of the FBI, CIA and Homeland Security and other senior Trump appointees all insisted that Lakanwal had been granted unvetted access to the US because of lax asylum policies in the wake of the chaotic final US withdrawal from Afghanistan under former president Biden.
However, AfghanEvac, a group that helped resettle Afghans in the US after the military withdrawal, said they had undergone “some of the most extensive security vetting” of any migrants.</p><small>2025-11-28 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636233-kp-cm-should-go-on-hunger-strike-until-he-dies-in-imran-khans-love-suggests-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM should go on hunger strike until he 'dies in Imran Khan's love', suggests Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>

“The power supply has been restored to four Bahria town projects, including main Bahria Town near Mohlanwal,” a Lesco spokesperson told Dawn.
The power supply was suspended yesterday, inviting criticism from the residents, who also announced holding a protest demonstration in front of the Bahria Town offices after Friday prayers on this issue.
According to Lesco CEO Mr Ramzan Butt, the last date for bill payment was November 21, which was extended to November 23 on the request of the housing society’s officials.
After failing to pay, the officials had requested another day’s extension and continued securing more until Wednesday.
“Since the final and last date was November 27 (yesterday), they, instead of paying bills, approached the court, reportedly. But before they could get the court decision, we disconnected the power supply to four projects, including the main Bahria town (near Mohlanwal) that alone has dues of over Rs530m,” Butt explained to Dawn.
In 2024, Lesco had disconnected the power supply to Bahria Town over the non-payment of more than Rs762m in electricity bills.
The real estate company has come under scrutiny before as well for power issues. In June last year, scores of residents in Bahria Town’s operations in Islamabad petitioned against overbilling and deductions by the management on electricity generated through solar power.</p><small>2025-11-28 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/28220245afa8b9b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957945/monument-to-first-man-in-space-yuri-gagarin-unveiled-in-islamabad' target='_blank'><strong>Monument to first man in space Yuri Gagarin unveiled in Islamabad</strong></a><br><p>The Russian Embassy on Friday announced that a monument to Yuri Gagarin, the first man to travel to space and return, was unveiled in Islamabad’s Fatima Jinnah Park.
Gagarin became the first man in space in April 1961, when he uttered the famous words “Let’s go” as his Vostok rocket blasted off from southern Kazakhstan. After a voyage lasting just 108 minutes, the 27-year-old cosmonaut ejected from his capsule and parachuted down into a field in the Saratov region of central Russia.
According to a post on X, the unveiling ceremony was attended by Russian Energy Minister Sergei Tsivilev, Power Minister Awais Leghari, Russian Ambassador Albert P Khorev, Pakistani Ambassador to Russia Faisal Niaz Tirmizi and pilot-cosmonaut Elena Serova.
“This is the greatest feat in our shared history. A huge number of scientists are engaged in space research. Let this work benefit all countries of the world,” the statement read, quoting Tsivilev.
The post added that the unveiling was scheduled to coincide with the 10th meeting of the Russia-Pakistan Intergovernmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific and Technical Cooperation.
The embassy extended its gratitude to the International Charitable Fund “Dialogue of Cultures-United World” for providing a bust of Gagarin, the St Petersburg International Mercantile Exchange for its support in installing it and Pakistani authorities for their assistance in this project.
Tsivilev also announced that next year, a Russia-Pakistan conference on cosmonautics and space infrastructure would be held in Islamabad.

Relations between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban are at their lowest point in the four years since the group came to power. Border crossings bet­ween the two countries have remained closed since October 11 and trade has been at a standstill following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-kilometre frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.
Following those clashes, Turkiye and Qatar stepped in to mediate. The first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks. The third round concluded without any concrete agreement.
The situation deteriorated again following Afghan accusations of Pakistani airstrikes earlier this week, which the military and government ministers denied. The Afghan side also threatened retaliation.
Questioned about the threat and the shaky ceasefire during his weekly press briefing, FO Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said: “The ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan does not imply a traditional ceasefire implemented after two belligerent states in a war or a conflict situation. Pakistan-Afghanistan ceasefire implied that there would be no terrorist attack by Afghan-sponsored terrorist proxies into Pakistan. There have been major terrorist attacks after this ceasefire.”
“So, interpreting in that sense, the ceasefire is not holding because the ceasefire was about ceasing terrorist attacks inside Pakistan by TTP, FAK, and Afghan nationals using Afghan soil.”

 

He continued that “if Afghan nationals are attacking, as they did so in Islamabad and elsewhere, so we cannot be very optimistic about the ceasefire, which, in any case, I mentioned, is not the traditional ceasefire between the two states, but to be understood in the context of terrorist attacks from Afghanistan.”
The spokesperson said that security forces remained fully alert and the military’s preparedness was robust in response to any alleged threat from Afghanistan.
“The security challenges we face would be addressed with the seriousness that they merit.”







The spokesperson was also questioned about allegations from the Afghan Taliban about Pakistan harbouring the banned militant Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group to which he responded that it was an “outrageous” claim.
“It is a figment of the imagination of the Afghan Taliban regime. Afghan side wants to externalise this menace of terrorism, which inherently is on their own soil and of their own making. They want to externalise it to Pakistan, naming various organisations. Any extremist terrorist element in Pakistan is treated, is dealt, as per our laws. This statement, of presence of any ISIS in Pakistan is totally baseless.”
Even before this week’s current flare-up in tensions, the information ministry earlier this month said that all terrorists involved in an attack on Cadet College Wana in South Waziristan were Afghan citizens.
The attackers had targeted the main gate of the college and gained entry to the educational institution, but a timely response from security forces averted a major tragedy. Government ministers had linked the attack to Afghanistan and said it was orchestrated from there.
Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry had also said that a suicide bomber who carried out an attack outside the Islamabad district and sessions court building was “not a Pakistani national”.
Twelve people were killed and 36 were injured in the suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif accused Afghanistan and India of involvement in terrorism, vowing a “befitting response” to the nation’s enemies following the two incidents.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif had also subsequently said that attacks on terrorist sanctuaries in Afghanistan could not be ruled out after the incidents in Islamabad and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-11-28 16:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636190-ceasefire-with-afghan-taliban-not-holding-amid-continued-terror-attacks-says-fo' target='_blank'><strong>Ceasefire with Afghan Taliban 'not holding' amid continued terror attacks, says FO</strong></a><br><p>

Reports about Imran’s ill health had swirled on social and foreign media a day ago, prompting both government and PTI leaders to dismiss the rumours and state that the former prime minister — currently held incarcerated at Rawalpindi’s Adial jail — was doing well.
Several PTI workers, including women, carried banners bearing slogans in favour of the former premier as they moved towards KPC today. The party workers and leaders chanted slogans and delivered speeches.







Authorities had sealed all routes leading to the KPC by placing barricades and parking vehicles.







A sizeable police presence was noted at the KPC and in the surrounding areas, supported by women personnel.
PTI Sindh spokesperson Mohammed Ali Bozdar said 20 PTI workers and leaders were detained; however, South Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza later told Dawn the number was 24.







Among the detainees was the party’s provincial president, Haleem Adil Shaikh.







Bozdar said the party’s Insaf lawyers’ forum representatives arrived at Preedy Police Station and held talks with officials. Subsequently, all detainees were released.














South Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Mahzoor Ali also confirmed that all protesters were released.
He said police took action as the crowd was ‘charged’ and the force feared they might indulge in vandalism and create a law and order situation.
“Therefore, the police just removed them, but they were not arrested,” the SSP said.</p><small>2025-11-28 15:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2818263517d854f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957919/putin-to-discuss-privileged-partnership-with-modi-on-india-visit-next-week' target='_blank'><strong>Putin to discuss ‘privileged partnership’ with Modi on India visit next week</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will discuss all aspects of their countries’ “privileged strategic partnership” when Putin visits New Delhi next week, the Kremlin said.
India, a major buyer of Russian oil, has also bought its weapons for decades, though a top defence official said the country had bought US arms worth nearly $30 billion in the past decade and aims to produce more of its own equipment.
“They (the Russians) have been our friends through both fair and foul weather, and we are not going to sort of stop our defence cooperation with them anytime soon, but I do want to stress that India follows a policy of strategic autonomy,” Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh said in New Delhi on Friday.
India was diversifying its suppliers, he told an industry event, adding: “But more than anything else we are trying to ensure that we increasingly do spend the bulk of our money within the country.”
Putin last visited India in December 2021, just a few months before Russia went to war in Ukraine the following February.
“This visit is of great importance, providing an opportunity to comprehensively discuss the extensive agenda of Russian-Indian relations as a particularly privileged strategic partnership,” the Kremlin said in a statement.
US President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged Modi to stop India’s buying of oil from Russia. In August, he imposed an additional tariff of 25 per cent on Indian goods in what Moscow said amounted to illegal trade pressure on New Delhi.
Trade and refining sources said this week that India’s December oil imports from Russia were set to hit their lowest in at least three years, off November’s multi-month highs, as refiners sought options to avoid breaching Western sanctions.
During his state visit from December 4 to 5, Putin will hold talks with Modi and have a separate meeting with President Droupadi Murmu, the Kremlin said, saying a number of unspecified intergovernmental and commercial documents would be signed.

The ruling PML-N secured close to 64 per cent of the total votes polled in the by-elections for six National Assembly constituencies held on Sunday as it emerged victorious on all seats. Five constituencies were located in Punjab and one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. These seats, except for one, were vacated due to the disqualification of the opposition PTI MNAs.
The PML-N also won six out of seven Punjab Assembly seats in the province by securing 82.41pc of the polled votes. On the seventh seat, it had not fielded its candidate in PP-269, Muzaffargarh, against PPP nominee Alamdar Qureshi.
The elections monitor had issued its by-election observation report a day earlier. In an accompanying press release, it noted: “The November 23rd by-elections for 13 National and Punjab Assemblies constituencies, though largely well-managed, were marked by recurring violations of campaigning restrictions, gaps in results transparency and a worryingly low voter turnout.”
The monitor also noted that “weak enforcement of campaigning restrictions” was among the persistent issues flagged in all polls. Furthermore, it said the overall turnout fell by 23 per cent for both men and women and only one constituency recorded a turnout of above 50pc.
It explained that at 238 (64pc) polling stations, at least 465 party camps were observed in close vicinity to the stations and transportation facilitation was observed at 184 (49pc) polling stations.
“Party camps were seen issuing voter slips at 216 (91pc) polling stations, and campaign material was found inside 16 (4pc) polling stations. While most polling stations had basic accessibility infrastructure, arrangements for women, the elderly, persons with disabilities, and transgender voters were inconsistent.”
Referring to organisational preparation and setup for the by-elections, Fafen said around 89pc of presiding officers, 79pc of assistant presiding officers and 77pc of polling officers reported receiving training from the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
“Ballot security and secrecy were generally upheld,” Fafen noted, adding that all four required ballot box seals were intact at 1,072 (98pc) booths and secrecy screens were properly placed at 1,044 (96pc) booths.
It stated that its observers closely monitored 366 polling booths and found polling organised and peaceful at 340 (93pc) booths, while only four (1pc) were described as disorganised or poorly managed.
Fafen noted that polling officers were observed performing key legal tasks such as verifying National Identity Cards (NIC), applying thumb marks, recording voter details and updating electoral rolls. However, at 92 (25pc) booths, they did not announce voter names and serial numbers as required under election laws.
“At 10 (3pc) booths, at least one eligible voter was turned away due to an expired NIC.”
Fafen added that assistant presiding officers “generally followed” proper ballot issuance procedures, but at 107 (29pc) booths, they pre-signed ballot papers, and at 102 (28pc) booths, they pre-stamped them.
“Although not illegal, these practices may increase the risk of ballot misuse,” Fafen pointed out.
“Of the 79 polling stations selected for counting observation, access to observers was denied at two. Presiding officers did not provide the Result of the Count (Form 45) to polling agents at six (8pc) polling stations and to observers at 13 (17pc) stations. Form 45 was also not displayed outside 15 (19pc) polling stations.”
“Similarly, Ballot Paper Account (Form 46) was not provided to polling agents at 15 (19pc) stations and observers at 17 (22pc) stations and it was not posted outside 16 (21pc) stations. At 33 (43pc) polling stations, presiding officers did not ask polling agents to sign the result forms.”
Fafen further said that around 97pc of polling agents interviewed during the observation process expressed satisfaction with the polling process, while only two expressed concerns. However, it said that all 137 polling agents interviewed after the counting phase reported satisfaction with the counting process.
The monitor also said it had deployed 122 trained and accredited observers, who conducted a “comprehensive observation” of opening, voting and counting processes at 373 polling stations and their 1,088 polling booths, including 626 male and 462 female booths. The observers also interviewed polling staff, security personnel, and 833 polling agents.</p><small>2025-11-28 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/636171-pakistani-students-win-oxford-university-debate-against-indian-team' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani students win Oxford University debate against Indian team</strong></a><br><p>
