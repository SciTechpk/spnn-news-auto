Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities. According to rescue officials, at least 32 people have been killed across four provinces over the last two days as heavy rains triggered flash floods and damaged houses. Meanwhile, some people lost their lives due to electrocution.
On Sunday, Rescue 1122 issued a statement outlining more deaths and injuries in Lahore as a result of rain-related incidents.
“Rescue 1122 received 10 emergency calls about collapsing walls in different parts of the city,” the statement read. “One woman was killed and 10 others were seriously injured. They were moved to different hospitals and received medical aid in Rescue Emergency ambulances.”
The statement added that there were also reports of falling trees across Lahore due to strong winds and rain, however, there were no fatalities or injuries.
“Rescue 1122 staff are present at the highways and are removing fallen trees from the roads,” the statement added.
However, in a separate report, Rescue 1122 said that a billboard fell due to the intense rain and wind and fell on a motorcyclist and his family in Lahore.
According to Rescue 1122, the 50-year-old motorcyclist was killed, while his 35-year-old wife and child were injured, bringing the overall death toll to eight. The injured were transported to Jinnah Hospital.

In Karachi, two people, including the younger brother of former lawmaker and PPP Karachi leader Javed Nagori, were electrocuted in rain-related incidents, according to officials and relatives.
City Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Arif Aziz told Dawn.com that Abdullah Anwar, 41, was sitting at a meeting place in Khadda Market near Sumair Arcade in Lyari, where an electric wire had fallen.
He said Anwar attempted to plug something into a rainwater-drenched wall socket when he suffered an electric shock and died. The SSP said the victim was dead with the wire in his hand when the police arrived.
The body was moved to the Civil Hospital Karachi, where doctors confirmed the cause of death as an electric shock, said police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
Nagori, while speaking briefly to Dawn.com, confirmed that the victim was his younger brother.
In another incident, a young man was electrocuted in the metropolis’ Clifton area. Boat Basin Police Station House Officer Malik Riaz Niazi said the man, in his early 30s, was passing by the Parklane Hospital when he apparently touched a wet electric pole and suffered an electric shock.
The body was moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal formalities, where his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
Earlier in the day, rescue official Sherbaz Khan confirmed to Dawn.com that two sisters died after being swept away by flood waters in the Kargah Nala of Gilgit Baltistan.
Meanwhile, in Punjab’s Sharifpura, two people were killed and one injured when the roof of a mud house collapsed. The bodies and the injured were shifted to Services Hospital, according to Rescue 1122.
Heavy rains were recorded in various districts of Punjab over the past 24 hours, according to Irfan Ali Kathia, Director General of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Lahore Airport recorded 65 mm of rain, while 32mm was recorded in Chakwal and 14mm in Dera Ghazi Khan 14. Rain was also recorded in Attock, Noorpur, Thal, Narowal, Kasur, Jhang, Toba, Tek Singh, Bhakkar and Khanewal.
“This spell of monsoon rain will likely continue until July 1,” Kathia was quoted as saying.
“Monsoon rains are also expected across most districts of Punjab in the next 24 hours,” he said.
The DG urged citizens to take precautionary measures and stay in safe places during thunderstorms.
“Keep the speed of the vehicle slow and maintain a reasonable distance. In case of emergency, contact PDMA helpline 1129.”
Wasa Lahore instructed to be on full alert amid heavy rainfall
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed the Water and Sewage Authority (Wasa) to remain on full alert in Lahore as heavy rains and strong winds began in various parts of the city.
Rain was recorded in Lakshmi Chowk, Qurtaba Chowk, Mazang, Data Nagar, Islampura, Shahdara, Ek Moria, Bhati Gate, Baghbanpura and Gulshan Ravi.
The Punjab CM directed senior Wasa officials to keep all main highways and underpasses clear, with pumps and staff ready at all underpasses.
Instructions were issued to keep all generators on standby with their fuel supply ensured, while field teams were instructed to remain active.
 






It was recommended that disposal stations be run on generators in areas with power outages, with the pumps of all disposal stations being kept clean and operational.
All town directors were directed to maintain complete monitoring of their towns.
Glof warning issued in Gilgit
The GB Disaster Management Authority issued a warning of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and flash floods.
“Due to intense heat and the western weather system, the ice in the glaciers of GB is melting rapidly, resulting in an increased risk of glacial floods and flash floods.
 
 

“This situation can pose a serious threat to communication roads, bridges, agricultural lands and human life and property,” the alert said.
The public and tourists were requested to ensure their safety and avoid unnecessary travel in extreme or uncertain weather conditions.
They were also advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.
“The public is urged to avoid staying unnecessarily on glaciers, river banks or bridges, cross floodwaters on foot or any vehicle, and remember the instructions issued by rescue agencies.”
The district administration reiterated in its alert that natural disasters can strike at any time, and necessary precautions should be undertaken.  “In case of any emergency, immediately contact the district control room at 920724-05811.”</p><small>2025-06-29 19:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/292312275f910f6.png?r=231328' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921034/indian-defence-attache-claims-paf-downed-indian-fighter-jets-because-of-political-leaderships-constraints' target='_blank'><strong>Indian defence attache claims PAF downed Indian fighter jets because of ‘political leadership’s constraints’</strong></a><br><p>An Indian defence attache has claimed that the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) shot down six Indian Air Force (IAF) fighter aircraft “only because of the constraint given by the political leadership to not attack the military establishment or their air defences”, Indian news outlet The Wire reported on Sunday.
Earlier this month, the PAF confirmed that six IAF jets were shot down late on the night of May 7, after India launched missiles at six Pakistani sites, including in Sialkot and Bahawalpur, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
Three of the downed fighters were French-made Dassault Rafales.
This military confrontation took place after New Delhi, without evidence, blamed Islamabad for backing terrorists who killed 26 tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam in April — an allegation that Islamabad denied.
According to The Wire, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, Indian Navy Captain Shiv Kumar, while speaking at a seminar in Indonesia last month, acknowledged that the PAF downed the Indian fighters.
 


During his presentation at the event, Kumar acknowledged the loss of Indian planes, though he said he “may not agree [with an earlier Indonesian speaker’s claim] that we lost so many aircraft”.
“After the loss, we changed our tactics and we went for the military installations. So, we first achieved suppression of enemy air defences and then that’s why all our attacks could easily go through using Brahmos missiles,” the Indian defence attache added, referring to Indian missile strikes on Pakistani bases on the night of May 9 and 10.
According to Kumar, IAF fighter jets were “operating under strict political orders from the Modi government not to target Pakistani military installations or air defence systems”, The Wire reported.
“This self-imposed limitation by the government was intended to prevent escalation of conflict in a nuclear environment,” the outlet added, quoting the Indian officer. “It was possibly based on the premise that the Pakistan military would not target Indian fighter aircraft flying in the Indian airspace, when India was not hitting any Pakistani military targets.”
Kumar inferred that the restrictions imposed by New Delhi led to the loss of IAF jets since Pakistan “refused to impose any such limitations”.
“The political directions had meant that IAF had to carry out their missions while deliberately avoiding the most threatening enemy assets, which are typically prioritised in air campaigns to secure air superiority,” The Wire reported.
The Wire also reported that the Indian Embassy in Jakarta said Captain Kumar’s remarks had been “taken out of context” in a statement.
“We have seen media reports regarding a presentation made by the defence attache at a seminar. His remarks have been quoted out of context and the media reports are a misrepresentation of the intention and thrust of the presentation made by the speaker,” The Wire wrote.
“The presentation conveyed that the Indian Armed Forces serve under civilian political leadership, unlike some other countries in our neighbourhood,” the outlet continued. “It was also explained that the objective of Operation Sindoor was to target terrorist infrastructure, and the Indian response was non-escalatory.”</p><small>2025-06-29 18:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29234745c9b3382.jpg?r=234837' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921038/trump-blasts-communist-winner-of-new-york-mayoral-democratic-primary' target='_blank'><strong>Trump blasts ‘communist’ winner of New York mayoral Democratic primary</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump branded the winner of New York City’s mayoral Democratic primary a “pure communist” in remarks that aired Sunday, an epithet the progressive candidate dismissed as political theatrics.
Zohran Mamdani’s shock win last week against a scandal-scarred political heavyweight resonated as a thunderclap within the party, and drew the ire of Trump and his collaborators, who accused Mamdani of being a radical extremist.
The Republican’s aggressive criticism of the self-described democratic socialist is sure to ramp up over the coming months as Trump’s party seeks to push Democrats away from the political centre and frame them as too radical to win major US elections.
“He’s pure communist” and a “radical leftist … lunatic,” Trump fumed on Fox News talk show ‘Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo’. “I think it’s very bad for New York,” added Trump, who grew up in the city and built his sprawling real estate business there.
“If he does get in, I’m going to be president and he is going to have to do the right thing [or] they’re not getting any money” from the federal government.
Trump’s White House has repeatedly threatened to curb funding for Democratic-led US cities if they oppose his policies, including cutting off money to so-called sanctuary cities, which limit their cooperation with
immigration authorities.
 
 

Mamdani also took to the talk shows on Sunday, asserting he would “absolutely” maintain New York’s status as a sanctuary city so that “New Yorkers can get out of the shadows and into the full life of the city that they belong to.”
Asked directly on NBC’s ‘Meet the Press’ whether he is a communist, Mamdani — a 33-year-old immigrant aiming to become New York’s first Muslim mayor — responded, “No, I am not.
“And I have already had to start to get used to the fact that the president will talk about how I look, how I sound, where I’m from, who I am, ultimately because he wants to distract from what I’m fighting for,” Mamdani said.
“I’m fighting for the very working people that he ran a campaign to empower, that he has since then betrayed.”
 


The Ugandan-born state assemblyman had trailed former governor Andrew Cuomo in polls but surged on a message of lower rents, free daycare and buses, and other populist ideas in the notoriously expensive metropolis.
Although registered Democrats outnumber Republicans three to one in New York, victory for Mamdani in November is not assured.
Current Mayor Eric Adams is a Democrat but is campaigning for re-election as an independent, while Cuomo may also run unaffiliated.</p><small>2025-06-29 18:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611593-heres-a-list-of-countries-where-pakistanis-can-now-travel-without-visa' target='_blank'><strong>Here's a list of countries where Pakistanis can now travel without visa</strong></a><br><p>

On June 28, 2009, Deen Mohammad Baloch was reported missing after he was allegedly picked up by unknown men from the hospital where he worked in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district. A father of three, Dr Deen was one of the many Baloch people who have gone missing in the province — an issue that remains largely unaddressed, despite persistent pleas of their families, who still long for their loved ones to return, uncertain whether they are dead or alive.
According to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances (COIOED) — a governmental body set up in 2011 to trace missing persons — the total number of missing persons cases received up to December 2024 was 10,467, while 8,216 cases were disposed of, with a total of 6,599 people traced so far.
“In these 16 years, I have tried everything — protested on the streets since I was a child, endured violence at the hands of police, pleaded in front of courts, spent time in jail — just to find where my father is,” said Sammi, a social rights activist.

Addressing the audience at the gathering, Sammi, who was 10 when her father went missing, said: “I am still the same Sammi I was when my father was taken away, a grieving daughter who has been longing for her father’s return for 16 years now.
“Today, I find myself in the same position I was 16 years ago — restless, uncertain and stuck in a cycle of never-ending wait.”
Speaking of her years-long struggle, she said, “My slogans, my hope and the tears in my eyes have not changed over these years, but instead of justice, all I ever received from the state was deafening silence”.
 
 

And yet she remained hopeful of her father’s return, “My voice may get drowned out in the hubris, but my hope for my father’s return will never waver,” she said.
 
 

Speaking to Dawn.com, Sammi expressed despair about the future, alleging that “state repression of Baloch activists had intensified in recent months.”
“We don’t know when we might be picked up, jailed, or have a case filed against us.”
In March, Sammi was detained during a protest at the Karachi Press Club calling for the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) leaders arrested in Quetta, including group leader Mahrang Baloch. BYC is a Baloch rights advocacy group working since 2018.

‘Space for dialogue rapidly closing’
Speaking at the event, veteran journalist Mazhar Abbas raised alarm that the “space for political dialogue on the issue was rapidly closing”.
“A political matter should only be resolved through political means,” Abbas said, adding that sweeping issues under the carpet was “going to make matters worse”.
Journalist Wasatullah Khan cautioned that by doing nothing, “we are leaving the course of events to time itself.”
Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) President Asad Butt questioned how, in 16 years, the state had been unable to tell whether Dr Deen Mohammad is alive.
Butt urged people to stand with the Baloch cause, stating that the even if one person was missing, it raised serious questions about the entire justice system, adding that “remaining silent in the face of such injustice is a cruelty in itself”.</p><small>2025-06-29 18:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611584-in-call-with-coas-irans-military-chief-thanks-pakistan-for-support-amid-israeli-aggression' target='_blank'><strong>In call with COAS, Iran's military chief thanks Pakistan for support amid Israeli aggression</strong></a><br><p>

According to Station House Officer (SHO) Syed Khurshid Ali, a complaint was filed and the victim’s statement was recorded, in which he alleged that he was sexually assaulted by his teacher and was injured.
“The complaint was registered by the victim’s uncle, and the suspect was arrested,” the SHO told Dawn.com.
“A first information report will be lodged under Section 53 (sexual abuse) of the CPA (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Child Protection Act), and a medical report will be obtained,” he added. “However, the victim provided us with bloodstained clothes, which indicate that he was assaulted.”
The SHO said that further investigation was underway.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from all four provinces, Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) in the year 2024, according to a civil society report.
The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” Sahil said.</p><small>2025-06-29 17:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/292032372dc0f0b.jpg?r=203533' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921024/mclarens-norris-cuts-piastris-lead-with-one-two-win-in-austria' target='_blank'><strong>Mclaren’s Norris cuts Piastri’s lead with one-two win in Austria</strong></a><br><p>Lando Norris won the Austrian Grand Prix from pole position in a McLaren one-two on Sunday after fending off championship-leading team mate Oscar Piastri in an early wheel-to-wheel duel and then withstanding intense pressure to the end.
The Briton’s third victory of the season cut Australian Piastri’s Formula One lead from 22 to 15 points after 11 of 24 rounds, with the two McLaren drivers locked in an increasingly private title battle.
Charles Leclerc completed the podium for Ferrari with teammate Lewis Hamilton fourth and George Russell, last year’s winner in Austria, fifth for Mercedes.
Red Bull’s four-time world champion Max Verstappen suffered his first retirement of the season, in his team’s home race, after a first-lap collision with Mercedes’s Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli.
The Dutch driver stayed third overall but is now 61 points behind Piastri in the championship standings.
“Tricky, hot, tiring,” said Norris after stepping out of the car at the finish of the 70-lap race on a sweltering Sunday. “A lot of stress but a lot of fun. A nice battle, so well done to Oscar.
“Hopefully it was a nice one for everyone to watch, but inside the car it was tough, especially when he was in DRS (drag reduction range).” Piastri, who seized second place from Leclerc after an aborted first start, set the fastest lap of the race.
He took the lead momentarily on lap 11 in an intense battle, but Norris grabbed it straight back in a duel that risked a repeat of the collision between the pair at the previous race in Canada.
Norris caused that one, and came away empty-handed, but this time it was Piastri who had the McLaren bosses shifting uneasily on the pitwall when he locked up with a puff of smoke on lap 20 while seeking to sneak through on the inside.
New Zealander Liam Lawson took a career-best finish in sixth for Racing Bulls with Fernando Alonso seventh for Aston Martin — the Spaniard finishing ahead of Sauber’s Brazilian rookie Gabriel Bortoleto.
The points were Bortoleto’s first in F1 and to make it even sweeter, Sauber took a double points finish, with Nico Hulkenberg finishing ninth. Hulkenberg was the first Sauber driver since Valtteri Bottas in 2022 to score in three races in a row.
Esteban Ocon took the final point for Haas.
McLaren are 207 points clear of Ferrari, who moved back up to second in the absence of team boss Fred Vasseur, who had to return home for personal reasons, in the constructors’ championship.</p><small>2025-06-29 16:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611564-pm-shehbaz-chaudhry-nisar-discuss-countrys-political-situation' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz, Chaudhry Nisar discuss country's political situation</strong></a><br><p>

Trump made the remarks in an interview on Fox News programme ‘Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo’ and said that the deal he is developing would probably need China’s approval to move forward, predicting that Chinese President Xi Jinping would likely approve it.
The US president earlier this month extended a deadline for China-based ByteDance to divest the US assets of TikTok to September 17, despite a law that mandated a sale or shutdown without significant progress.
A deal had been in the works this spring that would have spun off TikTok’s US operations into a new US-based firm — majority-owned and operated by US investors — but it was put on hold after China indicated it would not approve it following Trump’s announcements of steep tariffs on Chinese goods.
“We have a buyer for TikTok, by the way,” Trump said. “I think I’ll need probably China’s approval. I think President Xi will probably do it.”
 


A 2024 US law required TikTok to stop operating by January 19, unless ByteDance had completed divesting the app’s US assets or demonstrated significant progress toward a sale.
Trump, who credits the app with boosting his support among young voters in last November’s presidential election, has extended the deadline three times.</p><small>2025-06-29 15:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/2920205119a74a3.jpg?r=202340' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921023/strike-shuts-down-bangladeshs-biggest-port' target='_blank'><strong>Strike shuts down Bangladesh’s biggest port</strong></a><br><p>Operations at Bangladesh’s biggest port were suspended on Sunday as a strike by customs officials brought shipping activity to a halt.
The shutdown at Chittagong Port is part of an ongoing dispute between tax authority employees and the government, which is trying to overhaul the body.
“The port typically handles around 7,000 to 8,000 containers daily … But since this morning, there has been no movement in offloading or onboarding of goods,” said Mohammed Omar Faruq, secretary of the Chittagong Port Authority.
“This is having a huge impact on the country’s economic situation,” he told
AFP.
Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest garment manufacturer, while textile and garment production accounts for about 80 per cent of the country’s exports.
Mahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, said the halt in port operations would cost the industry $222 million.
“The cost of recovery will be staggering — beyond comprehension — and many factories risk going bankrupt,” he told AFP.
Staff at the National Board of Revenue (NBR) have been striking on and off for weeks over plans to split the authority into two separate bodies.
Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, urged them to end the walkout.
“We hope NBR’s staff will report back to work, setting aside their unlawful programme that goes against the national interest of the country,” his office said in a statement. “Otherwise, for the sake of the people of this country and safeguarding the economy, the government will be left with no option but to act firmly.”
NBR staff were prevented from entering their offices on Sunday after a government order sought to stop them from protesting within their building premises.
Meanwhile, 13 business chambers held a press conference on Saturday, urging the government to resolve the issue as soon as possible.</p><small>2025-06-29 15:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611557-more-rains-thundershowers-predicted-from-july-28-31' target='_blank'><strong>NDMA issues urban flood warning as more rains, thundershowers predicted</strong></a><br><p>

The accident in Sabasaba, in the Kilimanjaro region, on Saturday evening occurred after one of the bus’s tyres punctured, causing the driver to lose control.
“A total of 38 people died in the crash, including two women,” a presidency statement said, adding that 28 others were wounded.
“However, due to the extent of the burns, 36 bodies remain unidentified,” the presidency said.
Six of the injured were still in hospital for treatment, it added.
Deadly crashes are frequent on Tanzania’s roads.
In a 2018 report, the World Health Organization estimated that 13,000 to 19,000 people in Tanzania were killed in traffic accidents in 2016, far higher than the government’s official toll of 3,256.</p><small>2025-06-29 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/291851214ae4243.png?r=185331' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921018/peace-committee-leader-among-3-gunned-down-in-lakki-marwat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Peace committee leader among 3 gunned down in Lakki Marwat: police</strong></a><br><p>The leader of a peace committee and two of his companions were shot dead by terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Sunday, according to police officials.
The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Lakki Marwat, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
Shahid Khan, a spokesperson for Lakki Marwat police, told Dawn.com that the head of the Shahab Khel peace committee was heading to Qabol Khel when he was attacked in the Kara Wanda area.
“The peace committee chief Ghulam Dastagir alias Fauji and his friends Saleem Khan and Salahuddin were killed,” Shahid told Dawn.com. “A search operation was launched in the area after the incident.”
Peace committee officials in KP have been targeted in the past by terrorists. In April, there were two incidents targeting peace committees, one of which was in Lakki Marwat.
On April 29, a fierce gun battle was reported between members of a local peace committee and suspects — who allegedly killed an elderly man and wounded his relatives — in the district’s Begukhel area.
Earlier in April, a blast at a peace committee office in the South Waziristan district on Monday killed at least seven people, police and health officials said.
Wana City police Station House Officer (SHO) Usman Nazir told Dawn.com that seven people were killed and 16 others were also injured in the blast, which took place around 11am on April 26.
“Five of the injured were in critical condition,” he said. “The peace committee office was the target, as there was a meeting going on there at the time of the explosion.”
The SHO added that peace committee member Saifur Rehman was injured in the attack, “but his condition was not critical”.</p><small>2025-06-29 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29181921ecf7bea.jpg?r=182049' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921016/50pc-increase-in-fixed-gas-charges-notified-for-domestic-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>50pc increase in fixed gas charges notified for domestic consumers</strong></a><br><p>The government on Sunday notified a 50 per cent increase in fixed gas charges for domestic consumers, according to a notification from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
On Friday, the federal cabinet’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1. The ECC decided to increase fixed charges by 50pc for domestic consumers and shift the partial burden to bulk, power sector and industrial consumers.
According to the Ogra notification,  seen by Dawn.com, fixed charges for domestic consumers in the Protected category have risen to Rs600 from Rs400, while those in the non-protected category have to pay Rs1,500 as opposed to the previous charge of Rs1,000.
For non-protected consumers exceeding consumption of 1.5 cubic hectometres (hm³), the price has risen to Rs3,000 from Rs2,000.
Though the fixed charges have been increased, the price of gas itself has not risen, according to the notification. The sale prices for both Protected and Non-protected consumers remain the same. Additionally, gas prices for tandoors, commercial units, compressed natural gas and ice factories remain unchanged.
However, gas prices for general industries, power stations and independent power producers have risen.
Last month, Ogra determined about 6.6pc (Rs117 per unit) increase in prescribed natural gas prices to meet about Rs890 billion revenue requirement of the two gas companies during 2025-26.
In a determination sent to the federal government, Ogra worked out the average revenue requirement for Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) at Rs354bn for the next fiscal year and determined its prescribed price at Rs1,659 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) or about Rs104 per unit reduction from Rs1,762 per mmBtu in FY25.</p><small>2025-06-29 13:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611543-at-least-20-dead-in-kp-rains-as-crackdown-on-illegal-riverbed-hotels-launched-after-swat-tragedy' target='_blank'><strong>Crackdown initiated against Swat's illegal riverbed hotels as 20 dead in KP rains</strong></a><br><p>

All but one of the 242 people on board the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner were killed when it crashed in the western city of Ahmedabad on June 12. Authorities have identified 19 others who died on the ground, but a police source told AFP after the crash that the toll was 38.
India’s minister of state for civil aviation, Murlidhar Mohol, said the investigation was looking at “all angles” when asked specifically about possible “sabotage”, in an interview with Indian news channel NDTV.
“It has never happened before that both engines have shut off together,” Mohol said earlier in the interview, in reference to theories by some experts of possible dual-engine failure.
The minister added that until the investigation report is published, it would be premature to comment on the cause.
The team appointed to investigate the crash started extracting data from the plane’s cockpit voice and flight data recorders this week, in an attempt to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the disaster.
Air India has said that the plane was “well-maintained” and that the pilots were accomplished flyers.</p><small>2025-06-29 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/291404061d21ca8.jpg?r=140959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921004/pm-launches-app-that-allows-power-users-to-send-their-meter-readings-to-power-companies' target='_blank'><strong>PM launches app that allows power users to send their meter readings to power companies</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday formally inaugurated the ‘Apna Meter, Apna Reading’ power smart mobile application — an initiative aimed at promoting transparency in the billing process by allowing consumers to take their own meter readings and send them to their respective power companies.
The initiative aims to phase out the role of meter readers in power distribution companies (Discos) across the country amid frustration by power consumers. The current pro rata system removes electricity consumers from the ‘protected category’ or pushes them into the next slab, leading to higher bills.
Speaking at a ceremony to launch the app, the prime minister said the initiative is a revolutionary step undertaken by the government as part of power sector reforms over the past year.
“We implemented reforms in the power sector, but we have a long way to go. We brought merit-based appointments to the boards of Discos, and took strong action against the corrupt mafia,” he said.
PM Shehbaz said that the minister of energy made stringent efforts and held tough negotiations with independent power producers (IPP) that eventually led to reduction in electricity prices by Rs7.5 per unit.
“We settled circular debt after negotiations with banks. When global oil prices were falling, we took advantage and reduced electricity prices,” he said, adding that despite concerns, the government made the tough decision to rebase prices and not pass the burden to consumers.
The prime minister announced that the Pakistan Television (PTV) fee will be abolished from electricity bills. Consumers are currently charged Rs35 monthly PTV fee through electricity bills.
PM Shehbaz said the biggest challenge is power theft worth Rs500bn annually, and efforts are being made to curb the menace.
He reaffirmed that the government will not discourage solar power as it is the cheapest form of electricity. “Pakistan is one of the countries with the largest growth in solar energy production,” he said.
He said the main beneficiary of this app will be the power consumers. “It is a revolutionary technology, it will benefit every consumer in every home,”  adding that the power division should raise awareness among consumers to use the app, which has been introduced in five languages.
 






Federal Minister of Energy Awais Ahmed Leghari also spoke on the occasion and said the initiative aims to give the responsibility of the meter reader to the consumers.
He said power consumers under the ‘protected category’ consuming less than 100 units received higher bills due to delayed or flawed meter reading. He said the government returned Rs10bn in overbilled amounts last year and efforts are being made to ensure transparency in the billing process.
In a statement earlier, the Power Division said the new feature allows electricity consumers to take a picture of their electricity meter on a specified date and upload it to the app, based on which their monthly bill will be issued.
The aim of this system is to provide an effective solution to long-standing problems such as overbilling, reading errors and delay in reading.
“This is not just a technology feature but a concrete reform in governance, which truly empowers consumers. With this system, consumers will not only be able to keep track of their bills, but now they will also be the guardians of the reading process,” it added.
According to the salient features of the app, if the user provides the reading on the due date, the meter reading taken after that day will not be given priority, and only the reading provided by the user will be fed.
This system is especially beneficial for those consumers who are eligible for a government subsidy. The bill for consumers consuming up to 200 units of electricity is about Rs2,330, but with an increase of just one unit, the bill reaches Rs8,104.
“Through this app, it will be possible to ensure that the beneficiaries benefit from their subsidy by providing timely readings,” the statement read.
“This will not only create transparency in the electricity system but will also allow consumers to monitor their own billing. This will significantly reduce overbilling, unnecessary interference and complaints,” the power division concluded.</p><small>2025-06-29 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/291652079b50d83.jpg?r=165349' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921014/2-terrorists-killed-2-arrested-in-balochistans-duki-district-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>2 terrorists killed, 2 arrested in Balochistan’s Duki district: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces on Sunday killed two terrorists and apprehended two others during an operation in Balochistan’s Duki district, a statement from the military’s media wing said.
The statement, issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), said that security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the area upon the suspected presence of terrorists..
During the operation, security forces “effectively engaged the Indian-sponsored terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, two Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell, while two terrorists were apprehended,” the ISPR said.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were seized from the dead terrorists, who, according to the military’s media wing, remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the statement concluded.
Earlier this month, seven terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan were neutralised in two separate operations in Balochistan, the military’s media wing said.
An IBO was conducted in the general area of Mach in Kachhi district on the reported presence of the terrorists, the ISPR said.
“During the conduct of operation, [the] troops effectively engaged the Fitna al Hindustan terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the statement said.
In another IBO conducted in the general area of Margand in Kalat district, a terrorist hideout was busted and two terrorists were successfully neutralised, ISPR said.
Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India last month, militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country, according to data released by an Islamabad-based independent think tank.
The monthly security assessment issued by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) recorded 85 militant attacks in May as compared to 81 in April, resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.</p><small>2025-06-29 12:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29150342540f37d.jpg?r=151933' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921005/president-declares-justice-dogar-senior-most-ihc-judge-in-revised-seniority-list' target='_blank'><strong>President declares Justice Dogar senior-most IHC judge in revised seniority list</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday declared Justice Sarfaraz Dogar the “senior-most judge” of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), according to a fresh seniority list released by the Ministry of Law and Justice.
The development followed the Supreme Court’s verdict on June 19, declaring the transfer of IHC judges constitutional and referring the matter of seniority determination to the president. Earlier this year, the law ministry’s transfer of three judges to the IHC had disrupted the seniority list.
On Friday, however, five judges of the IHC challenged the SC’s decision to uphold the transfer of three judges —  Justice Sardar Dogar from the Lahore High Court (LHC), Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court (SHC), and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court (BHC).
According to the latest seniority list, Justice Dogar was designated as the most senior judge of the IHC, while the two other judges, Justice Soomro and Justice Asif, were ranked 9th and 11th, respectively.
President Zardari also declared that the status of the transfer of all three judges would be permanent.
The controversy had begun on Feb 20 when five IHC judges — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — had filed a representation, contending that under the Constitution, a high court judge must take a new oath upon transfer to a different high court, which should affect their seniority ranking.
 
 

According to the petition, the inter se seniority of the transferred judges should be determined from the date they took oath as justices of the IHC. Consequently, they should be placed lower in the seniority list than the petitioner judges.
The five judges also did not attend Justice Dogar’s oath-taking ceremony as the acting IHC chief justice.</p><small>2025-06-29 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611524-pm-shehbaz-vows-not-to-discourage-solarisation-boom-pledges-relief-for-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz vows not to discourage solarisation boom, pledges relief for consumers</strong></a><br><p>

At least 19 people have been killed and six others injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid heavy rains and the consequent flash floods and landslides, according to data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
KP Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Bilal Faizi said the child’s body was recovered from Charsadda and shifted to a hospital.
“He will be shifted to his native area in an ambulance,” Faizi said.
“One person remains missing and a search operation is underway.”
According to Faizi, a total of 17 people were reported missing on Friday when torrential flash floods triggered by heavy rains affected several areas in Swat and Malakand divisions.
Four people were rescued, while 11 bodies had been recovered. Today, a 12th body was recovered, leaving one person who remains missing.
Separately, the body of a young man who drowned in a flooded river in Lower Dir two days ago has been recovered in Charsadda, according to Faizi.
“The rescue team had been conducting continuous search operations for the past two days, after which the body was found,” Faizi said.
In yet another incident, two youth drowned in the Indus River in Balyani Akazai in KP’s Hazara division.
According to rescue spokesperson Rabnawaz Yousufzai, one youth jumped into the river to cool off from the heat. A second youth saw him drowning and jumped in to rescue him, but both were swept away by the strong current.
A third youth also jumped in to save his companions but was unsuccessful and barely managed to return to the river bank.
Following the incident, locals are helping search for the missing bodies.
More rains, floods expected across KP in next 24-48 hours
More rain is expected in the next 24-48 hours across most districts of KP, according to a statement from KP PDMA.
Flooding is expected in Swat, Chitral, Abbotabad, Mansehra, Peshawar, Bannu and Waziristan. An increase in the water level is expected in Swat River and Panjokra River and its tributaries, PDMA said.
Low-level flooding is expected in the Kabul River over the next 48 hours.
“Land sliding and flooding in local rivers and canals is likely in mountainous areas. PDMA has issued alerts to district administrations to take precautionary  measures,” the statement said.
Rescue 1122 and other relief teams have been directed to utilise all available resources.
PDMA has directed local administration to control traffic at sensitive places and highways, as well as direct travelers on national highways and provincial highways to take precaution. It was also directed that alternative routes be made for traffic flow.
“Ensure the cleanliness of rivers and drains and drainage systems to avoid urban flooding,” PDMA said.
The public was requested to take shelter in safe places during wind, hail and thunderstorms, while institutions were directed to disseminate weather alerts in local languages.
Farmers were directed to harvest crops early and store them in safe places, while cattle farmers were directed to protect their livestock.
“PDMA’s Emergency Operations Center is fully functional.

The appeal was filed on Saturday, two days before the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s (JCP) meeting to appoint chief justices to at least three high courts on July 1.
In its judgement anno­unced on June 19, the Supreme Court’s Const­itutional Bench, had held by a majority of 3-2 that the transfer of three judges to IHC from Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan high cou­rts was within the framework of the Constitution.
The Constitutional Ben­ch had also partially sent the matter to the president to determine seniority amongst judges, based on their service records.
Now, IHC’s justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz, who originally challenged the transfers, have filed an intra-court appeal (ICA) against the June 19 judgement.
The ICA, jointly moved by senior counsel Muneer A. Malik and Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, urged the court to set aside the order in the interest of justice.
While the appeal is heard, the Supreme Court should grant an interim relief against the judgment, the applicants pleaded.
The five judges have requested the Supreme Court not to consider justices Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Muhammad Asif as judges of IHC until they take fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194 Justice Dogar is also the acting chief justice of IHC.
The appeal contended that Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010 only provides for the appointment of judges to the IHC from other provinces but makes no reference to transfers.
 
 

The appeal contended that the June 19 order impermissibly reads in “permanent” in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.
The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.
The order also failed to interpret of articles 200 and 175A, without scuttling and undermining the powers of JCP under Article 175A of the Constitution, the appeal argued adding the independence of judiciary does not allow bestowing onto the executive a much more expansive power than what the text of Article 200 and the foundational principles of constitutional law can bear.
The concept of federalism also mandates that the provincial authority’s role in the permanent filling of vacancies of judges must not be usurped, it added.
The June 19 judgment had partially remanded the matter to the president to determine the seniority after examining the service record of the transferred judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether these transfers were permanent or temporary.
The powers of the president under Article 200(1) are two distinct provisions dealing with different situations and niceties and neither do they overlap nor override each other, the verdict explained, adding the transfer by the president by means of Article 200 cannot be construed as a fresh appointment, the judgment had held adding the powers of transfer conferred to the president by the framers of the Constitution cannot be questioned on the ground that if the posts were vacant in IHC then why they were not filled up by JCP through fresh appointments.

There were no immediate reports of casualties from the shallow quake, which USGS reported had occurred at around 3:30am with the epicentre almost 60 kilometres north-northeast of Barkhan city of Balochistan.
Senior levies officer Tuqeer Shah told Dawn.com that the Earthquake hit vast areas of Rara Shaim, Kingri and others.
According to initial reports, at least three people, including a couple, were injured in the Rara Shaim area of Barkhan after the roof of their house sustained damage. Over half a dozen houses have been damaged, while cracks have appeared in many others in Rara Shaim.
Shah added that the injured have been admitted to the hospital, while teams have been sent to the impacted areas to see the scope of the damage.
Pakistan straddles the boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, making the country susceptible to earthquakes.
The region can be challenging to navigate during crisis situations — in 2015, a 7.5-magnitude quake in Pakistan and Afghanistan killed almost 400 people across rugged terrain that impeded relief efforts.
The country was also hit by a 7.6-magnitude quake in 2005 that killed more than 73,000 people and left about 3.5 million homeless, mainly in Azad Kashmir.
Balochistan saw a quake in 2021 that killed at least 20 people and left more than 10 injured, with landslides hampering initial rescue efforts in the remote mountainous district of Harnai.</p><small>2025-06-29 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29115737e896b55.png?r=115837' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920986/71-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-tehrans-evin-prison-iranian-judiciary-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>71 killed in Israeli strike on Tehran’s Evin prison: Iranian judiciary spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s attack on the Evin prison in Iran’s capital, Tehran on June 23 killed 71 people, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Sunday.
At the end of an air war with Iran, Israel struck Tehran’s jail for political prisoners, in a demonstration that it was expanding its targets beyond military, civilian and nuclear sites to aim at symbols of Iran’s ruling system. According to Iranian health ministry figures, 610 people were killed on the Iranian side in the 12-day war, 13 of them children and 49 women, before a ceasefire went into effect last week.
“In the attack on Evin prison, 71 people were martyred, including administrative staff, youth doing their military service, detainees, family members of detainees who were visiting them and neighbours who lived in the prison’s vicinity,” Jahangir said in remarks carried on the judiciary’s news outlet Mizan.
 
 

Jahangir had previously said that part of Evin prison’s administrative building had been damaged in the attack, and people were killed and injured. The judiciary added that the remaining detainees had been transferred to other prisons in Tehran province.
Evin prison holds a number of foreign nationals, including two French citizens detained for three years.
“The strike targeting Evin prison in Tehran, put our citizens Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris in danger. It is unacceptable,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had said on social media X after the attack.

Lawmakers voted 51-49 to open debate on the 940-page megabill, with two of Trump’s fellow Republicans joining Democrats to oppose the legislation that would fund the president’s top immigration, border, tax-cut and military priorities.
Trump on social media hailed the “great victory” for his “great, big, beautiful bill”.
 


After hours of delay, during which Republican leaders and Vice President JD Vance worked behind closed doors to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the measure, Democrats demanded that the megabill first be read aloud in the chamber — a task that could delay the start of the debate until Sunday afternoon.
Democrats say the bill’s tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of social programs for lower-income Americans.
“Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don’t realise what’s in it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.
“Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish,” he said.
Once the bill has been read, lawmakers will begin up to 20 hours of debate on the legislation. That will be followed by a marathon amendment session, known as a “vote-a-rama,” before the Senate votes on passage. Lawmakers said they hoped to complete work on the bill on Monday.
 
 

Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Rand Paul voted against opening debate, a move that seemed for a time to be in danger of failing.
Trump attacked Tillis, who opposed the bill’s cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for lower-income Americans, which he said would be devastating for his native North Carolina. Tillis is up for reelection next year.
“Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against ‘Senator Thom’ Tillis. I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks,” the president posted.
Paul opposed the legislation because it would raise the federal borrowing limit on the $36.2 trillion US debt by an additional $5tr.
“Did Rand Paul Vote ‘NO’ again tonight? What’s wrong with this guy???” Trump said on social media.
In limbo
Saturday’s vote was in limbo for hours as Vance, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other top Republicans sought to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the legislation. It was not clear what deals, if any, were struck to win over their support.
Hardline Republican Senators Rick Scott, Mike Lee and Cynthia Lummis, who want deeper cuts in federal spending, voted to support the bill in the end. Another hardliner, Senator Ron Johnson, initially voted no but flipped his vote and backed the legislation.
Trump was monitoring the vote from the Oval Office late into the night, a senior White House official said.
The megabill would extend the 2017 tax cuts that were Trump’s main legislative achievement during his first term as president, cut other taxes and boost spending on the military and border security.
The nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee released an analysis projecting that the Senate bill’s tax provisions would reduce government revenue by $4.5tr over the next decade, increasing the $36.2tr US government debt.
The White House said this month the legislation would reduce the annual deficit by $1.4tr.
The world’s richest person, Elon Musk, also took a swipe at the bill, which would end tax breaks for the electric vehicles that his automaker Tesla manufactures.
Calling the bill “utterly insane and destructive,” he risked reigniting a feud with Trump that raged earlier this month, before Musk backed down from his rhetoric.
“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Musk wrote in a post on his social media platform X.
Medicaid changes
Republicans from states with large rural populations have opposed a reduction in state tax revenue for Medicaid providers, including rural hospitals. The newly released legislation would delay that reduction and would include $25 billion to support rural Medicaid providers from 2028 to 2032.
The legislation would raise the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes to $40,000 with an annual 1pc inflation adjustment through 2029, after which it would fall back to the current $10,000. The bill would also phase the cap down for those earning more than $500,000 a year.
That is a major concern of House Republicans from coastal states, including New York, New Jersey and California, who play an important role in keeping the party’s narrow House majority.
Republicans are using a legislative manoeuvre to bypass the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation in the 100-member chamber.
Democrats will focus their firepower with amendments aimed at reversing Republican spending cuts to programs that provide government-backed healthcare to the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as food aid to low-income families.
The bill also would raise the Treasury Department’s debt ceiling by trillions of dollars to stave off a potentially disastrous default on the nation’s debt in the coming months.
If the Senate passes the bill, it will then return to the House of Representatives for final passage before Trump can sign it into law. The House passed its version of the bill last month.</p><small>2025-06-29 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611490-tunisian-girl-set-to-be-repatriated-after-social-media-love-marriage-ends-in-divorce' target='_blank'><strong>Tunisian girl set to be repatriated after social media love marriage ends in divorce</strong></a><br><p>

The FIRs were lodged on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Riaz Ahmed of Okanwala police and the suspects were booked under sections 295-A and 298-C of the PPC and section 11 of Peca.
According to reports, a resident of Haseeb Town allegedly posted blasphemous content from his social media account, which subsequently went viral within the local community.
The content reportedly contained inflammatory sectarian comments, inciting discord among the residents of surrounding rural areas.
In the other incident, a resident of village 105/12-L was accused of sharing a video containing sectarian content and using hate speech against religious sects. Police claimed his mobile phone contained a video attacking revered religious figures.
Police started investigation but so far no arrest has been made in the cases.
BOOKED: A district and sessions judge booked ASI Maqsood Ahmed, a reader and two constables of the Yousafwala police for illegally detaining a citizen.
As per details, Shahid Ali, a resident of village 83/D Pakpattan, was returning home after a medical check-up when he was arrested by ASI Maqsood Ahmed near Ada Jahan Khan on June 22. The police officials also took two mobile phones and Rs10,000 cash from Shahid. His father, Abass Ali, inquired about the arrest but the police failed to satisfy him.
Later, his father filed a writ petition under section 491 in the court of D&SJ, Sahiwal. The court sent a ballif to Yousafwala police station and found that Shahid had been arrested in an old robbery case under section 288 of the PPC.
The judge found the case to be fake and also found the police record faulty and booked the officials under section 342 of the PPC and 155-C of Police Order for illegally detaining Shahid Ali. No arrest has been made so far by the police.

According to officials, a 17-year-old student reportedly suddenly developed fever, body aches and vomiting on June 25. A day later, he was admitted to the Aga Khan University Hospital where he tested positive for the deadly infection. On June 27, his condition deteriorated and he was shifted to ventilator support.
The patient had no history of swimming, the officials said and added that apparently he contracted the infection through the contaminated, or non-chlorinated, tap water.
According to experts, lack of filtration and chlorination of potable water is a major source of Naegleria’s infection. Besides, city’s water distribution system is faulty, allowing seepage of sewage in the domestic water supply lines, which in turn gets contaminated and causes harmful diseases.
Karachi recorded this year’s first death from Naegleria fowleri in March. The woman victim was a resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal and died at a private hospital in Karachi on Feb 23.
Commonly known as “brain-eating amoeba”, Naegleria fowleri is responsible for the disease called Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM). The infection is fatal in 98 per cent of the cases.
A free-living amoeba, Naegleria, is commonly found in warm fresh water (such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil. Only its one species, Naegleria fowleri, infects people. The germ cannot survive in cool, clean and chlorinated water.
It infects people when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose. This typically happens when people go swimming, diving, or when they put their heads under fresh water, like in lakes and rivers.
The amoeba then travels up the nose to the brain where it destroys the brain tissues and causes the PAM.
The first symptoms of the PAM usually start about five days after infection that may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Later symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, seizures, hallucinations, and coma.
After symptoms start, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within five days.

Information collected by this scribe about the excessive use of ecstasy pills and ice by local youth unfolds a horrifying situation as the drug is now considered an essential ‘ingredient’ in social gatherings like weddings, engagements and other festive or recreational ceremonies owing to its easy availability throughout Khyber.
Locals said that a majority of youth had gone out of the control of their parents or other family members as those two ‘lethal’ drugs were easily available in designated shops, kiosks, private houses and hujras and even outside educational institutions and sports grounds where those could be supplied through motorcycles or young carriers by using mobile phone service in all the three tehsils of Khyber.
Ghafoor Shah, a social activist in Landi Kotal, said that local drug addicts invented their own names for different types of ecstasy pills like Firoun, Trump, Kabaiga, Silver and Local, depending upon the ‘efficacy’ of those drugs.

Experts say effects of these drugs include hallucination, memory loss and psychosis

He said that such pills were openly offered to users during different types of parties at varying prices while reluctant or refusing youngsters were then ‘administered’ those pills either in a cool drink or green tea to make them addicts.
Ayaz Khan, a resident of Jamrud, told this scribe that initially parents were not aware about the negative effects of those drugs and ignored warnings by close relatives about addiction of their sons to ice and ecstasy pills but now they were mostly helpless to prevent such addicts from use of drugs.
Dr Feroz Shah, a health expert, was equally apprehensive about the spiralling use and sale of such lethal drugs and cautioned about serious health complications as their long term implications.
He said that excessive use of ecstasy pills mainly affected the central nervous system with short term or immediate effects such as increase in heartbeat, fast breathing and an addict becoming more alert, awake for a long time and talkative and in highly joyous mode.
“These are the signs and effects of these highly addictive pills, which attract most of our unemployed and depressed youth towards it with little or no knowledge of their worst side effects on their health,” he said.
He said that being highly addictive, long term effects of ecstasy pills could include depression, hallucination, memory loss, psychosis and other related mental issues among young users.
Dr Feroz Shah argued that most of addicts themselves or their relatives did not report those matters to doctors for possible treatment or therapy for fear of social stigma and lack of awareness about possible rehabilitation of addicts.
Sources said that absence of a specialist psychiatrist at the district headquarters hospital was hampering psychological treatment of such addicts as medical professionals contended that so far no proper medicine was discovered for treatment of such patients, except psychiatric counselling.
With Khyber police regularly claiming seizure of varying quantities of different types of illegal drugs, sources at Wazir Dhand market in Jamrud alleged that the illegal business was ‘thriving’ unhindered as police accepted ‘monthly’ from drug dealers.
They said that big time drug dealers ‘deputed’ their touts at different convenient points in the vicinity of Wazir Dhand market, situated on the border with Peshawar, to provide ice and ecstasy pills to interested buyers after issuing them a token for easy identification.
They said that currently Wazir Dhand market was considered the main ‘repository’ of illegal drugs including heroin, charas, ice and ecstasy pills with local police in complete knowledge of the daily ‘wheeling and dealing’ by dealers.
Replying to Dawn queries about the rise in use and sale of these drugs, DPO Rae Mazhar Iqbal claimed police seized huge quantity of drugs. He said that the menace could be wiped out with collective efforts.
