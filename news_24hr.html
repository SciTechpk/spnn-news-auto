The entrance was lined with food stalls which welcomed visitors with snacks and tea, while a man handed Rs100 entry tickets to oncoming vehicles for parking.
Inside the mandi, red tents near the entrance glowed under small chandeliers, while large pens stretched on for miles, filled with sacrificial animals.
From goats to sheep to oversized bulls and camels, the cattle market offered something for everyone.
However, amid the lively buzz of the mandi, what stood out the most were the soaring prices of the livestock.
Sellers quoted steep rates, as the price of cows jumped by several hundred thousand rupees within just a year, while healthy goats that cost Rs40,000 only two years ago were now being sold for Rs45,000 and above.
With transport, rent, and feed costs soaring, many struggle to keep up, and the spirit of sacrifice is increasingly overshadowed by steep price tags.

While economic indicators like inflation and remittances have shown improvement, prices at the cattle markets tell a different story.
According to the 2024 Pakistan Economic Survey (PES), the [livestock sector][5] accounted for approximately 61 per cent of the agriculture value added and 15pc of the GDP during FY24, with a growth rate of 3.8pc.
“The gross value addition of the livestock sector has shown an increase, rising to Rs5.8 trillion in 2023-24 from Rs5.59 trillion in 2022-23, marking a growth rate of 3.9pc,” stated the PES.
Despite this, however, sellers and buyers of sacrificial livestock are shouldering an economic burden, as these prices do not seem to drop.
One seller, Mohammad Abid, told Dawn.com that the prices of cattle vary depending on different sellers, mandis and factors related to the quality of cattle, as well as where the cattle are brought from.

“Cattle from Sindh would be cheaper as it is closer, while livestock from Punjab would be more expensive due to greater transportation costs,” he explained.
He also remarked on the increasing prices for goats over the past two years.
“In two years, there has been a Rs3,000 to Rs4,000 increase in the prices of goats,” he said. “If a goat cost Rs40,000 a year or two ago, it now costs between Rs43,000 and Rs45,000, with the highest price ranging from Rs50,000 to Rs70,000.”
Abid also opined that the government did not provide funds for the animals’ upkeep, stating, “Sellers must pay rent to set up their tents in the mandi.”

Another seller, Ibrahim, added that although the government had provided the space and electricity for generators and lights, they had to pay between Rs100,000 and Rs150,000 in rent every 10 days on top of bearing the cost of the animals’ food and water intake.
These prices reflected expenses like rent, feed, and caretaking — plus a profit margin — all of which are ultimately passed on to the customer.
“A cow worth Rs1.8 million last year now ranges between Rs2.3m to Rs2.5m. For more expensive animals, costing Rs2.5m to Rs3m, people may negotiate and take them for Rs1.8m to Rs1.9m,” Ibrahim highlighted. “Even with soaring prices, people are still willing to pay.”
Khurram Jameel, a customer who visited a few mandis to get an idea of the prices, said that he had seen cows sold for up to Rs7 million.
“I bought most of my cattle from a mandi near the Karachi-Hyderabad Super Highway,” he said, adding that he also had to pay Rs14,000 to transport the animals to the Defence Housing Authority, located on the other end of the city.
Jameel also agreed that rising prices had an impact on cattle-buying, but said it was also a matter of faith.
“This is Sunnat-i-Ibrahim and honestly, we enjoy it as Muslims,” he emphasised. “This is why it is called ‘Bari Eid’ — buy cattle yourselves, sacrifice them yourselves in your homes, take care of the animals and love them as we have been asked to do in our religion.
“If you are passionate about something, you do your best to get what you can.”

Despite complaints and disappointment over inflated prices, some customers echo similar sentiments, highlighting the true meaning of Eid and what it means to partake.
Another visitor at the mandi, Razia Abbasi, pointed out that the idea of a mandi had become more about “showing off wealth.”

“It’s become more of a show, a status symbol, as people believe the
bigger the better, even though it’s not a [part of] Islamic criteria
that you must get something bigger and more expensive,” she said.
“Qurbani (sacrifice) is what you can afford with an open heart, it
is not about showing off.”

She added that she mostly chose to buy Qurbani shares rather than only livestock.
“It is more affordable, costing between Rs38,000 and Rs39,000 for a share of a cow; though this has also increased from last year’s Rs32,000,” she said. “There is also the bonus of convenience as there is not always someone to take care of the animals, nor may there be space to keep them.”
In light of price surges, several customers said they now resorted to window shopping at mandis and opted to buy qurbani shares and search for cattle on online marketplaces for cheaper prices.
Yet, for some, the essence of Eidul Azha remains untouched as they keep in mind the deeper devotion behind the rising costs, but for how long can faith outweigh financial strain as prices climb consistently?

Pakis­tan had launched a broad-based engagement campaign in the United States to present its perspective on the recent spike in tensions with India, and counter New Delhi’s growing lobbying presence here.
The delegation comprises Senator Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
In New York, the delegation “drew attention to India’s illegal use of force and violations of international law, including the UN Charter and International Humanitarian Law, particularly targeting of civilian areas and killing of innocent civilians, including women and children”, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.
 






It added that the delegation rejected India’s allegations regarding the April 22 attack in India-occupied Kashmir “without a shred of evidence, and warned against India’s weaponisation of water through its unilateral hold on the IWT [Indus Waters Treaty] in violation of international law and treaty obligations”.
According to the statement, the delegation met with the UN secretary-general, the president of the General Assembly, the president of the Security Council, the representatives of the Security Council’s permanent and non-permanent members, ambassadors of the OIC Group, representatives of the media, civil society, and think tanks, and the Pakistani community.
 






Furthermore, the delegation highlighted the country’s role and commitment to combating terrorism in all forms, while also “drawing attention of the international community towards Indian-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan, and its transnational assassination campaign”.
“Cooperation, not politicisation, was required to effectively combat the menace of terrorism, it was underlined,” the statement said.
The delegation also emphasised the country’s responsible and lawful response to Indian aggression and provocations, adding that Pakistan “seeks peace but will always defend its sovereignty with resolve”.
It warned that Indian attempts to create a “new normal” that implied arbitrary and unilateral strikes could lead to disastrous consequences in South Asia’s nuclear environment, reiterating that peace in the region hinged on a just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in line with the UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“The international community was urged to uphold international law and the sanctity of treaties, push for the revival and normal functioning of the Indus Waters Treaty, and support the initiation of a comprehensive dialogue to resolve all outstanding issues between India and Pakistan, including the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir,” the statement read.
 






Speaking at a press conference at UN Headquarters, Bilawal said coope­ration between Pakistan and India’s intelligence agencies could significantly reduce terrorism in South Asia.
“I am completely confident that if ISI and RAW were ready to sit down and work together to fight these forces, we would see a significant decrease in terrorism in both India and Pakistan,” he added.
He also urged the global community to remain engaged in South Asia, warning that the risk of conflict between nuclear-armed neighbours had grown, not diminished, after the recent ceasefire.
“With the intervention of the international community — and I would like to mention particularly the role played by the US President Donald Trump and his team led by Secretary of State Marco Rubio — we did manage to achieve a ceasefire between India and Pakistan,” said Bilawal. “This is a welcome first step, but it’s only a first step.”
Pakistan praised globally for our kinetic actions: Dar
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, detailing PM Shehbaz’s recent multi-state visit, said the international community was lauding Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts.
“We are being praised for our kinetic actions”, he said, adding that Pakistan’s narrative was clear to the international community from the beginning and remained so until the resolution of the conflict.
While addressing a press conference, FM Dar said the delegation led by PM Shehbaz expressed gratitude for the support of countries to Pakistan throughout the period of tension, particularly Turkiye and Azerbaijan.
“People in Turkiye and Azerbaijan took to the streets to celebrate the resolution,” he said, noting that Pakistan’s victory was a victory for the entire Muslim community.
 


Appreciating Turkiye’s role in de-escalation efforts, he recalled that on the night of May 6, when India attacked, his Turkish counterpart was “the first one to call and ask if there is anything they can do for Pakistan”.
He further said that in the wake of the recent events, India’s “hegemony has been destroyed” and its supremacy “blown in the air”, adding that Indians were now blaming each other while Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts were being globally acknowledged.
SAPM Fatemi meets Putin’s foreign policy senior aide
Separately, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) Syed Tariq Fatemi called on Yury Ushakov, senior aide to the Russian president on foreign policy issues, and briefed him on the recent escalation in South Asia, outlining Pakistan’s position vis-à-vis India’s aggressive actions, especially unilaterally holding the IWT in abeyance.
“Besides these meetings, the SAPM gave two interviews to the leading Russian TV networks, expressing his candid views on the increasingly positive trends in Pakistan-Russia relations and recent escalation between Pakistan and India.
He also had an extensive exchange of views with a group of academics and journalists from prominent print and electronic media. Furthermore, the SAPM was hosted by Valdai Discussion Club, a prestigious think-tank in Moscow, for a talk on June 4, on the recent developments in South Asia and Pakistan-Russia relations.
“Overall, the visit of the SAPM was highly successful, with several important official engagements and candid exchanges with parliamentarians, a think tank, several academics and journalists. It paved the way to explicitly share Pakistan’s perspective on the recent situation and other important issues, such as IWT to the Russian side.
“There was widespread appreciation for the manner in which Pakistan was enhancing its relations with Russia, in important areas of trade, investment, energy and connectivity routes,” the FO said.

In the days leading up to his much-anticipated budget speech on the floor of the National Assembly, much is being discussed in the public domain on what could be and shouldn’t be on the government’s priority list.
At a pre-budget meeting last week, Aurangzeb promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and the documented sector to others through digitisation. He hinted at significant steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.
At a public event the same week, he also announced that the upcoming federal budget would introduce “bold measures” to steer the national economy in a strategic direction.
Dawn.com reached out to leading economists for their thoughts on the upcoming budget. Here’s what they had to say:
Not just a spreadsheet exercise
Ali Hasanain, associate professor of economics at the Lahore University of Management and Sciences, said that the government faces a uniquely narrow policy corridor as the country prepares to table its federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-26.
“On one side lie our binding fiscal constraints, which demand a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product) and steep revenue enhancements if we are to find a path out of our debt. On the other hand is a range of domestic and geopolitical pressures, from defence sector demands to the fallout of intensifying global tariff wars, particularly between the US and China.”
 
 

“The defence budget, though nominally growing, has shrunk dramatically in real terms over the past five years — by nearly $4.6 billion according to Jane’s Defence Budgets. Restoring defence purchasing power is a top priority, especially after recent skirmishes on Pakistan’s eastern border,” he stated, referring to the recent Pakistan-India escalation.
However, a knee-jerk reaction would be folly, Hasanain noted, adding that full nominal recovery of that spending would consume an additional 1.13pc of GDP — nearly the entire fiscal buffer painstakingly constructed under the International Monetary Fund programme. “Doing so risks derailing hard-won macroeconomic gains, would almost certainly crowd out critical social and development spending, and ultimately — due to its unsustainable nature —defeat the goal of sustainably improving our regional security outlook.”
“The government has shown its intent to broaden the tax base through new levies on retailers, wholesalers, and petroleum sales, while also offering some relief to the salaried class. These are steps in the right direction, but they will test political capital and administrative capacity alike,” the academic commented.
At the same time, he highlighted that the global trade environment is darkening. With the US and EU considering tariff escalations on Chinese electric vehicles and other AI-intensive exports, Pakistan must prepare for further volatility. “We should be creating fiscal space to reposition our export sectors, attract diverted FDI, and invest in logistics and trade facilitation. A budget that is locked into the past — whether via subsidies or unreformed pensions — risks missing the window to adapt.”
“In short, this budget is not just a spreadsheet exercise. It is a test of vision. Pakistan must demonstrate that it can meet its defence needs without compromising its economic future — and that it is ready to claim a place in the new global industrial realignment. That will require discipline, but also courage to prioritise what builds long-term resilience over short-term optics,” Hasanain added.
Towards a private-sector-oriented economy
“The upcoming budget will continue to prioritise macroeconomic stability,” said macroeconomist Ammar H Khan. “It is expected that the budget will continue to focus on maintaining a primary surplus, while utilising available room in financing costs to reallocate the same to incremental defence allocation, and infrastructure development.”
He emphasised that rationalising expenditures should remain a key priority; any laxity in this regard can lead to higher deficits and, eventually, higher debt to finance.
“Any adventures in extracting growth through higher government spending, or import-driven consumption, may lead to a short-lived growth spurt followed by another few years of low-to-no growth,” Khan said. “Macroeconomic stabilisation should be prioritised, and a move away from import-driven consumption-oriented growth, to an investment-driven and export-oriented growth model is the only way forward.”
“A potential tariff liberalisation regime, wherein excess duties and tariffs are expected to be either completely removed or rationalised, can be a highlight for the budget, as that would signal a shift away from a protected trade regime, to a more export-oriented regime,” he stated, adding that taxes on imports are effectively taxed on exports, and rationalising the same is the only way forward if “we want to move towards an export-oriented growth structure”.
 
 

The evolving composition of tax revenues would be critical, the macroeconomist noted. “Any excess reliance on salaried employees, or higher indirect taxes, is only going to expand the informal economy, while chipping away at any efforts for deepening the tax net,” he explained, adding that the current taxation structure is regressive at best, actively discouraging any value addition.
“It makes more economic sense to evade the tax net by producing low-value-added products, as any transition towards higher value-added attracts a significant tax, which makes the business uncompetitive. Similarly, the tax delta that exists between the formal and informal economy is substantial, which penalises entrepreneurs taking risks,” he explained. “One expects that some of this would change if we are to move towards an indigenous, economic-output-oriented growth structure, rather than one that only relies on imports.”
Speaking of the upcoming budget, he said it is expected to gradually transition towards a more private-sector-oriented economy, with a greater focus on enhancing formal savings, in a way that the same can be converted into investments. “The inability to expand the savings net, while imposing more taxes to extract another ounce (there is no pound left anymore) of flesh, will only constrain growth in the mid-to-long term.
“The expectation here is that the budget will prioritise stabilisation, and slowly transition towards growth, rather than going all out for growth, and sacrificing any gains made in the last few years in the process,” Khan added.
Is the government ready to break from routine?
“The budget 25-26 should be grounded in facts, centred around people’s needs, supportive businesses, and fully transparent,” stressed economic journalist Afshan Subohi.
“The government must move away from policies that disproportionately burden the voiceless majority to compensate for inefficiencies in governance and systematic flaws in the energy sector,” she stressed. “Rather than relying on token cash handouts, the budget should prioritise the revival of agriculture and industry to spur job creation and offer citizens the opportunity to earn a dignified livelihood.”
She emphasised that the tax structure must be reformed to make it more progressive by increasing the share of direct taxes by at least 5pc points. “It is unjust to impose income tax on families subsisting below the poverty line; the income tax exemption threshold should be raised to Rs1,300,000 from the current Rs500,000. The tax rates on the middle class must be scaled down.”
The journalist was also of the opinion that the rate of super tax should be moderated, while the tax net should be broadened. Moreover, she continued, the government must reduce the petroleum development levy to ensure that the benefits of falling global oil prices are passed on to the masses.
 
 

“Whenever there is a resource crunch, the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) is the first to face cuts. In the current fiscal year, under 50pc of the chopped PSDP has so far been disbursed. Given the private investor’s reluctance to invest in the current conditions, the government must not only increase development spending but also ensure its timely disbursement.
“It should also engage with the military hierarchy to explore the possibility of funding additional security-related needs through their commercial ventures, at least for the next fiscal year,” she said.
Afshan highlighted the need for the federal government to shut down redundant departments, which will cut recurring costs, tighten oversight of overseas travel and wasteful spending, and promote technology by supporting startups through incentives, policy support, and funding access.
“It is high time the government takes decisive steps to improve the collection and dissemination of relevant economic data and encourages provinces to systematically report key economic indicators through regular publication of provincial economic surveys.
“These suggestions align with IMF guidance and serve Pakistan’s long-term interests. The real test is whether the government is ready to break from routine and embrace a new path,” she added.
Military budget — the big job
Economist and academic Aadil Nakhoda said that the finance ministry has found itself facing significant challenges as the upcoming budget not only involves plans to cut import duties and tariffs, impose petroleum levy and carbon taxes, but also increase the military budget amid the possibility of intense border conflicts.
“The tariff liberalisation involves a drastic reduction of customs tariffs to 7pc in the next five years, while reducing the number of duty slabs from five to four and peak tariffs on imports from 20pc to 15pc. The revenues from customs tariffs may decrease by more than Rs 250 billion.
“However, the government expects that the increase in economic activity because of these drastic cuts may lead to not only higher revenue generation from direct taxes but also indirect taxes as import volumes subsequently increase due to the measures.”
According to Nakhoda, incentives to purchase imports from informal and grey channels may see a significant reduction as tariffs fall. Hence, the revenue may increase even without incurring significant losses, as importers may formally declare their imports to the government.
“Further, it is expected that exporting activities may increase as businesses find not only greater competition in the domestic market due to the increase in competing imported varieties, but may also adopt more efficient production methods in the face of increasing competition. Therefore, it has become increasingly important to improve the domestic business environment through market reforms such that innovation is encouraged.”
The economist further predicted that the government was also likely to increase the petroleum levy on fuel products and impose carbon taxes on older vehicles. “Both these measures may increase government revenue, but at the same time push consumers towards more environmentally friendly substitutes, lowering carbon emissions and improving the standard of living.”
Therefore, replacing older technologies with more efficient ones is also likely to boost efficiency and productivity. It may also result in lowering the demand for imported fuel products, which is a major component of the import bill, he added.
 
 

Lastly, Nakhoda highlighted that the military budget will inadvertently increase as the risk of border conflicts is high, but alerted that this may hurt development programs as well as funding of other sectors such as health and education.
“However, the recent conflict has seen a shift from using army personnel as a primary resource towards the use of machines and technology. This itself can have an impact on not only the financing of the military budget but also the size of the army,” he said.
Need to embed sustainability measures
“There are a few things that will remain standard in the budget, which will focus on stabilisation because it is being prepared along with the IMF,” said Sajid Amin Javed, who writes on macroeconomic policy.
According to him, not much relief can be expected in the budget, and whatever will be there will be minimal. “The government’s efforts to provide relief to the salaried class … that discussion is still pending with the IMF. So the first two to three slabs of the salaried class may get some sort of relaxation.”
He believes that there might not be a lot of effect on the tax rate, especially the upper slabs. But it is expected that taxable income will be increased from Rs600,000 to the Rs1-1.2 million range. “The government is trying to avoid new taxes as it has realised that there already is a lot of burden on people within the tax net.”
The macroeconomist also believes that Pakistan will see an increase in terms of defence expenditure.
“Another thing I see, as far as commitment and announcement is concerned, is bringing new sectors into the tax net, such as agriculture and textiles,” he said. “There will be some leniency for the real estate sector, whether it is explicit or implicit. Because the government realises that if economic activity needs to be increased and the growth rate target for next year needs to be increased, the real estate sector plays a pivotal role in it.”
So, tax rates can be adjusted, and proposals have been sent to the IMF.
 
 

For the common man, Amin noted, the upcoming budget will be “balanced” as compared to the previous two years. But it won’t have a lot to give, he warned.
“In my opinion, the government should try its best to provide relief to the salaried class, and the taxable income should be increased. Another direction that the government needs to set is to what extent these taxes will support investments, because I feel the focus this year, too, will be on revenues, as our target is huge.
“Last year, we saw that we couldn’t meet our targets even with high inflation. The government must balance, because we have been very focused on revenues for the IMF programme and meeting its targets. Our focus was also stabilisation, which is why taxation policies were tight. But now I feel the government must embed sustainability measures in the budget. And one big indicator in this is to support livelihoods for the common man,” the macroeconomist pointed out.
On a positive note, Amin said that he felt the budget will not be as tough as the previous two times, but at the same time, it will also not be as relaxed as the government wants it to be.
“In the context of PSDP, some schemes that were subject to delays or were at an early stage may be shelved, and the angle of expenditure reprioritisation of the IMF will be incorporated. We can expect this year’s PSDP to be a little less than that of last year,” he added.</p><small>2025-06-05 05:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607843-pakistan-india-conflict-discussed-by-trump-putin-amid-diplomatic-outreach' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan-India conflict discussed by Trump, Putin amid diplomatic outreach</strong></a><br><p>

The accused was presented before Judicial Magistrate Ahmed Shehzad Gondal by the federal police. Tensions rose in the courtroom when the magistrate noticed the absence of both the prosecutor and the district public prosecutor.
Expressing his displeasure, Magistrate Gondal said: “Where are the prosecutors of my court? Usually, no one shows up, but today the courtroom is full.”
Upon being informed by the duty prosecutor that the regular prosecutor was on leave, the magistrate ordered the presence of the district prosecutor before the proceedings could continue. The hearing was briefly adjourned, and the accused was taken back into police custody while awaiting the district prosecutor’s arrival.

Identification parade to be conducted once victim’s mother, aunt return from Chitral

Senator Falak Naz was also present in the courtroom during the hearing.
 
 

Later, upon reviewing the investigation officer’s request, the magistrate approved the remand and ordered Omar Hayat to be sent to jail for 14 days for the purpose of conducting an identification parade.
The suspect had allegedly murdered 17-year-old Sana Yousaf at her house in G-13 on Monday. He was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. Additionally, the victim’s mobile phone and the murder weapon were also recovered from his possession.
“The ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder,” said the police.
Moreover, the mother and aunt of Sana Yousaf are likely to identify the suspect arrested by the police in connection with the teenage girl’s murder, Dawn has learnt.
Police officers said that on Wednesday, the suspect was sent to Adiala jail on a 14-day judicial remand for the identification parade.
 
 

They said that a case had been registered over the murder in response to a complaint lodged by the victim’s mother, Farzana Yousaf. According to the FIR, the victim’s aunt was present in the house, while her father was outside.
However, the FIR does not clearly state whether the victim’s mother was present in the house at the time of the murder, the officers added. They said the family of Sana Yousaf had left for their hometown in Chitral along with the body for burial.
The police will request the mother and aunt to return as soon as possible for the identification parade.
The victim’s aunt, who also resides in Chitral, had come to Islamabad a few days ago to visit her brother (Sana Yousaf’s father) and was present in the house at the time of the murder.
The officers said that, so far, the investigators only have evidence in the form of geo-fencing data, recovery of an iPhone from the suspect, and CCTV footage. The suspect has yet to be interrogated, as no witness has so far recorded a statement regarding the murder.
However, there are two potential witnesses. The aunt who was present at the scene and the mother, on whose complaint the case was registered.
So far, the police have made successful efforts to trace and arrest the suspect and obtained his judicial remand for further legal action, the officers said. The investigation into the murder will gain momentum after the identification parade and recording of witness statements.
The police are also tracing other individuals considered as suspects who may have either assisted the suspect or been used by him intentionally. After committing the murder, the suspect reportedly left the victim’s house in a car driven by another person and reached Chungi No 26, from where he boarded a passenger vehicle.
The police will also investigate the ownership of the weapon used in the murder — whether it was licensed or illegal — and determine who owned or lent it to the suspect.
Bringing the weapon to the victim’s house suggests that he came there with the intent to harm her, the officers added.

• Polish national Małaszko says he travelled 3,322km and trekked 54km with his bike on his back over 56 days
• Legal dispute over trekking permit fees temporarily halted his expedition, until court intervened
GILGIT: Polish cyclist Paweł Małaszko, who started his ‘K2 B.C Bike Expedition’ from Karachi on April 4 to cycle across Pakistan from the shores of the Arabian Sea to K2 base camp, and completed his journey late last month, claims he is the first person to accomplish this feat.
The 46-year-old cyclist said he completed the 3,376-km journey in 56 days, bicycling 3,322km and trekking with his bike on his back for 54km. His journey included an elevation gain of 32,003 metres and temperatures ranging from 46°C to -18°C.
However, a legal dispute over permit fee hikes between Gilgit-Baltistan tourism and tour operators temporarily halted his journey, preventing the issuance of the required permit.
“When I was on the way, I was informed by my tour operator… that issuing trekking permits has been suspended by the GB tourism department,” he said.
After cycling over 2,000 kilometres to Gilgit, Mr Małaszko approached the GB Chief Court.
He told the judges the expedition was “not only a personal dream but also an opportunity to promote Pakistan as a destination for adventure and exploration throughout Europe and beyond. I have invested significant effort and dedication into this endeavour, and your help would mean the world to me”.
A GB Chief Court judge ordered the tourism department on May 3 to issue the permit at the previous rates, which it subsequently did.
Following the court order, Mr Małaszko travelled to Khunjerab Pass via the Karakoram Highway and then to Skardu, covering 3,050 kilometres by May 7. He commenced the final stage from Skardu to K2 base camp on May 11.
Reflecting on the journey, Mr Małaszko noted Pakistan’s diverse cultures and climates. “From Kara­chi to Multan, I had 46 degrees of heat every day,” he told Dawn in an earlier interview. “At that stage, I had to drive at night and early in the morning to avoid having a sunstroke.”
He praised the local hospitality, saying, “The hospitality among people is very high and that they try to be helpful in every aspect.”
While he found most roads in good condition, he acknowledged the unique challenges of mountain routes. “No one can influence how the mountains behave and whether they destroy the roads,” he said. “It is not man’s fault or negligence. That’s the case with the mountains.”
The final 200-kilometre stretch from Skardu to K2 base camp was described as the “most technical and challenging.” Małaszko explained, “On the way to K2 base camp, there are glaciers, a mountainous route, a steep hike; however, at some sections, I will put my bicycle on the back and travel myself.”
Upon completion, Małaszko claimed two records: cycling from sea level to K2 base camp and from sea level to Khunjerab Pass. “I’m the first man in history reach K2 base camp through by cycling. In addition, from sea level. I made the whole [journey] by force of my own muscles,” he told Dawn.

• 105 rearrested out of 216 escapees so far
• Meetings between families, inmates resume
KARACHI: Police and allied agencies are taking all-out efforts to recapture over a hundred prisoners who escaped from District Prison Malir on Monday night and are still at large, officials said on Wednesday.
The jailbreak began on Monday night and continued into the early hours of Tuesday after hundreds of prisoners — spooked by low-intensity quakes — were allowed into the prison courtyard. Later, the prisoners snatched guns from prison staff and forced open the main gate after a shootout and fled.
Officials said that 216 inmates had managed to break out of the prison and by Tuesday night 83 of them had been rounded up and police teams were carrying out raids to bring in those still at large.
On Wednesday, jail officials accompanying Sindh Prisons Minister Ali Hasan Zardari during his visit to the Malir jail told the media that out of 216 escapees, a total of 105 prisoners had been recaptured and 111 prisoners were still at large.
They said meetings of prisoners with their families have been resumed amid strict security arrangements.
The minister was briefed about the jailbreak and escape of over 200 prisoners following a small-intensity earthquake in the area.
However, he did not speak much about the high-profile incident, saying the Sindh government had formed an inquiry committee and it would not be advisable for him to talk prior to their findings.
Accompanied by newly appointed DIG-Prisons Aslam Malik, Malir jail superintendent Shahabuddin Siddiqi and Malir SSP Kashif Abbasi, the minister said escaped prisoners were returning back to the jail voluntarily. He promised that no action would be taken against such prisoners.
He said the jail would be upgraded to accommodate more prisoners while new barracks would be constructed. He said the prisoners are getting all facilities as per jail manual.
Following the jailbreak, the Sindh government had formed a two-member inquiry committee comprising Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi and city police chief Javed Alam Odho to conduct a thorough investigation.
The Sindh chief minister had ordered the removal of Inspector General of Prisons Qazi Nazir and suspended DIG-Prisons Hassan Sehto and Jail Superintendent Arshad Hussain.
The now-suspended prison superintendent had claimed in his report that prisoners became agitated due to tremors and started raising a commotion and shouting from the barracks. When security staff rushed to control the situation, many of the inmates broke down the doors of the barracks at Circle No IV, overpowered the jailer and other security staff and rushed towards the main gate.
Ordinance promulgated
Also on Wednesday, acting Sindh Governor Awais Qadir Shah promulgated an ordinance — the Sindh Prisons & Corrections Service (Amendment) Ordinance 2025 — empowering the Sindh chief minister to appoint an officer of the Police Service of Pakistan, Pakistan Administrative Service or Provincial Management Service as the prisons IG and DIG in place of officers belonging to the regular prisons service.
Governor Kamran Tessori is out of country and in his absence Sindh Assembly Speaker Shah became the acting governor.
Officials said that after the new law, the provincial government can post police officers as SSP and SP of prisons across the province.
They said that the decision was taken against the backdrop of the Malir jailbreak.

In a statement, the HRCP said this action, coupled with the requirement that Ahmadis should submit affidavits disavowing their beliefs, violates the community’s constitutional right to freedom of religion or belief under Article 20 as well as their right to equal citizenship.
 






The commission feared that this continued institutionalised discrimination against the Ahmadiyya community would empower vigilante actors and extremist groups to enforce a defacto ban on the community’s freedom of movement and public participation.
 
 

It said the LHCBA must withdraw its letter and the Punjab government should instruct local authorities to protect members of the Ahmadiyya community at a time when they were especially vulnerable to vigilantism.
In its letter to the Punjab IGP, the LHCBA sought to prevent the Ahmadiyya community from observing Islamic rituals on the occasion of Eidul Azha and action against its members if found violating the law.
Child marriage act challenged before FSC
The “Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Restraint Act, 2025” has been challenged before the Federal Shariat Court (FSS) for being ‘un-Islamic’.
Shahzada Adnan, a resident of Lahore, filed a petition through Advocate Mudassar Chaudhry pleading that the impugned law has been enacted in clear conflict to the Shariah, the Constitution and the fundamentals of Islam. The petition argues that the impugned legislation has totally negated the Islamic concept of marriage as according to the injunction of Islam, age does not matter but puberty is the key of ceremony of Nikah as well as marriage.
Citing Quranic verses, the petition says the impugned law is ultra vires and against the basic principles of Islamic Shariah.
It alleges that the implementation of the impugned law would open a door for pre-marriage sex in the country.
The petition argues that the parliament did not consider the legislation work of Quran, Hadith, Muslim jurists and other Islamic countries.
It said the legislative body also ignored the opinion of Council of Islamic Ideology, a constitutional body, which already declared the impugned law against the spirit of Islam as well the Constitution of the country. The petition asks the FST to declare the impugned law as unconstitutional and against the Islamic principles.

Here is some of what we know thus far. They are likely to announce an FBR revenue target around Rs14 trillion (maybe slightly higher).
Current expenditures are supposed to stay just below Rs23tr, of which around Rs16tr are federal and the rest from the provinces. The underlying primary balance (deficit plus interest expenditures) must remain somewhere near Rs1.17tr.
These numbers will be more or less fixed since they are part of the medium-term framework already worked out with the IMF and released in the last staff report. Whatever space will need to be made for shifting tax and expenditure priorities must be created in a way that does not change these numbers by too much.
 
 

Now consider what they will have to do in the budget. First up, defence spending is supposed to increase by around 13.7 per cent, as per the same medium-term framework, which was drawn up before the recent conflict. We will see how much of an increase actually comes now that the resource requirements of the security forces have undoubtedly increased following the war.
Usually the first place to see cuts is development spending. In the current year, for example, development spending was supposed to be less than Rs1tr as per the understanding with the IMF, but the government still announced a federal development programme spending target of Rs1.4tr in its budget last year. But until March, barely Rs309 billion had been spent, while the provinces raced ahead and have spent more than Rs1.2tr already.
For next year they are trying to keep the federal development programme down to Rs1tr again. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal has implored the provinces to cooperate with the centre and announce smaller development programmes for the next fiscal year. It is unlikely the provinces will oblige. And the federal government will have to starve its own plans, and its MNAs, in order to keep the fiscal equation more or less in control.

Rarely have conditions been so favourable for a government to do something big and transformative.

Along with demands for heightened defence spending will come demands for ‘relief’ from the citizenry, especially salaried individuals and businesses crushed under a Nordic tax burden. Probably the single largest growth in tax contribution this year has come from salaried individuals, as per figures reported in reputable news dailies.
 
 

Consider a few numbers. One reported figure shows that by the time this fiscal year ends, the salaried class would have paid an additional Rs182bn in taxes compared to what it paid last year. Mind you, this is incremental tax, over and above what it paid last year. This would make for a growth rate of almost 50pc in collections from salaried people.
Nobody else in the country has borne an incremental burden of this magnitude while seeing their income stagnate and its value be obliterated by the most ferocious inflationary fire this country has ever seen. This burden came right as that fire died down. Salaried people have seen predatory taxation and must be the first in line for relief in this budget.
The rising burden on compliant taxpayers has turned into a very serious issue. It was always serious, but now it is probably one of the most important drags on the economy, along with rising energy costs, a poor trade regime, policy inconsistency and lack of sanctity of contracts and all the traditional items we place on this list. How can they expect growth to reach 4.2pc next fiscal year without wider burden-sharing in revenue collection?
If there is any ‘relief’ for real estate speculators in the budget, we will know that this government is standing on legs of jelly. If there are no credible efforts to increase the base of taxation, we will know this government has surrendered without a fight.
 
 

From what we hear, they are planning far-reaching trade liberalisation. If this step is not accompanied with credible fiscal measures to arrest the growth of the tax burden on compliant payers, we will know the government is not serious about any trade reform or promoting exports, as they claim. They are merely ticking boxes and fulfilling formalities and hiding behind pious-sounding invocations of change and reform.
We have a moment of opportunity here. The economy has stabilised. The inflationary fire has been doused, the deficits bridged, the exchange rate is on an even keel and foreign exchange reserves are on an upward path. Beyond this, the government enjoys the backing of the powerful establishment and there is no opposition to speak of. Rarely have conditions been this favourable to do something big and transformative.
A lot of sacrifices have been made to bring this about. Let’s not mince words here. Our freedoms, our rights and even our votes have been trampled upon so that the government can enjoy calmer waters to operate in. Our incomes have been burned, and of what is left, a massive share has been appropriated in the name of bridging the yawning deficits that were taking us perilously close to total unviability. This is a lot of sacrifice for a common citizen to have to make.
 
 

Now that it has all been done, the least we are owed in return is that something good should come out of it. Give us some sort of a breakthrough, somewhere. Currently, we have a revenue base so narrow that only a ballet dancer could pirouette on it. We have a power sector that generates circular debt more effectively than electricity. We have SOEs whose accumulated losses are comparable to the cost of a large infrastructure project.
We are blessed with so many monuments to failed governance that this list gets truly impressive. Those ruling us should make at least one breakthrough against this list to vindicate themselves, and they can start with the upcoming budget.

• Fear has gripped media industry, judge told
ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday issued a final deadline to the federal government to respond to the identical petitions filed against “co­­ntroversial amendments” in the cybercrimes law, and hinted at deciding the matter ex parte if re­­plies to the challenges were not received.
Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas issued final notices to the Ministry of Law and Justice, Mi­­nistry of Information Techno­logy, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA, and the Pakistan Telecom­munication Authority (PTA) to submit their replies to the petitions filed against controversial amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
The judge made it clear that the hearing will proceed even if responses were not filed.
The petitions filed by the Pak­istan Federal Union of Journa­li­s­­ts, anchorpersons, and various journalist organisations have chal­­lenged the expanded scope of Peca, which, they argue, crimina­lises journalistic activity and curtails press freedom. During the hearing, several senior media rep­­­resentatives appeared in court.
Imran Shafiq, counsel for the pe­­­­­titioners, informed the court that only the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Information had filed partial responses, while the Ministry of Law, PTA, and other agencies concerned had ei­­ther sub­­mitted incomplete replies or igno­red the court’s orders altogether.
He accused the government of using delaying tactics, highlighting that it had raised jurisdictional objections. He asserted that only a constitutional bench could hear the case under the 26th Constitutional Amendment.
He argued that this objection was unfounded.
“This is merely an attempt to prolong the proceedings,” Mr Shafiq told the court, also pointing out that one of the government’s objections mentioned a verse from the Holy Quran that suggests caution before sharing information publicly. He alleged that the government had done so to justify the registration of FIRs against journalists.
Senior journalist Mazhar Abbas emphasised that an atmosphere of fear had gripped the media industry, adding that journalists were routinely harassed, summoned by the FIA, and threatened with arrest for performing their professional duties.
“We are not demanding any special treatment,” Mr Abbas said, adding, “We only ask for the protection of our constitutional rights and the right to report freely.”
Advocate Riasat Ali Azad urg­ed the court to issue an interim stay order to prevent the registration of FIRs and arrests of journalists.
Besides, he suggested the court should impose a fine of Rs500,000 on the agencies for failing to comply with court orders.
Justice Minhas wondered whether journalists were being truly prevented from reporting.
In response, Adnan Haider said, “We are fighting a war on social media just like the army defends the country in a war.”
The court granted a final opp­ortunity to the government depa­rtments to file their responses and adjourned the hearing to the second week of July.

While presiding over a meeting on railways, the premier instructed Pakistan Railways to expedite efforts to connect Gwadar with its network.
Earlier, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi briefed the prime minister on ongoing reforms in the railways department, saying that the organisation had immense potential for further investment.
He highlighted the establishment of modern information desks at major railway stations, outsourced cleaning systems at Lahore, Rawalpindi, and Multan railway stations, collaboration between his department and provincial food authorities to monitor food quality at trains and stations, and the resumption of long-suspended services.

Hanif Abbasi briefs premier on railway projects, plans to outsource assets

The minister told the meeting that Bolan Mail had recently been relaunched as a daily service, besides the restoration of Dera Ghazi Khan Express and Khushhal Khan Khattak Express.
Outsourcing, auction
Mr Abbasi said concrete sleeper factories in Sukkur, Khanewal, and Kohat, and railway hospitals, schools, colleges, and rest houses in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, Quetta, Multan, and Sukkur were being outsourced.
Moreover, Royal Palm Golf and Country Club, Lahore, is being auctioned with the potential to establish a five-star hotel and the digitisation and restructuring of the Railways IT directorate was underway.
He highlighted that free Wi-Fi was introduced on trains; Rabta App upgraded for ticket booking; 155 railway stations shifted to solar, saving millions; 17,101 posts cut, 5,695 more to be phased out; and Pakistan Railways Advisory and Consultancy Services, Rail­cop, Pakistan Railways Freight Transport Company, and Project Implementation Unit discontinued.
It was told that Rs10 billion railway land had been reclaimed and planning with Punjab was in progress on Lahore-Rawalpindi high-speed train, station upgrades, and suburban services.
Besides, the Sariab-Kuchlak and Quet­­ta-Chaman sections will be upgra­ded.
MQM delegation
Later, a MQM delegation, led by convener Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, called on the prime minister.
The prime minister consulted the MQM delegation regarding the federal budget for the fiscal year 2025-2026. The delegation presented its proposals concerning the budget.
PM Shehbaz said that providing top-notch transport facilities to the people of Karachi through the Green Line project was among the top priorities of the federal government. He said work on mega water (K-IV) project of Karachi would be expedited while instructions had already been issued to accelerate work on the Karachi-Hyderabad package as well.
The Muttahida delegation included Mustafa Kamal, Aminul Haque, Farooq Sattar, and Javed Hanif, PM Office said.
In a separate meeting with a delegation led by Belarusian Defence Minister Lt-Gen Victor Khrenin, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan desired to strengthen econo­m­­ic partnership with Belarus and benefit from country’s expertise in agricultural machinery manufacturing, adds APP.
The seven-member delegation included Belarusian ambassador Andrei Metelitsa, commander of the Belarusian air force and air defense and officials from the Belarusian defence ministry.
The premier said that cooperation with Belarus in IT and defence sectors would be further strengthened.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif will be departing for an official visit to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia on Thursday (today).

The draft of the bill was moved by Balochistan Awami Party (BAP) MPA Mir Sadiq Sanjrani.
JUI-F MPA Ms Shahida Rauf, while speaking on the floor of the House, said that the bill is being bro­ught to the assembly with good intentions and her party would support it.
She, however, suggested to the Leader of the House that every clause of the bill should be discussed in the House again so that there remained no ambiguity about it.
“If only one party opposes it, that will cause great loss to the province,” Ms Rauf said, adding that the bill should not be passed in haste.
Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, while taking up the issue of missing persons, said the matter must be resolved.
Commenting on the draft of the amendment, he said the anti-terrorism bill might be correct, but it needs to be clear who it actually benefits.
 
 

“Who will be held accountable for those being killed?” Maulana Rehman said, adding that the Counter Terrorism Department’s actions are visible to everyone and the House should be taken into confidence on the bill and it should be passed only after taking the opinion of every member of the House.
Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti claimed the issue of missing persons has been used to discredit state institutions, and legislation was the solution to the problem.
“We must now prevent this issue from being misused. Now, anyone arrested will be presented before a magistrate.”
Six-year sunset clause
The bill, seen by Dawn, proposes that anyone suspected of offences enshrined in the anti-terrorism law may be held in preventive detention for up to three months for the purpose of inquiry.
The inquiry will be held by a police officer not below the rank of Superintendent or through a Joint Interrogation Team (JIT). If the detention order is issued by the armed forces or intelligence agencies, the inquiry shall be conducted by a JIT consisting of members of the concerned agency.
During the course of inquiry, the concerned law enforcement officer heading it shall be vested with all powers relating to search, arrest, and seizure of property and other materials relevant to the offence.
The amended law also allows for detainees to be confined in a detention / rehabilitation / de-radicalisation centre who, upon a written request by the investigating agency or investigating officer, can be handed over to any law enforcement agency for the purpose of investigation.
 
 

The provincial government shall notify Oversight Board(s), comprising two civilians, two military officers, a psychiatrist, and a criminologist, under the chairmanship of the additional chief secretary (Home) or any other nominated officer to assess the case of each detainee and their ideological disposition and mental, physical, and psychological condition during detention, and recommend, where necessary, their transfer to a rehabilitation / de-radicalisation centre.
Explaining the bill’s salient features, CM Bugti told the House that if any institution picks someone up, it can keep them in custody for up to three months, after which they must be presented before a court and informed of the charges filed against him/her.
The detained person will be kept in a centre where he/she can meet their family members and the lawyer of the detained person will also be informed about it.
“If anyone disappears beyond this system, then he/she will be considered a truly missing person,” Mr Bugti said, adding that the new law would be valid for six years. The legislation also includes a provision to extend its operation by two years through a notification by the provincial government.

Trump said the measure was spurred by a makeshift flamethrower attack on a Jewish protest in Colorado that US authorities blamed on a man they said was in the country illegally.
The move bans all travel to the United States by nationals of Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.
 
 

Trump also imposed a partial ban on travellers from seven countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. Some temporary work visas from these countries will be allowed.
The bans go into effect on Monday, the White House said.
“The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted,” Trump said in a video message from the Oval Office posted on X.
“We don’t want them.”
 






World Cup, Olympics excluded
The ban will, however, not apply to athletes competing in the 2026 World Cup, which the US is co-hosting with Canada and Mexico, as well as the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics, Trump’s order said.
Trump separately on Wednesday announced a ban on visas for foreign students who are set to begin attending Harvard University, ramping up his crackdown on what he regards as a bastion of liberalism.
The US leader compared the new measures to the “powerful” ban he imposed on a number of mainly Muslim countries in his first term, which caused travel disruption across the world.
 
 

Trump said that the 2017 ban had stopped the US from suffering terror attacks that happened in Europe.
“We will not let what happened in Europe happen in America,” Trump said.
“We cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen.”
Venezuela hit back by warning that the United States itself was a dangerous destination.
“Being in the United States is a great risk for anyone, not just for Venezuelans,” Venezuela’s Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said after the announcement, warning citizens against travel there.
Trump’s new travel ban could, however, face legal challenges, as have many of the drastic measures he has taken in his whirlwind return to office.
‘Terrorists’
The White House unveiled the new ban with virtually no warning, minutes after Trump had addressed some 3,000 political appointees from his balcony at a celebratory “summer soiree”.
Trump also made the announcement with no reporters present, an unusual move after sharing many of his most headline-grabbing policy announcements at signing ceremonies in the Oval Office.
But rumours of a new Trump travel ban had circulated following the attack in Colorado, with his administration vowing to pursue “terrorists” living in the US on visas.
 
 

Suspect Mohammed Sabry Soliman, an Egyptian national according to court documents, is alleged to have thrown fire bombs and sprayed burning gasoline at a group of people who had gathered on Sunday in support of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.
US Homeland Security officials said Soliman was in the country illegally, having overstayed a tourist visa, but that he had applied for asylum in September 2022.
“President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm,” White House Deputy Press Secretary Abigail Jackson said on X.
 






Trump’s proclamation gave specific reasons for each country in his proclamation, which says it is aimed at protecting the United States from “foreign terrorists and other national security” threats.
Notably, Egypt was not on the list of countries facing travel restrictions.
For Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and war-torn Libya, Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, it said they lacked “competent” central authorities for processing passports and vetting.
Iran, with which the United States is in negotiations on a possible nuclear deal, was included as it is a “state sponsor of terrorism”, the order said.
“The impact of the ban will once again be felt by Americans who were denied the ability to see their loved ones at weddings, funerals, or the birth of a child,” said National Iranian American Council president Jamal Abdi.
For most of the other countries, Trump’s order cited an above-average likelihood that people would overstay their visas.
Trump administration ramps up attack on Harvard, Columbia
Meanwhile, Trump ramped up his campaign against top US universities on Wednesday, banning visas for all foreign students coming to attend Harvard and threatening to strip Columbia of its academic accreditation.
Trump is seeking to bring the universities to heel with claims that their international students pose a national security threat, that they ignored anti-Semitism on campus, and perpetuate liberal bias.
A proclamation issued by the White House late on Wednesday declared that the entrance of international students to begin a course at Harvard would be “suspended and limited” for six months, and that existing overseas enrollees could have their visas terminated.
“Harvard’s conduct has rendered it an unsuitable destination for foreign students and researchers,” said the order.
“I’m trembling. This is outrageous,” Karl Molden, a Harvard government and classics student from Austria, told AFP.
“He is abusing his executive power to harm Harvard as much as he can.”
 
 

“My god!” said another international student at Harvard, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, on learning of the executive order.
“This is such a disgrace.”
The announcement came after the Trump administration’s earlier efforts to terminate Harvard’s right to enrol and host foreign students were stalled by a judge.
The government has already cut around $3.2 billion of federal grants and contracts benefiting Harvard and pledged to exclude the Cambridge, Massachusetts institution from any future federal funding.
Trump has also singled out international students at Harvard, who in the 2024-2025 academic year accounted for 27 per cent of total enrollment, and a major source of income.
“This is yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard’s First Amendment rights,” a university spokesman said.
“Harvard will continue to protect its international students.”
 
 

The latest sweeping action against Harvard came as Trump’s education secretary threatened on Wednesday to strip Columbia University of its accreditation.
The Republican has targeted the New York Ivy League institution for allegedly ignoring harassment of Jewish students, throwing all of its federal funding into doubt.
Unlike Harvard, several top institutions — including Columbia — have already bowed to far-reaching demands from the Trump administration, which claims that the educational elite is too left-wing.
But Wednesday’s official action suggested it was not enough for Trump.
“Columbia University looked the other way as Jewish students faced harassment,” US Education Secretary Linda McMahon said on X.
 






She accused the school of breaking rules prohibiting recipients of federal funding from discriminating on the basis of race, colour, or national origin.
In the statement, the US Education Department said its civil rights office had contacted Columbia’s accreditation body about the alleged violation.
Withdrawing Columbia’s accreditation would see it lose access to all federal funding — a very significant proportion of the university’s income. Students attending the university would also not be able to receive federal grants and loans towards tuition.
Critics accuse the Trump administration of using allegations of anti-Semitism to target educational elites and bring universities to their knees.
 
 

The administration has already put $400 million of Columbia’s funding under review, prompting the university in March to announce a package of concessions to the government around defining anti-Semitism, policing protests and conducting oversight for specific academic departments.
Following Wednesday’s announcement, a Columbia spokesperson said the university is “aware of the concerns” raised by the government with its accreditation body.
“We have addressed those concerns directly with Middle States,” the spokesperson said, adding that “Columbia is deeply committed to combating anti-Semitism on our campus”. “We take this issue seriously and are continuing to work with the federal government to address it. “</p><small>2025-06-05 04:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0509321349d114c.jpg?r=093225' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915540/pm-approves-plan-to-cut-import-duties-on-raw-materials' target='_blank'><strong>PM approves plan to cut import duties on raw materials</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif has approved a reduction in duties on over 7,066 tariff lines, which include raw materials, intermediate and capital goods aimed at stimulating industrial growth in the country.
The premier green-lit the proposals for a formal announcement in the budget speech, which had received earlier approval from the Tariff Policy Board and Steering Committee. However, the premier asked that the implementation committee identify any irritants before the budget announcement.
Official sources told Dawn on Wed­­nesday that the government will announce the abolishing of 2 per cent additional customs duty (ACD) on 4,294 tariff lines in the upcoming budget. These are mostly raw materials, which will reduce the industries’ input cost.
It was also decided that the ACD will be reduced from 4pc to 2pc on 545 tariff lines, from 6pc to 4pc on 2,227 tariff lines, and from 7pc to 6pc for all products currently subject to a customs duty above 20pc.

Orders committee to consult sectors enjoying 100-150pc tariff protection

According to officials, the major impact will be seen in products classified in chapters 28 to 38, which mostly cover products related to chemicals, pharmaceuticals, plastics, etc. The 2pc to 4pc duty cut will lower the cost of all these products.
The reduction will also cover information technology products, which fall under chapters 84 and 85 of the Pakistan Customs Tariff. Polyester Filament Yarn and HRC of steel sectors will also see a cut in import duties.
Simplified structure
In the budget, the government will also introduce a simplified customs duty structure with slabs of 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20pc. The existing 16pc slab will be reduced to 15pc, while the 11pc rate will drop to 10pc. The 3pc slab will be abolished, with products either moved to a zero-duty category or the new 5pc slab.
Regulatory duties, which range from 5pc to 90pc on various products, will also see a drastic reduction in the upcoming budget. However, it will be fully eliminated over five years, easing import costs and improving market accessibility.
The regulatory duties, which currently reach as high as 90pc on various products, would be reduced to a maximum of 30pc.
Moreover, the 5th Schedule of Customs, which provides industry-specific tariff concessions, will be dissolved, with all products covered under it transitioning to the 1st Schedule in a phased manner. There are no changes in the tariff structure in the upcoming budget which will hurt the interest of any specific industry, the official added.
Engaging stakeholders
PM Shehbaz Sharif has directed the steering committee to initiate formal engagement with leading sectors such as auto, iron and steel, textiles, chemicals and plastics — currently shielded by effective tariff rates ranging between 100pc and 150pc after the budget announcement.
The committee will propose an agreed-upon reduction in tariffs for all these sectors in consultation with all stakeholders, the officials said, adding that the premier stated his government’s priority is to shift away from import substitution to an export-led growth strategy.
The premier agreed on the overall plan of a phased reduction in overall tariff protections for select industries.
Under the approved plan, the government has set a target to slash the simple average tariff from the current 19pc to 9.5pc within five years. A key adjustment in the plan includes restructuring duty slabs, replacing the existing slabs of 0pc, 3pc, 11pc, 16pc and 20pc with a streamlined system of 0pc, 5pc, 10pc and 15pc.
By the end of the five-year implementation period, the tariff overhaul will establish a uniform maximum duty slab of 15pc, eliminating sector-specific peaks that previously exceeded 20pc — primarily affecting the auto industry.
The additional customs duties curren­tly set at 2pc, 4pc, 6pc and 7pc across var­ious slabs will be gradually phased out to zero within the next three to four years.

Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20 per cent the mass of our Sun.
It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets. But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy.
This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant. The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.

With a slightly larger radius than Saturn, planet is only half its mass

The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by Nasa’s TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile’s Very Large Telescope.
“The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,” study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK’s Warwick University said.
Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an “intriguing discovery”.
“We don’t really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!” he said. “This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.”
The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze towards the planet next year to help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.

Over 200 inmates escaped from the facility after the city experienced slight tremors late Monday and early Tuesday.
Prisoners were allowed into the jail’s courtyard after the minor quakes and from there all hell broke loose, as the inmates overpowered the guards and made for the exits. As per news agencies, there were only 28 guards on duty to watch over 2,000 prisoners, while the jail’s security cameras were also reportedly not functioning. At the time of writing, a significant number of escapees remained at large.
 
 

As the Sindh chief minister said, the jailbreak represented a “complete breakdown in communication and preparedness”. The Sindh government says the escaped prisoners were involved in “minor offences”. The threat to public safety would have been considerably higher had these escapees included hard-core militants, or those involved in heinous crimes.
The episode reveals that our penitentiaries are woefully underprepared for emergency situations. The jail staff should have been trained to safely evacuate prisoners in case of natural disasters or other emergencies, while also ensuring they remained under the watch of law enforcers. Instead, what was witnessed was panic and a state of total unpreparedness. The incident again underscores the need to speed up jail reforms countrywide.
In many instances, our jails are still run under colonial frameworks. Overcrowding is common, while facilities contain under-trial prisoners as well as convicts. When jails have far more inmates than they can safely accommodate, mismanagement and chaos are natural corollaries. Speeding up trials and keeping probation options open for those involved in minor crimes should be considered. It is a fact that a broken legal and criminal justice system results in overcrowded and poorly managed jails.
 
 

Jail security also needs to be beefed up. The episode in Malir has shown that there are major lacunae concerning prison security. The Sindh authorities need to ensure that all the escaped prisoners are recaptured soon. In the past, the massive Bannu jailbreak showed that when the state lets its guard down, violent elements exploit loopholes — with terrifying consequences.
The chief justice of Pakistan is leading efforts to reform penitentiaries. These efforts must examine all proposals designed to ensure prisoners’ welfare and rehabilitation, as well as address loopholes in the security of prisons. Once these recommendations have been finalised, the chief justice should ensure that the federal and provincial governments implement them without delay.
The Malir jailbreak cannot be ignored, and should lead to visible changes in jail security and management.

• Israeli army designates roads leading to Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s aid centres ‘combat zones’
• UK minister seeks ‘independent’ probe into deadly incidents
UNITED NATIONS: The United States vetoed a UN Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access in Gaza, which Washington claimed undermined ongoing diplomacy to resolve the conflict.
“This resolution would undermine diplomatic efforts to reach a ceasefire that reflects the realities on the ground and emboldens Hamas. This resolution also draws false equivalence between Israel and Hamas,” said Washington’s United Nations envoy Dorothy Shea.
The result of the voting is as follows: 14 votes in favour, one vote against (by the US), and zero abstentions. It was the 15-member UNSC’s first vote on the subject since November, when the US blocked a move calling for an end to fighting.
In her remarks before the votes, the US ambassador said she would not back the resolution. “United States opposition to this resolution should come as no surprise.
“The United States has taken the very clear position since this conflict began that Israel has the right to defend itself, which includes defeating Hamas and ensuring they are never again in a position to threaten Israel. In this regard, any product that undermines our close ally Israel’s security is a non-starter.”
The new resolution, seen by AFP, “demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza respected by all parties.”
It also calls for the “immediate, dignified and unconditional release of all [prisoners] held by Hamas and other groups.” Underlining a “catastrophic humanitarian situation” in the Palestinian territory, the resolution additionally demands the lifting of all restrictions on the entry of humanitarian aid into Gaza.
Israel’s war on Gaza since October 2023 has killed at least 54,607 Palestinians and wounded 125,341, according to the health ministry.
16 more killed in Gaza
On Wednesday, Israeli bombardment killed at least 16 people in Gaza, including 12 in a single strike on a tent sheltering displaced people, the civil defence agency said. A day earlier, 27 people were killed when Israeli troops opened fire near a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s site in southern Gaza. The US- and Israeli-backed group operating aid sites in Gaza later shut its facilities, as the Israeli army warned that roads leading to distribution centres were “considered combat zones”.
At least 95 Palestinians were killed and 440 injured in Israeli attacks across Gaza in the past 24 hours, the enclave’s health ministry said on Wednesday.
The wave of deadly incidents at the aid distribution sites in the Gaza Strip drew condemnation from the United Nations, as the UN aid chief said the recent ‘horrifying scenes’ of Gazans being killed while trying to access food aid were the result of ‘a series of deliberate choices that have systematically deprived two million people of the essentials they need to survive’.
“The world is watching, day after day, horrifying scenes of Palestinians being shot, wounded or killed in Gaza while simply trying to eat,” UN aid chief Tom Fletcher said in a statement.
UK protests
On the other hand, pro-Palestinian protesters staged demonstrations outside the House of Parliament in London, calling for sanctions on Israel over ongoing hunger among Gaza’s war-struck population. The demonstrations were organised by several campaign groups, including Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Avaaz and Parents for Palestine.
Amid the protests, the UK government called for an “immediate and independent investigation” into the deaths. UK’s Minister for Middle East Hamish Falconer said the deaths of Palestinians as they sought food were “deeply disturbing” as he called Israel’s new measures for aid delivery “inhumane”.
Also, the BBC defended its Gaza coverage after White House criticism of its reporting of an incident in which Palestinians were killed near a Gaza aid centre, after the White House accused the broadcaster of taking “the word of Hamas”.

The provincial cabinet had decided to cut the power tariffs of these two plants by 30-40 per cent to reduce electricity bills. This move is similar to the federal government’s, which recently renegotiated contracts with independent power plants (IPPs) to reduce tariffs.
The provincial government said that both power companies would not make a profit or withdraw savings, and the amount would be diverted towards public relief. The two state-owned entities had been making between Rs12 to Rs13 billion in profit, which they would now forgo.
Likewise, both companies had savings of about Rs12 billion and it was decided they would not withdraw it to make room for tariff cuts. The amount saved on these heads is expected to translate into a 30 to 40 per cent reduction in electricity rates. This relief would then be conveyed to the federal government to help it overall reduce national tariffs.

Provincial govt says two state-owned companies will forgo profits, give up savings; CM Maryam asks authorities to curb vaping

Welcoming the step, power sector experts believe that Punjab still has more margin, which can be exploited. For example, local banks, which financed these projects, can be requested to reduce the mark-up rate, and a shift away from payments in dollars can also create further space, besides any insurance rate cuts.
Ideally, the government should have shifted loans and their servicing to its accounts; however, what it has already done is commendable and should help reduce national tariff, they added.
In February this year,  the government claimed to have secured about Rs1.571 trillion in savings in future payments to a total of 27 independent power producers (IPPs) through re-negotiations.
This was the key takeaway from a presentation made by the power division officials before the Senate Standing Committee on Power.
“The above savings will be passed on to the consumers through changes in agreements and tariffs over the contracting period,” read one of the slides that had been shared with the panel. It explained that Rs411 billion in savings had been secured through the termination of contracts with five IPPs, Rs238bn through the revision of tariff contracts with eight bagasse-based IPPs, and Rs922bn in tariff revisions with 14 thermal IPPs.
Meanwhile, the provincial cabinet has also approved the ’Chief Minister Wheat Program 2025’.
The establishment of Punjab’s first ‘Air Punjab Private Limited Company’ was also approved. CM Maryam Nawaz decided to start the airline within one year. She directed to ensure “safety gear” for labourers and workers and assigned the labour department a target of implementing safety SOPs within one month.
About the cabinet’s decision to shut down vaping stores, Dr Imran Aslam, the CM’s PRO confirmed that she had instructed the departments concerned to impose a ban on vaping as well.
Punjab Energy Secretary Dr Naeem Rauf told Dawn that in light of the recent decision, they would approach Nepra for a reduction in power tariffs for these two plants and would likely revise their power purchasing agreements so that these price reductions get permanence and are reflected in the new tariff.

• Met Office warns of above-normal rate of snow melting in GB, raising risk of Glof events
ISLAMABAD: India’s ‘water aggression’, higher-than-normal estimated rainfall and temperatures have reduced the response time for floods expected in the upcoming monsoon season, raising the risk of greater natural and man-made devastation unless improved vigilance and coordination is ensured, particularly in the country’s eastern parts.
This was the central theme of the annual flood preparation meeting of the federal and provincial governments on Wednesday, presided by Fed­e­ral Minister for Water Resources Muhammad Mueen Wattoo.
Participants of the meeting agreed to enhanced inter-agency and inter-provincial coordination and round-the-clock vigilance to manage flood risks during the upcoming monsoon season, set to begin on July 1.
The Pakistan Meteorological Depar­tment (PMD) officials told participants that temperatures were already abo­ve normal in Gilgit-Baltistan and forecast to remain so in the days ahead, resulting in above-normal snow-melting.
As a consequence, there could be higher and repeated chances of Glacial Lakes Outburst Floods (Glofs) in the monsoon season.
The rainfalls were also projected to be higher than normal across the country, particularly in the northern parts — Azad Jammu and Kashmir, GB, Potohar and parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa — and there could be greater frequency of all-weather events, including excessive thunderstorms and hailstorms.
Adding risks to the challenge was the unpredictability of water events from across the eastern borders as India is not sharing data relating to weather and river flows. Therefore, it was decided to be extra vigilant in relevant areas, particularly more than extra vigilance would need to be kept at Sialkot flood warning station because that would not provide more than 5-6 hours of response time.
In this regard, the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) expressed serious apprehensions over unpredictable and volatile Chenab flows which had already started affecting the Mangla dam filling. India has been reducing Chenab flows, forcing irrigation authorities to discharge around 40,000 cusecs of water from Mangla Dam instead of normal 10,000 cusecs a few days ago. Chenab flows reached just 6,000 cusecs about three days ago instead of 35,000-40,000 cusecs. The Mangla dam releases had to be increased to compensate for Chenab loss. With some improvements for subsequent two days, India against reduced flows to 21,000 cusecs on Monday.
An official statement said the PMD has “forecasted normal to slightly above-normal rainfall across central and southern Pakistan for the July to September period. Enhanced precipitation is expected in northeastern Punjab and Kashmir, while northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Gilgit-Baltistan may experience normal to below-normal rainfall”.
The forecast also warned of higher-than-normal temperatures nationwide, increasing the likelihood of extreme hydrological events such as riverine floods, flash floods, urban flooding, and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs), the statement said.
Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda), on the other hand, reported that enough storage was available both in Tarbela and Mangla dams and even at Chashma barrage. Therefore, there would not be a big challenge to cater for floods, whether on the Indus or Jhelum side as standard operating procedures were in place for controlled discharges downstream reservoirs in case of peak floods. However, localities around catchment areas in the northern part could be at risk in case of unusual floods.
In view of these inputs, the meeting agreed to have enhanced inter-agency coordination and round-the-clock vigilance to manage flood risks during the upcoming monsoon season. The crucial meeting, an annual ritual, was held to assess national preparedness for Monsoon Season 2025 and brought together representatives from federal agencies and provincial governments, to review flood mitigation strategies and pre-emptive measures for the safe passage of potential floodwaters.
Minister Mueen Wattoo directed to ensure immediate clearance of storm water drains in major urban centers and removal of encroachments and debris around waterways, particularly near barrages and key infrastructure such as National Highway Authority and Pakistan Railways bridges, to prevent floodwater blockages. Special attention was given to the de-silting and encroachment removal from urban nullahs in flood-prone cities including Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi, the statement said.
The chairman of the Federal Flood Commission briefed the meeting on pre-monsoon initiatives undertaken by the Commission, including readiness assessments and coordination plans. Stakeholders reported on ongoing monitoring of river flows, infrastructure readiness, and the functionality of meteorological and telemetry systems.
The minister also called for special attention to ensure the safety of vulnerable communities and public infrastructure.

ISLAMABAD: Amid final consultations on the budget, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) wants strict compliance with programme requirements, including the coverage of agriculture income tax in provincial budgets to ensure effective collection starting no later than September 2025.
The Fund also does not agree with a plan for incentivising enhanced power consumption desired by the federal government to absorb surplus capacity. Informed sources said the IMF wanted a strong commitment from the provinces for expenditure control, notwithstanding expansionary development plans presented by the provinces and approved by the National Economic Council (NEC). The four provinces have already exceeded their development allocations for next year by almost Rs850 billion than the IMF’s estimates.
The provinces, on the other hand, might not be able to provide a committed budget surplus this year, given the Centre’s revenue shortfall, and were maximising their next year allocations to ensure they did not lose their financial rights guaranteed by the National Finance Commission (NFC) before its next meeting.
The IMF also wants full implementation of the agriculture income tax and related services that the federal government and the provinces have not been able to settle, as the Centre believed corporate agriculture fell within its domain.
The sources said the authorities had tried their best getting a waiver for the sale of 7000mw of surplus power capacity at marginal cost — meaning no subsidy involved — but the Fund believed similar distortions in the economy, including taxation, incentives and allowances, had landed the country in a difficult state of affairs.
The government believed that surplus power could help boost economic activity if provided to new consumer sectors and industrial sectors even at breakeven rates, but the IMF believed it to be unfair to existing consumers paying a heavy price.
It was also considered unjustified to force old industries running at higher input costs to compete with new setups running on cheaper energy. The government was advised to continue cost-cutting efforts to stabilise the power sector and provide a level playing field to all. In this context, it was yet unclear if a section of the government trying to allocate 2000MW electricity to crypto farming would succeed in providing 3-4 cents per unit (Rs8-9 per unit) against Rs24-25 per unit base rate.
The IMF has also opposed provincial subsidies on electricity and gas as provided during the current year by Punjab, which intends to repeat it next year. In addition, it wants joint strategies to fight electricity and gas theft and smuggling to minimise financial leakage and tax loss. In this regard, the provinces would also have to right-size their departments in the next year to support a similar federal exercise during the current year.
The FBR tax target for next year would remain around Rs14.2tr or so as agreed during the first review of the extended fund programme a couple of months ago. Most of the other estimates shared at the time would also remain unchanged. There would be minor relaxation in tax rates for the salaried class but greater focus on recoveries from the retail sector. The cross-cutting theme of the next year’s budget would be digitisation and differential tax and transaction rates for cash and digital means.

• Sindh, KP ‘unhappy’ with exclusion of projects from federal budget
• Premier, all CMs to meet today on Indian moves against Pakistan’s water
ISLAMABAD: Fuelled by a 22pc increase in provincial allocations, the National Economic Council (NEC) on Wednesday approved with consensus a record Rs4.22 trillion national development outlay for the next fiscal year to upgrade growth rate to 4.2pc from 2.7 this year, despite an IMF-decreed 29pc cut in the public sector development programme (PSDP) compared to the current year.
The provincial expansionary stance is expected to come under the International Monetary Fund’s watch, which has been pushing for greater provincial cash surpluses to support the federal government in delivering a healthy amount for debt servicing, besides effective taxation of the agriculture income under a new national fiscal pact.
The meeting of the NEC — the country’s highest economic decision-making forum — was moved up by a day so that the prime minister, who chaired the meeting, could travel abroad. All provincial chief ministers, the deputy prime minister, and federal ministers for planning, finance and information were present. PM’s adviser Rana Sanaullah also attended the meeting.
The meeting also decided that the PM and all CMs would meet on Thursday morning for a special meeting in light of India’s move to disrupt Pakistan’s water share. They will ponder a strategy to safeguard Pakistan’s water resources.
The development portfolio includes Rs1tr from PSDP, Rs2.869 trillion from the provincial annual development plans (ADPs), and Rs355bn for separate projects by the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) through their resources.
Technically speaking, the Centre has allocated Rs880bn for the PSDP, down 20pc when compared to the current year’s revised allocation of Rs1.1tr and 37pc lower than the original allocation of Rs1.4tr. Yet, the government pitched the PSDP at Rs1tr after including Rs120bn to be generated through a petroleum levy imposed by the prime minister last month to finance projects in Balochistan.
The provincial share for next year has gone up by 22pc from Rs2.358tr. The provinces had pitched Rs2.795tr ADPs two days ago at the meeting of the Annual Plan Coordination Committee (APCC), but revised it to Rs2.869tr for the next year.
Punjab leads charge
The next year’s development plan is led by Punjab with a record Rs1.204tr, 20pc higher than the Centre, up 10.6pc compared to the current year’s Rs1.089tr. This is the first time a federating unit has exceeded the federal allocation, showing enhanced financial muscle of the provinces. Sindh trailed just behind the Centre with Rs967bn allocation, a healthy 27pc increase from its current year’s Rs705bn development fund. Punjab and Sindh enhanced their allocations by Rs16bn and Rs80bn respectively over what they had reported to the APCC on Monday.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa announced to invest Rs417bn in development next year, showing a massive 33pc increase over the current year’s allocation of Rs313bn. It had reported Rs440bn ADP in APCC but scaled down by Rs23bn. Balochistan, mostly dependent on the federal support, would announce Rs281bn development plan, up 12pc over the current year’s Rs252bn. Likewise, estimates for SOE’s projects were also jacked up to Rs355bn from Rs288bn two days ago.
Sources said despite their own heavy allocations, the Sindh and KP chief ministers complained over exclusion of their projects from the federal budget, while the Balochistan chief minister thanked the Centre for giving special attention to the restive province. KP chief minister’s adviser on finance Muzammil Aslam, however, appreciated the centre’s limitations in the given circumstances.
The cash-strapped government, however, did not forget protecting allocations for coalition partners’ parliamentarians scheme at Rs50bn and also enhanced funds for PML-N’s trademark road-building projects.
All other sectors, including special areas like Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, would be handicapped by lower allocations, as all sectors, including energy, food, and water, faced funding constraints.
Based on these spending plans, the government set next year’s growth target at 4.2pc, supported by 4.4pc target in agriculture output, 4.3pc in industry and 4pc in the services sector, and an inflation rate at 7.5pc.
It set the target for national savings at 14.3pc of GDP in FY 2025-26, slightly higher than the current year’s 14.1pc and total investment of 14.7pc of GDP, up from 13.8pc in FY 2024-25. This reflects a narrowing saving investment gap to be financed through modest external inflows.
Public investment is projected to increase from 2.9pc to 3.2p; similarly, private investment is also projected to rise from 9.1pc of GDP to 9.8pc. Fiscal and monetary policies will aim for consolidation and stability, with an expected inflation of 7.5pc due to the low base effect and risk of ongoing trade tensions and domestic tariff rationalisation measures.
The agriculture growth will be supported by a recovery in important crops (6.7pc) and cotton ginning (7pc), as well as robust performance in livestock.  The industrial sector is expected to benefit from a significant revival in LSM with 3.5pc growth, the planning ministry said, with 3pc growth in mining and quarrying, “alongside sustained growth momentum in construction and energy, gas and water supply”.
The services sector, which forms the largest share of GDP, is set to grow by 4pc, underpinned by stronger performance in wholesale and retail trade, transport, storage & communications, financial services and real estate.

• Bilawal says New Delhi can’t be ‘net security provider’ in the region if it can’t even defend its own skies
• Dar blames political rhetoric from Indian leaders for keeping South Asia tensions high
WASHINGTON / ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari have praised US President Donald Trump for his role in helping de-escalate the latest India-Pakistan military confrontation, and urged Washington to facilitate a comprehensive dialogue between the two nuclear neighbours.
Speaking at an event at the US Embassy in Islamabad marking the 249th anniversary of American independence, PM Shehbaz said the recent four-day conflict had revealed the “Pahalgam incident was a false-flag operation”, and credited President Trump for playing a decisive role in ensuring a ceasefire.
The premier said that the US president had shown beyond any doubt that “he is a man for peace … and beneficial business deals”.
He added, “President Trump is a man against escalation and a man against cold and hot war.”
PM Shehbaz said Pakistan downed six Indian fighter jets in self-defence after Indian aggression on May 6-7 resulted in the deaths of 33 Pakistani civilians.
“We responded with restraint and patience,” he said. “Our offer for an impartial international probe into the Pahalgam incident was met with aggression instead.”
He said that India “should have come out with solid evidence and convinced the world about the occurrence of the incident”.
PM Shehbaz also extended heartfelt felicitations to the US president and people of the United States, on his behalf and on behalf of the Pakistani nation, on celebrating their Independence Day.
He said the bilateral ties between the US and Pakistan were entering into renewed friendship, and the close contacts were being revived.
Facilitate dialogue
Meanwhile, speaking to US-based Pakistani journalists in Washington, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said President Trump “deserves credit” for helping facilitate the ceasefire between Pakistan and India last month.
“We should also pay attention to what the US president is saying. On 10 different occasions, he has taken credit for facilitating the ceasefire between India and Pakistan — and rightly so. He deserves that credit, because it was his efforts that helped make the ceasefire possible,” said Mr Bhutto-Zardari, the leader of the Pakistani delegation that began a three-day visit to Washington on Wednesday.
“So, if the US is willing to help Pakistan in maintaining this ceasefire, it is reasonable to expect that an American role in arranging a comprehensive dialogue would also be beneficial for us,” he added.
While India publicly denies that President Trump played any role in the ceasefire agreement and consistently rejects third-party mediation on bilateral issues, Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s remarks appear aimed at drawing the US into a more proactive diplomatic role in South Asia.
“Yes, America has an establishment, a thought pattern,” he acknowledged, “but knowing the ground realities, we are not delusional. We know what the realities of this city (Washington) are, what its geopolitics are, but we are here because we believe that our message is the message of truth. It aligns with international laws and relevant UN Security Council resolutions.”
His comments also targeted what he described as a failed US strategy of building up India as a regional security anchor. Referring to New Delhi’s recent troubles, he said: “What security will that net security provider provide to others when it cannot do that for itself? They were supposed to protect others, but couldn’t protect their own planes.”
“The concept of India as a counterweight to China now seems hollow. It’s not even a paperweight anymore. This approach, I believe, must now be re-evaluated,” he said.
India has long pitched itself as a “net security provider” in the Indo-Pacific region — a concept US policymakers have also endorsed. But Mr Bhutto-Zardari said this strategy had outlived its utility.
“I believe that this strategy of building up India as the net security provider has failed,” he said. “I believe what can really provide security to this region, and to the rest of the world, is peace bet­ween India and Pakistan.”
Rhetoric sustaining tensions
Separately, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Wednesday expressed readiness for a comprehensive dialogue with India, but warned that rising political rhetoric from Indian leaders is sustaining high tensions between the nuclear-armed rivals following last month’s military confrontation.
“Whenever they (Indians) want a dialogue, at any level, they will find us ready, but we are not desperate,” Mr Dar said during a press briefing in Islamabad.
Mr Dar said that although the ceasefire has held, political tensions remain inflamed by statements from Indian leaders, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who recently described the military exchange as “just a trailer” ahead of upcoming elections in Bihar.
“Political rhetoric is still on, possibly for internal reasons,” Mr Dar said. “I wish sense prevails. We are peace lovers, focused on economic revival, but dignity, sovereignty and territorial integrity come first.”
Mr Dar insisted that any future dialogue between Pakistan and India must be comprehensive, addressing terrorism, water rights under the Indus Waters Treaty, and broader bilateral issues. “When India is ready for talks, it will find us ready for talks on all issues.”
He also rejected Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishan­kar’s assertion that the talks should only cover the issue of terrorism, saying it wouldn’t work.

Trump said that there was no “immediate peace” on the horizon in Ukraine — which Russia invaded in 2022 — following what he described as a one-hour and 15-minute call with the Russian president.
On Iran, Trump said that Putin had offered to “participate” in talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, as Trump accused the Islamic republic of “slow walking” its response to Washington’s offer of a deal.
The call came three days after Ukraine conducted a massive, daring drone attack against Russian military airbases, saying it had destroyed several Russian nuclear-capable bombers worth billions of dollars.
Trump said that he and Putin had “discussed the attack on Russia’s docked airplanes, by Ukraine and also various other attacks that have been taking place by both sides”.
“It was a good conversation, but not a conversation that will lead to immediate peace. President Putin did say, and very strongly, that he will have to respond to the recent attack on the airfields,” Trump said in his post.
Trump did not say whether he had warned Putin off any such retaliation against Ukraine, which Washington has supported to the tune of billions of dollars in its fight against Russia.
‘Definitive answer’
The Republican has repeatedly alarmed Kyiv and Western allies by appearing to side with Putin over the war, and had a blazing Oval Office row with visiting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.
But Trump has also shown growing frustration with Putin as Russia has so far derailed the US president’s efforts to honour a campaign pledge to end the war within 24 hours, even if he never explained how this could be achieved.
The call between Trump and Putin did, however, show that Washington and Moscow may be eying cooperation on another key global issue — Iran.
Trump said he believed they were both “in agreement” that Iran could not have a nuclear weapon, and that time was running out for Tehran to respond to US offers of a deal.
“President Putin suggested that he will participate in the discussions with Iran and that he could, perhaps, be helpful in getting this brought to a rapid conclusion,” Trump said.
The US president added: “It is my opinion that Iran has been slow walking their decision on this very important matter, and we will need a definitive answer in a very short period of time!”
Putin told his Iranian counterpart Masoud Pezeshkian that Moscow was ready to help advance talks on a nuclear deal, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.
But Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said earlier today that Washington’s proposal was against Tehran’s national interest, amid sharp differences over whether Tehran can continue to enrich uranium.</p><small>2025-06-04 18:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607793-us-diplomat-underscores-enduring-pakistan-us-ties-at-independence-day-celebration' target='_blank'><strong>US diplomat underscores enduring Pakistan-US ties at Independence Day celebration</strong></a><br><p>

The committee was established by UNSC resolution 1373 (2001), adopted unanimously on September 28, 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
The committee, comprising all 15 UNSC members, is tasked with monitoring implementation of the above resolution, which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.
Pakistan was also appointed head of the UNSC committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of the sanctions measures on the Afghan Taliban.
In a press release, the Pakistan Mission to the UN called the appointments a “significant diplomatic development”.
 






It added that Pakistan was also appointed as the co-chair of the UNSC’s Informal Working Group (IWG) on documentation (working methods) and the newly established IWG on Sanctions.
The IWG on documentation focuses on improving the UNSC’s working methods, transparency, efficiency and inclusiveness.
The IWG on Sanctions issues aims to review and enhance the design, implementation, and effectiveness of UN sanctions regimes.
“These appointments represent an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s active engagement with the United Nations system, including its constructive role as an elected member of the Security Council,” the press release said, adding, “They are also an international recognition of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts”.
Pakistan, it said, remained committed to working with the UN and fellow member states in advancing the principles and purposes of the UN Charter as well as playing its part in the global fight against terrorism in collaboration with its international partners.
Pakistan began a two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member on the first day of the new year.
This marks Pakistan’s eighth term on the council, providing an opportunity to shape discussions on pivotal international issues, but also posing significant challenges.
Elected in June to replace Japan, Pakistan occupies one of the two Asia-Pacific seats on the UNSC. It will preside over the council in July, a key opportunity to set the agenda and foster dialogue.
While only permanent members hold veto power in the council, non-permanent members wield significant influence in terrorism-related sanctions committees, as decisions are made by consensus under established norms.
Pakistan’s term coincides with heightened tensions in conflict zones such as Gaza, held Kashmir and Syria.</p><small>2025-06-04 18:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607782-pakistan-elected-vice-chair-of-unscs-counter-terrorism-committee' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan elected vice chair of UNSC's Counter-Terrorism Committee</strong></a><br><p>

Two boys were found dead in a metal trunk of a house after both went missing in Kassoki village of Hafizabad district. Two uncles of one of the deceased boys, and their three accomplices, were among the suspects and police had arrested two of them.
Police had registered a case against four nominated and two unidentified suspects and started an investigation.
Hafizabad Crime Control Department (CCD) Deputy Superintendent of Police Ijaz Ahmed told Dawn.com today that one of the uncles was in CCD custody when the incident occurred. “The suspect drowned and his dead body was later recovered from the canal,” he added.
The first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered at Hafizabad’s Kasoki Police Station on the complaint of Sub-Inspector Ali Kamran under Section 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
“During an interrogation, the suspect confessed to the crime, saying that he had physically tortured the victims with a wooden bat,” the FIR said, adding that he hid the bat in his living room.
It added that the police were on their way with the suspect to recover the bat when the vehicle slowed down near a canal near Kariala village after approaching a pothole, where the suspect removed the handcuffs from his right hand. The FIR said the police tried to stop the suspect but he jumped out of the vehicle and ran towards the bushes.
As the police were chasing after the suspect, they heard a splashing sound, the FIR said and added that the police called on him, but the suspect kept moving forward in the water and disappeared.
Last month, Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) Sahil’s report revealed that 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country in 2024. The children were most vulnerable to abuse in the age group of 11-15 years, in which more boys than girls were reported.
The Punjab Home Department recently launched a campaign to raise awareness about the safety of children. The campaign, called ‘Safe Children, Safe Punjab’, was created “to prevent incidents of sexual abuse of minors”.</p><small>2025-06-04 17:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/041819343e0efdb.jpg?r=195830' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915401/pm-shehbaz-invites-opposition-leader-to-consult-on-new-chief-election-commissioner' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz invites opposition leader to consult on new chief election commissioner</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has invited the opposition leader for consultations on appointing the next chief election commissioner (CEC), months after the incumbent’s term expired in January, it emerged on Wednesday.
The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis­sioner and two members of the Election Com­mission of Pakistan (ECP)  exp­ired on March 12, with no action from the government.
The 26th Amendment allowed the CEC and the members to continue till their successors come in. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution, the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.
In a letter dated May 16 and addressed to Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub — seen by Dawn.com — the prime minister noted that the term of the incumbent CEC, Sikandar Sultan Raja, expired on January 27 this year, adding that he was holding office in accordance with the second proviso to clause 1 of Article 215 of the Constitution (term of office of the Commissioner [and members]).
“In term of clause (2A) of Article 213 and sub-clause (b) of clause (2) of Article 218 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, three names each for the appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and two Members (i.e. for Sindh and Balochistan) are to be forwarded to the Parliamentary Committee for hearing and confirmation of any one person against each position,” the letter read.
“In view of the aforesaid, you are invited for a meeting for consultation, in terms of clause (2A) of Article 213 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, in order to finalize three names each for appointment of Chief Election Commissioner and Members from Sindh and Balochistan.”
No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs.
Disqualification reference
Separately, a hearing on the disqualification reference against Ayub was adjourned until July 1 as he was obligated to attend the upcoming federal budget session in parliament.
Last week, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Sadiq forwarded a reference seeking Ayub’s disqualification to the ECP.
The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Ayub in the 2024 general election in NA-18 (Haripur) by a margin of 82,000 votes.
A five-member committee chaired by the CEC presided over the hearing, with Ayub stating that he had yet to appoint counsel.
“The budget session will start soon and I am a member of the Finance Committee. The budget meeting will be held for two weeks,” he said, requesting time to attend the budget session and appoint a leader.
Sindh Election Commission member Nisar Durrani said that there is a 90-day time limit to act on the speaker’s reference. The commission granted Ayub’s request and adjourned the hearing until June 24.
In a separate case in which the opposition leader was accused of rigging by Babar Nawaz, the opposition leader’s lawyer sought time to submit a reply and arguments. The commission adjourned the hearing until July 1.
 






Speaking to reporters following the hearing, Ayub assailed the National Assembly for sending the reference “without using their brains”.
“The speaker did not consult me about this reference,” he said. “In the 2018 elections, I beat my opponent by 40,000 votes. He previously approached the Abbottabad High Court, but the case was dismissed.”</p><small>2025-06-04 17:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607774-pm-shehbaz-sees-pakistan-us-bilateral-ties-entering-into-renewed-friendship' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz sees Pakistan-US bilateral ties entering into renewed friendship</strong></a><br><p>

In May, a family suffered from health problems after consuming food believed to be contaminated, resulting in the death of three children in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Nowshera district.
Nowshera police spokesperson Turk Ali Shah told Dawn.com, “The family had consumed Mithai [sweets] with tea at night, after which their condition deteriorated. Three siblings died after consuming poisonous food. Their mother was in critical condition.”
According to Wednesday’s statement, police formed an investigation team to probe the case, which was registered on May 19 upon the complaint of the victim’s father. An inquiry was launched under Section 174 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) (police to inquire and report on suicide, etc).
“District Police Chief Abdul Rashid formed an investigative team led by SP (Superintendent of Police) Alamzaib Khan and assigned them the task of ascertaining the facts of the case,” the statement read.
The team comprised Nowshera Cantt Circle Sub-divisional Police Officer (SDPO) Muqaddam Khan, Azakhel Station House Officer (SHO) Adil Syed and Investigation Officer Naik Zaman Khan.
“The complainant and his wife, while recording their statements under Section 164 of the CrPC (power to record statements and confessions), filed a formal claim against his mother, claiming that due to [a] domestic dispute, she had given his wife and children a poisonous substance, which caused their death,” the statement read.
Nowshera police said that the suspect had been arrested and that further investigation was underway.
Last week, a woman turned out to be the killer of her two minor children in the Rangpur locality of Gujrat, Punjab as A-Division police claimed to have resolved a mysterious double murder case.
The suspect confessed to strangling her five-year-old son and three-year-old daughter to enter into a second marriage with a man.</p><small>2025-06-04 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0420111955d01c5.jpg?r=202503' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915407/200000-afghans-left-pakistan-since-deportations-renewed' target='_blank'><strong>200,000 Afghans left Pakistan since deportations renewed</strong></a><br><p>More than 200,000 Afghans have left Pakistan since the government renewed a deportation drive in April, with Iran also stepping up expulsions of Afghans.
Generations of Afghans have fled to Pakistan and Iran during decades of successive wars, seeking safety and better economic opportunities.
Both governments have grown weary of large migrant populations and ordered millions to leave under the threat of arrest.
Pakistan has launched a strict campaign to evict more than 800,000 Afghans who have had their residence permits cancelled, including some who were born in the country or lived there for decades.
According to the interior ministry, more than 135,000 Afghans left Pakistan in April, while around 67,000 departed in May and more than 3,000 were sent back in the first two days of June.
The number of returnees has slowed ahead of the Eidul Azha holiday later this week, but some Afghans were still crossing the main border points from Pakistan today.
“We left behind our orchards” and livelihoods, 21-year-old farmer Mohammad Wali told AFP near the Spin Boldak crossing.
“But we said to ourselves, ‘If we stay, maybe one day we’ll lose our dignity,’ so it’s better to return to our homeland now.”
 
 

The UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM) on Tuesday voiced concern over a surge in Afghan families being deported from Iran, recording 15,675 crossing in May, a more than two-fold increase from the previous month.
Iranian officials have ordered Afghans without documentation to leave by July 6.
Nader Yarahmadi, from the Iranian interior ministry, said on state television that it would affect around four million of the more than 6m Afghans who Iran says are in the country.
The IOM said the influx across both borders threatens to strain Afghanistan’s already “fragile reception and reintegration systems”.
It again called for “all countries to immediately suspend the forced return of Afghans, regardless of their immigration status, until safe, voluntary, and dignified return conditions are in place”.
Rise in border violence
Millions of Afghans have poured into Pakistan over the past several decades, fleeing successive wars, as well as hundreds of thousands who arrived after the return of the Taliban government in 2021.
A campaign to evict them began in 2023, prompting hundreds of thousands to cross the border in a matter of weeks, fearing harassment or arrest. In total, more than one million Afghans have left Pakistan.
Islamabad has labelled Afghans “terrorists and criminals”, but analysts say the expulsions are designed to pressure Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to control militancy in the border regions.
Last year, Pakistan recorded the highest number of deaths from attacks in a decade.
Pakistan’s security forces are under enormous pressure along the border with Afghanistan, confronting rising attacks by terrorists in Balochistan and the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
 
 

The government frequently accuses Afghan nationals of taking part in attacks and blames Kabul for allowing militants to take refuge on its soil, a charge Taliban leaders deny.
Some Pakistanis have grown weary of hosting a large Afghan population as security and economic woes deepen, and the deportation campaign has widespread support.
Pakistan is now threatening to lift the protection granted to the 1.3m Afghans holding refugee cards issued by the UN high commissioner for refugees at the end of June.</p><small>2025-06-04 15:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607764-karachi-to-experience-low-intensity-tremors-this-week' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi to 'experience low-intensity tremors this week'</strong></a><br><p>
