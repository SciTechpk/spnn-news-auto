The incident occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a cricket match between the Green Shirts and Sri Lanka was also being held in Rawalpindi.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, while briefing the media outside the court, said that a “suicide blast” had occurred at 12:39pm. He said that 12 people were killed and 27 were injured, adding that the wounded were being provided medical treatment, with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif personally in touch with the hospitals in question.
Later, however, the spokesperson for the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Dr Mubahshir Daha, said that “12 people have been martyred in the blast”, while the number of injured had risen to 36, as per a statement.
“Following the attack, an emergency has been declared at PIMS, and medical assistance to the injured is underway,” the spokesperson said. “All resources are being utilised to assist the injured.”
Speaking to Dawn, Daha said that “Thirty-six injured people were brought to PIMS, out of which 18 have been discharged after treatment, while 14 have been moved to wards, three are in the emergency section, and one is in the operation theatre.”
In the evening, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal visited the injured at PIMS and directed the hospital staff to provide the best medical assistance to them, a statement said.

‘Perpetrators will bear consequences’
Providing details of the blast, Naqvi told reporters that the attacker stood outside the court for around 12 minutes before he detonated the explosives.
“He first attempted to go inside the court, but then targeted the police vehicle after he was unable to do so,” Naqvi said.
He added that an investigation was underway and identifying the attacker was a top priority. “I assure you we will identify him in the next few hours,” he said.
“We are linking this blast today with a lot of things and, in the coming hours or days, we will be very clear about it,” the interior minister said.
“We are not taking this blast as just another one,” he added, noting that its timing and the federal capital being targeted “has a lot of messages”.
“I don’t want to say anything about how Indians do…. like where and what happened half an hour before the blast even occurs,” he quipped.
“We will go with complete evidence and details. Whoever is involved in this, whether locals or foreigners, we will not spare anyone,” the minister vowed, affirming that the state will not remain quiet on the matter.
“We have a clear message that whoever did this will bear the consequences.”
The minister detailed that CCTV footage showed that the suicide bomber, standing outside the court building, “kept trying to figure out from different angles how to go inside”.
Responding to queries about those behind the blast, Naqvi said, “As far as this (Islamabad blast) is concerned, we will let you know as soon as this individual is identified.
The minister noted the injured included some police personnel, adding that the driver of the vehicle targeted remained safe. A lawyer was among the casualties, he added.
Asked about any security alerts, the interior minister replied, “There is nothing as such; routine matters are taking place.”
Naqvi noted that various activities were taking place in the capital, including political developments, events involving international guests and sports games.  He assured the public that the law enforcement agencies, the army and the Rangers were working together to keep the city secured.
The minister said he had directed the chief commissioner not to allow any vehicles into Islamabad without an e-tag on them after two weeks.
Meanwhile, security around the Judicial Complex, adjoining courts, and other sensitive buildings in Islamabad has been further tightened, police officials told the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
‘Massive blast’
Videos of the incident on social media showed flames and plumes of smoke rising into the air from the remains of a charred vehicle behind a security barrier.
Lawyer Mohammed Shahzad Butt, who witnessed the explosion, told AFP that it was a “massive blast”.
“Everyone started running inside out of panic. I have seen at least five dead bodies lying at the front gate,” he told AFP.

Rustam Malik, another lawyer, told AFP he “heard a loud bang at the gate” as he was entering the complex. “It was complete chaos, lawyers and people were running inside the complex. I saw two dead bodies lying on the gate, and several cars were on fire,” said Malik.
‘Nefarious act of India’, ‘wake up call’
PM Shehbaz strongly condemned the bombing “by the khawarij active with Indian support and the Fitna al-Hindustan”, according to a statement from the federal government. Extending his prayers for the loved ones of the deceased, he directed that those injured be provided with the best medical facilities.
“The prime minister ordered an investigation into the incident and said that the perpetrators will be brought to justice, come what may,” the statement read.
“Khawarij, active on Indian instigation from Afghanistan, also attacked innocent children in Wana at this time; it is time for the world to condemn such nefarious conspiracies of India,“ it added. “Both attacks are the worst examples of Indian state terrorism in the region.”
“We will continue the war against them until the complete elimination of the scourge of terrorism and the suppression of the last terrorist of Fitna al-Hindustan and Fitna al-Khawarij,” the statement concluded.
 






Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while Balochistan-based groups are designated as Fitna-al-Hindustan, to indicate India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
In a post on X, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed his condolences to the bereaved families, prayed for the recovery of the injured, and paid tribute to law enforcement agencies.
 






Defence Minister Khawaja Asif called the incident a “wake-up call”.
“We are in a state of war. Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan Army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan, today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts is a wake-up call,” he said.
“In this environment, it would be futile to hold out greater hope for successful negotiations with the rulers of Kabul,” he added.
 






Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that without the use of Afghan soil or facilitation, attacks like the blast in Islamabad and the bombing at Wana Cadet College would not be possible.
“Whenever we arrest terrorists or their handlers, Afghan nationals are among them,” he told Geo News. “Our law enforcement agencies have brought the situation in Wana under control. It is an ongoing development. It appears that these attacks are being carried out on the orders of the Afghan Taliban.”
Tarar mentioned that the attack is clearly linked to India, adding that New Delhi has a mindset that “not only supports the Afghan Taliban, but there is a nexus between India and Afghanistan”.
“Let me assure you, on behalf of the state of Pakistan, the security forces, the Pakistan Army and law enforcement agencies know how to deal with this threat,” Tarar added.
“It is truly upsetting that 12 of our people were killed … but the state will bring whoever is behind terrorism to justice. This conspiracy between the Indian and Afghan-backed Fitna al-Khawarij and Fitna al-Hindustan will fail.
“Their capacity to hit hard targets has waned, so they are resorting to soft target attacks. This means they are on their last legs,” the information minister added.
Tarar said that the state must act according to the National Action Plan to ensure that attacks like the ones today no longer occur.
“The prime minister has taken strong notice of this and said that he will bring those responsible to justice,” the minister added. “We are fully resolved, fully committed, and the situation will improve, God willing.”
Security high alert in Rawalpindi
According to Rawalpindi Police, following the suicide attack in Islamabad, a security high alert was issued for Rawalpindi.
Security arrangements for the ongoing One-Day International Match (ODI) match in Rawalpindi have been tightened further,“ the police said in a statement.
A Dawn correspondent in Rawalpindi said that the foolproof security and alternative traffic arrangements were causing difficulties for citizens.
“Due to ongoing development projects in Rawalpindi, important roads in the city are also closed, causing the flow of traffic to be diverted towards the adjacent areas and streets,” he said.
Later in the day, Naqvi, who is also the Chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), visited the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium and reviewed in detail the security arrangements for the ongoing match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
According to a press release, Naqvi reiterated that the Sri Lankan team has been accorded the status of State Guests and assured that their security will be ensured at all costs.
“He stressed that maintaining peace and stability, along with promoting sports and other activities, is a collective goal.”
‘Terrorism has no religion’
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar also condemned the incident in Islamabad and expressed grief over the loss of precious human lives.
“Suicide bombers and terrorists have no religion. They enemies of humanity,” he said, adding that Sindh police had been put on high alert until further orders.

“Checking and surveillance should be tightened at the province’s entry and exit points, important highways, roads and side roads, while intelligence measures should be made more effective and coordinated, especially in crime-affected areas and suburbs,” he said.
Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the blast and wished a speedy recovery to the injured.
“Those who spill the blood of innocent people are enemies of this nation and humanity,” he said as per a statement issued by the PPP media cell, stressing that “terrorists do not deserve any mercy.”
 






National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, condemning the attack, said, “Terrorists cannot demoralise the nation by their cowardly actions.”
He stressed that national unity was unavoidable to eliminate terrorism.
 






KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi prayed for those killed in the attack, saying, “The incident is extremely regrettable; cowardly attacks cannot dampen our spirits.”
 






Legal fraternity urges strict action
The legal fraternity also strongly denounced the explosion and expressed grief at the passing of their colleagues, praying for the injured and urging strict action against those responsible.
Speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court, senior lawyers expressed deep concern over the prevailing national situation and emphasised the need for solidarity among all segments of society.
Senior lawyer Hamid Khan said the country was “passing through a critical phase and stressed that all institutions and citizens must work together to protect the Constitution,” according to the AAP.
Former Attorney General Munir A. Malik said the entire nation mourned the loss of lives in the incident and stood in solidarity with the victims’ families. Ex-president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Abid Zuberi, addressed a press conference where he presented a resolution condemning the terrorist attack in the strongest terms and demanding that the perpetrators be brought to justice.
“The lawyers collectively reiterated their firm resolve to defend constitutional supremacy, uphold the independence of the judiciary, and promote unity and peace in the country,” the report said.
The Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) demanded that those responsible for this barbaric act be brought to justice without delay. Additionally, they called upon the federal government and relevant law enforcement agencies to take all necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of the legal community and of the general citizens to prevent similar incidents in the future.
UK asks citizens to ‘monitor travel advisory’
British High Commissioner to Pakistan, Jane Marriott, asked British citizens to monitor travel advice.
“We are aware of an explosion in Islamabad which has reportedly left several people dead,” she wrote on X. “We are closely tracking, and British nationals should monitor travel advice. My thoughts are with the loved ones of those who have lost their lives.”
 






On the other hand, the United States, the European Union, and China condemned the terrorist attack.
“Our condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in today’s senseless attack,” a statement from the United States Embassy in Islamabad said on X. “We wish a swift recovery to those injured.

A statement from China’s Embassy in Pakistan read: “We strongly condemn the suicide blast near Islamabad District Judicial Complex, extend our deepest condolences to the deceased victims, express our sincere sympathies to their families and the injured, and we wish for the early recovery of the injured.”
 






The State of Qatar also denounced the attacks taking place in Islamabad and Wana. “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reaffirms Qatar’s firm stance rejecting all forms of violence, terrorism, and criminal acts, regardless of their motives or justifications.
“The Ministry expresses the State of Qatar’s sincere condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and people of Pakistan, and wishes a swift recovery to the injured.”

At least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured in a suicide blast outside the district and sessions court building in Islamabad’s G-11 area.
The incident occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a cricket match between the Greenshirts and Sri Lanka was also being held in Rawalpindi.
The United States embassy in Islamabad said on X that it “stands in solidarity with Pakistan in the struggle against terrorism”.

We condemn this attack and all forms of terrorism and remain committed to supporting the Government of Pakistan’s efforts to ensure peace and stability in their nation.”
 






In a press statement, the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) also “strongly condemned” the suicide blast.
“An incident of this magnitude in the heart of the federal capital raises serious concerns regarding the safety of the legal community as well as of the common citizens,” SCBA President Haroonur Rashid was quoted as saying.
“The [SCBA] demands that those responsible for this barbaric act be brought to justice without delay,” said the statement, adding that they called upon the federal government and relevant law enforcement agencies to take all “necessary measures to ensure the safety and security of the legal community and of the general citizens to prevent similar incidents in the future”.
Human rights activist and lawyer Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir said there were not enough words to condemn the “heinous attack”.

“Terrorists who target innocent civilians deserve no leniency,” Bilawal was quoted as saying.
 






Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan said “cowardly acts” such as today’s attack “cannot weaken our resolve and morale”.
“I extend my heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and pray for the swift recovery of the injured,” he posted on X. “Our struggle will continue until the complete eradication of terrorism and the establishment of peace.”

“The war has come to the cities. Amendments and immunity won’t stop it,” journalist Zarrar Khuhro wrote on X. “Red lines have been probed and there are absolutely no good options on the table.”
Comparing it to the early 2000s’ wave of terror, the senior journalist deemed the situation “worse” as it involved “more sophisticated and far better” equipment and funding.

Crude bombs were hurled at 11 locations throughout the day, while three buses were set on fire, prompting the authorities to ramp up security. No casualties were reported in the arson incidents.
The police headquarters directed all stations in Dhaka to intensify patrols and surveillance ahead of November 13, when the International Crimes Tribunal is scheduled to set the date for delivering its verdict in a case against ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina.
Security has also been strengthened around key installations and religious establishments across the country.
In a statement last night, the Chief Adviser’s Press Wing said the Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) and Rapid Action Battalion have launched a citywide manhunt to arrest those involved in the attacks. It also warned that any attempt to disrupt the nation’s religious coexistence would be met with the full force of the law.
Chain of attacks
The attacks began early in the morning and continued until late at night.
The first explosion occurred around 3:45am in front of the Grameen Bank headquarters, an institution associated with Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus. Two people on a motorcycle hurled a crude bomb at the building before fleeing, said Sajjad Roman, officer-in-charge of Mirpur model police station.
Less than four hours later, another duo on a motorbike threw crude bombs at Prabartana, a business establishment owned by Fisheries and Livestock Adviser Farida Akhter in Mohammadpur, said Mohammadpur OC Kazi Rafique Ahmed.
Around 7:30am, four crude bombs were hurled, two targeting Ibn Sina Hospital and two others in front of Midas Centre in Dhanmondi, said Shah Mostafa Tariquzzaman, assistant commissioner of DMP’s Dhanmondi zone.
In the evening, multiple explosions rocked different parts of the capital, near Mouchak intersection around 6pm, in front of Bangladesh Betar in Agargaon around 6:20pm, on Khilgaon Flyover around 6:30pm, and near Shah Ali Market in Mirpur around 6:40pm.

Around 10:00pm, another bomb was dropped from the flyover, said Inspector (Investigation) Shah Alam of Shajahanpur police station.
The day’s final and most dramatic incident took place around 11:10pm, when attackers on a motorcycle hurled a crude bomb at the NCP office at Bangla Motor, leaving a bystander with minor injuries.
One unexploded bomb was recovered from the scene, said NCP Joint Member Secretary Mushfiqus Salehin.
He added that party activists chased two individuals fleeing on a motorcycle after the blast.
“Later, three more suspects were detained nearby, bringing the total to five. They were handed over to the police,” he said.
On Friday, several crude bombs were hurled at St Mary’s Cathedral in Kakrail and in front of the residences for priests and teachers of St Joseph School and College in Mohammadpur.
Meanwhile, two buses were set ablaze in Shahjadpur and Merul Badda early yesterday morning, while another was torched around 7:30pm in front of Lab Aid Hospital in Dhanmondi, police said.
Security alert
Following the incidents, the DMP banned all types of public gatherings around major government establishments in Dhaka, including the ICT premises, until further notice.
The spate of attacks coincided with the Awami League’s (AL) online call for a ‘Dhaka Lockdown’ on November 13, even though all political activities of the party remain banned.
The police’s Detective Branch (DB) said it has intensified counter-intelligence operations and surveillance to trace those responsible.
“They (AL activists) have declared they are willing to go to any extent for their leaders. We are investigating their involvement along with others,” said Shafiqul Islam, chief of the DB.
He said 34 AL leaders and activists were arrested in separate raids across the capital on charges of planning, financing and participating in flash processions.
The DMP also detained a 28-year-old Chhatra League member in connection with the crude bomb blasts, according to a statement from the Chief Adviser’s Press Wing.
The government reiterated its unwavering commitment to interfaith harmony. Security was reinforced at churches, temples, mosques and other religious institutions across Dhaka.
“We have been arresting those involved in subversive activities based on intelligence inputs. Whenever anyone is found involved, we act,” said AHM Sahadat Hossain, spokesperson of Bangladesh Police. “Pre-election violence in Bangladesh is unfortunately common, but we are prepared to prevent and respond.”
At a special security meeting at Rajarbagh Police Lines on Friday, police higher-ups reviewed the overall law and order situation and directed all Dhaka stations to intensify patrols, increase surveillance, and secure vital installations.
Following the meeting, the DMP conducted citywide security drills from 4pm to 5pm to test emergency response preparedness.
Nationwide directives
The security alerts extended beyond the capital.
Railway authorities were instructed to step up vigilance to prevent sabotage targeting rail tracks, stations and rolling stock.
In a letter to railway managers in Pakshi and Lalmonirhat on Sunday, officials warned of possible attacks and ordered night patrols, enhanced lighting, 24-hour depot security, fuel storage protection, and ID checks at all entry points.
Managers were also told to regularly inspect CCTV systems, tighten access to workshops, conduct platform checks twice daily, and monitor ticket counters and waiting areas for suspicious activity.
On November 3, Emaul Haque, Officer-in-Charge of Sher-i-Bangla Nagar Police Station, sent a letter to the National Institute of Ophthalmology in Dhaka, instructing authorities to strengthen on-site security to prevent sabotage.
The Dhaka Mass Transit Company Ltd (DMTCL), operator of the city’s metro rail, has cancelled all staff leave until further notice, in anticipation of possible unrest.
Although the order did not specify a reason, insiders told The Daily Star that the precautionary move came amid intelligence warnings of potential political violence this month.
As the capital braces for November 13, officials said law enforcement agencies have been placed on the highest alert.
“Every attempt to destabilise the country will be dealt with swiftly and firmly,” a senior home ministry official said. “Our priority is public safety, national unity, and protecting the democratic transition.”

Sources had earlier confirmed that all cadets were safe but said around 300 people were still inside the college.
Following the rescue of civilians from the incident site, sources said the “operation will now be brought to a comprehensive and decisive conclusion”.
“The security operation will continue until the last militant is sent to hell.”
The clearance operation is being led by inspector general of Frontier Corps Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (South), sources said.
“Due to the presence of Afghan militants inside the college, the security forces are conducting the operation with utmost care to ensure the safety of the cadets,” said security sources in an earlier update, adding that the operation will continue until the last terrorist is eliminated.
State-run PTV, citing security sources, reported that at the time of the attack, approximately 650 individuals, including 525 cadets, were present at the college.
Speaking to the media earlier today, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that “three [people] have been martyred” during the ongoing operation, without specifying who they were.
However, he had said at the time that security forces had successfully rescued everyone from the building.
“The terrorists had planned to hold them (cadets) hostage there, but their plan could not materialise. However, the clearance of the area is underway and will be completed in a bit,” the minister added.

Security forces had killed two terrorists yesterday after attackers rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the college’s main gate, causing it to collapse and damaging an adjacent structure.
In his media talk, Naqvi said, “We are very clear in that that Afghanistan is directly involved in the entire attack.
Noting that the terrorists had been identified as Afghan, the interior minister said the attackers’ “communication with their people in Afghanistan also continued the entire night”.
The minister further said, “I will request my brothers in KP that please do not defame yourselves. We must stand with our country, with our forces who are clearing these terrorists.
“They (terrorists) are trying to defame you; they are trying to take you on board based on their ties, but Pakistan should be the priority for us. Any other country comes later,” he added.
Referring to multiple visits carried out by top Pakistani leadership to Afghanistan, Naqvi said: “The foreign minister, deputy prime minister, defence minister — we all have gone numerous times and presented them with evidence and details on how they (terrorists) are being trained in Afghanistan, how they plan and then come here to carry out attacks.”
He asserted, “We are very clear in this that Afghanistan must stop them under all circumstances. In case of not stopping them, we will have no other option but to deal with the terrorists who are attacking our country.”
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi today denounced the attack, saying that “targeting innocent students and academic institutions is an extremely cowardly act”.
He noted that a peace jirga has been called by the PTI tomorrow in the KP Assembly to discuss the province’s volatile law and order situation. The federal government and the KP opposition Awami National Party (ANP) will attend the moot, where tribal elders will be present as well.
The KP CM also condemned the attack during his address at a sports event in Peshawar, adding, “We will not be scared by these. We have been facing them, […] we will once again bring peace to the entire Pakistan, especially Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”
 






3 terrorists hiding inside a college building
Earlier today, security sources said that a clearance operation to eliminate three terrorists was underway at the educational facility.
“An operation was underway to eliminate three khwarij present inside the Cadet College,” security sources said in a statement, adding that it was being reported that all of them hailed from Afghanistan.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), while khwarij refers to terrorists associated with it.
The security operation will continue till the eradication of the last terrorist, security sources asserted.

They added that the terrorists were hidden in a building that was located far away from the cadets’ residence. They asserted that the clearance operation was being carried out with great expertise to ensure that the cadets’ lives remained safe and they were not harmed.
The security source said the terrorists were “continuously taking directives from Afghanistan on the telephone”.
Separately, PTV, citing security sources, also reported that “three Afghan khwarij present in the Cadet College have been confined to a specific building of the college, and security forces have the area surrounded”.
 






The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) had said yesterday that the terrorists inside the college were in contact with their handlers in Afghanistan and “are getting instructions“.
“This blatant act of barbarism orchestrated by khwarij from Afghanistan is in contrast to assertions made by the Afghan Taliban Regime claiming non-presence of these terrorist groups on their soil,“ the ISPR had said.
Hailing yesterday’s response by the military, a security source noted, “The Pakistan Army’s soldiers sent two khwarij to hell by taking immediate and courageous action.”
“Terrorists attacking innocent tribal children have no connection with Islam or the prosperity of Pakistan’s people,” they asserted.
It had further said, “These khwarij belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij have once again tried to repeat the barbaric act of terrorism carried out by them in Army Public School Peshawar in 2014.“
 
 

On Dec 16, 2014, Pakistan lived through one of its most horrific chapters. The attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar and the operation to clear out the terrorists unfolded in less than 10 hours, during which 147 people, including 132 schoolchildren, were martyred.
The military maintained that the latest attack aimed to instil fear among the youth of the tribal areas, “who are acquiring quality education at their doorstep to excel in life and achieve a better future for not only themselves and their families but also for their communities“.
Earlier on Monday, security forces killed 20 terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBO) in KP — eight in North Waziristan and 12 in the Dara Adam Khel district. Another four were eliminated in Balochistan’s Kalat.

Salman hit a sparkling century and Hussain made a career-best 62 as Pakistan rallied from being 95-4 at one stage to post 299-5 in the first One-day International at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.
Sri Lanka were well and truly on top in the first half of Pakistan’s innings thanks to a mesmerising spell of leg-spin bowling by Hasaranga (3-54), only for Salman, who made an unbeaten 105, and Hussain to get stuck in and revive their side’s hopes with a 138-run partnership before Mohammad Nawaz applied the finishing touches with a quickfire 36 not out.
After Charith Asalanka won the toss and opted to bowl, Asitha Fernando rewarded his skipper with an early breakthrough when he trapped Saim Ayub lbw with a searing yorker.
Saim looked a pale shadow of the man who had thrashed South Africa to all parts just three days ago in Faisalabad and it was a struggle for his opening partner Fakhar Zaman and one-drop Babar Azam as well.
Pakistan only got past 50 in the 16th over and Fakhar departed soon after hitting the first six of the innings for a laborious 55-ball 32 when Hasaranga had him stumped. The left-hander also hit two fours.
Hasaranga then had Mohammad Rizwan lbw before adding to Pakistan’s misery when he cleaned up Babar (29) with a googly. Babar’s departure, after facing 51 balls and hitting three fours, left Pakistan tottering at 95-4 and it could’ve been worse when Hasaranga rapped Hussain Talat on the pads, only for the umpire to give it not out and Sri Lanka having burned both their reviews.
Hussain would make most of that reprieve and after Salman took Pakistan’s score beyond 100 in the 26th over with a late cut off Hasaranga for his third boundary, the left-hander deposited Maheesh Theekshana to the cover fence.
Salman and Hussain kept rotating the strike and both helped themselves a four each in the 31st over by Asalanka, before the latter brought up 150 for Pakistan when he cut Theekshana away for four in the 34th.
Hussain was growing in confidence with every delivery — a drive down the ground for four off Hasaranga exemplifying that, before he cut Liyanage for another boundary — and when Salman raised his ninth ODI half-century off 52 deliveries, Pakistan were set for the charge as the crowd began filling in once the floodlights were turned on.
Hussain showed that intent when he deposited Hasaranga for a one-bounce four wide of long-on to get to 42, beyond his previous ODI high, and Salman got his fifth four when he got gloves to a delivery going down legside before taking Pakistan past 200 with his sixth midway through the 41st over.
Salman moved into the seventies with a four over cover and Hussain brought up his maiden fifty off 53 balls before celebrating it with a six over Theekshana’s head.
Sri Lanka finally broke through when Hussain was out lbw but Salman kept going and took Pakistan to 250 on the first ball of the 46th over. The right-hander then got successive boundaries off Dusmantha Chameera before completing his second ODI ton off just 83 balls with a single.
Nawaz provided an able hand from the other end, getting two boundaries as 20 runs came off the 48th over. Fernando was then deposited by the left-hander for six over long-off and Nawaz would get two fours in the last over as Pakistan set Sri Lanka a target of exactly 300.</p><small>2025-11-11 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1117555404c241d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954476/state-of-war-defence-minister-asif-says-futile-to-hope-for-positive-talks-with-kabul-after-islamabad-attack' target='_blank'><strong>‘State of war’: Defence Minister Asif says futile to hope for positive talks with Kabul after Islamabad attack</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Tuesday said Pakistan was in a “state of war” after at least 12 people were killed and 36 were injured on Tuesday in a suicide blast in the federal capital, adding that it was futile to hope for any positive outcome of talks with Kabul after the incident.
The incident occurred as international events were being hosted in the capital, including the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference and the 6th Margalla Dialogue, while a cricket match between the Greenshirts and Sri Lanka was also being held in Pindi.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif blamed the incident on terrorists “active with Indian support”. The incident comes following a breakdown in negotiations with the Afghan Taliban government.
“We are in a state of war. Anyone who thinks that the Pakistan Army is fighting this war in the Afghan-Pakistan border region and the remote areas of Balochistan should take today’s suicide attack at the Islamabad district courts as a wake-up call: this is a war for all of Pakistan, in which the Pakistan Army is giving daily sacrifices and making the people feel secure,” said the defence minister in a post on X.
“In this environment, it would be futile to hold out greater hope for successful negotiations with the rulers of Kabul.”
He said Kabul could put a stop to the ongoing terrorism in Pakistan, “but bringing this war all the way to Islamabad is a message from Kabul, to which … Pakistan has the full strength to respond”.
 






Earlier today, PM Shehbaz said that Kabul must understand that lasting peace could only be achieved by reining in terrorist groups operating from Afghan soil.
The premier especially called attention to the recent border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, calling Islamabad’s response “firm and decisive, teaching an unforgettable lesson”.
Three top Turkish officials are due in Islamabad this week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Turkiye and Qatar have been acting as mediators between Islamabad and Kabul following an escalation of tensions between the two neighbours over the past weeks.
Border clashes and talks
Talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban followed weeks of shuttle diplomacy after deadly border clashes last month plunged relations between the two neighbours to their lowest point since the Taliban seized power in Kabul in 2021.
The hostilities began when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.
For its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.
After the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on October 15 in the evening, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha.
Since the skirmishes between Oct 11 and 15, Pakistan and Afghan Taliban representatives have held two rounds of talks — first in Doha and then in Istanbul — but a final agreement has not yet been achieved.
After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process, with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
For the third round, under the joint mediation of Turkiye and Qatar, delegations from both sides arrived in Istanbul last week but could not come to an agreement.</p><small>2025-11-11 13:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633135-pakistan-capable-of-giving-befitting-response-as-kabul-brings-terror-to-islamabad-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan capable of giving befitting response as Kabul brings terror to Islamabad: Asif</strong></a><br><p>

The attack, said to be a remotely controlled improvised explosive device (IED), targeted a security forces convoy, said security sources.
The explosion heavily damaged a security forces vehicle. The injured were shifted to the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) D.I Khan.
The attack came at a time when security forces are battling terrorists who attacked Cadet College Wana in North Waziristan. The military said a clearance operation is underway to neutralise the three terrorists who managed to infiltrate the educational institution.
Security forces added that three of the personnel are said to be in critical condition.
Following the attack, a large contingent of police and security forces reached the incident site and cordoned off the area.
A search operation was launched to sanitise the area.
Attack on Bannu police station thwarted
Separately, KP police said they thwarted a late-night attack on the Ahmadzai Police Station in the Bannu district.
In a press release, KP Police said “miscreants attempted to attack the police station with small and big weapons” in the early hours of Tuesday, but it was foiled due to the cops’ timely response.
The statement added that the policemen present inside the building thwarted the attack through their “swift and effective action”, with multiple terrorists killed and injured. The bodies were taken by the attackers, the police said.
KP Inspector General Zufiqar Hameed hailed the policemen for their response and asserted that the personnel were “ready and alert at all times to protect the public”.
IG Hameed also announced a cash reward and certificates of appreciation for the police team involved in repelling the attack.
Pictures shared by KP Police showed multiple kinds of weapons, including hand grenades, lying on the ground in the wake of the attack.
Some parts of the police station building were damaged.

He made these remarks particularly in reference to a proposal under the 27th Amendment to grant the president lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests.
Speaking after Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, who presented the bill in the lower house of Parliament, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan condemned the 27th Amendment.
He said that “with the passing of this amendment, democracy here will only exist in name”, adding that his party “will not accept” it.
It was a disservice to the “constitutional oath”, he decried. “When you take the oath, you vow to exercise responsibility and honesty for the good of the people and democracy,” Gohar added.
Speaking about the proposal to establish a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), he recalled that “this was also a part of the agenda for the 26th Amendment last year”. He claimed that the government had declared it “unconstitutional” back then.
“The head of state was issuing orders from Baku and so we are labelling this the Baku amendment,” Gohar continued,  apparently referring to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif presiding over a federal cabinet meeting — which approved the amendment — via a video link from Baku.
Barrister Gohar recalled that “when the current government first came into power, the first thing they did was amend the National Accountability Ordinance,” claiming that they got “rid of all corruption cases filed against them” by doing so.
“Now, on their way out, they want to give themselves immunity and hold themselves above the law,” he alleged.
The PTI chairperson stressed that “real democracy requires one to uphold the law and practice accountability”.
He went on to question: “In what part of the world does the president have lifetime immunity? “Can you not appear in front of a court and prove your innocence?”

Continuing his speech, Gohar said: “The day he (jailed PTI founder Imran Khan) gets free, when that man of steel is freed, whatever he says, his words will be declared as the Constitution.”
Then, coming back to the matter of immunity for the president, the PTI chairman said, “We make the law, and then while calling ourselves the protectors of the said law, we decide to grant ourselves immunity.”
“What face will you show to the people of Pakistan? People who have run out of patience, who do not have the means to eat, or pay hospital bills, people who do not have access to justice in courts,” he remarked.
Barrister Gohar said that by trying to pass this clause under the proposed amendment, the government was attempting to “create another elite class on top of the one that already exists.”
Tarar tables bill
Earlier, Law Minister Tarar tabled the bill in the NA today for the house’s consideration.
The bill needs a two-thirds majority in order to be passed by the NA, which the ruling coalition has in the 336-member house as compared to the opposition’s 103. Within the coalition, the PML-N has 125 seats, the PPP has 74, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) has 22, the  Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid has five, the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party has four, and the PML-Z, the Balochistan Awami Party, and the National Peoples Party have one seat each.
The NA session today began with a prayer for PML-N Irfan Siddiqui, who passed away yesterday.
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then asked Tarar to move the bill for the constitutional amendment to be taken into consideration, as stated in the house’s agenda for today.
The law minister moved the bill, recalling that when the legislation for the 26th Constitutional Amendment had landed in the house, “two main political parties, after much debate and discussion, made a few adjustments in the promises made to the public under the Charter of Democracy”.
“One of those key points was the establishment of a constitutional court […] Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman kept our friends from the opposition on board regarding this, and you all know that it was on their request that we agreed on establishing a constitutional bench instead of a constitutional court,” Tarar continued.
Subsequently, he said, the amendment for establishing a constitutional bench was passed. However, he added, several objections were raised over it, with the critics saying that “you have formed a court within a court, and that this system will not continue”.
Making a case for the constitutional court, Tarar said “some sensitive constitutional matters had surfaced in the past — and they will surface in the future as well — that took up most of the quality time of the court”. So, he continued, coalition partners were consulted, and it was agreed that a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) should be established.
The minister said the salient features pertaining to the FCC in the amendment bill were the same as the points agreed in the Charter of Democracy. At this point, opposition members could be heard protesting in the background.
Nevertheless, Tarar continued that an impression had been created that Article 184(3) of the Constitution — which elaborates on the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court — was being abolished. But it was not the case, he clarified, adding that the powers granted under the clause would be transferred to the FCC and “a pari materia provision has been introduced after Article 175-B [in the Constitution], pertaining to the [court’s] jurisdiction”.
He said in connection with Article 184 of the Constitution, the parliamentary committee that deliberated on the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment also discussed the matter of the court’s suo motu powers, “to which prime ministers, government employees, actors and even the country’s economic system had fallen victim”.
In view of these past instances, he said the FCC was not being granted suo motu powers under the new proposed amendment. Instead, an application would have to be submitted and fulfil the criteria outlined under Article 184(3) — that the matter in question was of public importance and required the enforcement of fundamental rights — to exercise this power, elaborated.
This power “will not be used to grill an individual”, he asserted.
On the matter of transfer of judges, he said after discussion and deliberation, it had been decided that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) be given the authority to transfer judges. The initial draft of the bill stated that a judge would be deemed retired if he refused a transfer, Tarar said, adding that the clause had now been amended to provide judges an opportunity to present their stance to the JCP regarding their transfer.
But after a decision regarding a judge’s transfer was finalised and the judge refused the transfer, the matter would be referred to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC). The SJC would then decide whether a judge’s stance was valid, or not and warranted action.
The minister pointed out that under the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, there were two courts at the apex level — the SC and FCC.
The FCC, he said, had more or less the same powers as granted to the constitutional bench established under the 26th Amendment. “These powers include those granted under Articles 184 and 186, of deciding on matters among provinces, giving advice on presidential references, making decisions regarding the transfer of cases […] and deciding on writ petitions under Article 199 except in some cases,” he elaborated.
The minister argued that this would reduce the SC caseload and the “Supreme Court will now have the time and energy to hear the cases of the common man”.
He said the incumbent Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi would continue to head the JCP and SJC under the new amendment on the basis of his seniority. Tarar added that the CJP would also continue to head any other body that he was currently heading.
Moreover, he continued, it had been proposed that from among the top judges of the SC and FCC, the senior judge would head these bodies. “If they are appointed on the same day, seniority will be determined on the basis of the day they entered in the office in the high court or the Supreme Court,” Tarar explained.
Another recommendation was that the five-judge panel of the JCP would comprise the top-most and senior puisne judges of the SC and FCC, Tarar said, adding that the two chief justices would decide who would be appointed as the fifth member of the panel. If they couldn’t nominate anyone, the matter would be referred to the commission, the law minister said.
Tarar said it was also proposed in the bill that if an elected senator took their oath after a delay, the period of their term would be reduced accordingly.
Speaking about Article 243, which deals with the command of armed forces,  Tarar said the government decided after consultation to bestow the rank of Field Marshal upon Chief of Army Staff Asim Munir in light of the successes achieved during May conflict with India.
He said it was also decided that under Article 243, “no individual will have the power to deprive a national hero of the title of Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet. These titles will be for lifetime. But if there are valid grounds on the basis of which one is of the opinion that these titles should be withdrawn, Parliament will decide on it after deliberation”.
On the matter of the president’s lifetime immunity from criminal proceedings and arrests, Tarar said a caveat had been added to the original proposal that the immunity would be waived for the period during which a former president would hold public office.
He then urged the house to carry out a “fruitful discussion” on the proposed amendment.
Speaker on opposition leader’s appointment
At one point during the session, NA Speaker Sadiq made observations regarding the appointment of the leader of the opposition in the house.
The post has been vacant since the disqualification of PTI’s Omar Ayub in August, and while the opposition party has requested the appointment of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party’s Mehmood Khan Achakzai in his place, the latter is yet to be notified as the opposition leader.
Addressing the matter today, Sadiq said the matter was currently sub judice, and therefore, the house would await the court’s decision before taking any further steps on the issue.
Referring to his meeting with PTI’s Asad Qaiser and Amir Dogar, the speaker said the matter of the opposition leader’s appointment had been referred back to the Peshawar High Court by the Supreme Court.
The matter would be taken up in the assembly once the court delivered its verdict, he added.
Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal, from the MQM, also spoke during the session. He referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which deals with the subject of local governments and to which his party had sought amendments.
The matter, however, has not been included in the 27th Amendment.
Kamal said the “matter is not dead yet” and will soon be discussed as part of a 28th constitutional amendment.
Highlighting the importance of local governments, he said: “If you want to have rights and resources, good governance policies — of the federal as well as the provincial government — at people’s doorsteps, there’s no vehicle for that [at present].”
Later, the session was adjourned until 11a, tomorrow.
Bill sails through Senate
The PML-N-led coalition government on Monday succeeded in manouvering the passage of the controversial 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill through the Senate, securing a two-thirds majority with the unexpected support of two opposition senators who voted against their party lines.
The bill, seeking crucial changes to several articles of the Constitution mostly dealing with the judiciary and the military leadership, was presented before the upper house of Parliament for a final vote by Law Minister Tarar amid a noisy protest by opposition senators.
As soon as Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani started putting up the bill for a clause-by-clause vote, the opposition senators started gathering in front of his dais and chanted anti-government slogans. They tore up copies of the bill and agenda and some of them were seen hurling the documents towards the law minister, prompting the sergeants-at-arm to make a human wall at the aisle between the treasury and the opposition benches to prevent any possible physical clash.
After staying in the house for a few minutes, the opposition senators belonging to the PTI and the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) staged a walkout from the house, providing the government with an opportunity to proceed smoothly.
After holding a vote on the bill by division, Senate Chairman Gilani announced that the 27th Amendment bill had been passed with 64 votes, which is not less than a two-thirds majority in the 96-member house.
After casting his vote against the party line, PTI’s Saifullah Abro announced his resignation from the house. Speaking on the floor, Senator Abro said he had “voted only for [Field Marshal] Gen Asim Munir”, adding that the Pakistani armed forces made the nation proud by defeating India in the May war.
He added that during the [passage of the] 26th Amen­dment, “my 10 family members were abducted, but my party [PTI] did not come to the rescue.
Interestingly, when he tendered his resignation, Senate Chairman Gilani said, “We will make you a senator again”.
Meanwhile, the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam Fazl (JUI-F) expelled Senator Ahmed Khan for voting for the bill against party direction.
Changes in the bill
During yesterday’s Senate session, PPP Senator Farooq Naek presented the final report on the bill, approved by the standing committees on the law and justice of the two houses, highlighting three to four changes that had been suggested by members.
About the changes incorporated into the bill on recommendation of the parliamentary committees, Senator Naek said the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) would have equal representation of all provinces besides a representative from the Islamabad High Court. He said the initial draft of the bill stated a judge having served for seven years in the high court could be nominated for the FCC, but this qualification merit has been curtailed to five years on the recommendation.
Moreover, he said, the committees agreed that if an appointment was made to the FCC from among sitting Supreme Court judges, the inter-se seniority of the appointee would remain the same as at the time of the appointment. On the other hand, in the case of a fresh appointment of a lawyer or a high court judge, the seniority would be reckoned from the date on which they would assume office. However, he added, if multiple judges would take the oath the same day, their seniority would be determined on the basis of their age.
Also, the parliamentary committees suggested a change in the nomination for the reconstituted Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP), he said. The 26th Amendment had authorised the speaker to nominate a woman or a non-Muslim candidate for the JCP, he explained. However, the committees proposed that the nominee should be a technocrat, he added.
The PPP senator said the suo motu powers of judges had not been taken away, but the court would exercise these powers only when an application was submitted. “The case will be taken up for hearing after the FCC decides whether the application for exercising suo motu powers is valid and needed,” he said.
The PPP senator, who was part of the committee that examined the initial draft of the bill, said that an interim stay order in matters of revenue remained valid until the case was decided under Article 199 of the Constitution. Since this created a huge backlog, the amendment suggested that interim order would be vacated automatically after one year if no decision on the case was made, he explained.
Referring to the procedure of judges’ transfer, Mr Naek said previously, even when the 26th Amendment was passed, the President could transfer judges with their consent and after consultation with the chief justices of both relevant high courts.
However, this procedure has been amended, he said. “Now a judge refusing his transfer would be given an opportunity of presenting his reasons for the decline before the JCP. And if the JCP finds the reasons invalid, he would have to retire,” the senator explained.
About the provision of lifetime immunity to the president from facing criminal trial or arrest under Article 248, he said it was suggested that this immunity would not be available if the President holds a public office after the end of his term, but as soon as he ceases that public office he would again be entitled to this immunity.
According to a proposed amendment in Article 243, this type of lifetime immunity has also been provided to the field marshal, marshal of the air force and admiral of the navy.</p><small>2025-11-11 12:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/11163331355c688.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954469/us-senate-passes-bill-to-end-government-shutdown-sends-to-house' target='_blank'><strong>US Senate passes bill to end government shutdown, sends to House</strong></a><br><p>The United States Senate on Monday approved a compromise that would end the longest government shutdown in US history, breaking a weeks-long stalemate that has disrupted food benefits for millions, left hundreds of thousands of federal workers unpaid and snarled air traffic.
The 60-40 vote passed with the support of nearly all of the chamber’s Republicans and eight Democrats, who unsuccessfully sought to tie government funding to health subsidies that are due to expire at the end of the year. While the agreement sets up a December vote on those subsidies, which benefit 24 million Americans, it does not guarantee they will continue.
The deal would restore funding for federal agencies that lawmakers allowed to expire on October 1 and would stall President Donald Trump’s campaign to downsize the federal workforce, preventing any layoffs until January 30.
It next heads to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where Speaker Mike Johnson has said he would like to pass it as soon as Wednesday and send it on to Trump to sign it into law. Trump has called the deal to reopen the government “very good”.
The deal would extend funding through January 30, leaving the federal government for now on a path to keep adding about $1.8 trillion a year to its $38tr in debt.
Coming a week after Democrats won high-profile elections in New Jersey, Virginia and elected a democratic socialist as the next mayor of New York City, the deal has provoked anger among many Democrats who note there is no guarantee that the Republican-controlled Senate or House would agree to extend the health insurance subsidies.
“We wish we could do more,” said Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat. “The government shutting down seemed to be an opportunity to lead us to better policy. It didn’t work.”
A late October Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 50 per cent of Americans blamed Republicans for the shutdown, while 43pc blamed Democrats.
US stocks rose on Monday, buoyed by news of progress on a deal to reopen the government.
Trump has unilaterally cancelled billions of dollars in spending and trimmed federal payrolls by hundreds of thousands of workers, intruding on Congress’s constitutional authority over fiscal matters. Those actions have violated past spending laws passed by Congress, and some Democrats have questioned why they would vote for any such spending deals going forward.
The deal does not appear to include any specific guardrails to prevent Trump from enacting further spending cuts.
However, the deal would fund the SNAP food-subsidy programme through September 30 of next year, heading off any possible disruptions if Congress were to shut down the government again during that time.</p><small>2025-11-11 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633117-three-martyred-in-cadet-college-wana-attack-militants-in-contact-with-afghan-handlers-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>'All students, staff rescued' as hunt for three terrorists continues in Cadet College Wana</strong></a><br><p>

The error was due to a typing mistake and has since been rectified.

KHYBER: The month-long closure of Torkham border crossing has caused a cumulative loss of over $45 million and another Rs16.5 billion in terms of exports and imports respectively through Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan.
Sources among official and trading circles told Dawn that Pakistan had already lost over 65 per cent of the Afghan market to Iran, some Central Asian States, Turkiye and even India due to hostile and aggressive trade policies dictated by security issues since the installation of the Taliban regime in Kabul in August 2021.
They said that while big time Pakistan and Afghan exporters had lifted their capital from the export-import business between the two neighbouring countries due to the repeated border closure and a hostile environment for traders and investors, the month-long closure of all border points had seriously dented the confidence of remaining “bunch” of small traders.
The sources said that while the uncertain situation had also dealt a severe blow to the burgeoning local manufacturing industry in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the border closure had seriously impacted manufacture of hundreds of daily items in Punjab and Sindh, which were exported to Afghanistan under the head of the miscellaneous items daily prior to the closure of the border.
They said that Afghanistan was currently importing cement, garments, shoes and slippers, a variety of edibles including different vegetables, fresh fruits, fish, chicken and other poultry items, animal feed and confectionery items.
The sources said that the prolonged border closure had negatively impacted the potato and banana exports, while the kinnow export was also in doldrums if immediate steps were not taken to ease border tensions.
Qari Nazeem Gul, an exporter and clearing agent, told Dawn that even before the border tensions began, at least markets in Kabul and Jalalabad were flooded with Iranian, Turkish and Central Asian products with Iran grabbing the major share of its exports to Afghanistan.
He said that Afghan traders were more interested and comfortable in doing trade with Iran instead of Pakistan as Iran was offering them more relaxations in acquisition of visas and custom duties.
“We are now hugely disheartened with the current pattern of complicated business with Afghanistan with most of the local traders now developing a hatred for the said trade due to continuous security and political issues between the two neighbouring countries,” he said.
Equally concerned was Mujeebullah Shinwari, who heads the Torkham customs clearing agents association.
“We’ve long been advocating for a trader-friendly policy by the government with special focus on alienating bilateral trade from security and political issues with Afghanistan,” he said.
 
 

Mr Shinwari said that the volume of Pakistan’s trade with Afghanistan had dropped from $2.5 billion in the years from 2012 to 2016 to a mere $800 to 900 million dollars on an annual basis.
“Gone are the times when 1000-1200 shipping containers loaded with multiple export items would cross over to Afghanistan on a daily basis, as we now have 250-300 containers left in the export field on a daily basis,” he said.
The customs clearing agents’ leader said that the suspension of bilateral trade was also harming revenue generation through tax collection under various heads that was up till now a handsome amount for the national exchequer.
He said that the current volatile and uncertain situation had deeply affected the small-time businessmen, traders and even shopkeepers in local markets as a large number of people affiliated with different trading fields had lost their legitimate earnings.
Mr Shinwari said that the local trading and transport community had never experienced such a long closure of the border with a majority of the vehicle owners who got stranded due to sudden closure of Torkham on October 12 were now contemplating to switch over to other less profitable business venture in order to cover for the month-long financial loses.
He suggested the formation of an all-powerful jirga of leading tribal elders, politicians and traders to hold meaningful dialogue with officials of both the countries to find a mutually agreed formula for reopening of all borders points for trading and thus, saving business communities of both countries from further financial losses.
Meanwhile, Israr Shinwari, head of a local youth organisation, has demanded the immediate reopening of the Torkham border through a powerful jirga mediating between the two countries.
During a meeting in Landi Kotal on Monday, he said that the Pak-Afghan border points should be kept open in all circumstances, with a special focus on promoting trade between the two countries.
Mr Shinwari, however, warned a series of protest demonstrations would be staged if their legitimate demands weren’t met.

The explosion near the historic Red Fort on Monday evening killed at least eight people and injured 20. It was the first such blast in the heavily guarded city of more than 30 million since 2011.
“Today, I have come to Bhutan with a very heavy heart,” Modi said in Thimphu, the capital of the neighbouring Himalayan nation, as he arrived on Tuesday for a scheduled visit.
“The horrific incident that happened in Delhi last evening has deeply disturbed everyone,” Modi told a public meeting.
“Our agencies will get to the very bottom of this conspiracy. The conspirators behind this will not be spared. All those responsible will be brought to justice.”
 






New Delhi’s deputy chief fire officer A.K. Malik told AFP shortly after the explosion that eight people had been killed. The Press Trust of India news agency reported on Tuesday that the death toll had risen to 12, although that figure has not been confirmed.
Home Minister Amit Shah told reporters late on Monday that security forces were “keeping all angles open”, adding that it was “very difficult to say what caused the incident” until forensic samples had been analysed.
The blast, if confirmed as an attack, would be the first significant security incident since April 22, when 26 mainly Hindu civilians were killed at the tourist site of Pahalgam in India-occupied Kashmir.
 
 

India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh also vowed today that those responsible for a deadly car explosion will face justice.
“The country’s leading investigative agencies are conducting a swift and thorough inquiry into the incident — findings of the investigation will soon be made public,” Singh told a conference in New Delhi.
“I want to firmly assure the nation that those responsible for this tragedy will be brought to justice, and will not be spared under any circumstances.”
The defence minister said agencies were carrying out a swift, thorough investigation, with the findings to be made public soon.
Crime scene investigators scoured through the wreckage of a car early on Tuesday, hours after the intense explosion. Security was increased across New Delhi as both forensic and anti-terrorism agencies searched for evidence.
Deputy Commissioner of Police Raja Banthia said Delhi police had registered a case under the anti-terrorism law, as well as the Explosives Act and other criminal laws.
The law, called the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, is India’s main anti-terrorism law. It is used to investigate and prosecute acts related to “terrorism” and activities that threaten the sovereignty and integrity of the country.
“Investigation is at a preliminary stage and any comment on it will be too premature,” Banthia told reporters.
Near the site of the blast in the city’s old quarters, a busy market and tourist area, most shops that shut soon after the explosion were yet to open in the early hours of Tuesday.
Forensic experts were seen scouring the site of the blast, which has been sealed since Monday night and enclosed in white cloth barriers.

Delhi Metro said the Red Fort station had been shut for security reasons.
Police said a slow-moving car, which stopped at a traffic signal, exploded just before 7pm (6:30pm PKT).
Nearby vehicles were also badly damaged. The explosion left behind mangled bodies and the wreckage of several cars on a congested street near a metro station in the old quarter of Delhi.
There was no immediate information on the occupants of the car, who were presumed to have been killed. Police said they were tracing the owner of the car.
Relatives of the victims gathered outside the nearby Lok Nayak hospital to identify the bodies of their loved ones.
“We at least know that my cousin is here, whether he is injured or not or the extent of his injury, we don’t know anything,” said a distressed relative who did not want to be named.
Before leaving for his state visit to Bhutan, Modi offered his “condolences to those who have lost their loved ones in the blast in Delhi”.
“I understand the pain of the families. The whole nation stands with them,” he said.
 






The Red Fort is one of India’s most well-known landmarks. Prime ministers address the nation from its ramparts on Independence Day, and its striking features appear on India’s largest banknote.
‘People were burning’
Eyewitnesses described to AFP how the car exploded in traffic and how people caught up in the surge of flames were set on fire.
“I saw the car explode while it was moving,” said Dharmindra Dhaga, 27.
“People were on fire and we tried to save them … Cars and people were burning — people inside the cars were burning,” he said.
“I was telling the public to save them, rescue them, and get them out. The public was busy making videos and taking photos.”
 


The emergency ward at Delhi’s LNJP hospital was chaotic after the explosion as wounded people streamed in and doctors rushed to treat them.
A woman broke down outside the ward where her husband was being treated.
“I can’t bear to see him like that,” she said as her brother tried to console her.
The last significant attack in the Indian capital was in September 2011, when a bomb hidden in a briefcase ripped through a crowd outside New Delhi’s High Court, killing at least 14 people.</p><small>2025-11-11 09:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633110-at-least-five-killed-over-a-dozen-injured-in-islamabad-suicide-blast' target='_blank'><strong>At least 12 martyred, 36 injured in Islamabad suicide blast</strong></a><br><p>

“Afghanistan must understand that lasting peace can only be realised by reining in Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory,” Shehbaz said while addressing the Inter-Parliamentary Speakers’ Conference in Islamabad.
In his remarks, the premier said that the theme of the conference, “Peace, Security and Development”, could not be more timely and relevant.
He added that the theme was particularly resonant for Pakistan, saying that the country had always advocated for peace through dialogue and diplomacy.
“We firmly believe that peace and security form the foundation of sustainable national and regional development,” he said.
“The true value of peace is most profoundly understood when we are confronted with the conflicts that continue to plague our world,” he said.
The premier especially called attention to the recent border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, calling Islamabad’s response “firm and decisive, teaching an unforgettable lesson”.
He also deeply appreciated the efforts of Turkiye and Qatar in facilitating peace talks between Pakistan and the Afghan Taliban regime.
“A peaceful Afghanistan holds the key to regional connectivity, peace, and prosperity,” he said.
“This peace has remained elusive for decades. However, Pakistan has never lost hope. We believe in a peaceful neighbourhood and have been striving hard for this purpose,” he asserted.
He regretted that terrorist groups continued to “imperil peace”, both within Afghanistan and outside it.
The premier also talked about the brief military conflict between Pakistan and India earlier this year in May.
“In May, Pakistan faced unprovoked aggression from the eastern front. Our armed forces displayed remarkable preparedness and performed outstandingly on the battlefield,” he said.
“Having won the war, we need to win peace, through sincere and honest efforts,” Shehbaz said.
He added that Pakistan’s commitment to upholding peace and security was manifested by its constructive role at diplomatic forums including the United Nations (UN), Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) and Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
The prime minister’s remarks come days after a third round of talks between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to monitor and prevent cross-border terrorism.
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif insisted that the negotiations were “over” and had “entered an indefinite phase”. The defence minister also said that the fragile ceasefire agreed between the two countries stood for the time being but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”.
Meanwhile, three top Turkish officials are due in Islamabad this week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Turkiye and Qatar have been acting as mediators between Islamabad and Kabul following an escalation of tensions between the two neighbours over the past weeks.</p><small>2025-11-11 07:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/11112408181b677.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1954450/in-emphatic-letter-to-cjp-justice-minallah-laments-use-of-sc-by-unelected-elite-to-suppress-peoples-will' target='_blank'><strong>In emphatic letter to CJP, Justice Minallah laments use of SC by ‘unelected elite’ to suppress people’s will</strong></a><br><p>Supreme Court (SC) Justice Athar Minallah has written an emphatic letter to Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, calling for the convening of a conference to consider threats to the judiciary while also lamenting the use of the apex court as an instrument to suppress the people’s will by “unelected elite”, it emerged on Tuesday.
The development comes as the government is making moves for the passage of the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The bill, which has been passed by the Senate, seeks crucial changes to a number of articles, mostly dealing with the judiciary and the military leadership.
In the seven-page letter, which Dawn has seen, Justice Minallah said that the missive was being recorded as a “solemn duty to the Constitution and to place on record for future generations how their destiny was being shaped behind the marble walls of the last resort of justice”.
 
 

He said that it was being written in the wake of recent events, which had greatly eroded public confidence in the judiciary.
“Institutions are not built overnight, but they can be destroyed in no time through fear, surrender or submission to the powers. The history of our judiciary is not unblemished nor flattering. However, its past failings, no matter how grave, cannot justify its continued capture to serve the interests of the unelected elites,” he said.
Justice Minallah said that as a sitting SC judge, he felt it was his duty to raise his concerns regarding the erosion of the people’s trust.
“I had taken an oath to defend, protect, and preserve the Constitution, but find myself helpless because the fundamental rights covenanted to the people have too often been reduced to mere cliché or rhetoric. We may pretend otherwise, but the stark reality is unpleasant and embarrassing for me as a judge of the highest Court and as a guardian of the Constitution,” he said.
Justice Minallah said that the truth had been concealed from the people for too long, adding that they had been misled and exploited so that the elite capture could sustain.
“From the very inception of our independence, the history of the state has been marred by the unholy alliance between certain state institutions and entrenched elites. An alliance having the hallmark of control, privilege, and impunity. The SC, by design or omission, has too often been employed as an instrument to suppress the will of the people rather than to safeguard it,” he said.
‘Political dissent has been criminalised’
In his letter, Justice Minallah also said that jurisprudence had too often bowed before power and might instead of standing on the side of the people. He highlighted the removal and execution of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, saying it “remains one of the gravest and most unpardonable betrayal of our oath and of the people’s trust”.
He further said that the persecution of Benazir Bhutto by “unelected elements” within state institutions, and the disqualification of Nawaz Sharif and the harassment of him and his daughter were a “continuation of a pattern of suppression of the people’s will when the interests of the unelected elite were threatened”.
The SC judge noted that President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had also fallen victim to this phenomenon.
“The phenomenon represents a consistent pattern of elite manipulation, wherein leaders are fostered and then ruined. Once they are backed by the people’s mandate, they are systemically dismantled if and when they challenge the entrenched power. The will of the people has repeatedly been subverted to perpetuate the elite capture of the state; a betrayal and subversion that strikes at the very heart of constitutional democracy,” he said.
He said that PTI founder Imran Khan was also being victimised under the same cycle of suppression.
“Political dissent has been criminalised, those who refuse to bend, including women, are made to endure inhuman conditions. It is no longer a secret that justice is denied to them,” he said.
“The truth is known to us, but it is whispered only in the tea room and chambers of this Court. The independence of this institution has too often been compromised from within, whether through surrender or through active participation,” he said.
“We proclaim ourselves to be guardians of the fundamental rights, but we maintained silence when a former chief justice of Pakistan told us that the phenomenon of enforced disappearance had reached his doorstep. We also chose to look the other way when another chief justice, who in the context of the reserved seats case, had warned twelve judges of this very court that he was the one responsible for stalling the imposition of martial law and that ‘they would come and send us home’.”
He further said that under the watch of the apex court, electoral outcomes were manipulated, the will of the people suppressed, dissenting voices silenced, undesirable political allegiance and opinions criminalised, and journalists abducted or intimidated.
‘Need for introspection undeniable’
Justice Minallah further said that at this critical juncture, the need for introspection was “undeniable”.
“I would respectfully urge that a judicial conference be convened for having an open institutional dialogue with all judges of the SC and the high courts to consider threats to independence of the judiciary that may be jeopardising its constitutional function of acting as a machinery for enforcement of fundamental rights of citizens,” he said.
“A candid and open discussion on the state of our institution, the challenges to its independence, and the steps necessary to reclaim the people’s trust has become inevitable. The judiciary is at a perilous crossroads. The truth must be spoken at this moment of reckoning,” he said.
He further said that Parliament may wish to consider the judiciary’s institutional perspective articulated through the proposed judicial conference, before it embarks upon “tinkering with the basic law of the land”.
He noted that news reports suggested that preparations were underway to house the new Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) within the building of the Federal Shariat Court (FSC).
 
 

“What is the invisible process through which some within the judiciary have been made aware of the changes that are to proposed through a Constitutional amendment? And what explains their eagerness to make advance administrative arrangements to accommodate the proposed structure of the judiciary even prior to the Parliament considering it?” he asked.
He said that the judiciary’s foremost loyalty lay not in self-preservation nor in deference to power but in allegiance to the people and to the Constitution.
“This court and the judiciary as an institution are at a perilous crossroad and silence in the face of the systemic erosion of judicial independence would only
amount to complicity. Our oath compels us to speak and uphold the truth and to guard the Constitution even when it is inconvenient to do so,” he said.
Full court demanded amid executive onslaught
Justice Minallah’s letter comes a day after Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, in addition to several lawyers and former judges, requested CJP Afridi to play his role and act as the guardian of the judiciary’s independence.
Senior puisne judge Shah, in a six-page letter, described the proposed amendment as a political device to weaken the judiciary and urged CJP Afridi to confront the executive to lay down a rule that no amendments affecting the judiciary be adopted without prior consultations with superior judges.
“You [CJP] act not merely as its administrator but as its guardian,” Justice Shah said while also requesting a full court meeting or preferably a joint convention of all constitutional court judges, including the FSC and high courts, to articulate the judiciary’s collective stance.
Justice Shah emphasised that this moment demanded leadership, transparency and institutional resolve. If such consultation is not initiated under CJ’s stewardship, it will inevitably be seen as acquiescence and an abdication of the trust reposed in the high office, he added.
In his letter, Justice Shah also questioned the justification for creating the proposed FCC, asking what constitutional vacuum it would seek to fill.
The proposed FCC does not arise from any genuine reform agenda, and its judges will be appointed without any constitutional parameters, as was the case with the Constitutional Bench (CB), the letter said, adding that such an arrangement vested decisive power in the executive and invited manipulation of the judicial process. A court may serve transient political interests, but it will permanently damage the republic, he added.
Separately, former judges and top lawyers also wrote a letter to CJP Afridi, urging him to summon a full court meeting to discuss the 27th Constitutional Amendment. The request came in a letter that was penned by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi and endorsed by former SC senior puisne judge retired Justice Mushir Alam, former Sindh High Court (SHC) judge retired Justice Nadeem Akhtar and nine other top lawyers.</p><small>2025-11-11 07:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633083-govt-mulls-introducing-28th-amendment-after-passage-of-27th-constitutional-tweak-sanaullah' target='_blank'><strong>Govt mulls introducing 28th Amendment after 27th constitutional tweaks: Sanaullah</strong></a><br><p>

The series win against South Africa marked a successful beginning to Shaheen Shah Afridi’s fresh stint as the new Pakistan captain, having replaced Mohammad Rizwan last month in an abrupt manner.
The Sri Lanka challenge will be different for the pacer, given that he won his maiden ODI series as skipper with first-choice players at his disposal against a South African team missing the likes of senior pros Temba Bavuma, Aiden Markam, Kagiso Rabada and Keshav Maharaj.
The Islanders, led by Charith Asalanka, in contrast, arrive in Rawalpindi with a full-strength team and a top form in the format — having won the last six of their seven ODI series, including those against the strong India and Australia to rise to fourth in the International Cricket Council ODI rankings.
Shaheen, however, did not touch upon his views on the upcoming contests, which would see the sides come against each other for the second and third games on Thursday and Saturday, respectively.
But he did reveal what went on in the background before he was handed the ODI captaincy at the expense of Rizwan — who was ripped off the position despite winning series in Australia and South Africa last year before a disastrous campaign in the ICC Champions Trophy earlier this year had raised questions over his performance.
“Rizwan was the only person [from the team] I had a discussion with when I was about to be appointed as captain,” said the Pakistan pace spearhead in the pre-series press conference here on Monday. “I asked him how he felt and what he wanted.
“Rizwan is a good human and he decided himself to stake a step back and let me replace him, and that was how the decision was taken.”
Shaheen had been in Rizwan’s position himself when he had replaced Babar Azam as Pakistan’s T20I skipper back in 2024 before being placed by the latter after just one series in charge.
The pacer, who lead Pakistan to the national side’s first-ever ODI series victory over South Africa at home last week, said the past did not spill into his decisions in the present and that he took advice from all his team-mates as captain.
“I talk to everyone for advice and I am not too egoistic to not talk to the ex captains because of things that happened in the past,” he said.
Moreover, Shaheen was not reluctant to back both Babar and Rizwan amid their recent struggles in white-ball cricket, observing that responsibility was for every player to take and not only for the established pros.
“Everyone has to take responsibility if you want to improve as a team,” the 25-year-old, who managed three wickets at an average of 38 in his first series as captain. “It’s not just for Rizwan, Babar, Fakhar [Zaman], Shaheen, Saim [Ayub] to ensure this. The first and the last, all players should take responsibility.
“As far as Rizwan is concerned, he is Pakistan’s top-scorer in one-dayers since 2023. We are trying to back players who are not in form so that they can do well in future matches. If you get hopeless about such players it will bring in worse results. We have to go into matches as a unit and win them as a unit.”
Babar, too, despite getting starts, failed to come up to the fans’ expectations, scoring only 45 runs across the three matches against the Proteas. Shaheen believed the right-hander would bounce back with a big performance in the near future.
“Babar can falter in one or two matches but he is in good touch and I hope he will score a hundred soon,” he said.
While no guarantees have been assured to Shaheen at least publicly by the PCB about the longevity of his stint as the skipper, the left-armer is looking forward to the 2027 ODI World Cup — which will be played in South Africa, Zimbabwe and Namibia.
“My job as captain is to ensure how to improve our one-day cricket and how to take my fellow players forward,” he said.
For Sri Lanka, the Pakistan series would be about sticking to the basics if they are to carry their decent form into the contests.
“I think it’s always competitive cricket when Sri Lanka and Pakistan face each other, and I expect some exciting cricket from tomorrow,” Asalanka told reporters. “We just want to focus on our basics and see what happens.
“Pakistan played good cricket in their last series. We played about 30–45 days ago, in Zimbabwe, and especially our ODI side has been doing really well. For us, it’s about sticking to the basics, keeping things simple, and backing our strengths.”

• Says owners who sold their vehicles but getting e-tickets have to visit traffic facilitation centre to submit evidence
• Concedes vehicles without number plates or bearing AFR markings cannot be issued automatic e-tickets
KARACHI: Following public backlash over the recently introduced e-ticketing system — particularly in light of heavy traffic fines and inadequate road infrastructure — the Sindh government is considering reducing the fine amount of challans for various violations.
On Oct 27, the Sindh chief minister inaugurated the AI-powered Traffic Regulation and Citation System (Tracs) and within one week the traffic police sent around 30,000 challans worth millions of rupees to registered owners of vehicles for violations, including not wearing seatbelt, tinted glasses, riding motorbike without helmet, etc.
Citizens and political parties have been criticising the Pakistan Peoples Party-led Sindh government and police for imposing heavy fines just to “mint money”.
At least three petitions have been filed before the Sindh High Court and notices have been issued to the Sindh government and police on two of them.
However, it is heartening to see vehicles stopping at traffic lights in designated areas, and motorcyclists wearing helmets ever since the new system became functional.
 
 

Sources told Dawn that Karachi-based politicians belonging to the ruling party as well as some senior police officials had expressed their concerns to the provincial government high-ups that a very good initiative had been politicised by certain quarters for their own political gains only because of the fact that “fines on some of the violations are on a very higher side”.
They suggested that the provincial government could counter this criticism by rationalising or lowering traffic fines for a period of its own choice.
The sources added that there was a growing realisation within the government and police circles that fines alone could not bring about a change in the traffic culture of the metropolis.
They emphasised the need to involve civic bodies as well as the Excise and Taxation Department in a coordinated effort to make the system more effective.
“Yes, absolutely,” replied Inspector General of Sindh Police Ghulam Nabi Memon when asked whether the success of the new system hinged on close cooperation between traffic police, district and local administration and agencies responsible for improved infrastructure in the city and without this the e-ticketing system and the police would continue to earn people’s ire.
“The long-term success of Tracs depends on strong inter-agency coordination between traffic police, local administrations, excise department, TMCs, KMC, and other civic bodies,” he added.
Responding to another question whether the fines were proportionate to Karachiites’ average monthly income, he stated: “The fine structure has been designed keeping in view deterrence and road safety, rather than revenue generation. It is important to note that traffic fines are not an unavoidable burden — they are avoidable by choice. Citizens who drive responsibly, follow signals, and respect laws will never incur penalties. The purpose is to promote a culture of compliance, discipline, and safety on Karachi’s roads.”
A senior provincial government official and the ruling PPP leader told Dawn on condition of anonymity that while the CM had already announced that “first-time” violators of traffic rules could have their fines waived within 10 days by submitting an apology in person, there was a strong possibility that the government would announce a significant reduction in the fine amount on certain violations by the end of this month.
He, however, made it clear that the system would not be rolled back or even suspended. Instead, he said, this system would soon cover entire Karachi and other districts of the province.
Hardship to registered owners who sold their vehicles
At present, registered vehicle owners face a distressing situation if they receive a challan for a vehicle they once owned but that has been sold to someone who has failed to have it transferred in their name.
In such cases, the previous owner is compelled to run from pillar to post, submitting documents and giving explanations to the excise and police authorities to prove that they no longer own the vehicle.
Likewise, the registered owner of a vehicle also suffers in the form of “demerit points” when a challan is issued for a violation, regardless of whether he or she was actually driving at the time.
The owner must bring the person who committed the violation before the relevant traffic office, after which the challan is reissued in the offender’s name.
The IGP explained that as per the Motor Vehicle Ordinance, the registered owner of a vehicle is legally responsible for its use until the ownership is officially transferred.
He said: “If a vehicle has been sold but not transferred, it remains in the name of the previous owner in the Excise record. Therefore, Tracs issues tickets against the registered owner, as recorded in the official database.
“In all the cases where a ticket is issued to a previous owner who has already sold the vehicle, the matter will be resolved at any Sahulat Centre [11 Traffic Facilitation Centres established across the city to assist citizens and address any complaints or issues related to e-ticketing]. The previous owner only needs to provide a proof of sale along with a letter from the Excise and Taxation Department confirming the transfer or sale. Upon verification, the e-ticket will be cancelled immediately,” he added.
Regarding the vehicle, the police chief said it would be blacklisted in the Tracs database. “Whenever it is detected through the Safe City camera network, it will be detained by the Excise Department and will not be released until the current possessor formally transfers ownership in their name.”
In cases where demerit points are assigned to a vehicle owner who was not driving at the time of violation, the IGP stated that the owner “simply needs to visit any Sahulat Centre along with the actual driver and provide the necessary explanation. After due inquiry and verification, the demerit points will be removed from the owner’s driving licence and transferred to the driver responsible for the violation”.
Impunity for vehicles
While law-abiding citizens become easy targets under the faceless e-ticketing system as they are being charged for merely switching lanes on roads like Sharae Faisal and I.I. Chundrigar Road, those driving vehicles with ‘AFR’ (Applied for Registration) plates or without number plates altogether are continue to do so with greater impunity as the system is not equipped to identify such vehicles to take action.
When asked about vehicles without number plates or AFR number plates, IGP Memon told Dawn that the Tracs identifies vehicles solely through their number plates. “Therefore, vehicles without number plates or bearing AFR markings cannot be issued automatic e-tickets, as the system relies on plate recognition for identification.”
He, however, claimed enforcement action is taken on the ground against such vehicles. “All vehicles found without proper registration plates are impounded on the spot and handed over to the Excise and Taxation Department. Excise teams accompany police during these operations, and legal action is initiated against violators in accordance with the law,” he stated.

Ambassador Asim Iftikhar, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the United Nations, made the remarks while addressing the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) open debate on small arms late on Monday, according to a press release by the mission.
In his remarks, Ambassador Iftikhar said, “Pakistan is seriously concerned about the presence of stockpiles of sophisticated arms and ammunition in Afghanistan, as noted in the findings of the secretary general’s reports.”
The report states that transnational criminal dynamics were observed in Afghanistan, where possible arms and ammunition transfer to neighbouring states in breach of the arms embargo and unofficial markets for weapons have emerged, further escalating the threat to regional security.
 


The envoy said Pakistan had “credible information of attempts to smuggle these arms to neighboring countries for terrorist activities”.
“Weapons confiscated at the Pakistan-Afghanistan border are traced back to stockpiles of weapons left behind by foreign forces in Afghanistan and illegal weapons being sold across black markets in Afghanistan,” Ambassador Iftikhar said.
“The movement of unmarked or unregistered weapons across the international border sustain and aid non-state armed groups, terrorist networks, and criminal gangs, undermining regional security and stability,” he said.
 






He further said that Pakistan was “deeply concerned” at the acquisition and use of these “mostly abandoned, modern and potent weapons by terrorist groups based in Afghanistan, which continue to pose serious challenge to peace and security in Pakistan and the broader region”.
He said that terrorist entities, such as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant-Khorasan (ISIL-K), the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and the Majeed Brigade, had used these weapons against Pakistani civilians and law enforcement agencies, leading to the loss of thousands of lives.
“We urge stronger international efforts to prevent access of illicit arms to armed terrorist groups in Afghanistan and to ensure that the Afghan interim authorities adhere to their international obligations and commitments in that regard,” he said.
“The international community needs to step up its efforts and plug gaps in its response to effectively address these threats to international and regional peace and security,” he added.
In his remarks, the envoy also noted that small arms and light weapons had emerged as “instruments of choice for non-state actors to perpetrate violence”, adding that illicit arms directly threatened national security and impeded counter-terrorism operations, and civilian protection.
He further said that illicit weapons impeded development prospects, contributed to human rights abuses and imperiled peace, security and stability.
“We firmly believe that the issue of illicit small arms and light weapons should be addressed comprehensively and in a balanced manner,” Ambassador Iftikhar said.
“The United Nations’ ‘Programme of Action on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects’ strikes a balance between the legitimate security requirements of states and the imperative to address the issue of illicit arms on both the supply and demand sides. We remain committed to its implementation at the national level and call for its full execution at the global level to safeguard and promote international and regional peace and security,” he said.
As the US troops departed Afghanistan in August 2021, they destroyed more than 70 aircraft, dozens of armoured vehicles and disabled air defences before flying out of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport following a chaotic evacuation operation. However, a large stock of weapons and equipment was still left behind that was coopted by the Afghan Taliban.
The arms also fell into the hands of the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan group and other terrorist outfits, as pointed out by Pakistan and others. Islamabad has repeatedly raised concerns over the use of Afghan soil by militants for cross-border terror­­ism and called on the United Nations for a “concerted campaign” to recover all weapons from terrorist groups such as the TTP.
In January, the Foreign Office said the presence of advanced US weapons in Afghanistan following the August 2021 withdrawal had become a “profound concern” for Pakistan’s safety and security.
The Washington Post also reported in April that terrorists who attacked the Jaffar Express train in Balochistan in March used weapons left behind when United States forces withdrew from Afghanistan.
According to The Post, an M4A1 carbine rifle built by American manufacturer Colt was recovered from the site of the attack. The rifle’s serial number indicated that it was part of billions of dollars worth of weaponry sent to US forces in Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-11-11 04:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633065-govt-to-table-27th-amendment-bill-in-na-today-after-constitutional-tweaks-sail-through-senate' target='_blank'><strong>NA session adjourned after day-long debate over 27th Constitutional Amendment Bill</strong></a><br><p>

• Fears another legislation may follow to further consolidate ‘absolute power’
ISLAMABAD: The PTI has been left with hardly any options to take action against Senator Saifullah Abro, who defied party policy by voting in favour of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment on Monday but later announced his resignation, while the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) expelled its senator, Ahmed Khan, for the same action.
PTI Senator Ali Zafar, while speaking to Dawn, said: “I have issued instructions under Article 63A. He [Senator Abro] violated them and is disqualified accordingly.”
Replying to a question, he said the party has distanced itself from Senator Abro, who has been removed from all communication channels, including the parliamentary party’s WhatsApp group.
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram, speaking to Dawn, said a show-cause notice would be issued to Senator Abro as a first step.
“In the past, some MNAs openly voted in favour of the 26th Constitutional Amendment and were terminated from the party. All possible actions will be taken against him for selling mandate. The Election Com­mission of Pakistan [ECP] will also be approached to immediately terminate his senatorship,” he said.
Mr Akram noted that the PTI Central Media Department held five press conferences across the country on Monday, denouncing the “self-serving constitutional amendments” and pledging to raise its voice against this contentious change on a daily basis.
Former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, speaking to Dawn, said Senator Abro betrayed the party and violated the oath he took when becoming a senator.
“People never respect those who violate their oaths and turn against their party. His [Senator Abro’s] family and children will not gain respect and will face criticism on every platform,” he said.
Apart from Senator Abro, JUI-F Senator Ahmed Khan also voted in favour of the 27th Amendment, defying his party’s instructions.
The JUI-F announced his expulsion in a statement, saying the decision was made on the recommendation of the party’s parliamentary leader, Senator Maulana Ata-ur-Rehman, and Provincial Ameer Balochistan, Senator Maulana Abdul Wasay.
 






The statement added that the central party has immediately expelled Senator Khan and asked him to resign from his Senate seat.
If he fails to do so, the JUI-F will approach the ECP for his disqualification.
‘Nefarious design’
Earlier, speaking at a press conference in Islamabad alongside PTI parliamentarians Mashal Yousafzai, Maulana Nasim Ali Shah, and Muhammad Mobeen Arif Jutt, the party’s senior leader Latif Khosa said the “person-specific, self-serving, and agenda-driven” 27th Constitutional Amendment was a continuation of the 26th Amendment, aimed at fulfilling the same nefarious design.
He warned that the legislation could be followed by a 28th Amendment to further consolidate “absolute power”, likening it to attempts by dictators like Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan, Ziaul Haq, and Pervez Musharraf to extend their rule indefinitely.
Mr Khosa noted that such figures were not remembered as national benefactors, adding that the true benefactors upheld constitutional supremacy, served the public, and returned looted mandates.
He described the grant of lifetime immunity as unprecedented, contrasting it with temporary immunity under Article 248, which did not shield General Musharraf from high treason charges.
He added that this new protection extended to a president facing major corruption cases and to army commanders, without legal precedent.
Mr Khosa warned that it effectively gave rulers a licence to act with impunity and might violate Article 126 of the Constitution, which required laws to conform to Islamic principles.
He also said the Supreme Court’s authority was being undermined by the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court under the 27th Amendment, staffed with judges favourable to the executive, threatening judicial independence.
Addressing a press conference at the party office in Karachi, PTI Sindh chief Haleem Adil Sheikh called the 27th Constitutional Amendment “a burial of the 1973 Constitution,” saying it had “destroyed” the foundations of Pakistan’s democratic and judicial system.
He added that the rule of law, judicial independence, and media freedom no longer existed in the country.

• Senior puisne judge asks CJ Afridi to play role as guardian of judiciary, confront executive on 27th Amendment
ISLAMABAD: As parliament moves to reshape the judiciary through the controversial 27th Amendment, two Supreme Court judges, in addition to several lawyers and former judges, have requested Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi to play his role and act as the guardian of the judiciary’s independence.
Senior puisne judge Mansoor Ali Shah, in a six-page letter, described the proposed amendment as a political device to weaken the judiciary and urged CJP Afridi to confront the executive to lay down a rule that no amendments affecting the judiciary be adopted without prior consultations with superior judges.
“You [CJP] act not merely as its administrator but as its guardian,” Justice Shah said while also requesting a full court meeting or preferably a joint convention of all constitutional court judges, including the Federal Shariat Court (FSC) and high courts, to articulate the judiciary’s collective stance.
 
 

Besides Justice Shah, Justice Athar Minallah also wrote a seven-page letter along similar lines, but its content could not be known. Senior lawyer Faisal Siddiqui, in a two-page letter endorsed by ex-judges, also asked the CJP to take a stand.
Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah emphasised that this moment demanded leadership, transparency and institutional resolve. If such consultation is not initiated under CJ’s stewardship, it will inevitably be seen as acquiescence and an abdication of the trust reposed in the high office, he added.
In his letter, Justice Shah also questioned the justification for creating the proposed Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), asking what constitutional vacuum it would seek to fill. The proposed FCC does not arise from any genuine reform agenda, and its judges will be appointed without any constitutional parameters, as was the case with the Constitutional Bench (CB), the letter said, adding that such an arrangement vested decisive power in the executive and invited manipulation of the judicial process. A court may serve transient political interests, but it will permanently damage the republic, he added.
The independence of the judiciary is not a privilege of judges; it is the people’s protection against arbitrary power. “This moment demands that you [CJP], as head of the institution, raise the alarm before the independence of the judiciary is irretrievably lost,” the letter urged.
The letter emphasised that there was no structural void or historical necessity to justify the creation of FCC over and above the SC. Importing the continental model into Pakistan’s integrated common-law framework is not reform – it is constitutional incoherence, the letter stressed.
The proposal for FCC in the Charter of Democracy 2006, the letter said, was envisioned only for a limited duration of six years in a very specific historical context — the military rule of Gen Pervez Musharraf — when civilian political forces sought to restore balance among the state institutions. Nearly two decades later, without implementation, the charter’s temporal vision has lapsed.
To now cite that temporary idea as justification for permanent changes in the judiciary is historically and constitutionally misplaced. This question too demands open consultation with the judiciary and a transparent explanation to the public, the letter said.
To say that a separate FCC was essential for constitutional adjudication was unfounded, the letter said, adding that strong and independent judiciaries around the world effectively discharge both constitutional and appellate jurisdictions without such a parallel court.
The real solution lies not in creating another apex forum but in ensuring that the existing court is equipped with independence, competent and adequately supported judges, the letter emphasised.
Pending cases
On pendency, the letter cited the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) 2023 judicial statistics, saying that Pakistan had 2.26 million pending cases, of which nearly 82 per cent were before the district judiciary, while the Supreme Court accounted for less than three per cent of the total. The overwhelming burden of delay lies at the base, not at the apex of the judicial pyramid.
Despite the creation of constitutional benches under the 26th Amendment, national pendency has remained virtually unchanged, confirming that structural tinkering at the top does not address systemic backlog.
If reduction of pendency is indeed the government’s objective, reform must focus on the district judiciary – fulfilling vacancies, strengthening case management, institutionalising alternative dispute resolution and ensuring data-driven accountability.
‘Greatest threat’
Meanwhile, Faisal Siddiqui said the missive was being written not in normal times but in times that presented the greatest threat to the Supreme Court since its establishment in 1956.
In case, this request was declined on the “pretext of neutrality or noninterference with legislation, then we would at least expect the CJ to accept and admit in a written response to us that he was now reconciled to be the last chief justice of Pakistan and now reconciled to accept the demise of the Supreme Court of Pakistan as the highest court in Pakistan”.“At least by this admission by you, we would no longer have any kind of expectation from your Lordship to be a defender of the Supreme Court,” the letter said.
The letter was endorsed and signed by former retired judges and senior lawyers, namely Mushir Alam, Nadeem Akhtar, Muneer A. Malik, Muhammad Akram Sheikh etc, and requested a prompt full court meeting.

• COAS cautioned against hasty escalation
ISLAMABAD: The Natio­nal Secur­ity Committee (NSC) did not overrule the then army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa’s response plan during the 2019 Balakot crisis, according to at least two participants of that meeting who spoke on Monday.
“The then army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa’s response strategy was agreed upon and executed by the Pakistan Air Force,” said a federal minister who attended the meeting, adding that the then chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, Gen Zubair Hayat, had proposed a more radical option that was not accepted.
An armed forces official who also participated in the meeting gave a similar account, saying that then prime minister Imran Khan was “displeased” with Gen Hayat’s suggestion, which he thought “did not make any sense.”
The statements counter a recent claim by former defence secretary Lt Gen (Retd) Asif Yasin Malik, who said that during the 2019 NSC meeting held after the Balakot strikes, Gen Bajwa had advised restraint but was overruled by the air chief and the CJCSC.
The 2019 escalation followed a Feb 14 suicide bombing in Pulw­ama, India-occupied Kashmir, which killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel.
India responded with airstrikes on Balakot on Feb 26, the first time since the 1971 war that Indian aircraft had crossed deep into Pakistani territory.
According to the two participants, who spoke separately to Dawn, the sequence of events began in the early hours of Feb 26, 2019, when then chief of general staff (CGS) Gen Nadeem Raza called Gen Bajwa at about 2:30am to report an Indian airstrike near Balakot.
Gen Bajwa asked for an assessment of the damage, and the CGS later informed him that no significant damage had occurred.
A seminary built during the Afghan war, used for religious education of local children, had been the intended target.
However, the missile missed its mark and landed some distance away, causing no casualties or structural damage.
Soon afterwards, the then air chief marshal Mujahid Anwar contacted Gen Bajwa to discuss the situation.
Gen Bajwa suggested that since no damage had been caused, the matter could be addressed during a meeting with the prime minister later that morning.
Before attending the NSC meeting, Gen Bajwa convened his core team at General Headquarters (GHQ), where the director general of military operations (DGMO) suggested that Pakistan must respond, but in a measured way, to avoid escalation.
The DGMO proposed that, unlike India’s night raid on a single site, Pakistan should strike multiple targets in broad daylight to send a clear message and restore deterrence.
The response operation, later known as Operation Swift Retort, was conceived during these consultations.
Gen Bajwa then took the plan to the National Security Committee meeting at the Prime Minister’s House. During the session, Gen Zubair Hayat spoke for about 40 minutes, emphasising that he was the prime minister’s principal adviser in times of war.
When Gen Bajwa asked for his concrete suggestion, Gen Hayat proposed full mobilisation of troops and a declaration of war against India.
According to participants, Gen Bajwa cautioned against hasty escalation. He then presented the operational plan prepared at GHQ, which was approved by the NSC. The detailed strategy was subsequently discussed with the PAF chief, who executed the air operation, they recalled.
On Feb 27, Pakistani aircraft struck six targets in India-occupied Kashmir, hitting “open spaces” to demonstrate their capability to hit Indian targets without escalating the tensions further.

Chairing a meeting to review progress on digitalisation of payments, the premier said that the adoption of digital systems would help ensure sustainable economic growth, improve governance, and curb corruption.
An official statement said the prime minister was briefed on the operationalisation of 10 million digital wallets under BISP set to be completed by the end of this month.
Highlighting global trends, Mr Sharif said Pakistan must align itself with the world’s rapid shift towards digital economies. “Digital payments will enhance transparency and efficiency while reducing corruption,” he noted, adding that the government’s early focus on digital transformation was now producing tangible results.

10m digital wallets to be activated  this month

The meeting was informed that payment of electricity and gas bills is now being facilitated through Raast QR codes, enabling billions of rupees in digital transactions. The mobile application for government services in Islamabad has also been integrated with Raast, while the issuance of new business licences has been linked to digital payment systems.
QR codes have been introduced at retail outlets to promote electronic transactions.
The participants also reviewed progress on the licensing of digital banks, a key component of the broader financial inclusion strategy.
The prime minister praised the Finance Ministry, the Ministry of IT, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), State Bank of Pakistan, and other stakeholders for their “commendable” work, but directed that all economic targets for the cashless transition be achieved within the defined timelines.
 
 

He noted that 68 per cent of Pakistan’s population has now achieved financial inclusion, instructing officials to further expand this coverage.The meeting was attended by federal ministers Ahad Khan Cheema, Muhammad Aurangzeb, Attaullah Tarar, Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Bilal Azhar Kayani, along with State Bank Governor Jameel Ahmad, NADRA Chairman Lt Gen Muhammad Munir Afzal, and FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial.

Official sources said the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has expedited renovation work on the third floor of the IHC building to accommodate the FSC. The IHC administration has been informed by a CDA contractor that three courtrooms will be ready within the next few days, while the construction of a fourth courtroom may take slightly longer.
At present, only three judges are serving in the FSC against the sanctioned strength of eight. Sources said the judges are “not comfortable” with the ongoing shifting process and have conveyed their concerns at the highest level.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, accompanied by the Islamabad deputy commissioner, had visited the FSC building last week and it was recommended the location was most suitable for the newly proposed court.

Renovation, vacation of IHC building section underway amid concerns over space, staff size

‘Insufficient space’
All three FSC judges, including Chief Justice Rehman, called on Chief Justice of Pakistan Yahya Afridi to communicate their concerns over the relocation plan.
One of their key reservations, sources said, relates to the shifting of more than 350 FSC staff members to the IHC building where a section on third floor has been allocated for the FSC. The judges believe the space is insufficient to house all employees and maintain the court’s operations effectively.
Due to these objections, the FSC building has not been “formally handed over to the CDA for renovation” despite the approval of the 27th Amendment by the upper house of parliament that paved the way for constitutional court’s creation.
FSC overstaffed?
On the other hand, law ministry officials claim the FSC is overstaffed, with 350 officials working on only 56 petitions. The FSC administration strongly disputes this claim. In addition to the 56 petitions, it asserts, nearly 500 criminal appeals are pending before the court’s principal seat and its four regional registries.
The law ministry officials argue the IHC with a similar strength of about 370 employees is handling over 17,000 pending cases. They suggest many FSC officials could be “reassigned to the upcoming constitutional court once it is operational”, given their relevant experience and familiarity with constitutional and Islamic jurisprudence.
IHC staff being relocated
Meanwhile, the process to vacate the third floor of the IHC building, which is being renovated, is also underway.
Assistant Registrar Muhammad Asad has been formally appointed to supervise the relocation process. He will assume charge of the record room’s administrative affairs in the old IHC building, according to an office order issued by the IHC additional registrar.
 
 

He will also oversee the reorganisation and transfer of court records to ensure smooth continuity of judicial operations during the shift.
Sources within the judiciary said the current reshuffling, including FSC’s relocation, was being undertaken as part of the broader restructuring efforts within superior judiciary. However, the judges’ unease underscores the logistical and administrative challenges of implementing the large-scale reforms within existing judicial infrastructure.
