The firings of at least two missiles, the country’s first in two months, further heighten global tensions after US President Donald Trump launched the attack that captured President Nicolas Maduro.
South Korea said peace on the Korean peninsula would be on the agenda during President Lee Jae Myung’s visit to Beijing, which will include a summit with his counterpart, Xi Jinping.
The launches from the capital Pyongyang into the sea between the Koreas and Japan represent “a message to China to deter closer ties with South Korea and to counter China’s stance on denuclearisation”, said Lim Eul-chul, a professor at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul.
North Korea signals ‘we are different from Venezuela’
Eul-chul said North Korea also wanted to send a message that “we are different from Venezuela” — as a nuclear and military power, ready to respond with “aggressive deterrence”.
Referring to North Korea‘s leader Kim Jong Un, Bong Youngshik, a visiting professor at Yonsei University, said: “After seeing what’s happening in Venezuela right now, the person who would be most afraid is Kim Jong Un.”
Seoul and Tokyo criticised the missile launches.
South Korea’s presidential office said it had held an emergency security meeting and urged North Korea to cease “provocative acts that violate United Nations Security Council resolutions”.
Japanese Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said the launches threaten the peace and security of the neighbouring country, the region and the international community.
“Our government lodged a strong protest with North Korea and strongly condemned it,” Koizumi said in a statement.
US forces for the Indo-Pacific said in a statement, “This event does not pose an immediate threat to US personnel or territory, or to our allies,” adding the US was consulting closely with its allies and partners.







Kim Jong Un flexing military muscles before party congress
The missiles, launched around 7:50am (2250 GMT on Saturday), flew about 900 kilometres, South Korea’s military said. Japan said there were at least two missiles that flew about 900 km and 950 km.
The last time Pyongyang tested a ballistic missile was on November 7.
On Saturday, Kim Jong Un called for more than doubling the production capacity of tactical guided weapons during a visit to a munitions factory, North Korea’s state media reported.
In recent weeks, Kim has made a series of visits to weapons factories, as well as to a nuclear-powered submarine, and has overseen missile tests ahead of this year’s Ninth Party Congress of the Workers’ Party, which will set out major policy goals.
South Korea expects Beijing to play a role in promoting peace on the Korean peninsula, said Wi Sung-lac, Lee’s security adviser, without elaborating on details of the summit agenda.
Lee’s agenda with Xi includes persuading China to facilitate dialogue with North Korea, experts say, at a time when North Korea has dismissed an outreach from Lee, who took office seven months ago</p><small>2026-01-04 04:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/040928081c7b4f7.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964979/kashmiri-cricketer-under-fire-as-his-helmet-displays-palestinian-flag' target='_blank'><strong>Kashmiri cricketer under fire as his helmet displays Palestinian flag</strong></a><br><p>NEW DELHI: Police in India-occupied Kashmir summoned a local cricketer for questioning on Friday after a video showing him wearing a helmet bearing a Palestinian flag sparked online outrage.
According to the Indian Express newspaper, police initiated a 14-day preliminary inquiry after the video circulated on social media, purportedly showing Furqanul Haq, a resident of Pulwama, wearing the helmet during a local league match in Jammu.
Police said the inquiry was ordered in view of the “sensitivity of the matter and its potential public order implications” and would examine the facts, the cricketer’s intent, and any possible linkages.
Under the law, police can conduct preliminary inquiries with prior permission from a deputy superintendent of police for cognisable offences punishable by three to seven years of imprisonment.
The controversy occurred during a match of the Jammu and Kashmir Champions League at Muthi, 10 kilometres from Jammu, after Furqan walked in to bat for his team, JK Eleven Kings, against Jammu Trail Blazers.
A Times of India (TOI) report stated some players from the opposing side objected to the helmet sticker, following which Furqanul Haq was sent back and took no further part in the match.
Both Furqan and the organisers of the tournament were later called to a police station for questioning.
The Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association distanced itself from the episode. “The JKCA has nothing to do with this. It involves local players. Even spectators are not allowed. Police will take necessary action,” an official told the TOI.
Support for Palestinian cause
The controversy drew political reactions. Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti expressed support for the Palestinian cause on social media.
“From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. A flag in the wind, bold and free, from the river to the sea,” she posted on X.







Published in Dawn, January 4th, 2026</p><small>2026-01-04 04:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965028/unwanted-unneeded' target='_blank'><strong>Unwanted, unneeded</strong></a><br><p>THE festive mood from the New Year’s celebrations had not even begun to wear off, when the world appeared ready to plunge headfirst into another round of violence and war.
With protests against economic hardships turning into a bout of serious civil unrest in Iran, US President Donald Trump had on Friday issued an unwarranted threat to “respond” if Iran’s security forces killed protesters, prompting Tehran to respond with the ‘warning’ that such a development would destabilise the entire region. What was being said between the lines does not need to be spelt out for anyone.

 

The two countries had come face to face during the Twelve-Day War between Iran and Israel in June this past year, when the US had bombed three Iranian nuclear sites, and Iran had retaliated by hitting America’s Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar before a ceasefire was reached.
Unsurprisingly, Israel also features prominently in the recent flare-up between them.
But Mr Trump’s interventionist aspirations have not been limited to Iran.
On Saturday, after a night of bombs and terror in Venezuela, the US president announced on his social media platform that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, had been captured and flown out of the country.
A US official later told the media that special forces troops had taken part in America’s first direct intervention in Latin America since 1989.
It is worth mentioning that Mr Maduro had just days ago attempted to engage with Mr Trump on narco-trafficking and illegal migration, both of which had been sore issues in Mr Trump’s relationship with his southern neighbour. However, Mr Maduro personally believed that Mr Trump was really after Venezuela’s considerable oil reserves — a perception that was reinforced by multiple leaders from the Trump administration making varying claims on Venezuela’s resources.

 

The Venezuelan context is important for Iran and, indeed, the Middle East. It establishes that there are no limits or international laws when the powerful decide to seize what they want.
There is no doubt that the Iranian people are unhappy with their government for the economic misery they have been suffering. But whatever their grievances, they are for the people of Iran to settle amongst themselves.
That Israel is attempting to fan the unrest and the US is publicly providing guarantees to protesters suggests that the old playbook is being used again: yet another country is to be destabilised as an insurance policy for the state of Israel. The wider region and Iran’s neighbours, in particular, should take a stand against such interventionism, lest they want chaos and unrest at their own doorsteps.
Whatever the Iranian government’s failings, it has kept order despite being placed under immense economic strain by those now pretending to be friends of its people.

According to an importer, 40,000 imported used cars, mainly from Japan, landed in the country during the previous fiscal year, with 660cc vehicles making up 98 per cent. Around 18,000 more arrived in July-December 2025.
Local car assemblers and their vendors feel threatened, claiming that the share of used cars is 25 per cent of all automobile sales, posing a serious risk to local assemblers and jobs in the industry.
With more imported used cars on the roads, Shershah traders say footfall should have increased as owners search for axles, suspension and old engines. But market traders say they have been sitting idle as high prices of parts have been keeping buyers away from one of Asia’s biggest and oldest markets, located close to Lyari and the old SITE industrial area of the port city.
Traders say the market’s slowdown is being driven by a mix of factors like rising prices, easier alternatives in other markets and long-standing problems in access and basic facilities. These have pushed many buyers away from Shershah even as the number of used cars grows.
Why buyers go elsewhere
One of the reasons for the low turnout of buyers, traders said, is the availability of axles, suspension parts and shock absorbers in other small and medium-sized markets at lower prices. They say engines remain Shershah’s core line, but for most other components, buyers can now shop elsewhere.
Another problem is the lack of parking on main roads and even inside the market, traders said. Damaged, narrow internal roads, which they say have not been repaired for decades, further restrict access.
Many consumers prefer buying axle- and suspension-related items from other markets, which they feel are hassle-free and appear cheaper than Shershah Market. Some axle and suspension dealers also pay visits to Dubai and Far East countries to directly import parts instead of procuring them from Shershah.
Traders and repairers say the differences become more obvious when comparing rates across markets. Consumers witness price disparity in axle, suspension and shock absorbers in different markets, which, they say, points to the presence of smuggled parts compared to duty-paid parts that cost more. Chinese parts are also present, they added.
Kabuli vs Chinese
A suspension and axle maker in F.B. Area said that “car owners mainly prefer Kabuli front axle to a Chinese-made one”.
Kabuli parts, which refer to imported used parts regarded as higher quality, “are repairable due to their good quality even after usage for two to three years. Chinese parts lack satisfaction and are unable to be repaired. They can only be replaced”, he said.
For example, a Chinese-made front axle boot pair for a Suzuki Alto 2004 (1,000cc) sells for Rs7,000-8,000, while traders at Plaza Market demand Rs4,000-5,000.
Chinese parts are a one-time risk, he said, as they cannot be repaired and need to be replaced with a new pair after developing a fault. He added that axle makers also provide a six-month guarantee, while others ask consumers to check performance within a week.
Another axle-and-suspension repairer in North Nazimabad, who said his brother visits Dubai to bring duty-paid parts, put the price of the rear axle (Kabuli) of old models of Suzuki Alto 1,000cc, Suzuki Margalla, Suzuki Cultus and Suzuki Mehran in the range of Rs12,000-14,000, including labour charges.
“The rates of front axles have increased by Rs2,000 in the last year but have doubled in the last five years,” he said, adding that dealers provide a six-month to one-year warranty on the above parts.
Repairing charges for a Kabuli axle pair, he said, are Rs5,000, which provides temporary relief for six months to one year depending on the owners’ driving style.
On the contrary, axle and suspension dealers at Plaza Market near Regal Chowk offered to replace the Suzuki Alto 1,000cc (2004) front-axle pair at Rs8,000-9,000, including labour charges, claiming them as “Kabuli and almost new”. They said the parts arrive from the Chaman border from cars that are partially destroyed in accidents.
“I do not know whether they are duty paid or not, but they are definitely cheaper than other markets,” they said, adding that they can be repaired at Rs3,500.
Repairers say buyers tend to check for axle-related issues early, especially when purchasing an older vehicle. They say many buyers first look for a troubling sound that emerges while taking a deep right or left turn. It is also a common sight on the roads that an old car is seen breaking up either the left or right front axle if owners delay in repairing and removing worn axles.
Price differences are also visible in other components.
A dealer at Shershah market said that the price of gaadri (located beneath the engine) for an old Toyota Passo and Daihatsu Mira costs Rs35,000-40,000 (duty paid) compared to Rs10,000-15,000 five years ago.
“After knowing the rates, buyers prefer to move on and they expect more bargaining, on which the shopkeepers do not agree as they are already offering wholesale rates,” he said, adding that “our daily trading of spare parts has shrunk to only 10 per cent”.
However, dealers at Regal Chowk said the gaadri rate of an old Mira 660cc model costs Rs12,000-15,000, including labour charges, as the part is Kabuli and was procured from the Chaman border.
Engines still draw buyers
While traders say buyers have drifted to alternative markets for several parts, Shershah has traditionally been known as a centre for engines. But even this segment, traders say, has been hit by rising prices.
Mohammad Saeed, dealing specifically in small car engines, said a 660cc engine is available for not less than Rs150,000 versus Rs25,000-30,000 five years back.
While complaining of surviving on only two per cent sales for the last four to five years, he said higher import duties on parts and accessories have pushed prices to the ceiling, thus keeping buyers away from the Shershah market.
When asked how a buyer feels satisfied that an imported used 660cc engine is in mint condition, he said importers and big traders own godowns, where imported items reach from the port.
“We just inspect the engines at godowns by removing their cover only,” Mr Saeed said. “If the engine is highly clean inside, it means it is in perfect condition.”
Traders are not allowed to check engines by starting them physically at the godown, he said, adding that this kind of business or deal has been going on for decades on mutual trust between godown owners and traders.
How engine buyers at Shershah Market shops feel satisfied over engine condition, he said, is largely the same approach. “We also use the same formula by asking to see the engine from the engine oil cover cap,” he added.
Buyers are given three to four days’ time to check engine performance in their vehicles, he said, adding that they can exchange it in case the engine does not perform up to the mark.
Syed Wali, who deals in heavy vehicle engines, said an Isuzu 2,500cc engine is available at Rs350,000 compared to Rs130,000 four years back, while a Hyundai Shehzore 2,400cc engine is priced at Rs400,000 compared to Rs160,000.
A Toyota Hilux 2,200-2,800cc engine is now priced at Rs300,000 as compared to Rs150,000.
“From morning to evening, we have been waiting for the buyers to turn up as trading activities have been at the lowest ebb of five per cent for the last many years,” he said.
A troubled past
Apart from prices and access, traders say the market’s past still affects how people view Shershah.
A wave of fear had gripped the market owing to the killing of 13 to 14 people, including traders and customers, in October 2010, as Karachi was in the grip of rising ethnic and political violence.

 

According to media reports, the incident was linked with an extortion dispute with the market association, coupled with ethnic conflict between two political parties at that time.
In June 2012, a prominent trader was shot dead in the market after he refused to pay extortion money.
However, traders agreed that the security situation had improved in the market after these incidents and after the government’s crackdown, and they said no mass killing has taken place since 2010. Still, they argue that buyers and traders remain cautious and that the market’s working conditions continue to create a sense of discomfort.
Zahid Malik Dehalvi, president of Anjuman Welfare Shershah Kabari Market, said that the Shershah market has been free of any smuggled parts and accessories for decades, as traders are paying heavy duties and taxes on imported used items.
Most of the traders, he said, regularly visit various countries, especially Dubai, Hong Kong, Japan and other Far East markets, to directly import used auto parts.
“We pay over Rs10 million as duties and taxes on one container carrying a load of 26 tonnes while smugglers clear the same by paying just Rs1.5 million to Rs2 million,” he said, adding that this is the main reason that the prices of auto parts in Shershah market are costlier than smuggled parts.
Mr Dehalvi, along with other traders, claimed that they sell only duty-paid items instead of smuggled parts in Shershah market, which comprises 4,500 shops and 3,000 small to large-sized godowns. These godowns also house small rented stalls, called theas in popular jargon.
Despite the fact that other cities also have used auto parts markets, Mr Dehalvi said Shershah, being one of the biggest markets in Asia, excels due to its size and because it feeds upcountry auto markets.
He said the working conditions in Shershah appear alarming due to the lack of a proper road network, security-related gaps, no cameras, no street lights, load-shedding and water scarcity.
Rangers and the police have provided security to the market traders after the killing incidents in which many people and traders were gunned down. Before these incidents, traders used to pull down their shutters by 4pm, he said.
“We have seen a time during 2002-04 when the traders did not have time to talk owing to the huge rush of buyers as prices of auto parts were also low,” he said, adding that the high prices of auto parts after the imposition of heavy duties and taxes have restricted buyers’ presence in the market.
“In heavy rains, the biggest used items’ market closes down for two to three days as rainwater submerges on the already dilapidated roads and enters the shops,” he said.
He said it was the government’s responsibility to provide basic amenities to the six-decade-old market as well as full security, as buyers and even traders still feel unsafe to even carry Rs50,000. He urged the Sindh government to ensure the setting up of police pickets in the market.</p><small>2026-01-04 04:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0408421494c76a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965043/maduro-now-in-new-york-jail-as-trump-says-us-to-run-venezuela' target='_blank'><strong>Maduro now in New York jail as Trump says US to ‘run’ Venezuela</strong></a><br><p>Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was in a New York jail on Saturday, hours after American special forces seized and flew him out of his country — which Donald Trump said would come under effective US control.
The US president’s announcement followed a lightning pre-dawn attack in which commandos grabbed Maduro and his wife while air strikes pounded sites in and around Caracas.
A US government plane carrying Maduro landed at a military base shortly after nightfall, and he was transported by helicopter to New York City, where the couple were to be arraigned on drug trafficking and weapons charges.
The White House posted a video on X of Maduro, handcuffed and in sandals, escorted by federal agents through a US Drug Enforcement Administration facility in New York.







“Good night, happy new year,” the 63-year-old leftist is heard saying in English.
Despite the success of the risky raid, what happens next is highly uncertain.
Trump said he was “designating people” from his cabinet to be in charge in Venezuela but gave no further details.
In another surprise, Trump indicated US troops could be deployed, saying Washington is “not afraid of boots on the ground.” But he appeared to reject the possibility of the country’s opposition taking power and said he could work instead with Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez.
One aspect that became clearer was Trump’s interest in Venezuela’s vast oil reserves.
“We’re going to have our very large United States oil companies … go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure,” he said.
“We’ll be selling large amounts of oil.”
Trump dismisses opposition leader
US-backed opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who won last year’s Nobel Peace Prize, posted on social media that “the hour of freedom has arrived.” She called for the opposition’s 2024 election candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, to “immediately” assume the presidency.







But Trump was surprisingly cold about expectations that Machado could become Venezuela’s new leader, saying she doesn’t have “support or respect” there.
Instead, he touted Rodriguez, saying “she’s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.” Rodriguez poured cold water on that, demanding Maduro’s release and vowing to “defend” the country.
Late on Saturday, Venezuela’s Supreme Court ordered Rodriguez to assume presidential powers “in an acting capacity.” Reflecting the confusion, Trump indicated US involvement is likely for the long haul.
“We’re going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place,” he said.
Venezuela ally China said it “strongly condemns” the US operation, while France warned a solution cannot “be imposed from outside.” United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was “deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected.”
At Venezuela’s request, the UN Security Council will meet on Monday to discuss the crisis, the Somali presidency of the Council told AFP.
Blackout and bombing
Venezuelans had been bracing for attacks as US forces spent months massing off the coast.
Caracas residents woke to explosions and the whir of military helicopters around 2am local time (0600 GMT). Air strikes hit a major military base and an airbase, among other sites, for nearly an hour.
The top US military officer, General Dan Caine, said 150 aircraft took part in the operation, supporting troops who choppered in to seize Maduro with the help of months of intelligence into his daily habits — down to “what he ate” and what pets he kept.
Maduro and his wife “gave up” without a struggle, and there was “no loss of US life,” he said.
Venezuelan authorities have yet to release casualty figures. But Trump told the New York Post that “many” Cubans in Maduro’s security detail were killed.
Within hours of the operation, Caracas had fallen eerily quiet, with police stationed outside public buildings and the smell of smoke drifting through the streets.
Shifting justifications
The US and numerous European governments did not recognise Maduro’s legitimacy, saying he stole elections in 2018 and 2024.
Maduro — in power since 2013 after taking over from leftist mentor Hugo Chavez — long accused Trump of seeking regime change in order to control Venezuela’s oil reserves.
Trump has offered several justifications for the aggressive policy toward Venezuela, at times stressing illegal migration, narcotics trafficking and oil.
But he had previously avoided openly calling for regime change.
Several members of Congress quickly questioned the legality of the operation. But Trump’s key ally Mike Johnson, top Republican in the House of Representatives, said it was “justified.”</p><small>2026-01-04 03:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/04080950feb22a9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964986/doctors-without-borders-warns-of-gaza-exit-after-israels-ban' target='_blank'><strong>Doctors Without Borders warns of Gaza exit after Israel’s ban</strong></a><br><p>PARIS: Medical charity Doctors Without Borders said on Saturday it will be forced to end its operations in the Gaza Strip in March if Israel does not reverse a decision to ban 37 international humanitarian organisations from the territory.
Earlier, Israel confirmed it suspended the organisations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials.
Israeli authorities said the lists are now officially required for “security” reasons to prevent bodies it accuses of supporting terrorism from operating in the Palestinian territories.
Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, called the demand a “scandalous intrusion”, though Israel contends the measure is needed to stop Palestinians from “infiltrating humanitarian structures”.
Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on Friday for Israel to end the ban, saying he was “deeply concerned” by the development.

UN chief calls on Tel Aviv to reverse its decision

Stephane Dujarric, a spokesperson for the secretary-general, said Guterres “calls for this measure to be reversed, stressing that international nongovernmental organisations are indispensable to life-saving humanitarian work and that the suspension risks undermining the fragile progress made during the ceasefire.”
“This recent action will further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians,” Ms Dujarric added.
NGOs included in the ban have been ordered to cease their operations by March 1.
“To work in Palestine, in the occupied Palestinian territories, we have to be registered. … That registration expired on Dec 31, 2025,” Isabelle Defourny, a physician and president of MSF France while speaking to France Inter said.
“Since July 2025, we have been involved in a re-registration process and to date, we have not received a response,” she said. “We still have 60 days during which we could work without being re-registered, and so we would have to end our activities in March” if Israel maintains the decision.
Ms Defourny said the Israeli decision is explained by the fact that NGOs “bear witness to the violence committed by the Israeli army” in Gaza.
MSF has roughly 1,200 staff members in the Palestinian territories — the majority in Gaza — including 40 international staff and some 800 Palestinian staff working across eight hospitals.
“We are the second-largest distributor of water (in the Gaza Strip),” Ms Defourny said. “Last year, in 2025, we treated just over 100,000 people who were wounded, burned, or victims of various traumas. We are second in terms of the number of deliveries performed.”
Several NGOs have said the new requirements contravene international humanitarian law or endanger their independence.
On Thursday, 18 Israel-based left-wing NGOs denounced the ban on their international peers, stating that “the new registration framework violates core humanitarian principles of independence and neutrality”.
The ban comes amid a fragile ceasefire in place since October, following the war waged by Israel in Gaza.
In November, authorities in Gaza said more than 70,000 people had been killed by Tel Aviv’s military. According to UN data, nearly 80 per cent of buildings in Gaza have been destroyed or damaged, leaving infrastructure decimated.
About 1.5 million of Gaza’s more than 2 million residents have lost their homes, said Amjad Al-Shawa, director of the Palestinian NGO Network in Gaza.

ISLAMABAD: The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations has launched ‘International Year of the Woman Farmer 2026’, a global campaign aimed at recognising women’s indispensable yet often overlooked contributions to global agrifood systems and to galvanising efforts to close persistent gender gaps.
Women make up a significant proportion of the world’s agricultural workforce and play a central role across agrifood value chains — from production and processing to distribution and trade — while also ensuring household food security and nutrition. In 2021, agrifood systems employed 40 per cent of working women globally— nearly equal to men.
Despite their vital role, women’s contributions remain undervalued and their working conditions are often more precarious: irregular, informal, part-time, low-paid work that is labour-intensive and highly vulnerable. Women continue to face systemic barriers, including limited access to land, finance, technologies, education, extension services and participation in decision-making at all levels.
In Pakistan, approximately 74 per cent of women and girls engaged in the labour force work in the agriculture sector, which generates about 40pc of household income. However, protection issues faced by women farmers remain poorly documented and insufficiently addressed.
An FAO report on women farmers in Pakistan highlights the need to amend labour and agriculture policies at the federal and provincial levels to recognise all women performing work related to crops, fruits, vegetables, livestock, fisheries, poultry, dairy, forestry and post-harvest production as “farmers”, whether they work full-time or part-time, including those working on family farms without land ownership.
The report recommends setting a minimum wage for women farmers and ensuring wage parity with male agricultural workers for work of equal value. It also calls for the allocation of unused federal and provincial land to landless rural women farmers, along with access to water and input subsidies to support sustainable livelihoods.
Designated by the UN General Assembly in 2024, the International Year aims to highlight the challenges faced by women farmers and drive policy reforms and investment to advance gender equality, emp­ower women and build more resilient agrifood systems. FAO, in collaboration with the Rome-based UN agencies — the International Fund for Agricultural Develo­pment (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) — will coordinate activities throughout 2026.
Recent FAO reports, The Status of Women in Agrifood Systems and The Unjust Climate, reveal that women farmers typically cultivate smaller landholdings than men and face a 24pc productivity gap even on farms of equal size. Each day of extreme heat reduces the total value of crops produced by women farmers by three per cent compared to men.

The NDC will also extend a special invitation to Tehreek Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP). Fawad Chaudhry, Imran Ismail and Mahmood Moulvi, who formed the committee, have begun contacting political leaders to extend invitations.

National Dialogue Committee to invite lawyers, intellectuals for talks

The organisers said the conference aimed to explore a way out of the political crisis and build harmony among national political parties. Mr Chaudhry said that bringing together all schools of thought on national matters was “the need of the hour” and that the goal was to develop consensus on key political issues.

 

Last month, the group formally approached Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, seeking the release on parole of senior PTI figures detained in Kot Lakhpat Jail, arguing their participation was essential to make any dialogue process credible and productive.
In a letter sent to the prime minister on Dec 23, the committee welcomed PM Shehbaz’s renewed offer of talks with the opposition, particularly PTI, and described it as a “golden opportunity” to stabilise the country amid deepening political, economic and institutional challenges.
Interestingly, the letter did not mention PTI founder Imran Khan, focusing instead on senior party leaders outside Adiala jail to initiate and sustain a dialogue process.
It also sought the rele­ase on parole of PTI leaders held in Kot Lakhpat Jail, including Shah Mah­mood Qureshi, Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Mian Mehmo­odur Rasheed and former senator Ejaz Chaudhry.
The committee said talks could only succeed if they began with tangible confidence-building measures.

MUKALLA : Yemen’s Saudi-backed and internationally recognised government said on Saturday it had retaken control of Mukalla, the key eastern port in Yemen and capital of Hadramaut province, from separatists who seized it last month.
The rapid government gains since Friday have reversed many of the advances made by the Southern Transitional Council (STC) and cast doubt on viability of its intention to hold a referendum on “independence”.
As the fighting threatened to upend the regional order, the United Arab Emirates urged de-escalation, saying it was “deeply concerned” by the violence. Saudi Arabia appealed for factions to convene for talks in Riyadh.
Saudi-backed forces said on Friday they had made advances and taken control of key locations in Hadramaut, a large province with stretches of desert along the Saudi border.
By Saturday, military officials announced that “all military and civilian facilities” in Mukalla, the provincial capital, had “been secured”. An official said the military had seized the city’s principal military base.
The STC confirmed the loss of territory. An STC official said there had been a “retreat of our forces” from the Al-Khasha area following “intense” Saudi airstrikes.
The official said a separate strike on the Barshid camp, west of Mukalla, resulted in fatalities. He did not provide a specific number.
Witnesses in Mukalla described a breakdown in security accompanied by looting, though Saudi-backed forces appeared to advance with little resistance.
UAE calls for dialogue
The conflict triggered an immediate diplomatic response. The UAE released a statement saying Yemenis should prioritise dialogue to safeguard security and stability.

 

Saudi Arabia, in a statement posted by its foreign ministry to social media, called for “a comprehensive conference in Riyadh to bring together all southern factions to discuss just solutions to the southern cause”. Riyadh said the Yemeni government had issued the invitation for talks.
Overnight, Presidential Council chief Rashad al-Alimi confirmed he had asked Saudi Arabia to host a forum to resolve the southern issue.
Tensions boiled over early this week when Saudi Arabia bombed a base in Hadramaut and demanded all remaining UAE forces in Yemen depart, calling the separatist expansion a “red line” for its security.
The STC responded with accusations that “northern Islamist factions” — a reference to the Islah party within the recognised government — had targeted civilians. The group appealed for international intervention against what it described as a “Saudi-backed military escalation”.
In a clear signal of its secessionist intent, the STC announced on Friday the start of a two-year transitional period leading to a referendum on independence for a new “South Arabian state”.
Aidaros Alzubidi, the STC chief, said the process would include dialogue with Yemen’s Houthi-controlled north, but warned the group would declare independence “immediately” if there was no dialogue or if southern Yemen was attacked again.
The political infighting has also disrupted travel. Aden airport, the hub for areas outside Houthi control, has been closed since Thursday amid disputes over flight restrictions. The STC stated on Saturday that southern Yemen was being subjected to a land, sea, and land blockade.
Separately, Pakistan expressed support on Saturday for Yemen’s territorial integrity and the Saudi-led push for de-escalation.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday had a phone call with Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan shortly after landing in Beijing, the Foreign Office (FO) said.
In a post on X today, the FO stated that the pair “deliberated on the recent situation in the region” during the phone call.
“The DPM/FM welcomed the Saudi foreign ministry’s statement regarding Yemen and appreciated the efforts of all sides to resolve the regional situation amicably,” the FO stated.







Meanwhile, the FO also welcomed the call by Yemen’s presidential council to hold a dialogue in Riyadh, urging all stakeholders to engage in “good faith” toward a negotiated political solution.
The FO expressed Pakistan’s hope that, guided by the principles of unity and brotherhood, regional efforts will contribute to bringing lasting peace and stability in Yemen.

Speaking in a recorded television appearance marking a holiday, Ayatollah Khamenei addressed the mounting crisis facing Iran’s leadership.
He adopted a dual approach to the demonstrations that have flared across more than two dozen cities since Sunday, acknowledging legitimate economic grievances while drawing a hard line against political dissent.
“We will speak with the protesters, but talking to rioters is useless,” Khamenei said. “Rioters should be put in their place.” Khamenei’s defiance came just one day after Trump warned that the US was “locked and loaded and ready to go” regarding the situation in Iran. Although Trump did not specify what action he might take, the threat adds to the pressure on Tehran following US and Israeli airstrikes last summer targeting Iran’s nuclear sites and military leaders.
‘Bazaaris were right’
Addressing the geopolitical tension, the Iranian leader insisted the country “will not yield to the enemy”. However, he conceded the validity of frustrations expressed by market traders regarding the collapsing rial currency.
“The bazaaris were right. They are right to say they cannot do business in these conditions,” Khamenei said. “The shopkeepers have protested against this situation and that is completely fair.”
He noted that the president and high-ranking officials were working to resolve difficulties in the sanctions-battered economy.
As authorities promised dialogue for economic complaints, rights groups reported a sharp rise in violence and arrests. Demonstrators calling for political change have clashed with security forces, resulting in at least 10 deaths.
Authorities have said two members of the security services had died and more than a dozen were injured in the unrest.
Hengaw, a Kurdish rights group, said late on Friday it had identified 133 people arrested, an increase of 77 from the previous day.
State television reported additional arrests in western and central Iran, including individuals accused of manufacturing petrol bombs and homemade pistols.
Discontent takes political turn
The unrest began as an expression of discontent over high prices, but quickly expanded to include political demands.
The semi-official Fars news agency reported that crowds in Karaj, on the outskirts of Tehran, burned the Iranian flag and shouted, “Death to the dictator!”
Videos circulated by rights groups showed marchers chanting: “We don’t want spectators: join us.”
State media offered accounts of deadly confrontations in smaller cities. The Mehr news agency reported that Ali Azizi, a member of the paramilitary Basij force, was “martyred after being stabbed and shot” in the western city of Harsin.
The Tasnim news agency reported a man was killed in the holy city of Qom when a grenade he was attempting to use exploded “in his hands”.
Social media posts reported unrest overnight in several districts of the capital, with activists proclaiming “this isn’t the last battle, Pahlavi is coming back!”
While reports of violence have centred on Iran’s western provinces, the atmosphere in Tehran appeared quieter on Saturday, a public holiday, as rain and snow kept many streets empty.

Senior Civil Judge Abbas Shah observed that the CM had repeatedly ignored summons and remained absent from proceedings without any lawful justification. The court noted that despite being given multiple opportunities to present himself before the court and respond to the allegations, the accused failed to comply with judicial directions.
The court took a serious view of the persistent non-appearance and termed it a deliberate attempt to evade the legal process. Consequently, the judge ordered law enforcement authorities to ensure Mr Afridi’s production before the court. Following the issuance of the arrest warrants, the court adjourned proceedings till January 17.
According to the case record, the matter stems from a complaint registered by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), which has booked the KP chief minister under various provisions of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).

Civil judge describes non-compliance with orders as deliberate attempt to evade legal process

Besides the cybercrime case, Mr Afridi and his colleagues are facing proceedings in an anti-terrorism court for their alleged involvement in the Nov 26 protest in Islamabad.
The anti-terrorism court had initiated proclamation proceedings against them for repeatedly failing to appear before the court. The court had called upon CM Afridi, Meena Khan, Amjad Khan, Shafiullah Jan and Amjad Afridi to appear before it to face ongoing legal proceedings. In its order, the court had noted that the repeated absence of the defendants left it with “no option but to initiate proclamation proceedings,” while granting them a final opportunity to surrender.
The notices had warned that failure to appear during the Section 87 proceedings would compel the court to proceed with further legal action in accordance with the law. The case is based on an FIR registered in connection with a November 26 protest, in which the chief minister and other individuals were nominated.
Mr Afridi is also facing a case in the Election Commission of Pakistan for the code of conduct violation during a recent by-election on a national seat in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. His lawyers have, however, challenged the ECP’s jurisdiction in the case while also moving the high court against the election watchdog.
The ECP had summoned the CM after he threatened the election staff during a political gathering in Havelian, Abbott­abad, ahead of the by-poll in NA-18.
It may be noted that Mr Afridi has been tasked by party leader Imran Khan, who is in jail, to lead the ‘street movement’ against the government. He visited Lahore last week to galvanise the party’s supporters, but the provincial authorities created hurdles in his political activities, prompting allegations from both sides.
He is set to visit Karachi next week to whip up support for the planned protest drive. The CM had also staged a sit-in outside the Adiala jail after the authorities barred him from visiting Imran Khan. However, he refrained from participating in subsequent protests to avoid legal troubles.

Filed by Advocate Nabeel Javed Kahloon, the petition seeks to set aside the sale of the national carrier, describing it as illegal and unconstitutional.
The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) had endorsed a Rs135 billion bid from an Arif Habib Group-led consortium for a 75 per cent stake in the airline.
The winning bid was approximately 35pc higher than the government’s reference price of Rs115bn. The consortium has pledged to invest an additional Rs80bn to Rs125bn into the airline for fleet modernisation and operational restructuring.
The petitioner argues that the privatisation process, specifically the Expression of Interest (EOI) published on May 7, 2025 and the subsequent sale on Dec 23 violates the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (Conversion) Act, 2016.

Petitioner says Dec 23 move is in violation of law governing the airline

He states that the federal government, while issuing the EOI, did not appreciate the legal fact that PIA is a trans-provincial institution included in the Federal Legislative List, Part II, hence without the approval of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) as mandated under Article 154 of the Constitution, since no privatisation could take place.
He argues that the government, through its cabinet committee, passed an order illegally for the privatisation of PIA without the approval of CCI and Parliament.
He contends that any restructuring or transfer of assets should remain within government-controlled entities as per the sections 3 and 4 of the 2016 Act.
The petitioner claims that massive public funds have been injected into the airline over decades and its sale to a private group is a matter of significant public interest.
He contends that the respondents, to justify privatisation, falsely portrayed PIA as a burden on the public exchequer and wrongly stated that its value is five times less than its accumulated losses (approximately Rs800bn).
In fact, he claims, PIA has not been receiving grants or subsidies from the government as its financial difficulties are due to debt servicing, mismanagement and policy failures.
He argues that the process for the sale of the asset adopted by the respondents amounts to misuse of authority, lack of transparency and arbitrary.
The lawyer argues that an amendment made to Section 28 of the Privatisation Commission Ordinance on Dec 14 2023, to oust jurisdiction of high courts, does not apply to the case in hand, since the petition challenges constitutional and legal violations, not private disputes between bidders.
He asserts that the sale of a national asset like PIA falls under judicial scrutiny under Article 199 of the Constitution.
Advocate Kahloon, who is known for representing aviation industry’s employees before courts, alleges that he has been subjected to harassment for raising the issue of the PIA’s privatisation.
The lawyer asks the court to declare the sale null and void, specifically the agreement reached on Dec 23, 2025.
He also urges the court to suspend all further steps, halt any actions arising from the May 2025 EOI and order that any necessary restructuring be kept strictly within state-owned entities.

While Infinix and Tecno have already announced higher rates, other brands, including Vgotel, Vivo, Realme, Oppo, etc., plan to announce new rates in the coming week.
Manufacturers say this is due to the high cost of chipsets.
“The memory chips have become costlier, between 20 and 30 per cent, and all of it is imported,” said Muzaffar Paracha, Senior Vice-Chairman of the Pakistan Mobile Phone Manufacturers Ass­ociation (PMPMA).

Manufacturers cite higher memory-chip costs,  AI-driven demand and global supply constraints for rising handset prices

Manufacturers noted that the cost of memory chips has increased by $20-30 per set. This is because the world is facing a shortage of memory chips.
“There are only three key producers of mobile phones — Apple, Samsung and Chinese brands that dominate world markets,” said Amir Allawala, a senior member of the association.
He added that, due to new developments, the prices of many items are rising rapidly, such as solar panels, ICs, and chipsets, as the world moves towards 5G-compatible mobile devices.
Apart from Samsung and Apple, almost all mobile phone manufacturers globally have been hit by a severe shortage of memory chips.
Most mobile phone chipsets for motherboards, such as processors and memory chips, are produced in Taiwan. Apple and Samsung phones, however, have their own supply lines for memory chips used in their devices.
Supply of memory chips has been constrained in Taiwan and Japan due to continuously rising demand across all sectors, including non-mobile manufacturers.
“This is because of extensive use of AI in almost all apps, which has led to the use of higher-capacity memory chips,” said Zeeshan Miannoor, vice chairman of the PMPMA.
“Now almost all preloaded apps on phones have AI features, which has led to increased memory requirements for both RAM and ROM,” he added.
Currently, the minimum smartphone memory configuration is 4GB RAM (random access memory) and 64GB ROM (read-only memory).
RAM serves as short-term storage for what the CPU is currently using, while ROM stores permanent startup code and essential data.
Taiwanese memory-chip makers have almost stopped producing 4GB/64GB chips, and prices of 4GB/128GB IC chips have increased significantly due to a shift in production towards 6GB/256GB chips.
“This is because the world is shifting to higher-capacity and 5G-compatible sets,” said Naveed Gaba, CEO of VGOTel.
As manufacturers shift to higher-capacity memory chips, there is a shortage of lower-capacity chips, while newer ones are more expensive.
He added that Chinese companies have started focusing on chip manufacturing, but this will take time.
Meanwhile, a senior expert in the field said recent conflicts in 2025 have highlighted the importance of autonomous weaponry such as missiles and drones. The expert added that high-grade chipsets and memory chips are in demand from sectors beyond IT and telephony.
Mr Allawala added that smartphone prices will rise and that the government needs to devise innovative options.
“There have been talks for some time about smartphones being sold on installments. This would allow consumers to buy phones more easily,” he said, adding that the government must facilitate greater localisation, which would help reduce the cost of other components used in mobile sets.
Around 31 million mobile sets are produced locally, but about 47pc are still 2G feature phones, as 4G and data services are not available in many remote and low-population areas.
After the upcoming spectrum auction, demand for smartphones with higher memory capacity is also expected to increase, as telecom operators roll out 4G services in more underserved areas.

The action came as a surprise, but according to sources familiar with the matter, planning for one of the most complex US operations in recent memory had been in the works for months and included detailed rehearsals.
Elite US troops, including the Army’s Delta Force, created an exact replica of Maduro’s safe house and practiced how they would enter the strongly fortified residence.
The CIA had a small team on the ground starting in August who were able to provide insight into Maduro’s pattern of life that made grabbing him seamless, according to one source familiar with the matter.
Two other sources told Reuters the intelligence agency also had an asset close to Maduro who would monitor his movements and was poised to pinpoint his exact location as the operation unfolded.
With the pieces in place, Trump approved the operation four days ago, but military and intelligence planners suggested he wait for better weather and less cloud cover.
At 10:46pm EST on Friday, Trump gave the final go ahead for what would be known as Operation Absolute Resolve, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Dan Caine told reporters.
Trump, surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, watched a live stream of the events.
How the hours-long operation unfolded is based on interviews with four sources familiar with the matter and details Trump himself has revealed.
“I’ve done some pretty good ones, but I’ve never seen anything like this,” Trump said on Fox News just hours after the mission was completed.
‘Massive’ operation
The Pentagon has overseen a massive military buildup of forces in the Caribbean, sending an aircraft carrier, 11 warships and more than a dozen F-35 aircraft.
In total, more than 15,000 troops have poured into the region for what US officials have long described as anti-drug operations.
According to one of the sources, Trump senior aide Stephen Miller, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe formed a core team working on the issue for months with regular - sometimes daily - meetings and phone calls. They often also met with the president.
Late on Friday night and into early Saturday, Trump and his advisers huddled as a number of US aircraft took off and carried out strikes against targets inside and close to Caracas, including air defense systems, according to a US military official.
Caine said the operation involved more than 150 aircraft launched from 20 bases around the Western Hemisphere, including F-35 and F-22 jets, and B-1 bombers.
“We had a fighter jet for every possible situation,” Trump told Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends.”
Sources have told Reuters the Pentagon had also quietly moved into the region refueling air tankers, drones and aircraft specialising in electronic jamming.
US officials said the airstrikes hit military targets. Images taken by Reuters at the La Carlota air base in Caracas showed charred military vehicles from a Venezuelan anti-aircraft unit.
With the strikes taking place, US Special Forces made their way into Caracas heavily armed, including with a blowtorch in case they had to cut through steel doors at Maduro’s location.
Around 1 a.m. EST Saturday, Caine said, the troops arrived at Maduro’s compound in downtown Caracas while being fired upon. One of the helicopters was hit, but still able to fly.
Social media videos posted by residents showed a convoy of helicopters flying over the city at low altitude.
Once they reached Maduro’s safe house the troops, along with FBI agents, made their way into the residence, which Trump described as a “very highly guarded … fortress.”
“They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broke into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason,” Trump said.
“They got taken out in a matter of seconds.”
Maduro in custody
Once the troops were inside the safe house, Caine said, Maduro and his wife surrendered. Trump said the Venezuelan leader had tried to reach a safe room but was unable to close the door.
“He got bum rushed so fast that he didn’t get into that,” Trump said.
Some US forces were hit, Trump said, but none were killed.
As the operation unfolded, Rubio started to inform lawmakers that it was underway. The notifications only began after the operation started and not before, as is customary for key lawmakers who play an oversight role, officials told Reuters.
As the troops left Venezuelan territory, Caine said, they were involved in “multiple self defense engagements.”
By 3:20am EST, the helicopters were over water, with Maduro and his wife on board.
Almost exactly seven hours after Trump announced the operation on Truth Social, he made another post.
This time it was a photograph of the captured Venezuelan leader blindfolded, handcuffed and wearing grey sweatpants.
“Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima,” Trump wrote, referring to the amphibious assault ship.</p><small>2026-01-03 18:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/0311430793a6b1f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964857/police-book-unidentified-suspects-for-murder-of-four-after-bodies-found-in-karachis-mai-kolachi' target='_blank'><strong>Police book unidentified suspects for murder of four after bodies found in Karachi’s Mai Kolachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: Docks police on Saturday evening registered a first information report (FIR) against unidentified suspects for brutally killing four persons whose bodies were recovered from a pit in a bushy area near Mai Kolachi Road on Friday night.
The case was registered on behalf of the state by police officer Mohammed Azhar under Sections 34 (common intention) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code
According to the contents of the FIR, the complainant said the bodies of two males and two females were recovered from a dried manhole. Their post-mortem examinations were conducted at Civil Hospital Karachi. Police shared pictures of the victims on different social media groups for identification.
“Circumstances give rise to suspicions that the victims were killed somewhere and later on their bodies were thrown in the dried manhole,” the FIR stated.
Speaking to Dawn earlier today, Karachi Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the bodies bore multiple marks of torture.
She added that victims’ ages were between 10 and 40 years, while the bodies were around four to five days old. The corpses were taken to Civil Hospital, where medico-legal formalities were completed late on Friday night.
Dr Syed said that one victim, a boy between 13 and 14 years of age, had multiple injuries to the head, face and neck. She said that another boy around 10 years of age had injuries to the throat.
The third victim, a girl around 14 to 15 years of age, also had multiple injuries to the head, face and neck. The fourth victim, a woman around 40 years of age, had injuries to the skull, she added.
“All the relevant samples have been collected to test for intoxication and sexual violence,” she said.
On Saturday evening, police said that the four victims were identified as a 35-year-old woman and her three children, aged 13, 12 and 10.
South Deputy Inspector General Syed Asad Raza told Dawn there was no CCTV footage available of the area from where the bodies were discovered.
Raza added that the victims’ injuries appeared to have been caused by an axe or a sharp-edged weapon. However, he said that the exact cause of death would be determined once the autopsy report was finalised.
He surmised that since three of the victims appeared to be children and the fourth a woman in her 40s, they may all belong to the same family.
“So the gruesome killing may be linked with so-called ‘honour killings’,” he expressed.</p><small>2026-01-03 17:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/03220843b80e6e5.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964889/venezuelan-oil-industry-worlds-largest-reserves-decaying-infrastructure' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuelan oil industry: world’s largest reserves, decaying infrastructure</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world. The country’s president, Nicolas Maduro, was captured by US forces on Saturday, according to US President Donald Trump.
Following are key facts about the oil industry of Venezuela:
Reserves
Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves but its crude output remains at a fraction of capacity due to mismanagement, lack of investment and sanctions, official data shows.
Venezuela holds about 17% of global reserves or 303 billion barrels, ahead of Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) leader Saudi Arabia, according to the London-based Energy Institute.
Its reserves are made up mostly of heavy oil in the Orinoco region of central Venezuela, making its crude expensive to produce, but technically relatively simple, according to the US government’s energy department.
Production
Venezuela was a founding member of OPEC with Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
The country was producing as much as 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s, which at the time represented over 7% of global oil output.
Production fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged some 1.1 million bpd last year or just 1% of global production.
“If developments ultimately lead to a genuine regime change, this could even result in more oil on the market over time. However, it will take time for production to recover fully,” said Arne Lohmann Rasmussen from Global Risk Management.
If regime change is successful, Venezuela’s exports could grow as sanctions are lifted and foreign investment returns, said MST Marquee analyst Saul Kavonic.
“History shows that forced regime change rarely stabilises oil supply quickly, with Libya and Iraq offering clear and sobering precedents,” said Jorge Leon, head of geopolitical analysis at Rystad Energy.
Trump told Fox News on Saturday the United States would be very strongly involved in Venezuela’s oil sector.
Joint ventures
Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in the 1970s, creating Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA).
During the 1990s, Venezuela took steps to open the sector to foreign investment. Following the election of Hugo Chavez in 1999, Venezuela mandated majority PDVSA ownership of all oil projects.
PDVSA set up ventures in the hope of boosting production, including with Chevron, China National Petroleum Corporation, ENI, Total and Russia’s Rosneft.
Exports, refining
The United States used to be the main buyer of Venezuelan oil but since the introduction of sanctions, China has become the main destination in the last decade.
Venezuela owes about $10 billion to China after China became the largest lender under late President Hugo Chavez.
Venezuela repays loans with crude transported in three very large crude carriers previously co-owned by Venezuela and China.
Two of those supertankers were approaching Venezuela in December when Trump announced a blockade of all tankers going in and out of the country.
The vessels are now waiting for instructions, according to PDVSA documents and shipping data, as Venezuelan exports have been mostly halted.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that a snow-clearing operation, led by Captain Asmad Gulfam, took place on the night of December 2 (Friday) and continued into this morning, to facilitate troops moving in the area.
“At around 2am on January 3, 2026, while [the] subject operation was ongoing, a snow slide triggered, resultantly Captain Asmad [28, a resident of Lahore], along with two soldiers and [a] civilian machine operator (PWD), got entrapped,” the ISPR said.
The statement added that four individuals were rescued from the snow; however, the condition of Captain Asmad, Sepoy Rizwan (32, a resident of Attock) and machine operator Essa (a resident of Astore) deteriorated and the three embraced martyrdom.
“These individuals rendered [the] ultimate sacrifice by leading a challenging operation, in extreme weather conditions, to facilitate operational movement of forces,” the ISPR stated.
“Their sacrifice and devotion to duty is [a] testimony to the fact that all ranks of [the] Pakistan Armed Forces are determined to defend the motherland and will not hesitate to lay down their lives in the line of duty and devotion to [the] cause.”
Last month, two army personnel were seriously injured when a speeding oil tanker hit an army vehicle near Qazi Ahmed town along the National Highway in Nawabshah on Saturday.
The victims, identified as Mohammed Bakhsh and Mohammed Nadeem, were on their way to Sukkur from Karachi when their vehicle met with the accident.
Police and Rescue-1122 personnel rushed to the accident site and moved the victims to the Qazi Ahmed Taluka Hospital for emergency treatment. Later, one of them was referred to the People’s Medical University Hospital in Nawabshah, due to his critical condition.</p><small>2026-01-03 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/03211803c3762b0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964887/ppps-sherry-rehman-slams-modis-silence-over-violence-against-minorities-in-india' target='_blank'><strong>PPP’s Sherry Rehman slams Modi’s silence over violence against minorities in India</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: PPP Parliamentary Leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman on Saturday expressed grave concern over the continued silence of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on violence carried out by Hindu radical groups against religious minorities, particularly Christians and Muslims.
Just before December 25, mobs armed with wooden sticks vandalised Christmas decorations at a shopping mall in central India, while right-wing groups disrupted school celebrations and burned holiday merchandise in the northeast, according to Indian media. The incidents occurred in the states of Chhattisgarh, Assam, Kerala and Uttar Pradesh ahead of the holiday.
“What stops Prime Minister Modi from condemning the actions of Hindu radicals who attack Christians — as we all do in Pakistan — from clearly stating that such violence is unacceptable in a civilised country?” Senator Rehman asked. “I think we know the answer, he is okay with impunity.”
She underscored that leadership is ultimately tested by its willingness to confront extremism within its own support base. Silence, she warned, risks signalling tolerance for impunity and normalising hate-driven violence.







Her remarks align with a piece published by The Wall Street Journal, which has documented a significant rise in violence against religious minorities in India since Prime Minister Modi took office in 2014.
According to the article, groups aligned with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been implicated in attacks against Muslims and Christians, alongside systemic discrimination in employment, education, housing, and access to civic participation.
According to the WSJ, India’s Muslim community — approximately 14 per cent of the population — has borne the brunt of the most severe attacks, facing widespread social exclusion and ghettoisation.
Christians, who comprise just a meagre 2.3pc of the population and largely belong to economically marginalised communities, have also increasingly been targeted.
WSJ noted that radical Hindu groups remain fixated on what they describe as the “threat” of Christian conversion, despite the Christian community’s small size and with 80pc of India’s population being Hindus.
The paper further highlighted that at least 12 Indian states have enacted laws prohibiting religious conversion by “force, fraud, or allurement,” with “allurement” often interpreted so broadly that even peaceful evangelical activity is criminalised. Violence against Christians is frequently justified under the pretext of enforcing these laws.
Senator Rehman emphasised that the protection of religious freedom and minority rights is not a regional or partisan issue but a universal democratic obligation.
“Condemning extremism should never be selective,” she stated. “A civilised nation is defined not by the power of its majority, but by how it protects its most vulnerable citizens.”
She asserted that a democratic country should unequivocally denounce hate-based violence, uphold constitutional protections for all faiths, and ensure accountability for those who incite or carry out attacks in the name of religion.</p><small>2026-01-03 16:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/032031437792a7c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964886/pakistan-witnesses-first-supermoon-of-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan witnesses first supermoon of 2026</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan witnessed the first supermoon, also known as the Wolf Moon, of 2026 on Saturday.
The moon was clearly visible in most parts of the country, and as the date coincided with the 14th of Rajab in the Islamic calendar, it appeared bright and prominent in the night sky.
In a statement, a SUPARCO spokesperson said the astronomical event also marked the last supermoon in a cycle that began in October 2025.
Traditionally referred to as the Wolf Moon, the supermoon began rising in Pakistan at 5:51 pm, with lunar illumination reaching 99.8 per cent, a spokesperson said.
Due to its closer distance from Earth, the moon appeared noticeably brighter and larger than usual.
As the sky was clear of clouds on Saturday, the supermoon was easily visible. However, due to thin cloud cover on Friday night, a bright, large ring was visible around the moon because of the refraction of moonlight.
At the time of the event, the distance between the Earth and the Moon was approximately 362,000 kilometres, making the Moon appear 6 to 7 per cent larger and about 10 per cent brighter than an average full moon.
A spokesperson from SUPARCO further stated that the Quadrantids meteor shower will also be at its peak during this period, enhancing the skywatching experience for observers.
According to the space agency, the next series of supermoons is expected to begin in November 2026, providing more opportunities for astronomical observation later in the year.</p><small>2026-01-03 15:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/643063-army-officer-soldier-among-three-martyred-in-gb-snow-clearance-operation' target='_blank'><strong>Army officer, soldier among three martyred in GB snow clearance operation</strong></a><br><p>

In a post on X today, the FO stated that the pair “deliberated on the recent situation in the region” during the phone call.
This is their second call this week. During the earlier call, the two exchanged views on “the current regional situation and recent developments”.
“The DPM/FM welcomed the Saudi foreign ministry’s statement regarding Yemen and appreciated the efforts of all sides to resolve the regional situation amicably,” the FO stated.







Both nations have a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also signed a landmark mutual defence agreement in September this year, which outlined that an attack on one party would be treated as an attack on both.
Pakistan welcomes call by Yemeni leadership for talks
Meanwhile, the FO issued a statement on Saturday evening expressing Pakistan‘s support for Yemen’s “unity and territorial integrity”.
The statement said that Islamabad welcomed the call by Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council to hold dialogue in Riyadh.
Pakistan also urged all stakeholders in Yemen to “engage in good faith toward a negotiated political solution based on agreed parameters”, added the statement.
“Pakistan reaffirms its steadfast support for the unity and territorial integrity of Yemen.”
The FO expressed Pakistan’s hope that, guided by the principles of unity and brotherhood, regional efforts will contribute to bringing lasting peace and stability in Yemen.







A day earlier, Yemen’s government launched an operation to take back military positions from southern separatists and said it had reclaimed one of the largest military camps in Hadramout province.
The operation in Hadramout marked the latest escalation in Yemen.</p><small>2026-01-03 14:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/031826274b7783d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964880/in-pictures-us-military-conducts-large-scale-strikes-on-venezuela' target='_blank'><strong>In pictures: US military conducts ‘large-scale strikes’ on Venezuela</strong></a><br><p>The US struck Venezuela and captured its long-serving president, Nicolás Maduro, on Saturday, President Donald Trump said, after months of pressuring him over accusations of drug-running and illegitimacy in office.

In an earlier statement, the FO said the foreign minister will be the “first foreign dignitary to visit China in 2026“, at the invitation of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, with whom he is co-chairing the dialogue.
In the X post, the FO said that Dar was received at the airport by China’s Special Representative on Afghanistan, Ambassador Yue Xiaoyong, Pakistan’s Ambassador to China and officials from the Pakistani Embassy.
“DPM/FM will also attend events marking the beginning of the 75th year of Pakistan-China diplomatic ties, with both countries planning initiatives and commemorative activities throughout 2026,” the post added.







The FO has said that the dialogue “will review the full spectrum of bilateral cooperation, identify new areas of partnership, and further advance the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China”.







Earlier this week, the FO had said the dialogue was the “highest consultative mechanism between Pakistan and China, providing a structured platform to review the entire spectrum of bilateral cooperation, as well as regional and international developments of mutual interest”.
It said that during the dialogue, the two foreign ministers will also announce a series of initiatives and commemorative activities to mark the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.







It had added that the visit formed an important part of the regular high-level exchanges between the two countries and reflected their shared determination to broaden and deepen their cooperative partnership, while reaffirming their mutual commitment to regional peace, stability, and sustainable development.
The sixth round of the strategic dialogue was held in Islamabad in August, with Yi visiting the capital and meeting Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Asif Ali Zardari.
At the time, China had affirmed its commitment to working with Pakistan on promoting regional peace, development and stability.</p><small>2026-01-03 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/031318548d8046d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp' target='_blank'><strong>BCCI instructs Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh’s Mustafizur after pressure from BJP</strong></a><br><p>Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders have been told to release fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia said on Saturday, amid growing tensions between the countries.
The development comes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticed Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise, calling Khan a traitor.
Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR had come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus.
Last month, hundreds protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi after Hindu factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
A total of 12 people were arrested in connection with his death.
“Due to recent developments going on all across, the BCCI has instructed the franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad,” Saikia told Indian news agency ANI.
“They can ask for a replacement if needed. And upon request, BCCI will allow a replacement player.”
“BCCI will allow Kolkata Knight Riders a replacement player in line with IPL regulations, and further details will be communicated in due course,” the team added in a statement.
Reuters has approached Mustafizur for comment.
Mustafizur, 30, has played for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals in previous seasons of the IPL, taking 65 wickets in 60 matches.
He was signed by Kolkata in last month’s auction for a fee of 92 million Indian rupees ($1.02 million), making him the most expensive player from Bangladesh in IPL history.
According to the Hindustan Times, opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Som’s criticism of Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise.
While calling Khan a “gaddar” (traitor), former Uttar Pradesh MLA Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”.
The Hindustan Times quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there.
“Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.”
The incident worsened relations between India and its neighbour, with ties already strained after Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to New Delhi following protests against her in 2024.
The 19th edition of the IPL begins on March 26, after India and Sri Lanka co-host the Twenty20 World Cup starting in February.</p><small>2026-01-03 09:46</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642994-india-promoting-terror-in-region-pakistan-rejects-jaishankars-irresponsible-assertion' target='_blank'><strong>'Delhi promoting terror in region': Pakistan rejects India's 'irresponsible' assertion</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the development marked another significant milestone in the advancement of national aerospace and defence capabilities.
“Taimoor air-launched cruise missile is capable of engaging enemy land and sea targets with high precision at a range of 600 kilometres, carrying a conventional warhead,” it said.







“Equipped with state-of-the-art navigation and guidance system, Taimoor is designed to fly at very low altitudes, enabling it to effectively evade hostile air and missile defence systems,” it said.
“Its precision-strike capability significantly enhances the conventional deterrence and operational flexibility of PAF, further strengthening the country’s overall defence posture,” it added.
“The successful flight test underscores the technical maturity, innovation and self-reliance achieved by Pakistan’s defence industry. The launch was witnessed by senior officers of the Pakistan Armed Forces, along with distinguished scientists and engineers who played a pivotal role in the development of this advanced weapon system,” ISPR said.
PAF Chief Air Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu also extended congratulations to the scientists, engineers and PAF team on the achievement, the statement said.
“He lauded their professional excellence, dedication and unwavering commitment to strengthening Pakistan’s defence capabilities,” it added.
The air chief also reaffirmed that such accomplishments “are a testament to the nation’s resolve to achieve technological self-sufficiency and maintain a credible conventional deterrent in the evolving regional security environment”.
“The successful test of the Taimoor weapon system reflects Pakistan Air Force’s continued pursuit of operational readiness, technological superiority and national security objectives,” he was quoted as saying.
President Asif Ali Zardari paid tribute to PAF for the successful test.
“The preparation of modern weapons at the local level is a clear reflection of national capability, resolve, and institutional expertise,” the president was quoted as saying.







The president said that the success of the test has “further strengthened national defence and bolstered Pakistan’s responsible defence policy for ensuring stability in the region“.
He lauded the “hard work, dedication, and spirit of national service of scientists, engineers, and the officers and personnel of the PAF”.
He added that the achievement marked a “significant milestone in Pakistan’s journey toward self-reliance in the arena of national defence”.
“The promotion of modern technology in the defence sector exhibited Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding its security and sovereignty,” the statement added.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also congratulated the PAF for the successful test, stating that the weapon system will “further enhance the country’s defence”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.</p><small>2026-01-03 08:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/03131014d0d0056.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964871/man-killed-2-cops-among-3-injured-in-terrorist-attack-on-police-post-in-bajaur' target='_blank'><strong>Man killed, 2 cops among 3 injured in terrorist attack on police post in Bajaur</strong></a><br><p>BAJAUR: A man was killed while three others, including two cops, were injured after unknown terrorists attacked a police post in Bajaur district’s Barang tehsil in the early hours of Saturday.
Police and local residents said the attack on the police post, located in the hilly Kohi Sar area about 22 kilometres from Khar, the district headquarters, occurred at around 2am.
Israr Khan, the spokesperson for the district police, told Dawn that the deceased was identified as 60-year-old Naseem Gul, a local resident. He added that the injured included two cops, 35-year-old Constable Suliman Khan and 58-year-old Constable Saz Muhammad, and 28-year-old Sahibzada, a school watchman.
He said the injured were taken to the District Headquarter Hospital in Khar for treatment, where their condition was said to be stable.
He said terrorists used both heavy and light weapons in the attack. The police spokesperson said that soon after the attack, a joint team comprising security forces and police reached the area and launched a clearance operation.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to data released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies. As many as 699 terrorist attacks were recorded countrywide during the year.
This violence claimed at least 1,034 lives and left 1,366 injured, underscoring a rising trajectory of militancy that has persisted since the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.</p><small>2026-01-03 08:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/031235465f719e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964861/pakistan-rejects-indian-fm-jaishankars-irresponsible-assertions-following-bad-neighbours-jibe' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan rejects Indian FM Jaishankar’s ‘irresponsible assertions’ following ‘bad neighbours’ jibe</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office (FO) on Saturday rejected the “irresponsible assertions” made by Indian External Affairs Minister Dr S Jaishankar, saying that New Delhi was again seeking to “deflect attention from its own troubling record as a neighbour that promotes terrorism and contributes to regional instability”.
Although the FO statement did not make a specific mention of the remarks by the Indian minister, its rebuke came after Indian media reported Jaishankar as saying on Friday that New Delhi had a right to defend itself against terrorism while talking about “bad neighbours”.
“You can also have bad neighbours … unfortunately, we do. When you have bad neighbours … if you look to the one to the West — if a country decides that they will deliberately, persistently, unrepentantly continue with terrorism, we have a right to defend our people against terrorism,” he was quoted as saying by The Hindu.
He also spoke about the Indus Water Treaty (IWT), which has been a major bone of contention between the two countries following an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22 blamed by India on Pakistan without evidence, saying: “Many years ago we agreed to a water-sharing arrangement — the belief was it was gesture of goodwill — because of good neighbourliness we were doing it … but if you have decades of terrorism there is no good neighbourliness and you don’t get the benefit of good neighbourliness.”
“You can’t say … Please share water with me but I will continue terrorism – that’s not reconcilable,” he was quoted as saying by the publication.
In a statement issued on Saturday, the FO said, “Pakistan firmly rejects the irresponsible assertions made by the Indian external affairs minister. Once again, India seeks to deflect attention from its own troubling record as a neighbour that promotes terrorism and contributes to regional instability.”
The FO said that India’s “documented involvement in promoting terrorist activities in the region, particularly in Pakistan, is well known”.
“The case of Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav remains a stark example of organised, state-sponsored terrorism directed against Pakistan,” it added.
Jadhav was captured in Balochistan in March 2016 and later confessed to his association with the Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing and his involvement in espionage and terrorism in Pakistan. He remains imprisoned in Pakistan.
“Equally concerning are recurring instances of extraterritorial killings, sabotage through proxies, and covert support to terrorist networks. This pattern is consistent with the extremist ideology of Hindutva and its violent proponents,” the FO said.







“India continues its illegal and violent military occupation of Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to extend full political, moral, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their just struggle to realise their right to self-determination, as enshrined in relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” the statement added.
On the topic of the IWT, the FO said that it was an international agreement “concluded in good faith and at considerable cost”.
“Any unilateral violation of the treaty by India would undermine regional stability and call into question its credibility as a state that claims to respect international legal obligations. Pakistan will take all necessary measures to safeguard its legitimate rights under the treaty,” it added.
The development comes after National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday during the funeral of the country’s former premier Khaleda Zia, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.</p><small>2026-01-03 08:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/031020373dfa172.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964854/fresh-talks-on-gaza-stabilisation-force-to-focus-on-mandate-as-pakistan-maintains-caution' target='_blank'><strong>Fresh talks on Gaza stabilisation force to focus on mandate as Pakistan maintains caution</strong></a><br><p>WASHINGTON: A fresh round of diplomatic talks on the formation of a proposed International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in Gaza is expected to be held in a Middle Eastern capital in the coming days, diplomatic sources told Dawn as Muslim countries, including Pakistan, continue to press for clarity on the force’s mandate, operational scope, and political objectives.
The ISF, a central element of a US-brokered Gaza peace plan, is envisioned to stabilise the territory following over two years of Israeli atrocities in the Gaza Strip, protect civilians and humanitarian corridors, and assist in establishing transitional governance through a proposed “Board of Peace”.
However, several core issues remain unresolved, including the force’s legal authority, chain of command, funding, duration, and whether it would play a role in disarming Hamas or other Palestinian groups.
Pakistan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other states have expressed willingness to participate in a stabilisation effort that genuinely restores order and facilitates humanitarian access.
“They are prepared to join any credible international force that brings stability to Gaza,” a diplomatic source said. “But they will not be part of a mission whose primary focus is disarming Palestinian resistance groups.”

 

Hamas has rejected the idea of an international force tasked with disarmament, warning that such a deployment would be considered a party to the conflict rather than a neutral stabilising presence.
This stance complicates efforts to secure broad regional participation and raises concerns about the safety and legitimacy of any deployed troops.
Last month, Reuters reported that international troops could be deployed in the Gaza Strip as early as 2026 to form a UN-authorised stabilisation force.
US signals gratitude, Pakistan remains cautious
Three weeks ago, United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio described Pakistan’s willingness to consider particpating as “key” to the initiative and expressed gratitude for Islamabad’s engagement.
Pakistani officials, however, emphasise that no final decision has been taken yet, and that Islamabad has neither committed troops nor received a formal request.
In December 2025, Pakistan also attended a US Central Command–hosted conference in Qatar, with representatives from nearly 45 countries, where the operational framework of the ISF was discussed.
Reports suggesting Pakistan might deploy up to 3,500 troops remain speculative. Diplomatic sources stressed that any troop commitment would depend on a mandate that is fully transparent, politically neutral, and focused on humanitarian stabilisation rather than disarmament or law enforcement inside Gaza.

Meanwhile, in a press briefing at the Pakistan Embassy in Washington on Friday, Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh framed discussions on the ISF alongside broader Pak–US relations.
He said that 2025 had been a year of positive trends in bilateral ties and that 2026 would be a year where concrete results were expected.
“The opportunities are positive and clear but 2026 will be a critical year for translating these possibilities into practical outcomes across every sector of our bilateral partnership,” he said.

 

The ambassador highlighted economic cooperation in minerals, energy, information technology, health, education, and counterterrorism as areas of particular promise.
Ambassador Sheikh also emphasised Pakistan’s competitive advantages, noting that the country’s production costs were lower than China’s. He drew attention to the skills of Pakistan’s youth, particularly in technology and English-language proficiency, which have earned global recognition.
Highlighting trade relations, he said Pakistan’s goods trade with the US rose 16.3pc in 2025, exports increased by 11.5pc, and services trade grew by 39.7pc.
Remittances from the US also rose by 5.4pc.
He stressed that while these achievements were commendable, sustained effort and institutional coordination would be required to translate potential into tangible results.
“Our partnership with the US is not just a matter of choice or convenience; it is a strategic necessity rooted in geography, economics, population, and shared interests,” the ambassador said.
Strategic and operational considerations
The ISF discussions, combined with Pakistan’s broader engagement with Washington, reflect the delicate balancing act Islamabad faces: supporting humanitarian stabilisation in Gaza while safeguarding Pakistan’s principles on Palestinian sovereignty.
Analysts say that unless a mandate acceptable to all stakeholders is clearly defined, the force may struggle to attract broad participation and could encounter operational and political obstacles on the ground.
Experts also note that the involvement of countries like Pakistan is politically significant.
Islamabad has traditionally played a mediating role in Middle Eastern conflicts, balancing ties with Arab states, the US and the broader Muslim world.
Any misstep in defining the ISF’s role could complicate Pakistan’s regional diplomacy, affect its credibility with partners in the Gulf, and influence its perception among Palestinians.
The coming meetings will be closely watched by both regional actors and Washington, as they may determine the pace at which the ISF is deployed.
While humanitarian objectives remain central, the debates over mandate, command, and responsibilities illustrate the inherent complexity of deploying a multinational stabilisation force in a highly contested environment.
Israel has banned 37 foreign humanitarian organizations from accessing the Gaza Strip after they had refused to share lists of their Palestinian employees with government officials, a move that the United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said will “further exacerbate the humanitarian crisis facing Palestinians”.
It is worth mentioning that eight Muslim-majority countries, including Pakistan, have expressed concern over the deteriorating humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip, saying that severe winter weather has further worsened conditions and stressing the need to immediately initiate and scale up early recovery efforts.
In a joint statement, Pakistan, Egypt, Qatar, Indonesia, Jordan, Turkiye, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates — which had also worked with US President Donald Trump’s administration last year on a plan to end Israel’s genocide and invasion in Gaza — have demanded that Israel ensure the UN and international NGOs can operate in Gaza and the West Bank in a sustained, predictable and unrestricted manner, given their integral role in the humanitarian response in the Strip.

The father-and-son gunmen are alleged to have carried out the attack at a Hanukkah event at the famed Bondi Beach on December 14. Australia’s worst mass shooting in almost three decades shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country.
The massacre has sparked more active policing in Sydney, Australia’s most populous city and the capital of New South Wales state.
Authorities on Saturday announced a “high-visibility” police presence for the marquee cricket series between Australia and England, which is held every two years.
Measures at the cricket ground, some 5km from Bondi Beach, would include the riot patrol unit, officers on horseback and officers carrying rifles.
“The difference will be in the visibility of long arms and a stronger presence,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said in a statement.
Police said they expected a capacity crowd for day one of the fixture, the final encounter in the five-match series already claimed by Australia.
“Many people may not be used to seeing police carrying rifles at sporting events, but our objective here is to help the public feel safe,” Lanyon said.
Cricket Australia said first responders to the attack and “community members who bravely acted” would be honoured before the start of play on Sunday.
There will be a guard of honour on the field and a round of applause for “emergency response agencies and members of the community in the face of extreme danger”, the governing body said in a statement.
On Wednesday, around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during New Year celebrations, which typically attract over a million revellers.
Several New Year events planned at Bondi were cancelled, while traditional Christmas celebrations there were muted, following the attack that authorities believe was inspired by Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State.</p><small>2026-01-03 07:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642955-kp-cm-sohail-afridi-signals-readiness-to-hold-talks-with-establishment-on-provincial-issues' target='_blank'><strong>KP CM Sohail Afridi signals readiness to hold talks with establishment on provincial issues</strong></a><br><p>
