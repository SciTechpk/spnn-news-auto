Imran, imprisoned since Aug 5, 2023 in a case related to state gifts, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials in alleged terrorism cases related to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Imran had issued a nationwide protest call, which was set to reach its “peak” today to mark the second year of his incarceration. According to PTI leader Asad Qaiser, August 5 is the inception of the protest, but it should not be considered a “final call”.
“An elder like Rehana Dar is being dragged by the shameless Punjab Police, a disgraceful sight,” the PTI said on its official X account.
It shared a video showing Dar, who contested the 2024 general elections in Sialkot against PML-N’s Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, being dragged into a police van by personnel with riot gear.
The PTI said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Punjab Inspector General Dr Usman Anwar “have sunk to a new low with this act” and “abandoned all sense of shame and decency”.
 






Reuters pictures also showed at least two other individuals being detained in Lahore.
Qaiser yesterday said raids had begun in Punjab and Kashmir, while PTI Punjab media cell head Shayan Bashir claimed that the police carried out some 200 raids and picked up party workers, who were released after allegedly submitting affidavits.
The party’s district chapters also alleged police actions against its workers and supporters who had gathered to hold protests.
The PTI in Bahawalpur claimed on X that “several” of its workers who had gathered in Balochistan’s Kohlu district for a protest were arrested.
Purported pictures of the incident shared by the party showed workers making a victory pose as they entered a police van, with cops equipped with batons.
 






The PTI’s Multan chapter alleged that its Lahore rally was “attacked by police”, with multiple vehicles participating in it facing damage. Visuals shared by it showed the back window of a car shattered with a hole in it.
 






Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur is expected to attend a rally in Peshawar, according to a video showing a container for that gathering.
Meanwhile, the opposition party shared a video of its convoy departing from Peshawar for Swabi.

Pakistan is observing Youm-i-Istehsal (Exploitation Day) today to mark the sixth anniversary of India revoking Kashmir’s special autonomy and to show solidarity with Kashmiris.
On Aug 5, 2019, India’s Narendra Modi-led government stripped the Muslim-majority territory of its special status by repealing Article 370 of the constitution, splitting the former state into two territories directly ruled by New Delhi.
“India’s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir remained the defining conflict of the South Asia region, and the driver of India’s continued rogue behaviour,” PM Shehbaz said in a statement.
 


The premier also recalled the recent India-Pakistan conflict, noting: “India’s unprovoked aggression against Pakistan in May 2025, and its swift and comprehensive military defeat are only the latest evidence of the urgent need for the international community to ensure that the resolution of the Kashmir dispute becomes a global priority.
“The will and aspirations of the Kashmiri people, in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions, are the only path forward,” he stressed.
PM Shehbaz noted that a “just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was a key pillar of Pakistan’s foreign policy”.
The prime minister reiterated “strongest condemnation” of India’s illegal and unilateral actions to alter the demographic structure and political landscape of India-occupied Kashmir (IoK).
 
 

He also flayed India’s efforts to silence genuine Kashmiri leaders as part of the “wider hegemonic and extremist agenda” that informed its illegal occupation of the disputed region.
“The imprisonment of Kashmiri leaders and activists, including Shabbir Ahmed Shah, Muhammad Yasin Malik and Masarrat Alam Bhatt, will never dim the resolve of our Kashmiri sisters and brothers,” he asserted.
Urging the international community to play a role in halting human rights crimes in IoK and reversing the 2019 action, the premier reaffirmed Pakistan’s “unflinching” stance, moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people.
Meanwhile, in his statement, President Asif Ali Zardari also referred to the recent conflict with India, emphasising that “this year’s ‘Youm-e-Istehsal’ assumes greater significance”.
“While the resounding success of the ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ is a matter of great pride for the people of Pakistan, the day also underscores the need for a settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people, for a lasting peace in South Asia,” the president said.
 






He highlighted that Indian authorities had taken a number of steps, aimed at changing the IoK’s demographic structure and political landscape, during the last six years.
“These measures include gerrymandering of the electoral constituencies, allowing addition of non-Kashmiris to electoral rolls, issuance of domicile certificates to outsiders, granting more powers to the lieutenant governor in administrative matters, and introduction of new laws on ownership of land and property,” he noted.
“The Kashmiri people are confronted with the danger of becoming a disempowered community in their own land. The genuine leadership of the Kashmiri people remains behind bars. The intimidation of innocent people, arbitrary detentions, and the so-called ‘cordon and search’ operations have become a matter of routine,” Zardari said.
To mark Youm-i-Istehsal, a rally was taken out from Parliament House to D-Chowk in Islamabad to express solidarity with Kashmiris.
 






Special walks and events are being held across all four provinces, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan. A one-minute silence was also observed at 10am to express solidarity with Kashmiris, Radio Pakistan reported.
Pakistani missions abroad were also set to organise special events in connection with Youm-i-Istehsal.
Dar condemns reports of India planning to maintain held Kashmir as union territory
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar underscored that Kashmir was an internationally recognised dispute, and its future cannot be determined through internal legislation or court rulings, Radio Pakistan reported.
Addressing the rally in Islamabad, Dar expressed concern over media reports suggesting that Indian authorities are attempting to grant statehood to Jammu while retaining the Kashmir Valley as a union territory.
He condemned such moves as “unacceptable and provocative”.
India’s top court is also set to hear a petition tomorrow that seeks directives to the federal government to restore the statehood of the Union territory of Jammu and Kashmir, Hindustan Times reported, citing Live Law.
 


The foreign minister reaffirmed Islamabad’s desire for friendly relations with all neighbouring countries and its preference for dialogue and diplomacy over confrontation.
However, he warned that Pakistan’s armed forces and its people were “fully capable of delivering a resolute response to any act of aggression, as demonstrated” during the May conflict.
Addressing the rally, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar noted that the bonds between Kashmiris and Pakistan were “eternal which can never be broken by any Indian conspiracy”.
Recalling that bodies of Kashmiri icons, such as Burhan Wani, were wrapped in the “colour of Pakistan’s flag, which was a manifestation of Kashmiris love and affection for Pakistan”.
Also mentioning the India-Pakistan conflict, Tarar asserted that the “victory in Marka-i-Haq has boosted the morale of Kashmiri masses”.
NA passes resolution condemning ‘all forms of Indian state violence’
In its session today, the National Assembly passed a unanimous resolution, condemning “all forms of Indian state violence and coercive tactics aimed at erasing the identity, culture, and political aspirations of the Kashmiri people, which have failed and will continue to fail”.
The lower house of the parliament reiterated that “Pakistan will never compromise on the right of the Kashmiri people to self-determination as guaranteed under international law and UN resolutions”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The resolution was moved by Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam in Urdu and by PPP MNA Shazia Marri in English.
 


The resolution stressed that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was “not an internal matter of India but a global issue requiring a just resolution in accordance with UNSC resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people”.
It called upon the global community to “stand for justice, not silence, in the face of Indian oppression and human rights abuses” in IoK.  The NA declared that “from Srinagar to Islamabad, the heart beats as one for the freedom and dignity of Kashmir”, Radio Pakistan added.
The NA affirmed that Pakistan’s moral, political and diplomatic support for the Kashmiri people remained “unshakable and enduring”, and committed to continue raising the Kashmir issue at every regional and international forum.
The House demanded the immediate implementation of all relevant UNSC resolutions, which call for a free and impartial plebiscite.
India’s repressive actions only perpetuate human suffering: ISPR
The armed forces also emphasised that it was “unequivocally evident that durable peace in South Asia remains unattainable without the just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”.
In a press release, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu and the armed forces reaffirmed their “unwavering solidarity with the resilient and courageous people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK)”.
“India’s repressive actions, coupled with its belligerent posture and incendiary rhetoric, serve only to exacerbate regional instability and perpetuate human suffering,” the ISPR noted.
 






It added: “The armed forces of Pakistan fully support the legitimate and ongoing struggle of the Kashmiri people for their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in international law and UN Security Council resolutions.
“The continued illegal occupation of IIOJK by Indian security forces — characterised by an unrelenting military siege, systemic human rights violations, and demographic engineering — constitutes a grave breach of international norms and remains a matter of deep concern.
The armed forces “pay solemn tribute to the martyrs of IIOJK and reiterate their enduring commitment to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Kashmiri people in their just and rightful struggle for freedom”.

Around 10,000 lightning flashes lit up Hong Kong’s skies between 6am (3am PKT) and 6:59am, according to the city’s weather authorities, as up to 90 millimetres of rain per hour continued to drench the city and neighbouring Guangdong province.
Videos showed torrents of water cascading down steep hillsides in the former British colony, breaking into white-water streams as they rushed down staircases linking Hong Kong’s multi-tiered cityscape.
The deluge prompted the weather bureau to extend its highest “black” rainstorm warning until 3pm.
 


The water had risen to ankle-height outside Hong Kong’s largest hospital, as medical authorities announced they would be closing clinics across the city due to the downpour.
Extreme rainfall and catastrophic flooding, which meteorologists link to climate change, pose mounting challenges for officials in mainland China, sweeping people to their deaths, displacing thousands, and threatening billions of dollars in economic losses.
The storms follow deadly flash floods in Southern China over the weekend, which left five dead in Guangdong province and prompted a large-scale search operation involving over 1,300 rescuers.
As of Tuesday morning, four rivers in the province had risen to such a height that were at risk of bursting their banks, China’s state broadcaster CCTV reported.
Hong Kong, Guangdong Province, and Macau — which issued a Red rain warning — form the backbone of Chinese President Xi Jinping’s flagship Greater Bay Area initiative, aimed at fusing Hong Kong’s financial firepower with Guangdong’s manufacturing and technological strength.
Airports across the region reported cancellation rates of around 20 per cent on Tuesday, according to data from Flightmaster, while speed limits on the Hong Kong-Zhuhai Macau Bridge — a flagship GBA infrastructure project — were lowered due to poor visibility.
Hong Kong’s airport has maintained normal operations throughout but said some flights had been delayed and passengers were advised to head to the airport only after their flight time was confirmed.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange remains open, having changed its policy to continue trading whatever the weather late last year, but the judiciary announced that courts, tribunals and register offices would remain shut until at least two hours after the ‘black’ rainstorm alert was cancelled.
“Persistent rainstorm will cause serious road flooding and traffic congestion. Members of the public are advised to take shelter in a safe place,” the Hong Kong Observatory said in a bulletin on its website.
Hong Kong typically receives an annual average of 2,200mm of rainfall, more than half of which usually falls from June through August.
But it is not all doom and gloom.
Hong Kong Disneyland announced it remains open, and its daily “Friendtastic! Parade” is still scheduled to take place later today, according to the park’s website.</p><small>2025-08-05 09:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05122034614720a.png?r=122401' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928877/pakistan-uk-strengthen-alliance-with-fresh-defence-and-trade-focus' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, UK strengthen alliance with fresh defence and trade focus</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan and the United Kingdom have pledged to deepen their partnership across key sectors, with a renewed focus on defence cooperation and strategic dialogue, during high-level talks in Rawalpindi on Monday, according to a statement by Press Information Department (PID).
Pakistan and UK have been engaged in Enhanced Strategic Dialogue (ESD) since 2011, which has deepened and broadened the dialogue between the two countries, covering areas such as trade, economic growth and development, cultural cooperation, security, and education.
The consensus was reached during a meeting between Minister for Defence Production Muhammad Raza Hayat Harraj and British High Commissioner Jane Marriott in Rawalpindi.
“Pakistan considers the United Kingdom a close friend and a genuine development partner,” Minister Harraj said, according to the statement.
“Frequent interaction has been useful in coordinating our approaches to various bilateral, regional and international issues. The two sides agreed to enhance cooperation in all fields, including defence,” the minister was further quoted as saying.
Harraj also expressed hope that UK-Pakistan bilateral relations will continue to evolve on principles of mutual respect, shared common interest and understanding each other’s perspectives, as per the statement.
“The British High Commissioner expressed her commitment to strengthening the UK-Pakistan relationship and working with Pakistan on shared priorities, including bilateral trade and defence production,” it added.
In July, the two countries formally signed the Trade Dialogue Mechanism Agreement and announced the establishment of the UK-Pakistan Business Advisory Council to institutionalise bilateral economic cooperation.
The Senate Chairman Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani has also previously stated that Pakistan greatly values its long-standing, close, and enduring relationship with the United Kingdom, built on shared history, values, and traditions.</p><small>2025-08-05 08:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05131622cee3fee.jpg?r=133311' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928883/weak-indian-rupee-may-blunt-us-tariff-bite-say-economists' target='_blank'><strong>Weak Indian rupee may blunt US tariff bite, say economists</strong></a><br><p>The Indian rupee’s recent slide may help soften the blow from higher US tariffs, economists said, with trade tensions between New Delhi and Washington intensifying under President Donald Trump.
The Indian rupee dropped to 87.8850 per US dollar on Tuesday, nearing its all-time low of 87.95 hit in February. Bankers said the currency would probably have breached the 88 mark if not for likely intervention by the Reserve Bank of India via state-run banks.
The Indian rupee is the worst-performing major Asian currency so far this year. While peers such as the Taiwanese dollar, South Korean won, Singapore dollar and Thai baht have appreciated between 6 per cent and 10pc, the rupee has declined by 2.5pc against the dollar.
The steeper US tariffs imposed on India last week, compared to other Asian countries — along with Trump’s threat of further penalties — are seen keeping the Indian rupee under pressure.
Against a basket of Asian currencies, many of which compete with India in export markets, the rupee has declined 3.9pc since April 1, according to HDFC Bank.
This depreciation provides India a competitive price advantage over trading partners, potentially offsetting at least some part of the impact of higher US tariffs, economists say. India currently faces US tariffs that are about 5-6 percentage points higher than those levied on most other major economies, HDFC Bank said.
“In cases where US consumers try to renegotiate contracts and ask for cost-sharing of tariff burdens, the rupee’s depreciation could provide a meaningful cushion,” said Sakshi Gupta, principal economist at HDFC Bank.
The bank estimates that a sustained 1pc decline in the rupee could offset 2–3 basis points of the drag on GDP growth from higher US tariffs.
“From a structural perspective, it would be helpful if India maintained a competitive real effective exchange rate,” said Dhiraj Nim, forex and rates strategist at ANZ.
Nim noted that most studies show Indian exports are sensitive to real effective exchange.
India’s real effective exchange rate, as per the Reserve Bank of India’s July bulletin, stood at 100.36 in June, suggesting the rupee was broadly fairly valued. In contrast, the rate had touched 108.14 last November, indicating the currency was about 8pc overvalued at the time.
Faced with low domestic inflation and uncertainty over the impact of US tariffs, economists expect the RBI may prefer a weaker rupee over a fairly or over-valued one.</p><small>2025-08-05 08:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/617409-death-of-a-delta-pakistans-indus-sinks-and-shrinks' target='_blank'><strong>Death of a delta: Pakistan's Indus sinks and shrinks</strong></a><br><p>

• Dr Anita Zaidi says vaccine will initially be given to 9 to 11-year-olds, later offered to older girls
• Govt and private sector must work together, as even the richest cannot go it alone, says Bill Gates
KARACHI: Cervical cancer vaccines will be rolled out in Pakistan from September, a top official from the Gates Foundation told Dawn on Monday.
Pakistan has a population of 73.8 million women aged 15 years and older who are at risk of developing cervical cancer, as per a factsheet by the HPV Information Centre.
Cervical cancer is the second most frequent cancer among women between 15 and 44 years of age. But with a single dose of HPV (Human Papillomavirus) vaccine, females would be immune for life.
 


According to Dr Anita Zaidi, president of the foundation’s Gender Equality Division, the vaccine will be given to nine to 11-year-old girls, as part of initial outreach campaigns, and can eventually be offered to older girls.
Since screening for cervical cancer is limited in Pakistan, prevention is the best tool in this case, she said.
 
 

This initiative is separate from the Gates Foundation’s $2.5 billion global commitment through 2030 to transform women’s health across every stage of life.
Announced on Monday, the pledge will support 40 innovations in five critical, chronically underfunded areas — particularly those affecting women in low- and middle-income countries.
 
 

“Investing in women’s health has a lasting impact across generations. It leads to healthier families, stronger economies, and a more just world,” Bill Gates, chair of the Gates Foundation, said at the launch event.
“Yet women’s health continues to be ignored, underfunded, and sidelined. Too many women still die from preventable causes or live in poor health. That must change. But we can’t do it alone,” he said.
Research shows that for every $1 invested in women’s health, it generates $3 in economic growth. Closing the gender health gap could boost the global economy by $1 trillion per year by 2040.
Despite clear economic returns and the biological fact that women are necessary for the survival of our species, research and development spending on female health is severely limited.
According to a 2001 analysis by McKinsey & Co, only one per cent of research and innovation is carried out into female-specific conditions, beyond cancer.
‘Can’t do it alone’
Examples for innovations that could particularly impact women in low-income countries are six-month injectable contraceptives that can be taken discreetly, particularly important in countries like Pakistan, where even slogans for body autonomy are reviled.
The Gates Foundation has worked in Pakistan for years, collaborating with institutions like Aga Khan University and the Lahore University of Management Sciences to support locally grounded innovations — from gut health to AI applications in women’s care.
But as the tech billionaire points out, even the richest in the world can’t do it alone. The government and private sector have to work together to co-invest in women’s health innovations – a tall order in a country where mothers can justify so-called ‘honour killings’ of their daughters.
When life is being denied, it is easy to think of nutrition as a rather trivial matter.
“When I was practising in Pakistan, I would see malnourished children with various health issues,” recalled Dr Zaidi, who has previously worked at Aga Khan University.
“I would advise mothers to breastfeed properly, but their own health was so compromised, they had little to give.”
Without addressing the mother’s health, we cannot address children’s health, she said. The neglect doled out to women has led Pakistan’s newborn mortality rate to be among the highest in the world, with one out of 25 babies dying in the first month of life.
Though many aspects of women’s health need to be addressed, Dr Zaidi says that if there is only one area that could be focused on, it would be health during pregnancy.
The gut health of pregnant women is vitally important because it is deeply connected to malnutrition.
A lack of food, appropriate calories, and vitamins, combined with a living environment that exposes individuals to numerous infections, leads to an inflamed gut and poor health. When women in poor health get pregnant, they deliver unhealthy babies, and the cycle continues, creating a transgenerational issue.
Pakistan will not prosper without recognising that women’s development has to be central to the country’s development, Dr Zaidi says. Ultimately, however, through civil society, policy making and implementation, it is up to Pakistanis to change the reality that women face.

Zelensky claimed on Monday that his troops in northeastern Ukraine were fighting foreign “mercenaries” from various countries, including China, Pakistan and parts of Africa.
A statement by the FO today said Pakistan “categorically rejects the baseless and unfounded allegations of the involvement of Pakistani nationals in the conflict in Ukraine”.
“To date, Pakistan has not been formally approached by the Ukrainian authorities, nor has any verifiable evidence been presented to substantiate such claims.”
The statement added that the government would take up this matter with the Ukrainian authorities, “and seek clarification in this regard”.
“Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to the peaceful resolution of the Ukraine conflict through dialogue and diplomacy, in accordance with the principles of the UN Charter,” the statement said.
 






In a post on X on Monday, Zelensky said: “We spoke with commanders about the frontline situation, the defence of Vovchansk, and the dynamics of the battles.
“Our warriors in this sector are reporting the participation of mercenaries from China, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and African countries in the war. We will respond.”
 






The Russia-Ukraine war began when President Vladimir Putin ordered the latter’s invasion on Feb 24, 2022.
The government has on separate occasions rebuffed allegations that the country was providing arms to Ukraine.
During a visit to Pakistan in July 2023, then-Ukra­inian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba had rejected similar reports, clarifying that the two nations had no deals for the supply of arms and ammunition.
Initially taking a neutral stance on the matter and maintaining that in its diplomatic moves till last year, Pakistan has called for de-escalation and ceasefire in recent months as the war crossed the three-year mark.
Pakistan has historically maintained good relations with Ukraine, having purchased weapons systems from it in the past, but has also been strengthening ties with Russia in recent years.</p><small>2025-08-05 06:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/05114648be694ee.png?r=115203' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928869/thousands-to-join-bangladesh-rallies-concerts-a-year-after-hasinas-ouster' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands to join Bangladesh rallies, concerts a year after Hasina’s ouster</strong></a><br><p>Thousands of people are expected to pour into Bangladesh’s capital of Dhaka on Tuesday for the first anniversary of deadly protests that ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to attend rallies, concerts and prayer sessions.
The events will culminate in a declaration touted as a roadmap for democratic reform in the political journey from an uprising sparked by economic woes and repression to rule by an interim government led by Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus.
“Together, we will build a Bangladesh where tyranny will never rise again,” Yunus said in a message to the nation a year after protests forced Hasina to flee to neighbouring India, as he paid tribute to those who sacrificed their lives.
A peaceful, fair, and transparent election could be held early next year, Yunus said, pledging a return to full democratic rule at a time of mounting pressure for a swifter transition amid growing labour unrest.
“Fallen autocrats and their self-serving allies remain active,” however, he added, urging unity to protect the gains of the uprising while his government holds reform talks with political parties and civil society.
His interim government had launched sweeping reforms, he added, while trials for those responsible for the “July killings” were progressing swiftly.
 
 

Police were on high alert throughout the capital, with armoured vehicles patrolling the streets to deter any attempt by Hasina’s banned Awami League to disrupt the day’s events.
“Let this anniversary not be a day of retrospection, but a rallying cry for a brighter tomorrow,” Hasina said in an open letter to the people of Bangladesh, adding that she had never resigned from her duties as prime minister.
“Bangladesh has overcome adversity before, and we will rise again, stronger, more united, and more determined to build a democracy that truly serves its people.”
The July Declaration, to be announced later in the day by Yunus, will formally recognise the 2024 student-led uprising and the shift away from authoritarian rule to democratic renewal.
Despite some opposition, it is backed by major political groups, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by former premier Khaleda Zia.
Supporters see the charter as a foundation for institutional reform; critics have warned its impact could be largely symbolic in the absence of a legal framework or parliamentary consensus.</p><small>2025-08-05 06:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/051110217aa7873.jpg?r=111304' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928741/cda-blames-typo-for-rs47m-tender-for-ministers-house' target='_blank'><strong>CDA blames typo for Rs47m tender for minister’s house</strong></a><br><p>ISLAMABAD: After facing public criticism over a tender worth over Rs47 million for the repair and maintenance of a federal minister’s official residence, city managers clarified on Monday that there was a typographical error.
The CDA on Saturday had floated the tender worth Rs 47.3 million for “repair and maintenance of house No 36 at Minister Enclave, Islamabad,” and called for bids from registered firms.
There was uproar on social media on Sunday, as people criticised the civic agency for its plan to spend such a huge amount on the official residence of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi.
However, the CDA on Monday came up with a statement saying the tender was originally meant for eight houses in the Minister Enclave, not one. The CDA also issued a corrigendum with an amendment to the tender on Monday edition of newspapers, removing the name of house No 36 and replacing it with eight houses.
 
 

When contacted, a CDA spokesperson stated: “It was a routine matter which was meant for maintenance of 8 houses at the cost of 47 million but there was a typo error in the advertisement published on August 2. The typo error was immediately rectified by the CDA itself and a corrigendum was issued the very next day.”
However, an official source expressed surprise at the CDA’s explanation, pointing out the significant discrepancy between mentioning house No 36 and listing eight separate houses.
“If this was a typo error, a proper inquiry should be conducted to fix the responsibility for such a blunder,” he said.

According to a press release issued by the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE), Mohammad Aneeq, Ghulam Junaid, Mohammad Saram and Ahmed Imran Malik secured bronze medals for the nation.
“Among 86 participating countries, Pakistan proudly ranked 32nd, outperforming many technologically advanced and developed nations, including Germany, Austria, Turkey, France, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, Finland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Saudi Arabia,” said the press release.
Last year, the Pakistani team had secured two bronze medals and the overall ranking was 46th.
“This brilliant performance of the Pakistan team is a testament to the transparent and merit-based selection process carried out by FBISE, and it reflects the immense potential and talent of Pakistan’s youth. It marks a significant step forward in promoting excellence in computer science and informatics within the country.”
It said: “FBISE extends its heartfelt congratulations to the students, their families, coaches and partner institutions for this remarkable success, which brings pride and honour to the entire nation.”
 
 

The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training had entrusted FBISE with organising Pakistan’s participation in the International Olympiad in Informatics each year. In response, FBISE issued official notifications to all educational boards across the country, including the Inter Boards Coordination Committee (IBCC), to encourage students from all streams, including those from the Cambridge stream.
The same notice was also sent to the directorates of education and FBISE-affiliated institutions. As a result, a total of 528 students nationwide registered for the POI.
Additionally, FBISE conducted two rigorous rounds of nationwide testing to identify and select the most outstanding young programmers. The first round of POI was held across 12 examination centres countrywide. Based on these results, 25 students were shortlisted for the second round, which led to the final selection of four students.

Bolsonaro is on trial at the Supreme Court for allegedly plotting to cling onto power after losing 2022 elections to President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
President Donald Trump has sought to punish Brazil, a longtime US ally, for what he sees as a politically motivated “witch hunt” targeting Bolsonaro by imposing eye-watering tariffs on Latin America’s biggest economy.
The 70-year-old Bolsonaro is banned from social media for the duration of the proceedings, and third parties are barred from sharing his public remarks.
But on Sunday, his allies defied the order by sharing footage online of a call between the former army captain and his eldest son Flavio at a solidarity rally in Rio de Janeiro.
Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes reacted furiously, declaring that the judiciary would not allow a defendant to “treat it like a fool” because of his “political and economic power.”
Criticising Bolsonaro’s “repeated failure” to comply with the court’s restrictions on him during the trial, he placed him under house arrest at his home in the capital Brasilia.
He also barred the country’s former leader (2019-2022) from receiving visitors, apart from his lawyers, and from using mobile phones, and warned that any new transgression would lead to him being detained.
Several mobile phones were seized at his home on Monday, the police said.
Washington condemned the new restrictions on Monday night, with the State Department’s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs issuing a statement on X.
“Minister Alexandre de Moraes, already sanctioned by the United States for human rights violations, continues to use Brazilian institutions to silence the opposition and threaten democracy,” the bureau posted. “Let Bolsonaro speak!”
 






US officials added that they would “hold accountable all those who collaborate with or facilitate sanctioned conduct.”
The US post was re-shared by Bolsonaro’s politician son Eduardo Bolsonaro, who had successfully lobbied Washington to take punitive action against Brazil over the case.
In a separate post, he wrote: “Brazil is no longer a democracy.”
He called Moraes, who is presiding over Bolsonaro’s trial and has styled himself a defender of Brazilian democracy in the face of the far right, an “out-of-control psychopath.”
Last month, Moraes ordered Bolsonaro to wear an ankle bracelet and instituted the social media ban.
Trump responded in unprecedented fashion by banning Moraes from the United States and freezing his assets in US banks.
‘Thank you Trump’
Trump’s pressure campaign has angered many Brazilians but endeared him to Bolsonaro’s conservative base.
At rallies in Rio, Brasilia and Sao Paulo on Sunday, some demonstrators waved US flags or held signs reading “Thank you Trump.”
Bolsonaro himself did not attend the rallies, having been ordered by the Supreme Court to stay home at night and at weekends throughout the trial.
Prosecutors say he and seven co-accused tried to overturn his 2022 election defeat in a plot that only failed because the military did not get on board.
He faces a 40-year sentence if convicted at the trial, which is expected to wrap up in the coming weeks.
Bolsonaro’s supporters stormed Brazil’s congress in January 2023, after Lula was inaugurated, ransacking the chambers and attacking police, in scenes reminiscent of an attack by Trump supporters on the US Capitol two years before.
Despite being barred from running, Bolsonaro hopes to mount a Trump-style comeback in Brazil’s 2026 presidential election.
Lula, 79, has said he may seek a fourth term, health permitting.
Last year, he was hospitalised for a brain hemorrhage caused by a bathroom fall.</p><small>2025-08-05 05:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/051042440387215.jpg?r=104253' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1928775/weather-pundits-warn-of-heaviest-rain-spell-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Weather pundits warn of heaviest rain spell in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), Punjab and the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday warned that a spell of heavy torrential rains will begin on Aug 5 (today), persisting till August 7, warning of urban flooding in some cities.
Officials warn that urban flooding is feared in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Islamabad over the next 72 hours.
According to the PDMA fact sheet, heavy rains have already claimed 163 lives so far this season, besides leaving 579 people injured and 215 homes damaged across Punjab.
The PDMA also predicted moderate to high-level flooding in the Chenab and Jhelum rivers from August 5, with thunderstorms expected in upper catchment areas.
PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia placed all emergency centres on high alert, stating, “Our field teams are monitoring the situation 24/7, especially in vulnerable areas like Murree where landslides remain a serious threat.”
Meanwhile, the current rains and floods have filled the Tarbela Dam up to 91 percent of its full capacity and the Mangla Dam to 60pc, while major rivers currently show normal flow levels, say officials.
 
 

Residents in low-lying areas of 19 districts, including Faisalabad, Sialkot and Bahawalpur, have been advised to move to safer locations.
The PDMA has activated its emergency helpline 1129 and deployed special teams to prevent water accumulation in vulnerable cities.
Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has ordered immediate financial assistance for affected families as the province braces for what meteorologists predict could be the heaviest rainfall of this monsoon season.
The PDMA urged people to keep children away from storm drains and waterways. “One moment of carelessness can cost lives in these conditions,” it cautions.

“The body of a man, who was swept away by a glacier over 28 years ago, has been found by locals after the massive glacier melted in recent days,” district police officer Amjad Hussain told reporters on Monday.
According to locals, the deceased, identified as Naseerudden, was buried under the glacier along with his horse while returning from Allai area of Battagram. 
They said the man was associated with cattle trade. His body was found intact and still recognisable, and his national identity card was also recovered from his clothing.
“A group of visitors spotted the body and informed nearby villagers, who buried it at a local site and later informed the bereaved family,” DPO Hussain said.
He said Naseerudden had left behind a daughter and a son, who were still alive and currently residing in the Allai area of Battagram. 
“The rumours are circulating that the man was murdered, but these are entirely baseless. His brother survived the tragedy,” Mr Hussain clarified.
“At the time of the incident, the family and residents even attempted to search 150 feet deep into the glacier but were unsuccessful,” a resident said. “Now, the body would be shifted to our native village in Koz Shayar, Gohir Abad, for formal burial.”

They, however, opposed any military offensive and forced displacement in the region for the sake of peace.
The elders gathered in a “consultative jirga” on the law and order situation in the province here with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur in the chair.
This is the second such gathering, held in line with the declaration of the July 24 multi-party conference.

CM chairs jirga on law and order

The first jirga, also presided over by the chief minister, was held on August 2 with elders from Orakzai and Khyber districts, Darra Adamkhel tehsil of Kohat district and subdivision Hassankhel of Peshawar district, at the Chief Minister’s House here. The participants opposed any military operation and forced displacement in the region.
They wondered if authorities would promise in writing that the military operation would eradicate terrorism from the region forever and that there would be no such action in the future.
 
 

Monday’s gathering was attended by adviser to the chief minister Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, Senator Noorul Haq Qadri, the chief secretary, police chief, the relevant commissioners, deputy commissioners and senior police officials, according to an official statement from the Chief Minister’s Secretariat.
The participants thoroughly discussed the law and order situation in Bajaur and Mohmand tribal districts and made several recommendations.
The participants expressed their commitment to peace, saying they want peace, so the government should ensure it.
They said that they’re ready to fully cooperate with authorities for the elimination of terrorism, which was the enemy of all.
The participants opposed military operations or forced displacement, saying such actions are unacceptable.
They recommended the formation of a broad-based and empowered jirga, comprising representatives from the federal and provincial governments, tribal elders and all key stakeholders, to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Afghan government and people to ensure the long-term eradication of terrorism in the region.
The participants said that the initiative of local jirgas was a positive step and called for it to be made more effective so that its outcomes could benefit other regions as well.
The chief minister reportedly asked them about the options available for restoration of peace other than military operations against terrorism.

The treasury members, including two ministers, reminded the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmakers as to how the top leadership of the PML-N was cruelly put behind bars during the last government under Imran Khan when the latter lashed out at the government over their ongoing “political victimisation”.
The house witnessed rumpus on a couple of occasions due to sloganeering by the PTI members during the speeches of Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar when they justified the recent court convictions of the top PTI leadership in the May 9 rioting case.
The PTI members entered the assembly hall carrying the portraits of Imran Khan and all those leaders who were recently convicted by an anti-terrorism court over their alleged involvement in the rioting incidents in which a number of military installations were attacked in May 2023 after Mr Khan’s arrest.
At the outset, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq announced that as per past tradition they would not transact any business and would only pay tributes to late MNA Mian Azhar, who died in Lahore on July 22.
While paying tributes to late MNA, PTI’s Ali Muhammad Khan and Sardar Latif Khosa criticised the government over the recent conviction of their top leaders, including parliamentarians, and alleged that due to ongoing crackdown on the opposition, Hammad Azhar, the son of late Mian Azhar, could not properly attend the funeral of his father.
Ali Muhammad Khan described the conviction of opposition leaders in both houses of the parliament Omar Ayub Khan and Shibli Faraz as ‘a mourning day for the democracy’. He regretted that Hammad Azhar could not meet his father during his last days. He said ex-premiers Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif also went through a similar situation in the past and questioned as to how long politicians would face such things.
Mr Khan also declared that his party would go ahead with their planned countrywide protests on Tuesday (today) for the release of the incarcerated party founder.
Taking the floor, Mr Khosa asked, “Do you want to murder democracy?” He informed the lawmakers about the brief participation of Hammad Azhar in the funeral fearing his arrest in fake cases. Mr Khosa asked the government to withdraw cases against Hammad Azhar or admit that someone else was ruling the country. He regretted that on one hand, the treasury members were visiting the residence of late MNA to offer condolences and on the other hand, they were bent upon “victimising” his son.
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the PTI leaders had been convicted in the May 9 cases as per the law. He advised the opposition members to approach courts if they had objection to the decisions. He recalled that the court had not allowed former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to attend his mother’s funeral despite repeated requests. He said at that time the judge had stated he could not do so because of the orders from “high-ups.”
Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said the PTI had always rejected the talks offer from Shehbaz Sharif when he was in the opposition as well as in power. He also highlighted the alleged victimisation of PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah during the PTI’s government.
The National Assembly will meet again on Tuesday (today) at 11am.

“We request a suo motu action be taken and this matter may urgently be referred to the three-judge committee or this letter be treated as a petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution for formation of a commission to fix responsibility for policy manipulation and identify lapses in regulation,” said a two-page letter written by Vice Chairman of TTAP Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar.
The commission should conduct a comprehensive and transparent investigation to identify all beneficiaries of these exploitative decisions especially those from the ruling coalition who hold significant stakes in the sugar mills, the letter said.
The commission should also ensure strict accountability for those who have prioritised personal gain over national interest and public welfare, the letter suggested, adding the future of our nation’s economic stability and the trust of its citizens in democratic government depends on swift and resolute action.

Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen Pakistan calls it a matter of utmost urgency; says issue not ‘mere market fluctuation’, outcome of ‘deliberate policy choices’

The letter started by stating that TTAP was not writing to CJP as politicians but as deeply concerned citizens of Pakistan, witnessing with profound anguish the relentless economic assault on our populace, particularly through egregious manipulation within the sugar industry.
This is a matter of utmost urgency that demands the immediate and decisive intervention of the highest court, the letter said and, while highlighting recent events surrounding the sugar crisis, said it was a stark testament to how entrenched interests exploit national policy for personal gain, at the direct expense of the common citizen, they feared. We have seen retail sugar prices surge to an unprecedented Rs200 per kg since January.
This alarming increase is not a mere market fluctuation but a direct consequence of deliberate policy choices, Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar regretted, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s government, in a move that defies logic and public interest, first approved the export of 765,000 metric tonnes of sugar between July 2024 and May 2025, despite clear warnings of impending supply shortages.
This decision allowed a select group of sug­­ar barons to reap immense profits. Sub­se­que­ntly when local prices skyrocketed, the government paradoxically approved the import of 500,000 metric tonnes of sugar, further facilitating the same beneficiaries through preferential tax treatment, the letter said.
The cabinet waived all duties and taxes on these imports and this exemption has rightly drawn the ire of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), clashing with loan conditions and exacerbating Pakistan’s fiscal strain, the letter bemoaned.
This export-import cycle, repeated over the past 24 months, unequivocally exposes the profound influence of the sugar industry over national policy and raises serious questions about economic stewardship and more critically about who truly benefits from these decisions.
According to credible news reports, the letter said, a staggering 50 per cent of sugar mills were owned by politicians including prominent affiliates of the ruling PML-N coalition. This direct involvement of the political class, holding parliamentary seats, represents a profound conflict of interest and cements their “entrenched political clout”.
This blending of political muscle and commercial gains for a privileged few, the letter said, adding the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) had previously imposed penalties totally Rs44 billion on 81 sugar mills in Aug 2021, underscoring a history of cartelisation and exploitative practices, the letter emphasised.
The policy shifts in the sugar sector are not accidental; they are deliberate mechanism, crafted by politically connected elite, to extract wealth from the masses, the letter said.
These extractive political institutions ensure the system works for the few, not the many, the letter regretted, adding that the impact on citizens is severe. A July 10, 2025 report highlighted the government’s two-phase import plan to stabilise prices, yet the persistent influence of what is widely known as the ‘sugar mafia’ remains evident in every policy shift, demanding urgent scrutiny, the letter said. and reminded that the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was informed on July 29 that sugar mills have earned Rs300 billion due to recent fluctuations in the rates of this essential commodity.
Regrettably, all available redressal forums that could provide relief remains silent, seemingly due to pressure from the executive, the letter said.

Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar issued the directive while hearing a petition from a petrol station operator whose business has been severely disrupted by the prolonged demonstration near the National Press Club.
During the hearing, key officials including Advocate General Islamabad Ayaz Shaukat, Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon, SSP Operations Shoaib Khan, and DSP Legal Sajid Cheema were present.
The chief justice questioned the administration for allowing the lengthy disruption.

Instructs city administration to protect rights and property of others as well

“Under what law is someone’s property being blocked?” he asked city officials in the courtroom. “The steps you’ve taken are insufficient. You must protect the rights and property of others.”
The petition was filed by M/S Awan Associates, which operates a PSO fuel station.
It challenged indefinite road closures that have paralysed business and, according to the petition, violated multiple constitutional rights.
 






Islamabad Advocate General Ayaz Shaukat told the court that no official permission had been granted for the protest, which is being led by members of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee.
“We disperse them, but they return,” he said.
Deputy Commissioner Memon said the administration could offer an alternate location for the protest.
The chief justice instructed him to negotiate with the demonstrators and inform them they could not continue occupying the current site.
He ordered the submission of a compliance report at the next hearing.
“The direction has been given. It’s not the court’s job to spoon-feed the administration,” the chief justice remarked before adjourning the case.
The petition filed through advocate Kashif Ali Malik cited respondents in the case include the Federation of Pakistan, Capital Development Authority (CDA), chief commissioner, deputy commissioner, and inspector general of Islamabad.
During the hearing, the petitioner’s lawyer told the court that key routes — Nazim-ud-Din Road, Shaheed-i-Millat Road, and Polyclinic underpass — have remained closed for weeks, causing a “drastic decline” in customers.
He said the blockade also hampers access for emergency vehicles and suppliers, rendering operations “unsustainable”.
Mr Malik argued the closures violate fundamental rights to life, movement, trade, property, and education as guaranteed in Constitution.
Citing Supreme Court precedents, he contended that protests cannot override the public’s right to healthcare, education, or livelihood.
While acknowledging protests are a protected right, the petition stressed that such demonstrations cannot “paralyse the entire locality” or indefinitely restrict public movement.
The court has been asked to declare the road closures “illegal, unconstitutional, and without lawful authority” and to order the immediate restoration of traffic.

The assets were attached in connection with a plea bargain agreement reached in the £190 million case.
Earlier this year, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) issued a public notice to auction six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and Islamabad after Mr Riaz, the chairman of Bahria Town, and his son Ali failed to pay the amount agreed in the plea deal to settle the case.
However, the IHC stayed the auction. Last month, the accountability watchdog moved the court to vacate the stay order.
An IHC division bench, comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Asif, reserved the judgment on Monday after hearing detailed arguments from both sides.

State-run PTV says NAB to hold auction on Aug 7

Senior lawyer Farooq H. Naik appeared on behalf of Bahria Town, while prosecutor Rafay Maqsood represented the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
Mr Naik argued that NAB’s auction notice was “illegal, deceptive, and issued with mala fide intent”.
He said Bahria Town was not a party to the plea bargain case and had been wrongfully targeted.
He added that Mr Zain, who had pledged Bahria Town properties as collateral, had applied for cancellation of his plea bargain, and that application was still pending. “If the plea bargain is under judicial scrutiny, NAB cannot lawfully proceed with the auction,” Mr Naik submitted.
He contended that NAB’s move to attach and auction Bahria Town’s properties lacked legal basis, as the company itself had not been declared an accused in any reference related to the £190 million case.
The NAB prosecutor rejected Bahria Town’s position, stating that Mr Riaz and his son had entered into a plea bargain with NAB but failed to pay the agreed-upon amount.
NAB decided to auction the properties to recover the outstanding amount under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance, 1999.
Mr Maqsood stated a similar plea had earlier been dismissed by a trial court, after which the petitioners approached the IHC, which issued the stay order on June 12, on the day of the auction.
NAB subsequently filed an application to vacate the stay order.
The NAB prosecutor pointed out the Lahore High Court’s Rawalpindi Bench had directed the petitioners to approach the auction committee, and that attempts to invoke the IHC’s stay order before that bench had been rejected.
Bahria Town’s counsel described the move as a violation of due process, warning it would damage investor confidence and the business environment.
The court echoed the concern, stressing the need for transparency and legal clarity, particularly when dealing with assets not directly tied to any accused individual.
Separately, a late night tweet from state broadcaster PTV‘s X account announced that NAB had set a date for the auction of Malik Riaz’s properties. It said the auction would take place on August 7, 2025, at the NAB Rawalpindi Office, Sector G-6/1, Islamabad.

• Aid seekers among 19 more killed over 24 hours
JERUSALEM: More than 600 retired Israeli security officials have urged US President Donald Trump to pressure their own government to end the war in Gaza.
“It is our professional judgement that Hamas no longer poses a strategic threat to Israel,” the former officials wrote in an open letter shared with the media on Monday, calling on Trump to “steer” Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decisions.
“At first this war was a just war, a defensive war, but when we achieved all military objectives, this war ceased to be a just war,” said Ami Ayalon, former director of the Shin Bet security service.
The war, nearing its 23rd month, “is leading the State of Israel to lose its security and identity,” Ayalon warned in a video released to accompany the letter.
The letter was signed by three former Mossad heads: Tamir Pardo, Efraim Halevy and Danny Yatom.
Other signatories include five former heads of Shin Bet — Ayalon as well as Nadav Argaman, Yoram Cohen, Yaakov Peri and Carmi Gilon — and three former military chiefs of staff, including former prime minister Ehud Barak, former defence minister Moshe Yaalon and Dan Halutz.
The letter argued that the Israeli military “has long accomplished the two objectives that could be achieved by force: dismantling Hamas’s military formations and governance.”
It added that the third, and most important, could only be achieved through a deal: bringing all the Israeli prisoners home.
In the letter, the former officials tell Trump that he has credibility with the majority of Israelis and can put pressure on Netanyahu to end the war and return the prisoners.
In recent weeks Israel has come under increasing international pressure to agree to a ceasefire that could free Israeli prisoners and allow UN agencies to distribute humanitarian aid.
But some in Israel, including ministers in Netanyahu’s coalition government, are instead pushing for Israeli forces to push on and for Gaza to be occupied in whole or in part.
Israel’s war goals
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Netanyahu promised on Monday to update Israel’s Gaza war plan, a day before a UN Security Council meeting on the fate of prisoners still held in the Palestinian territory.
Addressing a cabinet meeting nearly 22 months into the war, the Israeli leader told ministers that later in the week he would instruct the military on how “to achieve the three war objectives we have set”.
Israel — backed by the United States and Panama — is preparing to convene a UN Security Council meeting on Tuesday to highlight the fate of the prisoners.
At the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu reiterated that Israel’s three war goals remain “the defeat of the enemy”, the release of prisoners and the “promise that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel”.
The UN session was called after Palestinian groups published last week three videos showing prisoners Rom Braslavski and Evyatar David appearing weak and emaciated.
Netanyahu said he had asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide food and medical treatment to the Israeli prisoners.
Hamas has said it was willing to allow access to the prisoners in exchange for opening aid corridors into all of Gaza.
‘We are starving’
Israel’s assault in Gaza has killed at least 60,933 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry, which are deemed reliable by the UN.
 
 

Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli fire on Monday killed at least 19 Palestinians, including nine who were waiting to collect food aid from a site in central Gaza.
In Gaza City, Umm Osama Imad was mourning a relative she said was killed while trying to reach an aid distribution point.
“We are starving… He went to bring flour for his family,” she said. “The flour is stained with blood. We don’t want the flour anymore. Enough!”
Further south, in Deir el-Balah, Abdullah Abu Musa told AFP his daughter and her family were killed in an Israeli strike.

The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) says in its report, ‘Afghanistan Returnees Overview’ that around 1.4 million Afghan PoR cardholders currently remain in Pakistan.
 
 

As of July 26, an estimated 1,668,000 Afghans have returned to Afghanistan in 2025, including 1,280,000 from Iran and 389,000 from Pakistan. Between July 1 and 26 alone, approximately 539,000 individuals returned from Iran, accounting for almost one-third of the overall number of people that have returned from Iran so far this year.
During the reporting period (July 20-26), daily arrivals from Iran averaged around 11,000. In contrast, returnees from Pakistan during the same period averaged 1,100 per day.

PoR cardholders cannot stay any longer as document expired on June 30

From January–February 2025, the government issued a directive, requiring Afghan nationals in Pakistan to relocate from Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and Rawalpindi, or else face deportation. Further announcements followed on the implementation of the second phase of the “IFRP”, targeting ACC holders in addition to undocumented Afghans to return to Afghanistan.
These decisions have resulted in an uptick in arrests, detentions and deportations of Afghan nationals, particularly in April 2025. At present, the PoR card validity is yet to be extended, following its expiry on 30 June 2025.

• Ministry fast-tracks approval amid suspension of land travel to Iran, affecting pilgrims
• Ferry service to link Iran and GCC countries with Karachi and Gwadar ports
ISLAMABAD: While a large number of pilgrims en route to Iraq have been stranded due to a sudden ban on land travel to Iran, the government has approved the first ferry service licence.
Applications by ferry operators have been pending since 2017 -18. Taking a fast-track route, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs on Monday approved the first ferry service licence to an international ferry operator.
The UK-based company — ‘Sea Keeper’— will operate ferry routes connecting Pakistan with Iran and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
The government is under serious pressure from around one million pilgrims who attend Arbaeen (Chehlum of Imam Hussain) in Karbala, as land travel to Iran has been stopped without any notice recently.
Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has led the move by fast-track approval to ferry service operators who had filed applications in 2017 and 2018.
 
 

The minister emphasised that ferry service will not only provide the pilgrims going to Iraq and Iran a safe and secure travel but it also provides an opportunity for boosting regional connectivity as well as economic activity via sea routes.
“Initial operations will commence from the ports of Karachi and Gwadar using modern ferry vessels equipped with essential amenities to ensure safe, affordable travel. Expansion of routes and port calls is planned based on demand and bilateral agreements”, the minister said in a statement.
This ferry service launch forms part of Pakistan’s broader strategy to develop its blue economy, improve trade logistics, and promote maritime tourism, reflecting a renewed commitment to sustainable regional sea transport infrastructure, the minister stated.
Sources in the Ministry of Maritime Affairs confirmed that more ferry services licences are expected to be issued in near future as the licence committee was scrutinising the cases.
The Licensing Committee comprises officials from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Ministry of Defence, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Interior, and representatives from the Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC) and port and shipping authorities.
The PNSC will be the regulator of ferry companies ensuring the technical aspect of ships and their services.
Meanwhile, a senior official of Karachi Port Trust told Dawn that the ferry terminal has already been established at the Karachi port.
Once the relevant formalities are notified, the terminal will be handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for immigration and passport duties.
Other relevant departments, including Customs and security agencies, will also deploy staff at the ferry terminals in both Karachi and Gwadar.

• Power division says electricity duty cannot be abolished without provincial consent
• Industrial consumers complain of 14pc tariff hike, rising system losses, eroding competitiveness
ISLAMABAD: Confirming widespread overbilling and subsequent punitive action against relevant electricity officials in Lahore following a probe ordered by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the Power Division on Monday said the federal government cannot abolish electricity duty — as announced by the power minister — without the consent of the provincial governments.
Testifying at a public hearing held by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), Additional Secretary for Power Mehfooz Bhatti reported that an inquiry ordered by the prime minister into overbilling complaints against Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) had been completed and action had also been taken against those responsible.
Mr Bhatti said the inquiry report had been submitted to the prime minister and, hence, he would refrain from discussing the matter until its recommendations were processed through relevant channels and formally presented before the regulator.
This statement led various consumers to raise concerns about similar overbilling practices in other power companies and demanded through probes.
The regulator had called the public hearing on the request of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos) seeking a negative quarterly adjustment of Rs1.80 per unit to refund about Rs53.4 billion to consumers for three billing months — August to October. The refund stems from savings in capacity payments during the fourth quarter (April-June) of FY2025.
Nepra member from Sindh, Rafique A. Shaikh, reminded Mr Bhatti that overbilling investigations by a team of the regulator some two years had found massive discrepancies but was confronted by the power division at the time. However, a subsequent inquiry ordered by power division itself found even greater instances of overbilling. Responding to a question, Mr Shaikh noted that Nepra had arranged refund of the overbilled amounts to the consumers.
He also reported that Power Minister Sardar Awais Leghari had earlier last month announced that he had written to the provincial governments about the centre’s intentions to remove electricity duty from July 1, 2025 and requested provinces to make alternative arrangements.
He added two provinces have responded so far to the proposal while two others were yet to get back with their feedback but “we cannot discontinue electricity duty” unless all provinces agree.
The regulator was informed that about 128,000 applications for new connections were pending beyond permissible deadlines with various distribution companies, potentially delaying the absorption of around 1,070MW of generation capacity.
Additionally, about 4,000 net-metering applications are also pending beyond regulatory timelines with Faisalabad Electric alone accounting for 2,000 of these. Likewise, more than 70,000 faulty meters had not been rectified, which meant these consumers were being billed based on estimated consumption.
The Power Division further reported that 700–800MW of captive power plants have returned to the national grid due to an increase in gas tariffs following a special levy under the IMF programme. As a result, circular debt has dropped from Rs2.39tr to Rs1.6tr within a year, owing to improved economic indicators, exchange rate stability, reduced interest rates, and efficiency gains by Discos. Overall electricity consumption increased by 1.6 per cent last year, while industrial demand rose by 6.3pc.
Industrial consumers from Karachi and Lahore pointed out that average power rate had increased by 14pc with effect from July 1, a figure also confirmed by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.
 
 

They stated that a 19pc tariff imposed by the Trump administration on Pakistani products had already burdened the sector, and rising electricity costs further undermined competitiveness against countries like India. They demanded the removal of cross-subsidy costs on industrial consumers — claimed at Rs137bn by industry representatives and Rs73bn by the Power Division.
Despite claims of increased efficiency, industrial users highlighted that system losses have risen to 18.3pc in FY2025, compared to 17.55pc in FY2024 and 16.5pc in FY2023.
The Power Division clarified that the proposed lower quarterly adjustment is due to Rs18bn in savings from reduced capacity payments to the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (which is currently non-operational), Rs17bn in contract revisions with power plants, and other factors such as declining interest rates and currency stabilisation.
The petition estimated total savings of Rs53.7bn on capacity charges across 10 public-sector Discos. However, increases in operations and maintenance expenses, as well as service and market operation fees, reduced the net savings to Rs53.39bn.
Capacity charges of all Discos had come down during April-June period of current year except for Quetta Electric whose capacity charges went up by Rs3.057bn. Although K-Electric has no contribution in lower quarterly tariff adjustments, its consumers would also benefit the overall quarterly tariff reductions under the government policy of uniform tariff throughout the country.
The highest savings were reported for Faisalabad Electric at Rs15.026bn, followed by Lahore Electric at Rs12.636bn, and Multan Electric at Rs8.48bn. Other notable reductions include Hyderabad Electric at Rs6.63bn, Gujranwala Electric at Rs6.11bn, and Peshawar Electric at Rs3.3bn.
Additional savings include Rs2.88bn for Tribal Electric, Rs1.04bn for Islamabad Electric, and Rs653m for Sukkur Electric.
Under the tariff framework, fuel cost variations are passed on to consumers monthly through an automatic mechanism.
Meanwhile, quarterly tariff adjustments — accounting for changes in power purchase prices, capacity charges, operation and maintenance costs, and transmission/distribution losses — are incorporated into the base tariff by the federal government.

• Announces Rs4bn for reconstruction, distributes cheques among flood victims; says those living along waterways needed to be relocated
• Ghizer residents cut off, at risk of food shortage as link road submerged
• Met Dept warns of flash floods, landslides in GB and KP ahead of new rain spell
GILGIT: As flash floods in the mountainous northern parts of the country leave a trail of destruction in their wake, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Mon­day directed the National Disaster Mana­g­ement Authority (NDMA) and the climate change ministry to set up an “early warning and monitoring centre in Gilgit-Baltistan within the next few months”.
These directives came as the premier visited GB along with cabinet members to take stock of the damage caused by floods over the past few weeks, which claimed several lives and destroyed homes and farmland across the region.
About the early warning system, the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan quoted the PM as saying that for the past seven years, the subject “remained confined to papers only” and over the past year and a half, “no progress had been made”.
 
 

He asked stakeholders to complete the project within two months, ruling out the possibility of any extension.
In a meeting held to assess the damage, the premier asked the climate change ministry to adopt a “proactive approach” as he underscored the importance of generating funds to develop climate-resilient infrastructure.
He said an early warning system should be installed for tourist destinations, adding that residents should be moved away from natural watercourses.
Addressing the meeting, PM Shehbaz stressed that he had issued “clear” directives to Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik and his team to work on the matter. He highlighted that Mr Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan. The PM, however, did not specify the quantum of these funds.
He said the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, wher­eas the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work.
PM Shehbaz said a survey of the damage to highways and other infrastructure should be conducted and communication links of all areas should be restored on a priority basis. The premier also directed the water resources minister for an improved water system in the region. He also announced Rs4 billion for the restoration of infrastructure in GB.
Later, addressing a cheque-distribution ceremony for the flood victims, PM Shehbaz recalled, “A huge cloudburst occurred in Gilgit-Baltistan, as a result of which there were immense rains and floods.” He said being one of the most vulnerable countries, Pakistan needed to be prepared against climate disasters.
Furthermore, the premier announced a Daanish school and a 100MW solar power project for the region. He said the solar project’s approval would be sought from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.
During his one-day trip, the premier also held separate meetings with the GB chief minister and the governor to discuss the region’s flood damages, among other matters.
Separately, Climate Minister Musadik Malik told journalists that the early warning systems had either been stolen or deliberately damaged. He said the unplanned construction in the region added to the recent disasters, saying people had built hotels and other infrastructure in the pathway of streams.
Ghizer residents stranded
Meanwhile, the residents of Ghizer remained marooned for a fifth straight day after a flood cut off the Gilgit-Shandur road access, even as the mountainous region braces for more disasters in light of a warning issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department.
According to the local administration, a flooded stream in Khotom village blocked the Ghizer River, due to which the river overflowed and submerged a 500-metre stretch of the road, cutting off access for thousands of residents in Phander, Khalti, Teero, and other areas up to Shandur Top.
Five stranded residents from Khotom village were, however, rescued via boat, while a search for missing tourists in the Babusar area had also been concluded.
 
 

Rescue 1122 officials reported that five members of a family from Khotom village were rescued and moved to safety via boat on Monday, while food supplies were delivered to other stranded families. The rescue team stated that restoring the submerged road was extremely difficult due to the rocky terrain at the blocked section.
The Gilgit-Shandur road also serves as a link between Gilgit-Baltistan and the Chitral district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Local resident Yaqoob Tai told Dawn that the road blockage occurred in a mountainous area, making the repair work particularly complicated.
Residents are unable to reach Chitral because the alternative route is under construction and much longer. Locals are facing shortages of essential items and medicine amid fears that if the situation continues, a severe food shortage may occur.
On the other hand, the Ghizer district administration has contacted the Chitral administration, requesting a no-objection certificate to transport essential food and fuel supplies from Chitral to Phander Valley via Shandur Road.
Separately, the search operation for 12 tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Babusar area was concluded on Monday without any success. GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq stated that the 14-day-long search operation on the Babusar Highway had ended. While all vehicles were recovered from the debris, the missing tourists could not be traced.
On July 21, at least four tourists died, and 14 went missing after floods swept through the Babusar area in Diamer. During the operation, seven bodies were recovered.
Glof alert
Meanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department issued an alert for increased risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs), flash floods, and landslides in the glaciated regions of Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
A wet spell is expected this week, with scattered rain and thunderstorms, including isolated heavy rainfall. The PMD advised relevant authorities to remain vigilant and take precautionary measures to avoid any untoward incidents.

• Pakistan Railways generated Rs13.9bn from leasing, licensing of land in 3 years
ISLAMABAD: As much as 3,999 acres of land, belonging to the Pakistan Railways (PR), is currently under “illegal occupation” of various “government and defence departments”.
This information was placed before the National Assembly by Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi on Monday, through written replies to two separate, but similar questions posed by MNAs.
“The PR owns a total of 168,858 acres of land across its network in Pakistan, out of which 13,115 acres (7.7 per cent) is under illegal occupation,” said the minister.
In the past five years, PR has managed to retrieve over 2,550 acres of land from illegal occupants. However, the replies have no mention about the retrieval of land from the government and defence departments.
The minister was responding to separate questions asked by PPP’s Shazia Marri and Sher Afzal Marwat of the opposition PTI.
 
 

The minister had been asked to provide the “names of individuals, entities, or organisations currently occupying railways land illegally, with specific locations and extent of each encroachment”.
Besides this, the minister had also been asked to provide a “province-wise bre­ak-up of the encro­ached land as well as the area of the illegally occupied land retrieved by the PR during the last five years”.
The response categorised the occupying individuals or departments into different categories, including “agricultural, commercial, residential, and government/defence departments”.
It says that the largest area of 4,773 acres is under illegal occupation of the individuals or departments related to agriculture, followed by 3,999 acres by the “government/defence departments”.
Moreover, the reply shows that a total of 3,266 acres are under residential use and 712 acres of illegal land is in commercial use.
The government/defence departments have been illegally occupying 2,539 acres in Punjab, 764 acres in Sindh, 349 acres in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and 347 acres in Balochistan.
Similarly, the province-wise data of the total land under illegal occupation shows that 5,717 acres are under illegal occupation in Punjab, followed by Sindh (5,590 acres), Balochistan (1,033 acres) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (775 acres).
According to Mr Abbasi, the PR has been successful in retrieving 1,078 acres from the possession of illegal occupants in Punjab and 837 acres in Sindh during the last five years. Moreover, it has retrieved 419 acres in Balochistan and 218 acres in KP.
 
 

The reply, however, shows that when the PR has been successful in getting back some of its encroached land from the possession of individuals and organisations using it for residential, agricultural or commercial use, it has not retrieved even a single acre from the “government/defence departments” in the past five years.
The PR has retrieved 1,594 acres of land which was under agricultural use, 713 acres under commercial use and 268 acres under residential use.
The minister said the PR administration had undertaken several measures over the last three years to retrieve its illegally-occupied land.
“Unauthorised possession of railway land by government departments are being regularised through leases under Railway land policy,” said the minister, adding that commercial encroachments are being reviewed under “Remedial Policy” through lease agreements involving upfront premiums and arrears.
He said any illegal occupation or encroachment was dealt with legal action as per rules and regulations and regular anti-encroachment operations were being carried out to prevent fresh encroachments.
From 2020 to June 2025, he said, a total of 5,182 encroachment cases were reported, with a challan rate of 99.58pc and a conviction rate of 96.71pc.
Out of 5,611 accused, 99.6pc belonged to the general public, with nearly all arrested and only 20 still at large.
He said the PR had launched a comprehensive anti-encroachment campaign in collaboration with provincial government authorities.
The minister claimed that no new encroachment on the PR land had been recorded in the past five years.
Mr Abbasi said the PR had generated a total revenue of Rs13.9 billion from the leasing and licensing of railway land over the last three financial years.

• Asad Qaiser says this isn’t ‘final call’; protest to continue till govt’s ouster
• Ali Zafar says door to dialogue closed, but ‘decisions can change’
• Azma hopes people will reject ‘politics of chaos’
ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Amid claims of a crackdown by the government, the PTI will launch its movement for the release of party founder Imran Khan and other prisoners today, which, it said, will continue till the ouster of the incumbent government.
According to PTI leader Asad Qaiser, August 5 is the inception of the protest, but it should not be considered a ‘final call’.
“Provincial chapters of the PTI have been directed to arrange rallies, public awareness events, and other activities. The protest will continue till the fake government is removed,” he said, adding that it was the right of the masses that their true representatives sit in parliament. The Aug 5 protest marks the second anniversary of party chief Imran Khan’s imprisonment in a corruption case.
“We have decided to involve all segments of the society…in the protest as we have been raising our voice for their rights,” the PTI leader claimed.
According to Mr Qaiser, raids against workers and members of parliament have started, while a number of workers have been arre­sted. He said details were being collected to know the actual number of arrests. The PTI leader claimed raids had started in Punjab and Kashmir and Section 144 was being imposed in different districts.
Meanwhile, PTI Punjab media cell head Shayan Bashir, in a press conference alongside Senator Ali Zafar, claimed that the police made some 200 raids and picked up party workers, who were released after allegedly submitting affidavits.
“The PTI will stage a major show of strength in Lahore and outside Adiala Jail (in Rawalpindi), besides organising massive rallies across the province, which will continue afterwards at full throttle,” he said. “Party workers and supporters from different districts have also reached Lahore,” he added.
During the presser, Senator Zafar made an ambiguous statement about talks, saying that though the “door for dialogue” had been closed by Imran Khan but in politics, “decisions do change”.
 
 

He said Mr Khan had given a message that he would be ready to stay in jail for 10 years for the people of Pakistan and the rule of law and not succumb to any kind of pressure, including “fake cases” and delay in the hearing of his cases.
Saying that he believed in dialogue, Senator Zafar said Mr Khan had once allowed the party to go into dialogue with two conditions, which were not accepted by the government, and the talks fell through.
Senator Zafar said the government was relying on four major cases against Imran Khan —Toshakhana-I, the cipher case, the Iddat case and the Al-Qadir Trust corruption case —but all cases crumbled one by one as they reached the high court. “The convictions handed down by the jail trial courts were suspended by the high court in a matter of minutes, except for the last Al-Qadir Trust case, which is not being allowed to be heard for the sake of delay,” he claimed.
Claiming that Mr Khan was resolute that he would get out of jail through the courts, Senator Zafar said the former prime minister was facing the “worst kind” of human rights violations. He said the government and powers that be wanted to break Mr Khan while exerting pressure on him and his wife.
“The government will fail in its efforts to keep Imran Khan out of politics,” he asserted.
Answering a question about boycotting by-elections, Senator Zafar said holding by-elections was illegal until the disqualification was upheld by the Supreme Court. He said the PTI would approach courts against the by-elections. It may be noted that several PTI leaders were disqualified following their conviction in the May 9 cases.
‘Politics of chaos’
On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said people would reject the Aug 5 protest call.
“The politics of chaos will be rejected and defeated by the people. The PTI is no longer a political party but it has become a fascist group determined to damage the state institutions and disrupt national unity,” Ms Bokhari said during a presser in Lahore on Monday. The minister claimed that the person who raised slogans of ’Haqiqi Azadi (real freedom) was the same individual whose $18 million advertisement was published in the United States.
“This man once begged for freedom from America, and now his sons are repeating the same narrative,” said the minister. It may be noted that the PTI had said Imran Khan’s sons would also arrive in Pakistan to join the movement.  The minister said on August 5, when the nation would be expressing solidarity with Kashmiris, the PTI’s protest call was “highly regrettable”.
