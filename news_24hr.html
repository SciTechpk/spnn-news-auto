The government has declared a public holiday on the occasion.
On this day, Pakistan became the seventh nuclear power of the world and the first Muslim state having the nuclear arsenal in its defence stockpile.
A team of Pakistani scientists led by the founder of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, and Dr Samar Mubarakmand carried out nuclear tests in the Raskoh Hills in Chaghai district of Balochistan. These tests demonstrated the resolve of the nation to safeguard Pakistan’s territorial integrity, independence and sovereignty.
The historic statement of former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto that “they would starve, but transform the country into a nuclear power”, led to achievement of this milestone.
By resisting the mounting external pressures, ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif decided to test the nukes in response to Indian nuclear tests, and thus balancing the strategic slanting power in the region.
 






President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif have renewed their pledge to uphold and safeguard the sovereignty and territorial integrity of country, reports Radio Pakistan.
In his message on the occasion, President Zardari said Pakistan’s nuclear capability continues to serve as a credible minimum deterrent that guarantees peace and ensures no one can undermine our sovereignty and national security.
Zardari said Pakistan does not seek conflict and is committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law. He added that Pakistan demonstrated its strategic patience and commitment to peace in the face of recent unprovoked Indian aggression.
In his separate message, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif hailed Pakistan’s nuclear journey and called for renewed unity and determination to transform the country into an economic power.
 






PM Shehbaz linked this year’s commemoration with Pakistan’s recent success in defending itself from an unjustified war imposed by India. He urged the nation to carry the spirit of Youm-i-Takbeer beyond defence and into economic transformation.
The armed forces of Pakistan, along with the chairman joint chiefs of staff committee and services chiefs, extended heartfelt felicitations to the nation on the 27th anniversary of Youm-i-Takbeer.
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Youm-i-Takbeer commemorates the momentous occasion in 1998 when Pakistan emerged as a nuclear power, restoring the strategic balance in South Asia and asserting its sovereign right to self-defence.
The statement said this historic achievement epitomises the nation’s resolve, unity, and unwavering pursuit of a dignified and peaceful existence.
“Pakistan’s strategic capability is a national trust, reflecting the collective aspirations of its people. The commemoration of Youm-e-Takbeer is a tribute to the foresight of visionary leadership, the brilliance of our scientists and engineers, and the countless contributions of all those who rendered Pakistan’s defence unassailable,” it added.
“Let this day renew our collective pledge to remain vigilant, united, and resolute in our commitment to the security, progress, and prosperity of our beloved homeland.”</p><small>2025-05-28 06:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/68367e3813f7a.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913819/a-war-without-end' target='_blank'><strong>A war without end</strong></a><br><p>SUCCESSFUL defence against India’s unwarranted aggression is certainly a great accomplishment and a matter of pride for the nation and the security forces. Yet a victory celebration in an ongoing conflict seems premature. The exchange of missiles and drones may have stopped, but the tension between the two countries is far from over. In the words of the Indian prime minister, it’s just a “pause”. It’s an extremely dangerous situation that needs caution and not triumphalism.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s comment that Pakistan has taken revenge for the 1971 war seems highly questionable. Is there really any comparison between a war that led to the disintegration of the country and defeating the recent Indian attack? The 1971 tragedy was more than India’s military invasion; it was also a war within that we as a nation must never forget. The tragedy is etched in our conscience.
Attempts to politicise national security must also be avoided. The Indian aggression has united the country across the political spectrum. Political parties set aside their differences and stood behind the armed forces. But soon after the hostilities eased the daggers were out again, not realising the serious challenges the nation’s security continues to confront. The major responsibility obviously lies with the government to bring down the political temperature as the threat of another Indian escalation looms large. A politically divided country weakens the country’s defence.
Then there is also a question about the elevation of the army chief to field marshal and the extension in the air force chief’s tenure. Undoubtedly all the three forces did remarkably well in thwarting the Indian attack. The air force particularly played the most critical role not only in defending our airspace but also downing several Indian aircraft. It re-established Pakistan’s deterrence even in the conventional field. There is also no doubting of the leadership of the army chief.

Most troubling for India has been the strengthening of China-Pakistan defence collaboration.

Still, it’s difficult to understand the need to promote the army chief to the highest position just on the basis of four days of conflict. It was certainly not winning an all-out war. Gen Munir is the second military chief to be promoted to the five-star rank after Ayub Khan, the country’s first military dictator.
While giving full marks to the professional capabilities of our armed forces in taking on a much more powerful adversary, there is also a need to do a critical assessment of our vulnerabilities. It must be a cause for concern that the Indian missiles managed to hit some of our key airbases, including Nur Khan Airbase close to the capital. Surely the damage was not as much as being claimed by the Indian prime minister. Nevertheless, these gaps have to be plugged, as another Indian military strike seems very much on the cards.
The four-day military face-off that drove the two nuclear-armed neighbours close to a full-blown war also brought to the fore the fast-shifting regional and global geopolitics. India’s expectation of winning international approval for its military operation against Pakistan in response to the terrorist attack at a tourist spot in disputed territory failed miserably. Perhaps the most shocking development for the Modi government was President Trump’s claim to have brokered the ceasefire using trade as leverage.
One of the reasons for India’s failure to muster support for its military action even from its strategic allies in the West was that it failed to provide any solid evidence of Pakistan’s alleged involvement in the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India mostly relied on past incidents that allegedly had links to local militant groups. Israel was perhaps the only country which publicly backed India’s military action against Pakistan.
Another plausible reason for the US and other Western countries to counsel restraint to both states was the fear of the conflict turning into a nuclear confrontation; this would have had disastrous consequences for global peace. The Modi government in its hubris completely miscalculated India’s strategic and economic importance. But it will be a mistake to read too much into Trump’s offer to mediate between the two countries on Kashmir and other outstanding issues. No external mediation will be accepted by New Delhi. Moreover, India remains a strategic ally of the US despite the friction between the two countries on trade and tariffs issues. But there is certainly an opportunity for Pakistan to reset its relations with Washington.
Most troubling for India, however, has been the strengthening of China-Pakistan defence collaboration. Pakistan’s spectacular success in air warfare is largely the result of our strategic alliance with China. Besides close cooperation between the two air forces, the China-Pakistan naval axis is also visible.
Pakistan and China both share security, military, and financial concerns. Advancing and reinforcing conventional and strategic relations with China is an essential component of Pakistan’s foreign and national security policies. Beijing, however, would not like the conflict between its two nuclear-armed neighbours to escalate. Surely any fresh flare-up between India and Pakistan will have serious implications for the entire region and beyond.
It now seems that the battlefront has moved to the field of diplomacy with both countries sending teams to various capitals to explain their respective positions on the sources of conflict. It’s obvious that both sides will be raising the issue of terrorism apparently being used against each other as a tool in the ongoing covert war. But there are limits to what the international community can do in bringing the two countries together on the negotiating table. Both sides have now declared victory in a conflict that has resolved nothing. It’s a war without an end.

Police Surgeon Summaiya Syed told Dawn that both the girls, aged 15 and 8, were brought to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi (CHK) by their maternal and paternal uncles at 5:30pm.
She said that the girls were examined at the health facility and “findings are strongly suggestive of sexual violence”.
 
 

Evidentiary samples had been collected for serology and DNA profiling and cross matching, she said, adding that both sisters bore marks of “severe physical violence”.
The condition of the eight-year-old was serious, she said.
Dr Summaiya said the relatives had on May 25 brought the girls to a government hospital in New Karachi with complaint of sexual harassment and torture.
Central SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi said that their father had died four years ago and their mother had married another man and was living with him with her four children.
He said that a few days ago the girls’ mother had informed the Khwaja Ajmer Nagri police that her daughters were “maltreated by an intruder”.
However, the girls’ uncles had informed hospital officials on Tuesday that they were beaten by their stepfather.
He said that the police were investigating the case.

By late afternoon, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it had distributed about 8,000 food boxes, equivalent to 462,000 meals, after an almost three-month-old Israeli blockade of the devastated enclave.
In Rafah, which is under full Israeli army control, thousands of people, including women and children, some on foot or in donkey carts, flocked towards one of the distribution sites to receive food packages.
Videos showed lines of people walking through a wired-off corridor and into a large open field where aid was stacked. Later, images shared on social media showed large parts of the fence torn down as people jostled their way onto the site.
 



Private relief agency’s closeness to US and Israel’s endorsement of its distribution method have raised doubts about its neutrality

Hamas denies accusation
“The real cause of the delay and collapse in the aid distribution process is the tragic chaos caused by the mismanagement of the same company operating under the Israeli occupation administration in those buffer zones,” Ismail Al Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, said.
The Israel military said its troops fired warning shots in the area outside the compound and that control was re-established.
A UN spokesperson called images of the incident “heartbreaking”.
Israel’s foreign ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein wrote on X that 8,000 “food packages” were delivered to Pale­stinians on Tuesday, the first day of what he described as an American initiative.
 






Screening procedures
Although the aid was available on Monday, Palestinians appeared to have heeded warnings, including from Hamas, about biometric screening procedures employed at the foundation’s aid distribution sites.
“As much as I want to go because I am hungry and my children are hungry, I am afraid,” said Abu Ahmed, 55. “I am so scared because they said the company belongs to Israel and is a mercenary, and also because the resistance (Hamas) said not to go,” he said in a message on WhatsApp.
The Israeli military said four aid sites have been established in recent weeks across the enclave, and that two of them in the area of Rafah began operations on Tuesday and “are distributing food packages to thousands of families in Gaza Strip”.
Israeli officials said one of the advantages of the new aid system is the opportunity to screen recipients to exclude anyone found to be connected with Hamas.
Humanitarian groups briefed on GHF’s plans say anyone accessing aid will have to submit to facial recognition technology that many Palestinians fear will end up in Israeli hands to be used to track and potentially target them.
Aid groups boycott GHF
The United Nations and other international aid groups have boycotted the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which they say undermines the principle that aid should be distributed independently of the parties to a conflict, based on need.
“Humanitarian assistance must not be politicised or militarised,” said Christian Cardon, chief spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross.
United Nations spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters the UN has a sound plan “to get aid to a desperate population” and that Israel was allowing it to deliver relief, but with a lot of obstacles.

Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revoked Harvard’s ability to enroll foreign nationals, throwing the future of thousands of students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.
She  had threatened last month to block international students at the school  unless it turned over records on visa holders’  “illegal and violent activities.” But a judge quickly suspended the move after the university sued to “stop the government’s arbitrary, capricious, unlawful, and unconstitutional action.” There will be an injunction hearing on Thursday, a court filing showed.
Harvard President Alan Garber said in a statement that the attempted foreign students ban “imperils the futures of thousands of students and scholars across Harvard and serves as a warning to countless others at colleges and universities  throughout the country who have come to America to pursue their education and fulfill their dreams.”
In addition to undermining the independence of storied US universities — which attract top students from around the world and produce much of the country’s lucrative scientific research — Trump has sought to dismantle the government’s traditional soft power tools, including humanitarian aid and the Voice of America radio network.
Meanwhile, the US government intends to cancel all remaining financial contracts with Harvard, a senior official said on Tuesday, in President Donald Trump’s latest attempt to force the prestigious university to submit to unprecedented oversight.
The administration “will send a letter to federal agencies today asking them to identify any contracts with Harvard, and whether they can be canceled or redirected elsewhere,” the official said.
The ending of contracts — estimated by US media to be worth $100 million — would mark the severance of business ties between the government and an institution that is both the country’s oldest university and a global research powerhouse. Amid a broad push to amass power in the White House, Trump has singled out Harvard for particularly fierce punishment.
His administration accuses the Cambridge, Massachusetts university of permitting anti-Semitism and pervasive liberal bias.
Harvard has rejected orders to allow a series of extraordinary measures, including an audit of political leanings on campus and a ban on students deemed to be  “hostile to the American values.”
In the last few weeks, the elite educational bastion has seen billions of dollars in federal grants frozen and an attempt — paused last Friday by a court ruling — to end its ability to host foreign students.
The university is fighting back, arguing that the Trump attacks are unconstitutional and would cripple its ability to function.
On Monday, Trump vowed he would prevail in the increasingly public struggle. In a social media post he claimed that foreign students at Harvard included  “radicalised lunatics, troublemakers.”

This evolving challenge requires a clear and adaptive strategy to effectively counter it.
These operations, which Delhi has designed to stay below the nuclear threshold, have manifested the shrinking space in which our deterrence operates in the highly volatile South Asian environment. The time has come to rethink and update our understanding of deterrence — one that reflects the realities of today, where conflict no longer arrives with armies massing at borders, but with drones in the sky and missiles that strike and disappear before the world has time to respond.
On May 7, India launched “Operation Sindoor” — a coordinated assault involving air strikes, drone swarms, and missile attacks deep inside Pakistani territory. The strikes hit a disturbing range of targets from religious institutions like mosques to strategic military installations. Pakistani armed forces that follow a “quid pro quo plus” policy with regards to India, responded robustly and swiftly, downing multiple Indian aircraft — including Rafale, Mirage 2000, MiG-29, and Su-30 jets in a short span of less than an hour — employing stand-off weapons and air defence systems to signal its resolve.
But instead of de-escalating, India escalated further.

Pakistan’s quid pro quo plus aims at preventing all-out conflicts, but India’s reckless behaviour to expand geographic scope of its strikes risks miscalculation resulting in a nuclear catastrophe

By the next morning, a wave of drones swarmed Pakistani skies, followed a day later by fresh missile attacks on airbases. It was a moment of real danger. The international community scrambled to contain what was quickly becoming a runaway crisis. Deterrence, while not broken, was undeniably shaken.
 
 

India’s willingness to act and expand geographic scope of its strikes, echoing Uri in 2016 and Pulwama-Balakot in 2019, points to a gap in Pakistan’s ability to deter reckless Indian behaviour due to emergence of newer technologies. To put it simply, Pakistan’s shield is holding, though it may be fraying at the edges.
Pakistan’s nuclear weapons programme, born from the trauma of 1971, was built on a simple promise: to make any future aggression against the country unthinkable. Between 1998 and 2015, that promise largely held. Even during moments of extreme tension like the Kargil crisis of 1999, months-long military standoff in 2002 or the aftermath of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, India refrained from crossing the Line of Control and the international border or undertaking major strike in Pakistani heartland. But that calculus began to shift post-2015 especially following the Gurdaspur attack barely weeks after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had met then Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif at Ufa. First came the claimed “surgical strikes”, then the 2019 aerial incursion following Pulwama.
“South Asia has neither crisis stability nor arms race stability. While I do not expect a crisis for some time — perhaps several years — the region remains unstable and dangerous,” said Chris­to­­pher Clary, a security aff­airs expert at the University at Albany, the US.
The May 2025 clash — an intense 88-hour exchange of air strikes, drones, and missile fire — marked a deeper evolution of this trend of a rapid escalation under the nuclear overhang. It laid bare a dangerous new reality: India believes it can operate in a “grey zone” just below the nuclear threshold, using limited, precise force to impose costs without triggering all-out war. Indian leaders appear beholden to the idea that they can hit Pakistan without provoking an uncontrollable escalation. From Uri to Balakot, and now Pahalgam, the visible trend is that each strike is a calculated test of Pakistani resolve, and each one pushes the boundaries a little further.
Pakistan’s “quid pro quo plus” policy, adopted after 2016, meant to meet Indian aggression with a harder blow, aimed to slam this door of a military conflict below nuclear rung shut. But three incidents in nine years show Pakistani “plus” isn’t scaring India enough. The policy’s success is bittersweet: it prevents all-out conflict, but India does exploit some space to commit aggression.
Elizabeth Threlkeld, director for South Asia at the Stimson Center, the US, agrees “the limitations of Pakistan’s quid pro quo plus approach are becoming more visible in light of India’s increasing willingness to engage in limited conventional actions.”
Misstep towards catastrophe
Each Indian operation is designed to normalise limited raids in the eyes of the world. If this continues, and strikes on mainland Pakistan are repeated, it would increase the risk of a misstep towards nuclear catastrophe as each crisis raises the stakes. Getting an opportunity to dump the payload on a Balakot hill in 2019 gave way to mainland strikes in 2025, setting a higher baseline for the next clash. A more worrying aspect is that if this cycle will persist, each round will compress decision making windows in a world of hypersonic weapons.
India’s playbook is clear: use modern technology — drones, standoff missiles — to inflict pain while staying below nuclear tripwires. Modi is therefore attempting, at least on his part, to rewrite the rules, projecting strength to domestic audiences and signalling that Pakistan’s nuclear shadow won’t paralyse India. Whispers of pre-emptive counterforce strategies, meanwhile, have in the past few years circulated with growing frequency, though such a gamble remains improbable.
“In March 2022, an Indian BrahMos missile landed in Mian Channu. Delhi called it an error, Pakistani leadership accepted the explanation, but I saw it as a deliberate test of our defences, including our response time. BrahMos is central to India’s pre-emptive strike plans, its speed and precision leave little time to respond, making such incidents dangerously destabilising for Pakistan,” Dr Shireen Mazari, who was a federal minister in 2022, said, alluding to the debates within the system at that time.
India’s confidence in multi-domain warfare, blending crewed and uncrewed platforms, creates a false sense of control, as if escalation can be neatly managed.
The proponents of such an approach forget that wars don’t always proceed as per calculated decisions, rather they often unravel through confusion.
A single misstep, like a missile or an artillery piece gone astray or a misunderstood signal, can unravel restraint and push a tense standoff into full-blown catastrophe.
 
 

What makes it scarier in Indian case is that the extremist Hindutva mindset currently dominating New Delhi and electoral pressures push the government to demonstrate strength through limited strikes, confident they can avoid nuclear escalation. This dynamic perpetuates the very crises their leaders must manage.
“The very presence of recurring conventional engagements highlights the precariousness of the situation, where misperceptions of red lines could lead to inadvertent escalation between the two nuclear-armed adversaries,” Threlkeld maintained.
Deception or internal dysfunction?
Following India’s aerial strikes on the morning of May 7 and Pakistan’s forceful retaliation, Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval conveyed messages through international intermediaries indicating that New Delhi wanted to de-escalate. But to Islamabad’s surprise, shortly after it received these signals, Pakistan’s airspace was swarmed by hostile drones. Whether this was a deliberate act of deception or a sign of internal dysfunction within the Indian system remains unclear. However, one plausible explanation is that hardliners within India’s security establishment pressured the military to climb the next rung of the escalation ladder — targeting Pakistani military installations with unmanned platforms, despite diplomatic overtures suggesting restraint.
In this scenario, Pakistan faces a stark choice: continue pursuing a doctrine that punishes India after the incident or forge one that stops India cold.
First, there is a need to strengthen our conventional arsenal, which includes acquisition of modern fighter jets, advanced air defences, rapid-response units, and precision munitions, to make limited strikes too costly. Second, ambiguity, using cyber-attacks, economic pressure, or international legal action to raise India’s costs without nuclear risks, should be embraced. The ‘catalytic posture’, which involves signalling nuclear readiness to draw international mediation has worked well so far in South Asian environment, but its overuse risks diminishing returns.
Dr Adil Sultan, a dean at the Air University and a former SPD official, while explaining his vision of next generation of deterrence, said, “The future conflict is likely to be more intense, complex, and short, thus requiring quick response through ‘multi-domain integration’ (MDI) of all three services, and ground and space-based assets, with PAF being in the lead due to its inherent agility and capacity to act in a shortest possible time with maximum effect.”
Pakistan should also re-emphasise red lines through robust crisis channels especially after the targeting of the airbases.
So here we are back, 27 years later, on the same razor’s edge — thanks to the technological advancement. The nuclear bombs remain the ultimate guarantor of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, but every knife-edge attack or missile/drone strike cannot be stopped. The nukes can only promise that if the worst comes, both sides will pay an unthinkable price.

Eleven victims remained in hospital in a stable condition on Tuesday, police said, adding that they all appeared to be recovering well. British police believe the incident, in a packed Liverpool city centre on Monday, was isolated and not an act of terrorism.
They said the driver of the grey Ford Galaxy people-carrier involved in the incident was believed to have followed an ambulance into a closed street when a road block was lifted to allow paramedics to attend to a suspected heart attack victim.
Videos posted online showed the vehicle driving through the street crowded with fans, sending several flying into the air and dragging at least four under its wheels.

Police identified the driver as ‘53-year-old white British man to cool social media speculation’

When the vehicle stopped, angry people converged on it and began smashing the windows as police officers battled to prevent them from reaching the driver. Police said 50 people, including children, had been treated for their injuries, with 11 still in hospital.
“They are all in a stable condition, and I am pleased to say that they appear to be recovering well,” Deputy Chief Constable Jenny Sims said.
King Charles, who is visiting Canada, said he was  “deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the terrible events”. His sister, Princess Anne, met medics who had treated some of the injured at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.
Million people
With most people off work for the Spring Bank Holiday, officials estimated that around 1 million people descended on the 10-mile (16 km) parade route to watch the Liverpool team travel through the city on an open-top bus with the Premier League trophy.
Liverpool last won the league in 2020, ending a 30-year-wait, but fans were unable to celebrate due to lockdowns during the pandemic. Police said the car hit the spectators as the event was winding down. In the aftermath, a photographer saw emergency services carrying victims on stretchers and in their arms to nearby ambulances.
One source told MailOnline that it looked like the driver panicked when he realised he was in the crowd and people started banging on his car. The driver, who was sounding his horn, reversed and then accelerated forwards, according to reports from other witnesses.
Police were unusually quick to provide a description of the man they arrested, saying around two hours after the incident he was a  “53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area.”  Former police officers and local politicians said that statement was needed to cool social media speculation that the episode was an Islamist attack.
“That was one of my first concerns, that we needed to get the story out quickly,” Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram told the BBC. “If there’s a vacuum, we know there are some elements that will try to inflame the situation and to create that speculation and to put misinformation out there.”

Nepra set K-Electric’s base tariff at Rs40 per unit for the fiscal year 2023-24, which is almost 40pc higher than even the national average tariff of about Rs28 per unit in 2025-26 for the 10 public sector power distribution companies (Discos).
The delta between the Discos’ average and K-Electric’s tariff is transferred to the taxpayers through the federal budget in the form of tariff differential subsidy.
In a detailed determination, the regulator changed K-Electric’s tariff mechanism based on 100pc recovery of bills and instead allowed recovery losses in the tariff, starting from 6.75pc in FY24 and gradually declining to 3.5pc by F30.

Nepra sets utility’s base rate at Rs40 per unit, 40pc higher than national average tariff

Interestingly, the Discos’ tariff is still based on a 100pc recovery of bills. The judgement on K-Electric indicated that a similar charge may be coming up for Discos’ tariff in the shape of higher costs to honest consumers.
 
 

“To ensure sufficient liquidity in the power market and to align the collection targets with current market realities, the authority has decided to allow recovery loss to K-Electric,” Nepra said, directing K-Electric to ensure collection of 93.35pc of FY24 billing, 93.6pc in FY25, 94.4pc in FY26, 95.19pc in FY27, 95.7pc in FY28, 96.10pc in FY29, and 96.5pc in FY30.
The loss recovery allowance, starting at 93.25pc, was opposed by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division). Although it supported the loss recovery allowance through tariff, apparently to claim similar dispensation for government-owned Discos, it said a lower recovery ratio should be allowed, starting with 96.7pc, and an increase in commercial losses should be benchmarked against efficient Discos to arrive at reasonable targets.
Nepra set the total average tariff at Rs39.97 per unit for FY24, which included a power purchase cost of Rs31.96, transmission cost of Rs2.86, distribution cost of Rs3.31, and supply margin of Rs2.28, with a negative prior-year adjustment of 44 paise per unit to ensure total revenue requirement of Rs606 billion.
Interestingly, the above tariff is based on almost half of the power supply from the national grid; otherwise, K-Electric’s average base rate would have been much higher.
This determination covers a total power dispatch of 17,768 gigawatt-hours (GWh) — 48pc sourced from the national grid, 42pc from K-Electric’s own generation, and 9.9pc from private suppliers.
K-Electric’s total revenue requirement determined by Nepra at Rs606.92bn for FY24 included a supply margin Rs34.68bn, operations and maintenance (O&M) allowance at Rs5.91bn, negative working capital adjustment of Rs1.244bn, recovery loss of Rs36.25bn, gross margin of Rs40.92bn, and net margin of Rs34.68bn after a negative prior-year adjustment of Rs6.69bn.
The power regulator noted that K-Electric’s previous multi-year tariff (MYT) for 2017-23 did not allow any provision on account of recovery loss. Instead, actual write-offs were allowed subject to prescribed criteria.
Considering that FY24 had already lapsed and FY25 was almost 10 months gone, K-Electric’s actual recovery for FY24 remained at 91.5pc, whereas FY25 was expected to close at 90.5pc, it said. The financial impact of these under-recoveries was around Rs40bn and Rs57bn, respectively.
“The authority noted that return allowed to K-Electric for its distribution function is around Rs21.6bn, meaning thereby that effectively K-Electric would be incurring losses for the first two years of MYT, if no recovery loss is allowed to K-Electric. This may compromise the financial viability of the company, which is neither in the interest of the consumers nor power system as whole,” Nepra said.
The regulator said that Discos were not allowed any recovery loss, but the federal government had the power to levy surcharges to offset the inefficiencies of Discos arising from high losses and under-recoveries. However, no such option is available for K-Electric, as it can only charge the regulated tariff.
It said the National Electricity Policy 2021 empowered Nepra to revisit the target for collections and align with the current market realities through “efficient tariff structures for sufficient liquidity in the power market” as “international precedents also suggest that 100pc billing recovery is generally not mandated”.
Solar projects
In a separate development, Nepra approved bidding results of K-Electric’s two solar-powered plants with a combined capacity of 150 megawatts, promising the lowest-ever rates in Pakistan.
Under the determination, Master Textile Mills Limited has been declared the lowest bidder at the lowest offered tariff of Rs11.6508 (4.0363 US cents) per kilowatt-hour for the 50MW Winder project, and Rs11.21 (3.8826 US cents) per kWh for the 100MW Bela project.
The two projects are estimated to bring savings, both in terms of cost and forex outflow, in both national and K-Electric’s grids, by displacing the existing expensive generation, Nepra said.
It added that energy cost savings due to fuel displacement were estimated at Rs2.3bn annually, amounting to a total of Rs57.8bn over the life of the projects. Additionally, the projects are estimated to generate annual foreign exchange savings of $17.01 million, totalling $425.2m in savings over their lifespan.

A mere accounting exercise; an attempt at balancing income and expenditure of the government? Well, the fact is that most budgets in the past have been devoid of any strategic direction.
Now, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb has promised to introduce “bold measures” in the upcoming budget to steer the economy in a “strategic direction”. What he means by bold measures or strategic direction remains unclear.
The only hint he has dropped so far about the “strategic direction” concerns plans to expand the restructured debt management office’s goal “beyond reducing interest payments, and instead create economic value” or ‘Alpha’, a term used in finance to describe an investment strategy’s ability to beat the market, to put the economy on a sustainable growth path.
“That is where we are going to bring very bold measures in the coming budget to give strategic direction where the economy is headed, and change the DNA of the economy and not to just give an account of expenditure and revenue,” he told a gathering on Monday. Besides, he has promised to simplify tax returns for salaried individuals and significantly increase the defence budget next year in view of the Indian threat.
There’s no reason to doubt the government plans to give a strategic direction to the economy in the next budget. That said, the next budget has to primarily focus on fiscal consolidation if the country intends to keep receiving multilateral dollars going forward, as well as avoid the temptation to pump imported growth to stave off another boom-bust episode.
There is already some anxiety in the market regarding the ‘inconclusive’ talks with the IMF on the government’s budget proposals, especially the ones related to the increase in defence spending, tax relief for salaried individuals and the real estate sector, and cuts in public sector expenditures. The fund appears to be concerned over the hole these steps would create in the budget, and wants the authorities to identify alternative sources to cover the gap.
Perhaps the single most important and bold strategic measure that the minister can introduce in the budget relates to reforms focused on increasing the tax base for boosting tax-to-GDP ratio to the globally acceptable range of 18-20pc of the size of the economy.
This will not just create fiscal room for raising the defence expenditure and somewhat reduce the tax burden on salaried households and the corporate sector, but also create room to deepen the recent recovery and push the economy towards sustainable growth.
But it again depends on how the authorities define strategic and whether real tax reforms fall in that category. Nothing can be bolder or more strategic than taxing incomes from the retail, agriculture, real estate and other sectors still operating outside the system.

The explanation came after a member of the five-judge constitutional bench, Justice Shakeel Ahmed, asked whether the law secretary was “competent to clarify” in the notification that judges would not be required to take a fresh oath on their posting to the IHC.
The AGP also explained that no question was raised on the judges’ transfer in the report of the chief justices and registrar of four high courts. He said the then chief justice of the IHC Aamir Farooq was completely independent in determining their seniority while deciding the representation of five IHC judges.
At this, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, who was heading the constitutional bench, observed that the counsel representing the petitioner judges did not apprise the court about the representation moved by the judges the high court and its decision. The attorney general explained that the IHC judges had requested for determination of seniority upon taking the oath.

Justice Aamir had complete independence in determining IHC judges’ seniority while deciding their representation, SC told

Also, Justice Shakeel Ahmed observed that none of the counsel earlier mentioned the representation and subsequent decision by the then CJ of the high court.
The AGP said Article 200 of the Constitution explained the method of transfer of the judges, whereas the power of veto to question any such transfer was with the judiciary and not with the executive. At the time of transfer, all the chief justices had expressed their willingness over the transfer, he added.
But Justice Salahuddin Panwhar observed that an opinion of chief justice on the issue of seniority was never sought.
During the hearing, the bench raised questions whether the authority of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) could be made ineffective by transferring judges on a permanent basis, also asking about any principles for judges’ transfer.
Mr Awar reminded the court that Article 200 could not be made ineffective. Even when the 18th Amendment was made, Article 200 was not changed, he said. The AGP further said, in his opinion, setting a time for transferred judges was like adding new words to the Constitution.
When Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan said that the minutes of JCP meeting held on Feb 10 should be provided, the AGP explained that two additional judges were appointed to the IHC in Jan 17 meeting of the commission whereas in the subsequent JCP meeting held on Feb 10, IHC CJ Aamir Farooq was elevated to the Supreme Court.
Justice Afghan asked if acting IHC CJ Sardar Sarfaraz Dogar, too, was among those on the list to be considered for elevation by the JCP on Feb 10, the AGP replied in affirmative.
The AGP requested the court to reject petitions of the PTI founder and others by declaring them as inadmissible.  On the other hand, the KP Advocate General said he supported the arguments advanced by lawyers on behalf of the petitioners.
The AGP took the position that a judge was brought for a limited time only when the number of permanent judges of the high court was complete.

A.T.M. Azharul Islam, from the Jamaat-i-Islami party, and who has been in custody since 2012, was acquitted of crimes against humanity by the Supreme Court, which ordered his release.
Azharul Islam, who was born in 1952, was among six senior political leaders convicted during the tenure of Sheikh Hasina, whose 15-year-long autocratic rule as prime minister ended in August 2024 when a student-led revolt forced her to flee.
Political parties, including Jamaat-i-Islami, are readying for hugely anticipated elections which the interim government has vowed will take place by June 2026 at the latest.
Islam’s lawyer Shishir Monir said he was “fortunate” because the five other senior political leaders who had been convicted — four from Jamaat-i-Islami, and another from the key Bangladesh National Party (BNP) — had already been hanged.
“He got justice because he is alive”, Monir told reporters. “The appellate division failed to review the evidence in other cases for crimes against humanity.”
Azharul Islam had been sentenced to death in 2014 for rape, murder and genocide during the 1971 military operation.
Hasina banned Jamaat-i-Islami during her tenure and cracked down on its leaders.
Azharul Islam appealed in 2015, but the court upheld the verdict in 2019, and he filed a review petition in 2020.
Hasina, 77, fled to India last year as crowds stormed her palace, and she remains there in exile.

• Babusar Top receives heavy snow; authorities say extreme conditions likely to persist through May 31
ISLAMABAD: Seven people were killed and over two dozen others sustained injuries on Tuesday as severe rain and windstorms swept through parts of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as well as Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).
This is the second time in a week that a storm of such intensity wreaked havoc in many parts of the country, damaging crops, properties, and other  infrastructure. At least 19 people were killed and over 90 others  injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains had battered many areas in Islamabad, Punjab and KP on Saturday.
On Tuesday, two people were killed and around 20 injured after a thunderstorm swept through various parts of Punjab. The storm, accompanied by heavy rainfall, strong winds, and hail, caused widespread destruction.
According to Rescue 1122, a passenger van overturned due to rain and dust storm on Ghazi-Lawrencepur Road near Ghazi Interchange in Attock, which resulted in the death of one passenger and left five others injured.
Separately, four children aged between nine and 12 years were injured when the wall of their house collapsed during the windstorm in Rehmo village of Attock district.  Also, a 25-year-old woman received multiple injuries when the roof of her house collapsed in the same area. An 11-year-old girl was critically injured when the wall of her house in Saghirabad area of Attock collapsed.
According to the Rescue 1122’s provincial headquarters, a man was killed after lightning struck him in Mianwali’s Kalabagh.
The district experienced multiple emergencies including a wall collapse that left one person injured at the Makkharwal police station and a falling solar panel that inju­red another resident.
In Gujran­wala, a young girl fell from roof due to powerful gusts.
In Taunsa Sharif, a woman was injured when the wall of her house collapsed.
Three people, including two children, were inj­ured in Rawalpindi as gusty winds battered the garrison city in the afternoon.
According to the PDMA, these ext­r­eme conditions are likely to persist through May 31, with upper and central Punjab districts inc­luding Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala and Faisalabad, facing the highest risk.
Two killed in KP
In Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, two people lost their lives and another 10 sustained injuries in rain-related incidents.
Rains lashed many areas of the province, leaving several people injured.
A child died while four others were injured in a roof collapse incident in Swabi. Another person died and three members of the same family were injured in a lightning strike in Shangla district. In the Mattani area of the provincial capital, three persons were injured when the roof of their house collapsed, while another one was injured in another rain-related incident in the Badershi area of Nowshera district.
The upper parts of the Hazara division on Tuesday received heavy downpour and snowfall, blocking the Karakoram Highway to all sorts of traffic at two locations in the Lower Kohistan.
“The floodwater carrying heavy rocks and stones from nearby mountains blocked the Karakoram Highway at two points in our district,” Mohammad Duraj, an official from Rescue 1122, Lower Kohistan, told reporters. Babusar Top, the highest point in the Kaghan Valley, received heavy snowfall, significantly dropping temperatures across the district.
KP’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) in a statement issued here said that the spell will continue till May 30. It said the rain caused widespread damage to the crops.
PDMA said wheat, vegetables and fruit crops were badly damaged in Mardan and its surrounding areas due to the hailstorm. Besides, rains also disrupted the power supply across the province as 113 of Peshawar Electric Supply Company tripped due to rain and thunderstorm.
Three killed in AJK
In Kashmir, three women lost their lives and a man went missing while several properties were damaged after a “cloudburst-induced flood” wreaked havoc in a suburban area of Muzaffarabad on Tuesday afternoon, officials said.
Saeed Qureshi, a senior director at the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), told Dawn that the “cloudburst” triggered a flood in a water channel in Balgran village, located around 35 kilometres from Muzaffarabad on the right bank of the Neelum River, at about 4pm.
Among the victims were Zaiwar Jan, 75, and her daughter Shireen Bibi, 35, who died when the raging current swept into their house and filled it with mud.
Station House Officer (SHO) of Panjgran Iftikhar Awan, who spoke to Dawn from the affected village, said the mother’s body was recovered immediately, while the daughter’s body was later pulled from the debris.
In another severely affected house nearby, rescuers found 35-year-old Gori Bibi critically injured and unconscious. She was rushed to the Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Patikka, where she succumbed to her injuries later in the evening.
 
 

Gori Bibi’s father, 65-year-old Jalal Deen, was reported missing.
“We have been trying to locate him, but to no avail,” said SHO Awan.
Videos shared by residents showed muddy water gushing through the ground floor of the village’s main mosque, which was built almost along the course of the water channel, where water flow is usually minimal. According to SHO Awan, the flood, which lasted for about half an hour, completely destroyed the mosque.
Mr Qureshi from the SDMA said initial assessments indicated partial damage to 20–25 houses and the mosque. However, SHO Awan feared that the figure could be higher. “At the moment, our priority is to assess the human losses. Material damages will be evaluated in daylight on Wednesday,” he said.
Separately, in Islamabad, the district administration decided to move billboards out of the city after a hoarding fixed at the National Press Club collapsed due to a windstorm that had also uprooted several trees.

Speaking to reporters in Islamabad, Aleema claimed that court cases involving her brother were being manipulated, and that petitions were being removed from cause lists under pressure.
“I want to tell the unseen forces that I am ready to negotiate,” she said.
“They should tell us what Imran has done to them. Instead of fearing Imran and his sisters, they should speak to me directly.”
She further alleged that these hidden elements were exerting undue influence on judges and parliamentarians, calling for transparency and direct dialogue.
Later, she attempted to meet her brother at Adiala Jail but was denied access, though her two other sisters and several lawyers were granted a meeting.
In a separate media talk in the neighbouring garrison city, Aleema Khan questioned Pakis­tan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chair­man Barrister Gohar Ali Khan over his repeated claims that Imran Khan would be released before Eidul Azha, which will fall on June 7. “If he has good news, he should share it with party workers,” she said.
She said the PTI was preparing for massive nationwide protests, while clarifying that Imran Khan had no plans to summon workers to Islamabad because he was aware that “snipers are stationed in the capital to target them”.
She stressed that Mr Khan had clearly said he could spend the rest of his life in jail if it was in the country’s best interest.
Gandapur criticises federal govt
Meanwhile, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Min­ister Ali Amin Gand­apur, standing alongside her, criticised the federal government and judiciary, blaming the 26th Amend­ment for the current political instability.
He claimed that the amendment had worsened the situation and vowed to repeal it once his party returned to power.
Mr Gandapur reiterated that the Feb 8 general elections were rigged and that PTI’s mandate was ‘stolen’. “There is no case against Imran Khan, and there is no justification for keeping him behind bars,” he said.

• Meets commercial banks, regulators, industry bodies to gather input for budget
• Stakeholders agree incentives must make digital payments more appealing than cash
• Ceramic tile manufacturers say import dependence cut from 74pc to 4pc
• New digital financing model being developed to support small-scale farmers
ISLAMABAD: As part of pre-budget consultations with stakeholders, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Tuesday promised to shift the tax burden away from the salaried class and documented sector to others through digitisation, and hinted at major steps towards the compulsory use of digital payments to maximise a cashless economy and increase documented transactions.
A Ministry of Finance team, led by the minister, had a series of meetings with commercial banks, development financial institutions, regulators and industrial representatives, including ceramics manufacturers and steel producers, to discuss policy measures for inclusion in the next year’s federal budget.
 
 

Some of the proposals finalised during these meetings are believed to be strategic in nature to capture most of the undocumented economy through digitisation, including additional tax measures on cash transactions, incentives on digital payments and outrightly blocking cash payments in certain critical sectors to be identified by the Federal Board of Revenue with the support of Karandaaz, the Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited and the banking sector.
One of the meetings on accelerating Pakistan’s transition to a digital and less cash-dependent economy finalised a host of measures for inclusion in the federal budget to expand access to digital financial services, encourage the use of digital transactions, and reduce reliance on cash in everyday economic activity.
The meeting decided to fine-tune measures for the budget given the fact that digital payment options were widely available and accessible across various sectors, including retail, services and public sector transactions.
The participants supported steps that would encourage broad-based interoperability, leveraging Raast instant payments system in particular, leading to improved consumer choice in using digital payments platforms, according to a statement.
The meeting agreed that creating a more level playing field between cash and digital transactions was essential, and that incentive structures should be rebalanced to make digital payments more attractive and cost-effective for both consumers and businesses.
The importance of imp­r­oving cost structures related to digital transaction infrastructure, including merchant acquisition and service provision, was taken as a priority to enable wider outreach, especially for small merchants and underserved communities.
The finance minister believed that moving towards a cashless economy was not simply a policy aspiration, but a practical necessity for long-term fiscal resilience, competitiveness and inclusive growth.
“Digitalisation is the foundation of a modern financial system. We must move with urgency and coordination to create a payments environment that is inclusive, interoperable, and focused on ease of use for every Pakistani citizen,” he said.
Engagements with industry
In a meeting with a delegation of the All Pakistan Ceramic Tiles Manufacturers Association (APCTMA) and Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSA), Mr Aurangzeb said the government was committed to shifting the tax burden away from the already compliant formal sector and the salaried class towards segments of the economy that have so far remained undocumented or under-taxed.
The prime minister is personally leading high-level meetings to drive forward reforms that enhance transparency, documentation and economic equity across all, he said, adding that broadening the tax base is essential to achieving fiscal balance and promoting fairness in the economy. The ceramic tiles manufacturers reported the manufacturing capacity at about 560,000 square metres per day, backed by over Rs100 billion in investments, nearly 60 per cent of which is foreign direct investment from China. They said the industry has reduced import dependency from 74pc to just 4pc and now relies almost entirely on local raw materials and labour.
The minister also assured the delegation that reforms in the energy sector were a top policy priority and envisaged a series of measures aimed at improving affordability, ensuring reliability, and moving towards a more efficient and targeted energy pricing structure.
He also pledged to simplify regulatory procedures, reduce compliance burden, and create a stable and predictable policy environment to attract further investment.
Credit access for small farmers
The finance minister also chaired a meeting of the Task Force on National Initiative to Unlock Un-Collateralised Credit for Small Farmers Through Tech-Driven Solutions. He reviewed the recommendations for the National Subsistence Farmers Support Initiative, aimed at unlocking uncollateralised financing for small-scale farmers through innovative, technology-based solutions and enhanced access to credit.
The proposed scheme would employ an end-to-end digital process to ensure transparency, efficiency, and a seamless customer experience.
Designed as a federal programme with nationwide coverage, the initiative aims to align provincial and national efforts to boost agricultural productivity, enhance food security, and contribute meaningfully to GDP growth through inclusive agri-development.
A revised scorecard was presented by the task force with a greater emphasis on agronomic factors — raising the weightage of agronomy from 40pc to 60pc — while maintaining a 40pc weight on financial indicators, thereby rebalancing priorities to better reflect the realities of smallholder farming.
The prototype scheme, developed by the Ministry of Finance’s Task Force on Access to Finance, calls for a multi-bank and microfinance institution (MFI) delivery model implemented through a unified methodology, ensuring wide outreach and operational standardisation across financial institutions.
It was decided to make the entire process time-bound and action-oriented to achieve lasting impact and then replicate a parallel, tech-supported model for the dairy and livestock segment, as most smallholder farmers maintain herds but faced difficulties in securing financing for livestock acquisition, maintenance, and dairy product marketing.
The delegation of Large Steel Producers raised critical challenges facing the steel industry, including high energy costs, regulatory inconsistencies, and the need for a stable policy environment to ensure long-term investment and growth. They also highlighted the impact of taxation policies on formal businesses and sought government support to level the playing field.
The finance minister promised to resolve these challenges and reiterated that every sector must play its role in stabilising and growing the economy.
“We cannot allow the burden to fall solely on the formal sector and the salaried class,” he was quoted as saying, adding that the government was pursuing a broad-based strategy to expand the tax base, reduce reliance on over-taxed segments and bring the undocumented economy into the fold.

• ECP lawyer says declaration given by independents to join PTI not accepted by commission
ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on Tuesday questioned the Sunni Ittehad Council’s (SIC) standing in the reserved seats case, noting that the original order had allocated seats to the PTI and not SIC.
Headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the 11-judge bench resumed the hearing on a set of petitions seeking to revisit the July 12, 2024, majority judgement.
The issue about the locus standi of SIC cropped up when Justice Musarrat Hilali questioned the party’s counsel, Faisal Siddiqi, whether he was representing PTI or SIC.
“Did PTI authorise the counsel to advance the arguments on their behalf too and did SIC know the counsel is also advocating for PTI since it may undermine their interest?” the judge observed.
The counsel said he has a “right to support the majority judgement” and criticised the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for not implementing the apex court’s order after more than 11 months.
The judgement had declared that 41 independents will file duly signed and notarised statements before the ECP within 15 days, explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party — PTI.
Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar wondered whether lawmakers had submitted any declaration indicating that they intended to join PTI after the majority judgment.
If they had submitted the affidavits, then how the SIC can now stand before the court as its members resiled after submitting the declaration, the judge remarked.
The ECP counsel said lawmakers did submit declarations, but the commission did not accept them.
Then these lawmakers are still independent members, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail observed.
The counsel replied that the ECP recognises them as SIC members.
Justice Mazhar interjected, saying the Supreme Court declared these lawmakers independent, irrespective of whether the judgement had been implemented or not.
Mr Siddiqi, who was representing the SIC, argued the objection on the locus standi didn’t apply to the respondents but to the petitioners.
When the lawmakers decided to join PTI, their connection or relation with SIC was terminated, emphasised Justice Mazhar.
He asked the counsel to explain his position, as he could not understand the argument.
The lawyer accepted the judges’ remarks “for the time being” and suspended his argument.
“So you agree that presently these members are independent,” Justice Mandokhail interjected again, adding that if the answer was affirmative, then the question was whether any one of them could even approach the court.
Though conceded, the SIC lawyer said he wanted to argue on the maintainability of the review petitions first. “If these members are independent, then the role of SIC is still intact here,” Justice Mazhar remarked.
Another bench member, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, asked about the “understanding” between PTI and questioned Mr Siddiqi whether the members he was representing belonged to PTI or SIC.
Justice Hilali asked about the symbol on which Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the SIC chairman, contested the elections. She added that Mr Raza himself contested the February 2024 general election as an independent candidate.
“Why did Hamid Raza not contest the election from the platform of SIC?” Justice Hilali asked and expressed her annoyance at Mr Siddiqi for agreeing to answer the questions but later avoiding them.
“What was the philosophy behind SIC members contesting elections as independents?” she wondered.
The counsel explained the lawmakers were not candidates of SIC, but rather independent and the majority judgement classified them as such. Later, they were candidates of the PTI and not independent.
Mr Siddiqi said the court can grant three types of relief — set aside the majority judgement, the consequence of which would be that the Peshawar High Court judgement and the ECP’s decision will be revived. The second being substituting the majority judgement with the minority and the third being the majority judgement set aside and the appeals before PHC revived for re-hearing.
Justice Khan observed that whatever record the majority judgment had relied upon was “not admissible” evidence as per the law. “No one knows which nomination papers — out of four — of these independent candidates were submitted by the ECP during the hearing.” 
He reminded the minority jud­gment, which he and Justice Nae­­em Akhtar Afghan had authored, did not rely on these records since they were not admitted as evidence.
“Therefore, these were not part of the record of the case.”
Justice Mandokhail remarked that it should be left to the court to consider whether the right of any party was being infringed upon or not.
Later, the case was adjourned till Thursday.

An incident report issued by the district headquarters hospital (DHQ) in Wana mentioned a “drone attack” at 8pm, which injured 22 people aged between 13 and 60 years.
The condition of a 13-year-old and a man was listed as “serious”, and they were referred to “tertiary care”. Seven, including three aged 15, 18 and 19 years, had “major” injuries. The rest of the 13 had “minor” injuries, of which two were discharged.
PTI-affiliated MNA Zubair Khan Wazir echoed the hospital’s tally and told Dawn.com, “The young men were playing volleyball when the quadcopter fired shells on them.”
He added that people in the area were “scared and restricted to their homes after the attack”.
Wazir, in a post on Facebook, strongly condemned the “drone attack in which innocent citizens were targeted”. He demanded that the federal government and the relevant institutions “immediately investigate the incident, provide justice to the affected families, and take immediate and effective steps to prevent such attacks in the future”.
“Targeting common people under the guise of an attack on a Taliban post is extremely regrettable, shameful and unacceptable,” Wazir claimed, terming the incident a “part of a heinous conspiracy to sabotage regional peace”.
The incident comes within a fortnight after a suspected quadcopter munitions drop claimed the lives of four children and injured five others in North Waziristan District’s Mir Ali tehsil. The military clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Locals there staged a sit-in for over a week with the victims’ bodies, demanding justice, before finally announcing today that they had ended their protest after reaching an agreement with the local administration.</p><small>2025-05-27 19:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/28001001a558984.png?r=001040' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913657/pakistan-azerbaijan-vow-to-grow-ties-through-investment' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Azerbaijan vow to grow ties through investment</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev renewed their pledge to diversify the strategic partnership through investment in mutually beneficial avenues, Radio Pakistan reported.
The development came as the premier met with President Aliyev after landing in Azerbaijan’s Lachin District earlier today as he continued his four-nation tour to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the recent military confrontation with India.
Starting his expedition on May 25, the premier has already paid a visit to Turkiye and Iran, with Tajikistan his final stop of the trip ending on May 30.
In their meeting today, PM Shehbaz and Aliyev reviewed the “full spectrum of bilateral relations and expressed satisfaction over the upward trajectory of political, economic, defence, and cultural cooperation” between their countries, Radio Pakistan stated.
The prime minister thanked Aliyev’s country for its steadfast support during the recent Pakistan-India confrontation and “acknowledged the public expressions of solidarity from both the leadership and the people of brotherly Azerbaijan”. Earlier this month, Aliyev had congratulated Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s “remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.
He noted that the people of Azerbaijan “celebrated the success of Pakistan in Marka-i-Haq against India”, referring to the Pakistan armed forces’ response to Indian aggression.
A video shared by the government showed President Aliyev greeting the premier with a hug and the two sharing an energetic handshake.
 






The Azerbaijan side agreed to the exchange of delegations regarding progress in its investment in Pakistan, with delegation-level talks to be organised “very soon”, Radio Pakistan reported.
The prime minister reiterated that both countries had stood by each other on every occasion and would continue to do so. He also conveyed his warm felicitations to Aliyev and his nation ahead of the Azerbaijan Republic Day tomorrow.
The two leaders underscored the importance of coordinated efforts to promote regional stability, mutual prosperity and principled positions on key international issues, the report added.
The meeting concluded with both leaders reaffirming their commitment to the deepening of the Pakistan-Azerbaijan partnership and working closely to further advance shared objectives at the bilateral and regional levels.
Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Deputy PM Ishaq Dar, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to PM Tariq Fatemi were also present during the meeting, according to a post on the government’s official X account. Dar, Tarar and Fatemi have been accompanying Shehbaz on the four-nation tour.
 






The leaders also met over a luncheon, according to the government.
“Unity and brotherhood — in the end, that’s all what matters!” posted Dar on his X account. He also shared a video showing glimpses of Aliyev and the Pakistani top leadership having a cordial conversation.
 






Upon his arrival in Lachin, PM Shehbaz was received by FM Jeyhun Bayramov, Pakistan’s Ambassador to Azerbaijan Qasim Mohiuddin and other diplomatic staff, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported, citing a PM Office press release.
The prime minister is set to attend the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Aliyev, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
 






In Istanbul, Shehbaz and Erdogan had “reaffirmed their principled support for each other’s core concerns, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute”. In Tehran, the premier expressed his willingness to talk with India to resolve ongoing issues, including Kashmir and water security.
During his visit, PM Shehbaz will have “wide-ranging discussions with the leaders of these countries on an entire range of issues covering bilateral relations and matters of regional and international importance”, the Foreign Office had said earlier.
“He will also have the opportunity to express the deepest appreciation and acknowledgement for the support extended to Pakistan by the friendly countries during the recent crisis with India,” it noted.
While in Tajikistan — likely the last leg of his tour — the premier will also attend the International Conference on Glaciers being held in its capital, Dushanbe, on May 29 and 30.
COAS Munir, Iran counterpart discuss strengthening defence ties
Separately, COAS Munir, who also visited Istanbul and Tehran alongside PM Shehbaz, met with his Iranian counterpart Major General Mohammad Bagheri.
Gen Munir met with Bagheri at the General Staff Headquarters in Tehran, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a press release today.
The two military leaders engaged in discussions on the “evolving regional security landscape, with particular focus on strengthening bilateral defence ties”, the ISPR said.

“Key areas of mutual interest included enhancing military-to-military cooperation, improving security mechanisms along the shared border, and exploring avenues for transforming the border regions into zones of trade and economic connectivity, thereby contributing to regional stability and prosperity.”
COAS Munir was “accorded a warm welcome upon his arrival, including a ceremonial guard of honour presented by a well-turned-out contingent of the Iranian Armed Forces”, the statement added.
The ISPR stated that COAS Munir was on an official visit to Türkiye, Iran and Azerbaijan — three of the countries on Shehbaz’s itinerary.
The army chief, alongside PM Shehbaz, yesterday met with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian. Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi was also present during the meeting, according to state-run PTV News.
Support from friendly countries
As tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi escalated, with India launching deadly strikes on Pakistan on May 6, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had conveyed his solidarity to the prime minister and said it supported Pakistan’s “calm and restrained policies”.
Following the tit-for-tat airbase attacks and a US-brokered ceasefire between the two neighbours, Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev had “warmly congratulated PM Shehbaz upon Pakistan’s remarkable success”, according to the PM Office.
Iran had also offered to mediate during the escalation and paid a visit to both Islamabad and New Delhi in peace efforts, which were appreciated by PM Shehbaz and the military’s spokesperson.
 
 

The diplomatic support voiced by Turkiye and Azerbaijan stoked anger in India as people cancelled their holidays in popular resorts in the two countries.
The moves intensified as Adani group-operated Mumbai and Ahmedabad airports ended the ground handling concession agreements with Çelebi, an Istanbul-headquartered airport.
Small Indian grocery shops and major online fashion retailers also began a boycott of Turkish products ranging from chocolates, coffee, jams and cosmetics to clothing.</p><small>2025-05-27 19:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606524-aleemas-give-and-take-offer-can-be-considered-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Aleema's ‘give and take' offer can be considered: Khawaja Asif</strong></a><br><p>

The monsoon season wreaks havoc in the metropolis every year as the drains become clogged causing them to overflow.
According to a notification issued by Karachi Commissioner Hassan Naqvi, the ban was imposed under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).
The notification said that throwing waste into the drains “causes serious environmental hazards, discharge of less water, choking of nullahs and a major cause of blockage of the nullahs during the monsoon season”.
 
 

It further said that this “warrants immediate action” to impose the ban “to prevent [the] throwing of garbage, solid waste and dumping of debris and other materials into the nullahs”, barring the people from the above actions.
The order also authorised the police to register complaints against violators under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.
In March, the Karachi administration imposed a similar ban on the dumping of garbage and solid waste debris in drains for two months. The commissioner had said that all private, public and autonomous institutions had been urged to play their due role in improving the city’s sanitation conditions.
KPT issues monsoon alert
Separately, the Karachi Port Trust (KPT) issued an alert on precautionary measures for the monsoon season.
In the alert dated May 26, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the KPT listed the steps which would be taken as safety measures for heavy rains, wind and flooding.
The measures included close monitoring and assessments of the safety of ships, ensuring mooring lines were set optically, and all pilots were to be on standby.
The alert also said, “Small boats are to be parked at locations less prone to wind and water pressures and to be properly secured.”
“Perform periodic maintenance for electrical items and standby generator should be readily available on short notice,” it added.</p><small>2025-05-27 18:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606517-at-least-six-killed-as-heavy-rains-dust-storms-hit-parts-of-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>At least six killed as heavy rains, dust storms hit parts of Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>

For over a week, the locals in Mir Ali had been staging a sit-in, demanding justice in the wake of a suspected strike that took place in Hurmuz village on May 19 during the daytime, leaving four children of the same family dead and injuring five others, including a woman. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) clarified that security forces were “falsely implicated” in the incident and that it was carried out by the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Allama Iqbal Dawar, one of the organisers, told Dawn.com that following a series of talks held between the protesters and officials, both sides reached an agreement on late Monday night.
The bodies of the deceased have been buried, and the roads previously blocked by the protesters are now open, while officials are set to meet the affected families and announce compensatory measures soon.
Additionally, Mufti Baitullah, spokesman for the Jirga, also announced the agreement while addressing the protesters in a video seen by Dawn.com. Baitullah was seen lauding the Jirga members for playing a positive role in the whole affair.
When approached by Dawn.com, District Police Officer Waqar Ahmad confirmed that the agreement had been signed but did not reveal any details about the pact.
Similarly, Mir Ali Tehsildar Sher Bahadar told Dawn.com that a four-point agreement had been reached. However, he too did not elaborate any further.
However, North Waziristan Deputy Commissioner Mohammad Yousuf Karim told the local media that he had held thorough talks with the tribal leaders, assuring them that the government and the army would pay “serious attention” to the safety of the residents during operations against the militants.
Last week, the local elders had threatened to march to Islamabad to protest against the drone strike in case their demands were not met.</p><small>2025-05-27 18:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/27182314aa0dc58.jpg?r=201429' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913674/three-dead-multiple-injured-as-rains-batter-kp-and-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Three dead, multiple injured as rains batter KP and Punjab</strong></a><br><p>At least three people lost their lives and multiple others were injured as strong winds and thunderstorms lashed several parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab on Tuesday.
In Swabi District, a two-year-old child died when a boundary wall and roof collapsed in the Manki village, according to Rescue 1122 official Nabeel Khan.
Nabeel told Dawn.com that the incident occurred due to strong winds and storms, adding that the toddler’s mother and another child were injured and taken to a hospital.
In another incident, he said the roof of a shed collapsed in Ziarat Cham Baba, trapping a mother and her son under the debris, who were pulled out of the rubble by locals and taken to a hospital.
In Shangla District’s Bisham tehsil, lightning struck a house, killing one person and leaving six others unconscious, Rescue 1122 official Rasool Khan Sharif said.

A young man was injured when a wall collapsed in the Rahimabad area due to a storm, according to a statement by the Nowshera Rescue 1122. The medical teams and ambulances reached the spot and took the person to the hospital, the statement added.
Separately, a total of seven people were injured in Peshawar in various rain-related incidents, according to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi.
Two people were injured after a billboard of the Hayatabad Cricket Stadium fell on their car in Peshawar, Faizi said, noting that rainwater inundated the roads in the city, causing inconvenience to people.

A roof and wall collapse in Mattani village injured three people, while another person was injured in the collapse of a wall in the city’s Garhi Qamardin area. A solar panel fell on Phandu Road and injured a person.
Earlier today, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) warned that the district administrations to take precautionary measures as more rain and gusty winds were expected in the upper and central parts of the country.
At least 19 people were killed over 90 others injured as powerful windstorms and heavy rains battered several parts of the country on Saturday, paralysing road and air traffic, damaging infrastructure and triggering widespread power outages.
Many of the casualties were caused by the walls and roofs of the houses collapsing and trees falling on them, according to the PDMA.
The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) had forecasted most of South Asia to experience above-normal rainfall and above-average temperatures during this year’s southwest monsoon season from June to September.
One killed, 8 injured across Punjab
Meanwhile, at least one person was killed and eight others were injured in the rains across Punjab, according to Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmed.
One person died due to lightening in Mianwali’s Kala Bagh Bazaar. Another person was injured in Mianwali the wall of the Makarwal police station collapsed due to strong winds.
In Rawalpindi, two children were injured by a falling object from the roof and one person was injured by falling from ladder.
A 22-year-old woman was injured after a mud house collapsed in Attock. In Gujranwala, a girl fell from the roof into the courtyard due to strong winds. A solar panel fell from the roof due to strong winds in Miaoli, injuring one person.
In Islamabad, strong winds persisted for an extended period, toppling trees and billboards, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The intense weather conditions prompted motorists to take shelter under bridges to protect their vehicles from a possible hailstorm, the report said, adding that motorcyclists sought refuge under flyovers to shield themselves from the strong gusts.
The Punjab PDMA urged citizens and provincial authorities to remain on high alert.
PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia directed deputy commissioners and rescue agencies across the province to remain alert amid reports of wind and rain in various districts of Punjab, a statement by the PDMA said.
“Relevant departments to be on alert to deal with emergency situations,” the statement read, adding that the provincial control room and all district emergency operation centres have also been alerted.
The situation was being monitored 24/7 in the PDMA control room, DG Kathia said.
He added, “Citizens should be careful and stay away from electric poles and hanging wires.
“Stay in safe places to avoid lightning. Never stay in open places during bad weather and lightning. Avoid unnecessary travel and drive slowly.”</p><small>2025-05-27 18:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/271913311b9374e.png?r=003041' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913684/pakistan-to-celebrate-eidul-azha-on-june-7-as-zilhaj-moon-not-sighted' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to celebrate Eidul Azha on June 7 as Zilhaj moon not sighted</strong></a><br><p>The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee (RHC) on Tuesday announced that it has not sighted the Zilhaj moon, meaning Pakistan would observe Eidul Azha on June 7.
The committee’s meeting took place on a roof in Islamabad’s Kohsar Block, where the religious affairs ministry has its office.
Addressing a press conference, RHC Chairman Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad said, “No testimony of sighting the moon of the month of Zilhaj was received from any part of Pakistan […]. Therefore, it was decided with consensus that Zilhaj 1, 1446AH would be on May 29, Thursday and Eidul Azha would be observed on June 7, Saturday.”
He noted that the weather remained cloudy in most parts of the country and clear in some.
Maulana Azad presided over the meeting of the RHC earlier in the evening, with officials and experts from other departments also gathered to sight the moon.
Simultaneous zonal meetings of the RHC also took place at their respective headquarters in the provincial capitals to send testimonies.
Dr Mohammad Hasan Ali, director of the Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics at the Pakistan Meteorological Department; Shaukatullah Khan of the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco); and Zainul Abedin from the science and tech ministry were among those present during the meeting, Azad said.
Earlier this week, Suparco predicted that the festive occasion of Eidul Azha would likely be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.
 
 

According to Suparco, while the birth of a new moon for Zilhaj 1446 AH would occur on May 27, the possibility of the moon being sighted across the country today would be extremely low even under optimal weather conditions.
Cloudy weather reported in the federal capital further reduced the sighting probability.
Celebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.</p><small>2025-05-27 16:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2717442548e6498.jpg?r=175256' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913654/nab-to-auction-six-bahria-town-properties-in-rawalpindi-islamabad-on-june-12' target='_blank'><strong>NAB to auction six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi, Islamabad on June 12</strong></a><br><p>The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Tuesday announced a public auction of six Bahria Town properties in Rawalpindi and Islamabad on June 12.
The development adds on to NAB’s previous actions against property tycoon Malik Riaz, who owns Bahria Town and is an absconder in the £190 million Al Qadir Trust Case.
In a notification today, NAB listed six properties of the project owned by tycoon Malik Riaz, including five in Rawalpindi and one in Islamabad.
The properties were being auctioned to recover the defaulted amount of a plea bargain under Section 33E of the NAB Ordinance 1999, it added.
NAB media director Birj Lal Dosani confirmed the details to Dawn.com, stating that the amount was being recovered in connection with corruption charges under a plea bargain.
 
 

Earlier this year, the watchdog warned the public against investing in Bahria Town’s Dubai project and began extradition efforts for Riaz and his son.
In February, NAB [filed] a reference against Riaz, ex-Sindh chief minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Minister Sharjeel Memon, and others for land transfer to Bahria Town. The watchdog also filed two corruption references for unlawf­u­lly acquiring 4,500 kanals of state land in Rawalpindi’s New Murree for Bahria Golf City and Takht Pari forest area.
In March, NAB said it had sealed “numerous” commercial and residential properties of Bahria Town in Karachi, Lahore, Takht Pari, New Murree/Golf City, and Islamabad over corruption cases filed against Riaz. It had also frozen hundreds of bank accounts and vehicles of Bahria Town.
Separately, a Rawalpindi Accountability court had issued non-bailable arrest warrants for Riaz and his son, Ali Ahmed Malik, in the Takht Pari reference.
NAB has multiple times warned the public to “avoid any attractive inducements from Bahria Town and to protect their hard-earned savings”.
 
 

According to senior counsel Khawaja Haris, a plea bargain agreement was considered successful if an accused confesses to a crime and then agrees to return the money in return for “a lighter punishment”.
From 2000 to 2022, the accountability watchdog recovered Rs65 billion through plea bargain out of a total of Rs91.55bn, a NAB official told the Supreme Court in 2022.</p><small>2025-05-27 14:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606460-ruet-e-hilal-committee-meeting-underway-for-zil-hajj-moon-sighting' target='_blank'><strong>Zil Hajj moon not sighted, Eid ul Adha to be celebrated on June 7</strong></a><br><p>

The SAFE borrowing scheme, backed by the EU’s central budget, was proposed by Brussels in March as the bloc rushes to boost its defences.
Finalised by member states earlier this month, the text received final approval at a meeting of European ministers in Brussels, with 26 countries voting for and one abstention, the presidency said.
EU countries had haggled at length over what the money could be spent on and how countries outside the bloc could access the funds.
In the end, the agreement stuck to the original proposal, allowing 35 per cent of the value of the weapons to come from manufacturers beyond the bloc and Ukraine.
France’s Europe minister Benjamin Haddad called SAFE “a major step forward” that asserts “a very clear principle of European preference to support our industries, reduce our dependencies, including from the US, and invest in Europe’s strategic autonomy.”
“But it is just one step — and we will need to go further,” Haddad told reporters in Brussels.
The borrowing programme is part of a package of measures, including loosening budget rules that Brussels says could potentially unlock 800bn euros of defence spending.
The approval of SAFE came after the EU and the UK agreed a new defence partnership as part of a post-Brexit “reset”.
London would still need to strike a separate deal with the EU if it wants to fully open the new scheme to the British defence industry.</p><small>2025-05-27 13:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606462-sindh-govt-bans-gifting-ajrak-traditional-cap-in-school-ceremonies' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh govt bans gifting ajrak, traditional cap in school ceremonies</strong></a><br><p>

Youm-i-Takbeer is observed on May 28, marking the historic day when Pakistan became an atomic power.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last year declared a public holiday throughout the country on account of Youm-i-Takbeer, the day when Pakistan’s defence became impregnable after conducting nuclear tests in the hills of Chagai, Balochistan in 1998.
The School Education Department has sent a letter to all district education authorities.
It stated that educational institutions will remain open and hold special programmes to celebrate the day with a “positive social message for peace and courage”.
The letter added that May 28 is a “significant day that marks a milestone in our nation’s history, symbolising strength, resilience, and technological advancement”.
It said all schools will conduct activities including morning assembly special programmes, national anthem and prayers, and pay tribute to the Pakistan Army.
All schools will hold speech competitions on the topic of “Significance of Youm-i-Takbeer”, “Pakistan’s Journey to Becoming a Nuclear Power”, and “National Security and Patriotism”. They will also organise arts and posters as well as national songs competitions.
The competitions will be held at the district level in all public schools across Punjab. The top winner of each category at the district level will be awarded a prize of Rs50,000.
The department has urged all schools to participate in these activities and competitions to celebrate the day.
“Students and staff will make a pledge to work for the betterment, peace, and scientific progress of Pakistan,” it added.
At the conclusion of the ceremony, summer vacations shall be declared.</p><small>2025-05-27 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606444-no-holiday-for-punjab-schools-on-may-28' target='_blank'><strong>No holiday for Punjab schools on May 28</strong></a><br><p>

Indian state-run Aeronautical Development Agency, which is executing the programme, will shortly invite initial interest from defence firms for developing a prototype of the warplane, envisaged as a twin-engine 5th generation fighter, the ministry said.
The project is crucial for the Indian Air Force, whose squadrons of French, Russian and ex-Soviet aircraft have fallen to 31 from an approved strength of 42 at a time when rival China is expanding its air force rapidly.
Pakistan has one of China’s advanced warplanes, the J-10, in its arsenal, which it claims to have used to shoot down India’s latest French Rafale jets in the recent fighting.
 






Militaries of nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan faced-off in four days of fighting this month, which saw use of fighter jets, missiles, drones and artillery by both sides before a ceasefire was announced by US President Donald Trump.
 
 

It was the first time both sides utilised drones at scale and the South Asian powers are now locked in a drones arms race, according to Reuters’ interviews with 15 people, including security officials, industry executives and analysts in the two countries.
India will partner with a domestic firm for the stealth fighter programme, and companies can bid independently or as a joint venture, the defence ministry said in a statement, adding that the bids would be open for both private and state-owned firms.
In March, an Indian defence committee had recommended including the private sector in military aircraft manufacturing to shore up the capabilities of the Indian Air Force and reduce the burden on state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, which makes most of India’s military aircraft.
 
 

Indian Air Chief Marshal Amar Preet Singh has previously criticised Hindustan Aeronautics for slow delivery of light combat Tejas aircraft, a 4.5 generation fighter, which the firm blamed on slow delivery of engines from General Electric due to supply chain issues faced by the US firm.</p><small>2025-05-27 10:03</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/27141811b7e0e8d.jpg?r=141822' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913643/policeman-on-polio-duty-gunned-down-in-balochistans-noshki' target='_blank'><strong>Policeman on polio duty gunned down in Balochistan’s Noshki</strong></a><br><p>A policeman guarding a polio vaccination team was gunned down on Tuesday by unknown attackers in Balochistan’s Noshki district, according to an official.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are the only countries where polio remains endemic, and vaccination teams are frequently targeted by militants waging a campaign against security forces.
Noshki Deputy Commissioner (DC) Amjad Hussain Soomro confirmed the “unfortunate incident” to Dawn.com, in which Waheed Ahmed was gunned down in Noshki’s Killi Muhammad Hassni district.
He said that police have set up checkpoints at various places to search for the attackers, who will be arrested soon.
DC Soomro noted that security of the health department staff working on the anti-polio campaign has been further beefed up.
He added that the anti-polio campaign is continuing even after the terrorist incident and the targets given to the anti-polio teams in Noshki district for this national cause will be completed soon.
Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind confirmed that the martyred was a resident of Jalalabad, Noshki.
“The polio campaign is a national duty, and any attack on it is intolerable,” Rind said in a statement, paying tribute to the slain officer who “sacrificed himself while on duty”.
“This attack is a conspiracy to sabotage the national campaign and spread fear and panic,” Rind added.
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the attack in Noshki and offered heartfelt condolences to the family of the bereaved.
He noted that the courage and sacrifice of polio officials “[inspires] us all to save our children from this crippling disease.”
The president reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to fully eradicating polio.
“We have the tools, the will, and the support of our global partners to make this vision a reality,” he said in a statement issued today. “I call on parents to open their doors to vaccinators, ensuring every child receives the life-saving polio drops.
“I urge teachers, religious leaders, and community elders to champion this noble cause, dispelling myths and building trust. I appeal to the media to amplify the truth: the polio vaccine is safe, effective, and our best weapon.”
He reiterated his support for his daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, “whose tireless advocacy and efforts has galvanized our nation in this fight against polio”.
“Today, I also pay tribute to our brave polio workers, who risk their lives to reach every child, often in the face of grave danger.
“We also honour those polio workers and security officials who have made the ultimate sacrifice, losing their lives to cowardly attacks aimed at derailing our efforts to make Pakistan polio-free,” he said.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the incident and affirmed that strict action will be taken against militant elements targeting the polio campaign, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and said that an attack on the team tasked with securing the safe future of children is intolerable.
Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar strongly condemned the incident, describing it as a “cowardly and inhumane act.”
He emphasised that targeting the polio campaign is equivalent to attacking the future of innocent children. While paying tribute to the martyred official, the minister hailed him as a “hero of the nation.”
Kakar warned that any effort to derail the polio campaign would be seen as a direct challenge to the writ of the state, and affirmed that the government will deal with terrorists with an iron fist.
Yesterday, two polio workers were abducted by armed assailants in Tank district while performing their duties in the Dolat Koruna area as part of the ongoing vaccination drive which kicked off on Sunday.
 
 

The Pakistan Polio Programme launched the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad.
The campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.
