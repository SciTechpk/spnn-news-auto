The accident in Sabasaba, in the Kilimanjaro region, on Saturday evening occurred after one of the bus’s tyres punctured, causing the driver to lose control.
“A total of 38 people died in the crash, including two women,” a presidency statement said, adding that 28 others were wounded.
“However, due to the extent of the burns, 36 bodies remain unidentified,” the presidency said.
Six of the injured were still in hospital for treatment, it added.
Deadly crashes are frequent on Tanzania’s roads.
In a 2018 report, the World Health Organization estimated that 13,000 to 19,000 people in Tanzania were killed in traffic accidents in 2016, far higher than the government’s official toll of 3,256.</p><small>2025-06-29 14:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29155911d339338.webp?r=160028' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921009/at-least-8-dead-13-injured-in-rain-related-incidents-across-gb-punjab-and-sindh-officials' target='_blank'><strong>At least 8 dead, 13 injured in rain-related incidents across GB, Punjab and Sindh: officials</strong></a><br><p>At least eight more people were killed and 13 injured on Sunday in separate rain-related incidents across Karachi, some areas of Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan, according to rescue officials.
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities. According to rescue officials, at least 32 people have been killed across four provinces over the last two days as heavy rains triggered flash floods and damaged houses. Meanwhile, some people lost their lives due to electrocution.
On Sunday, Rescue 1122 issued a statement outlining 11 new casualties in Lahore as a result of rain-related incidents.
“Rescue 1122 received 10 emergency calls about collapsing walls in different parts of the city,” the statement read. “One woman was killed and 10 others were seriously injured. They were moved to various hospitals and received medical aid in Rescue Emergency ambulances.”
The statement added that there were also reports of falling trees across Lahore; however, there were no fatalities or injuries.
“Rescue 1122 staff are present at the highways and are removing fallen trees from the roads,” the statement added.
However, in a separate report, Rescue 1122 said that a billboard fell due to the intense rain and wind and fell on a motorcyclist and his family in Lahore.
According to Rescue 1122, the 50-year-old motorcyclist was killed, while his 35-year-old wife and child were injured, bringing the overall death toll to eight. The casualties were transported to Jinnah Hospital.

In Karachi, two people, including the younger brother of former lawmaker and PPP Karachi leader Javed Nagori, were electrocuted in rain-related incidents, according to officials and relatives.
City Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Arif Aziz told Dawn.com that Abdullah Anwar, 41, was sitting at a meeting place in Khadda Market near Sumair Arcade in Lyari, where an electric wire had fallen.
He said Anwar attempted to plug something into a rainwater-drenched wall socket when he suffered an electric shock and died. The SSP said the victim was dead with the wire in his hand when the police arrived.
The body was moved to the Civil Hospital Karachi, where doctors confirmed the cause of death as an electric shock, said police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed.
Nagori, while speaking briefly to Dawn.com, confirmed that the victim was his younger brother.
In another incident, a young man was electrocuted in the metropolis’ Clifton area. Boat Basin Police Station House Officer Malik Riaz Niazi said the man, in his early 30s, was passing by the Parklane Hospital when he apparently touched a wet electric pole and suffered an electric shock.
The body was moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) for legal formalities, where his identity could not be ascertained immediately.
Earlier in the day, rescue official Sherbaz Khan confirmed to Dawn.com that two sisters died after being swept away by flood waters in the Kargah Nala of Gilgit Baltistan.
Meanwhile, in Punjab’s Sharifpura, two people were killed and one injured when the roof of a mud house collapsed. The bodies and injured were shifted to Services Hospital, according to Rescue 1122.
Heavy rains were recorded in various districts of Punjab over the past 24 hours, according to Irfan Ali Kathia, Director General of the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
Lahore Airport recorded 65 mm of rain, while 32mm was recorded in Chakwal and 14mm in Dera Ghazi Khan 14. Rain was also recorded in Attock, Noorpur, Thal, Narowal, Kasur, Jhang, Toba, Tek Singh, Bhakkar and Khanewal.
“This spell of monsoon rain will likely continue until July 1,” Kathia was quoted as saying.
“Monsoon rains are also expected across most districts of Punjab in the next 24 hours,” he said.
The DG urged citizens to take precautionary measures and stay in safe places during thunderstorms.
“Keep the speed of the vehicle slow and maintain a reasonable distance. In case of emergency, contact PDMA helpline 1129.”
Wasa Lahore instructed to be on full alert amid heavy rainfall
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz directed the Water and Sewage Authority (Wasa) to remain on full alert in Lahore as heavy rains and strong winds began in various parts of the city.
Rain was recorded in Lakshmi Chowk, Qurtaba Chowk, Mazang, Data Nagar, Islampura, Shahdara, Ek Moria, Bhati Gate, Baghbanpura and Gulshan Ravi.
The Punjab CM directed senior Wasa officials to keep all main highways and underpasses clear, with pumps and staff ready at all underpasses.
Instructions were issued to keep all generators on standby with their fuel supply ensured, while field teams were instructed to remain active.
 






It was recommended that disposal stations be run on generators in areas with power outages, with the pumps of all disposal stations being kept clean and operational.
All town directors were directed to maintain complete monitoring of their towns.
Glof warning issued in Gilgit
The GB Disaster Management Authority issued a warning of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOF) and flash floods.
“Due to intense heat and the western weather system, the ice in the glaciers of GB is melting rapidly, resulting in an increased risk of glacial floods and flash floods.
 
 

“This situation can pose a serious threat to communication roads, bridges, agricultural lands and human life and property,” the alert said.
The public and tourists were requested to ensure their safety and avoid unnecessary travel in extreme or uncertain weather conditions.
They were also advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.
“The public is urged to avoid staying unnecessarily on glaciers, river banks or bridges, cross floodwaters on foot or any vehicle, and remember the instructions issued by rescue agencies.”
The district administration reiterated in its alert that natural disasters can strike at any time, and necessary precautions should be undertaken.  “In case of any emergency, immediately contact the district control room at 920724-05811.”</p><small>2025-06-29 14:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/291851214ae4243.png?r=185331' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921018/peace-committee-leader-among-3-gunned-down-in-lakki-marwat-police' target='_blank'><strong>Peace committee leader among 3 gunned down in Lakki Marwat: police</strong></a><br><p>The leader of a peace committee and two of his companions were shot dead by terrorists in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat district on Sunday, according to police officials.
The incident reflects the escalating militant presence in Lakki Marwat, where attacks have become more frequent in recent months despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.
Shahid Khan, a spokesperson for Lakki Marwat police, told Dawn.com that the head of the Shahab Khel peace committee was heading to Qabol Khel when he was attacked in the Kara Wanda area.
“The peace committee chief Ghulam Dastagir alias Fauji and his friends Saleem Khan and Salahuddin were killed,” Shahid told Dawn.com. “A search operation was launched in the area after the incident.”
Peace committee officials in KP have been targeted in the past by terrorists. In April, there were two incidents targeting peace committees, one of which was in Lakki Marwat.
On April 29, a fierce gun battle was reported between members of a local peace committee and suspects — who allegedly killed an elderly man and wounded his relatives — in the district’s Begukhel area.
Earlier in April, a blast at a peace committee office in the South Waziristan district on Monday killed at least seven people, police and health officials said.
Wana City police Station House Officer (SHO) Usman Nazir told Dawn.com that seven people were killed and 16 others were also injured in the blast, which took place around 11am on April 26.
“Five of the injured were in critical condition,” he said. “The peace committee office was the target, as there was a meeting going on there at the time of the explosion.”
The SHO added that peace committee member Saifur Rehman was injured in the attack, “but his condition was not critical”.</p><small>2025-06-29 14:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29181921ecf7bea.jpg?r=182049' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921016/50pc-increase-in-fixed-gas-charges-notified-for-domestic-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>50pc increase in fixed gas charges notified for domestic consumers</strong></a><br><p>The government on Sunday notified a 50 per cent increase in fixed gas charges for domestic consumers, according to a notification from the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra).
On Friday, the federal cabinet’s Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved the hike in fixed gas charges for all consumers from July 1. The ECC decided to increase fixed charges by 50pc for domestic consumers and shift the partial burden to bulk, power sector and industrial consumers.
According to the Ogra notification,  seen by Dawn.com, fixed charges for domestic consumers in the Protected category have risen to Rs600 from Rs400, while those in the non-protected category have to pay Rs1,500 as opposed to the previous charge of Rs1,000.
For non-protected consumers exceeding consumption of 1.5 cubic hectometres (hm³), the price has risen to Rs3,000 from Rs2,000.
Though the fixed charges have been increased, the price of gas itself has not risen, according to the notification. The sale prices for both Protected and Non-protected consumers remain the same. Additionally, gas prices for tandoors, commercial units, compressed natural gas and ice factories remain unchanged.
However, gas prices for general industries, power stations and independent power producers have risen.
Last month, Ogra determined about 6.6pc (Rs117 per unit) increase in prescribed natural gas prices to meet about Rs890 billion revenue requirement of the two gas companies during 2025-26.
In a determination sent to the federal government, Ogra worked out the average revenue requirement for Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) at Rs354bn for the next fiscal year and determined its prescribed price at Rs1,659 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu) or about Rs104 per unit reduction from Rs1,762 per mmBtu in FY25.</p><small>2025-06-29 13:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611543-at-least-20-dead-in-kp-rains-as-crackdown-on-illegal-riverbed-hotels-launched-after-swat-tragedy' target='_blank'><strong>Crackdown initiated against Swat's illegal riverbed hotels as 20 dead in KP rains</strong></a><br><p>

All but one of the 242 people on board the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner were killed when it crashed in the western city of Ahmedabad on June 12. Authorities have identified 19 others who died on the ground, but a police source told AFP after the crash that the toll was 38.
India’s minister of state for civil aviation, Murlidhar Mohol, said the investigation was looking at “all angles” when asked specifically about possible “sabotage”, in an interview with Indian news channel NDTV.
“It has never happened before that both engines have shut off together,” Mohol said earlier in the interview, in reference to theories by some experts of possible dual-engine failure.
The minister added that until the investigation report is published, it would be premature to comment on the cause.
The team appointed to investigate the crash started extracting data from the plane’s cockpit voice and flight data recorders this week, in an attempt to reconstruct the sequence of events leading to the disaster.
Air India has said that the plane was “well-maintained” and that the pilots were accomplished flyers.</p><small>2025-06-29 12:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/291404061d21ca8.jpg?r=140959' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921004/pm-launches-app-that-allows-power-users-to-send-their-meter-readings-to-power-companies' target='_blank'><strong>PM launches app that allows power users to send their meter readings to power companies</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday formally inaugurated the ‘Apna Meter, Apna Reading’ power smart mobile application — an initiative aimed at promoting transparency in the billing process by allowing consumers to take their own meter readings and send them to their respective power companies.
The initiative aims to phase out the role of meter readers in power distribution companies (Discos) across the country amid frustration by power consumers. The current pro rata system removes electricity consumers from the ‘protected category’ or pushes them into the next slab, leading to higher bills.
Speaking at a ceremony to launch the app, the prime minister said the initiative is a revolutionary step undertaken by the government as part of power sector reforms over the past year.
“We implemented reforms in the power sector, but we have a long way to go. We brought merit-based appointments to the boards of Discos, and took strong action against the corrupt mafia,” he said.
PM Shehbaz said that the minister of energy made stringent efforts and held tough negotiations with independent power producers (IPP) that eventually led to reduction in electricity prices by Rs7.5 per unit.
“We settled circular debt after negotiations with banks. When global oil prices were falling, we took advantage and reduced electricity prices,” he said, adding that despite concerns, the government made the tough decision to rebase prices and not pass the burden to consumers.
The prime minister announced that the Pakistan Television (PTV) fee will be abolished from electricity bills. Consumers are currently charged Rs35 monthly PTV fee through electricity bills.
PM Shehbaz said the biggest challenge is power theft worth Rs500bn annually, and efforts are being made to curb the menace.
He reaffirmed that the government will not discourage solar power as it is the cheapest form of electricity. “Pakistan is one of the countries with the largest growth in solar energy production,” he said.
He said the main beneficiary of this app will be the power consumers. “It is a revolutionary technology, it will benefit every consumer in every home,”  adding that the power division should raise awareness among consumers to use the app, which has been introduced in five languages.
 






Federal Minister of Energy Awais Ahmed Leghari also spoke on the occasion and said the initiative aims to give the responsibility of the meter reader to the consumers.
He said power consumers under the ‘protected category’ consuming less than 100 units received higher bills due to delayed or flawed meter reading. He said the government returned Rs10bn in overbilled amounts last year and efforts are being made to ensure transparency in the billing process.
In a statement earlier, the Power Division said the new feature allows electricity consumers to take a picture of their electricity meter on a specified date and upload it to the app, based on which their monthly bill will be issued.
The aim of this system is to provide an effective solution to long-standing problems such as overbilling, reading errors and delay in reading.
“This is not just a technology feature but a concrete reform in governance, which truly empowers consumers. With this system, consumers will not only be able to keep track of their bills, but now they will also be the guardians of the reading process,” it added.
According to the salient features of the app, if the user provides the reading on the due date, the meter reading taken after that day will not be given priority, and only the reading provided by the user will be fed.
This system is especially beneficial for those consumers who are eligible for a government subsidy. The bill for consumers consuming up to 200 units of electricity is about Rs2,330, but with an increase of just one unit, the bill reaches Rs8,104.
“Through this app, it will be possible to ensure that the beneficiaries benefit from their subsidy by providing timely readings,” the statement read.
“This will not only create transparency in the electricity system but will also allow consumers to monitor their own billing. This will significantly reduce overbilling, unnecessary interference and complaints,” the power division concluded.</p><small>2025-06-29 12:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/291652079b50d83.jpg?r=165349' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921014/2-terrorists-killed-2-arrested-in-balochistans-duki-district-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>2 terrorists killed, 2 arrested in Balochistan’s Duki district: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Security forces on Sunday killed two terrorists and apprehended two others during an operation in Balochistan’s Duki district, a statement from the military’s media wing said.
The statement, issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), said that security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in the area upon the suspected presence of terrorists..
During the operation, security forces “effectively engaged the Indian-sponsored terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, two Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell, while two terrorists were apprehended,” the ISPR said.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were seized from the dead terrorists, who, according to the military’s media wing, remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area.
“[A] sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the statement concluded.
Earlier this month, seven terrorists belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Hindustan were neutralised in two separate operations in Balochistan, the military’s media wing said.
An IBO was conducted in the general area of Mach in Kachhi district on the reported presence of the terrorists, the ISPR said.
“During the conduct of operation, [the] troops effectively engaged the Fitna al Hindustan terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the statement said.
In another IBO conducted in the general area of Margand in Kalat district, a terrorist hideout was busted and two terrorists were successfully neutralised, ISPR said.
Despite heightened military tensions between Pakistan and India last month, militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country, according to data released by an Islamabad-based independent think tank.
The monthly security assessment issued by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) recorded 85 militant attacks in May as compared to 81 in April, resulting in 113 fatalities. These included 52 security forces personnel, 46 civilians, 11 militants, and four peace committee members.</p><small>2025-06-29 12:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29150342540f37d.jpg?r=151933' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921005/president-declares-justice-dogar-senior-most-ihc-judge-in-revised-seniority-list' target='_blank'><strong>President declares Justice Dogar senior-most IHC judge in revised seniority list</strong></a><br><p>President Asif Ali Zardari on Sunday declared Justice Sarfaraz Dogar the “senior-most judge” of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), according to a fresh seniority list released by the Ministry of Law and Justice.
The development followed the Supreme Court’s verdict on June 19, declaring the transfer of IHC judges constitutional and referring the matter of seniority determination to the president. Earlier this year, the law ministry’s transfer of three judges to the IHC had disrupted the seniority list.
On Friday, however, five judges of the IHC challenged the SC’s decision to uphold the transfer of three judges —  Justice Sardar Dogar from the Lahore High Court (LHC), Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the Sindh High Court (SHC), and Justice Muham­mad Asif from the Balochistan High Court (BHC).
According to the latest seniority list, Justice Dogar was designated as the most senior judge of the IHC, while the two other judges, Justice Soomro and Justice Asif, were ranked 9th and 11th, respectively.
President Zardari also declared that the status of the transfer of all three judges would be permanent.
The controversy had begun on Feb 20 when five IHC judges — Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Justice Babar Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz — had filed a representation, contending that under the Constitution, a high court judge must take a new oath upon transfer to a different high court, which should affect their seniority ranking.
 
 

According to the petition, the inter se seniority of the transferred judges should be determined from the date they took oath as justices of the IHC. Consequently, they should be placed lower in the seniority list than the petitioner judges.
The five judges also did not attend Justice Dogar’s oath-taking ceremony as the acting IHC chief justice.</p><small>2025-06-29 10:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611524-pm-shehbaz-vows-not-to-discourage-solarisation-boom-pledges-relief-for-consumers' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz vows not to discourage solarisation boom, pledges relief for consumers</strong></a><br><p>

At least 19 people have been killed and six others injured in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa amid heavy rains and the consequent flash floods and landslides, according to data from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA).
KP Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Bilal Faizi said the child’s body was recovered from Charsadda and shifted to a hospital.
“He will be shifted to his native area in an ambulance,” Faizi said.
“One person remains missing and a search operation is underway.”
According to Faizi, a total of 17 people were reported missing on Friday when torrential flash floods triggered by heavy rains affected several areas in Swat and Malakand divisions.
Four people were rescued, while 11 bodies had been recovered. Today, a 12th body was recovered, leaving one person who remains missing.
Separately, the body of a young man who drowned in a flooded river in Lower Dir two days ago has been recovered in Charsadda, according to Faizi.
“The rescue team had been conducting continuous search operations for the past two days, after which the body was found,” Faizi said.
In yet another incident, two youth drowned in the Indus River in Balyani Akazai in KP’s Hazara division.
According to rescue spokesperson Rabnawaz Yousufzai, one youth jumped into the river to cool off from the heat. A second youth saw him drowning and jumped in to rescue him, but both were swept away by the strong current.
A third youth also jumped in to save his companions but was unsuccessful and barely managed to return to the river bank.
Following the incident, locals are helping search for the missing bodies.
More rains, floods expected across KP in next 24-48 hours
More rain is expected in the next 24-48 hours across most districts of KP, according to a statement from KP PDMA.
Flooding is expected in Swat, Chitral, Abbotabad, Mansehra, Peshawar, Bannu and Waziristan. An increase in the water level is expected in Swat River and Panjokra River and its tributaries, PDMA said.
Low-level flooding is expected in the Kabul River over the next 48 hours.
“Land sliding and flooding in local rivers and canals is likely in mountainous areas. PDMA has issued alerts to district administrations to take precautionary  measures,” the statement said.
Rescue 1122 and other relief teams have been directed to utilise all available resources.
PDMA has directed local administration to control traffic at sensitive places and highways, as well as direct travelers on national highways and provincial highways to take precaution. It was also directed that alternative routes be made for traffic flow.
“Ensure the cleanliness of rivers and drains and drainage systems to avoid urban flooding,” PDMA said.
The public was requested to take shelter in safe places during wind, hail and thunderstorms, while institutions were directed to disseminate weather alerts in local languages.
Farmers were directed to harvest crops early and store them in safe places, while cattle farmers were directed to protect their livestock.
“PDMA’s Emergency Operations Center is fully functional. The public should report any untoward incident to 1700,” the statement said.</p><small>2025-06-29 09:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611502-president-zardari-notifies-justice-sarfraz-dogar-as-ihc-senior-most-judge' target='_blank'><strong>President Zardari notifies Justice Sarfraz Dogar as IHC senior-most judge</strong></a><br><p>

The appeal was filed on Saturday, two days before the Judicial Commission of Pakistan’s (JCP) meeting to appoint chief justices to at least three high courts on July 1.
In its judgement anno­unced on June 19, the Supreme Court’s Const­itutional Bench, had held by a majority of 3-2 that the transfer of three judges to IHC from Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan high cou­rts was within the framework of the Constitution.
The Constitutional Ben­ch had also partially sent the matter to the president to determine seniority amongst judges, based on their service records.
Now, IHC’s justices Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri, Babar Sattar, Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan and Saman Rafat Imtiaz, who originally challenged the transfers, have filed an intra-court appeal (ICA) against the June 19 judgement.
The ICA, jointly moved by senior counsel Muneer A. Malik and Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed, urged the court to set aside the order in the interest of justice.
While the appeal is heard, the Supreme Court should grant an interim relief against the judgment, the applicants pleaded.
The five judges have requested the Supreme Court not to consider justices Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, Khadim Hussain Soomro and Muhammad Asif as judges of IHC until they take fresh oaths in accordance with Article 194 Justice Dogar is also the acting chief justice of IHC.
The appeal contended that Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act 2010 only provides for the appointment of judges to the IHC from other provinces but makes no reference to transfers.
 
 

The appeal contended that the June 19 order impermissibly reads in “permanent” in Article 200(1) and (2) of the Constitution when no such language was contained in the provision.
The appeal pleaded that the constitutional bench had misunderstood the provisions of Article 200 by reading sub-article (1) in isolation from other provisions of the article by not holding that transfers envisioned in Article 200(1) were only for a temporary and time-specified period.
The order also failed to interpret of articles 200 and 175A, without scuttling and undermining the powers of JCP under Article 175A of the Constitution, the appeal argued adding the independence of judiciary does not allow bestowing onto the executive a much more expansive power than what the text of Article 200 and the foundational principles of constitutional law can bear.
The concept of federalism also mandates that the provincial authority’s role in the permanent filling of vacancies of judges must not be usurped, it added.
The June 19 judgment had partially remanded the matter to the president to determine the seniority after examining the service record of the transferred judges as soon as possible, including the question of whether these transfers were permanent or temporary.
The powers of the president under Article 200(1) are two distinct provisions dealing with different situations and niceties and neither do they overlap nor override each other, the verdict explained, adding the transfer by the president by means of Article 200 cannot be construed as a fresh appointment, the judgment had held adding the powers of transfer conferred to the president by the framers of the Constitution cannot be questioned on the ground that if the posts were vacant in IHC then why they were not filled up by JCP through fresh appointments.

There were no immediate reports of casualties from the shallow quake, which USGS reported had occurred at around 3:30am with the epicentre almost 60 kilometres north-northeast of Barkhan city of Balochistan.
Senior levies officer Tuqeer Shah told Dawn.com that the Earthquake hit vast areas of Rara Shaim, Kingri and others.
According to initial reports, at least three people, including a couple, were injured in the Rara Shaim area of Barkhan after the roof of their house sustained damage. Over half a dozen houses have been damaged, while cracks have appeared in many others in Rara Shaim.
Shah added that the injured have been admitted to the hospital, while teams have been sent to the impacted areas to see the scope of the damage.
Pakistan straddles the boundary where the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates meet, making the country susceptible to earthquakes.
The region can be challenging to navigate during crisis situations — in 2015, a 7.5-magnitude quake in Pakistan and Afghanistan killed almost 400 people across rugged terrain that impeded relief efforts.
The country was also hit by a 7.6-magnitude quake in 2005 that killed more than 73,000 people and left about 3.5 million homeless, mainly in Azad Kashmir.
Balochistan saw a quake in 2021 that killed at least 20 people and left more than 10 injured, with landslides hampering initial rescue efforts in the remote mountainous district of Harnai.</p><small>2025-06-29 07:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29115737e896b55.png?r=115837' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920986/71-killed-in-israeli-strike-on-tehrans-evin-prison-iranian-judiciary-spokesperson' target='_blank'><strong>71 killed in Israeli strike on Tehran’s Evin prison: Iranian judiciary spokesperson</strong></a><br><p>Israel’s attack on the Evin prison in Iran’s capital, Tehran on June 23 killed 71 people, Iranian judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Sunday.
At the end of an air war with Iran, Israel struck Tehran’s jail for political prisoners, in a demonstration that it was expanding its targets beyond military, civilian and nuclear sites to aim at symbols of Iran’s ruling system. According to Iranian health ministry figures, 610 people were killed on the Iranian side in the 12-day war, 13 of them children and 49 women, before a ceasefire went into effect last week.
“In the attack on Evin prison, 71 people were martyred, including administrative staff, youth doing their military service, detainees, family members of detainees who were visiting them and neighbours who lived in the prison’s vicinity,” Jahangir said in remarks carried on the judiciary’s news outlet Mizan.
 
 

Jahangir had previously said that part of Evin prison’s administrative building had been damaged in the attack, and people were killed and injured. The judiciary added that the remaining detainees had been transferred to other prisons in Tehran province.
Evin prison holds a number of foreign nationals, including two French citizens detained for three years.
“The strike targeting Evin prison in Tehran, put our citizens Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris in danger. It is unacceptable,” France’s Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had said on social media X after the attack.

In the mid-19th century, the concept of the ‘Muslim Ummah’ found immediate traction among the Muslims of South Asia. According to the historian Mubarak Ali, the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid I actively promoted a policy of pan-Islamism, in an attempt to strengthen the Ottoman Empire and bolster the empire’s standing against European powers.
Ali wrote that one of the reasons this idea became popular among most South Asian Muslims was that, after the decline of over 500 years of Muslim rule in India, Muslims suddenly became conscious of their minority status in the region. Some Muslim scholars tried to come to terms with the rise of European colonialism by shaping a reformist variant of Islam as a way to adapt to Western modernity. This then evolved into becoming a demand for a Muslim-majority nation-state in the region.
The concept of the nation-state had been evolving in Europe from the 18th century. By the early 20th century, it had become one of the most powerful ideas in the world. It was a geographical idea about territory with well-defined borders within which populations that shared cultural, political and economic ideals and interests resided.
In the late 1930s, Muslims of India warmed up to this idea. Led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, they looked to create a modern Muslim-majority nation-state (Pakistan), where they would be able navigate their own destiny without any interference from the “Brahmin Hindu hegemony”, which Jinnah’s party feared India would become after the departure of British colonialists.

As globalisation frays the fabric of civic nationalism, nation-states from India to Russia are embracing an older identity model — the civilisation-state

As opposed to a nation-state, what the 19th century Ottoman Sultan was offering was a ‘civilisation- state.’ A civilisation-state is a political entity that identifies itself with a continuous cultural or historical civilisation. So, the Sultan was proposing a broader Muslim state built on shared civilisational traits.
During the post-colonial era, when empires had all but crumbled and the West had raced ahead in the fields of politics, economics and science, the idea of the civilisation-state looked cumbersome and regressive. The idea of the nation-state seemed more suitable to the post-colonial order. But these states had to accept certain universalities to be accepted in the community of nation-states. These universalities included human rights, democracy, freedom of religion, international laws etc.
The concept of the nation-state was largely based on ‘civic nationalism’ and pluralism, even though nation-states founded on a particular faith or ethnicity were tolerated as long as they accepted the universalities.
 


The concept of civilisation-state is not new as such, but the term is. It was coined in the 1990s with the emergence of ‘globalisation’. Increased interconnectedness and interdependence between nations began to weaken traditional boundaries and the authority of the nation-state. According to the American scholar Francis Fukuyama, globalisation led to a decline in national identity, diminishing the power of the nation-state. The rise of populism in the last 15 years or so is often seen as a reaction against globalisation and against the consequential decline of nationalism and/or national identities.
The bid to secure these resulted in radical (right wing) nationalism, but it rejects the pluralism and the universalities that were inherent in the idea of the nation-state. This radical nationalism then began to mutate, becoming a ‘civilisational nationalism’ that looks to create civilisation-states. In most cases, it is the already existing nation-states that are seeking to change their ideological disposition in this regard.
Russia is an example. After the demise of Soviet communism and of the Soviet Union itself, the civilisation-state is a recurring theme in the rhetoric and political discourse of Russia’s long-time ruler Vladimir Putin. He insists that Russia is not just a nation-state but a unique civilisation with its own historical, cultural and spiritual identity, separate from ‘Western civilisation.’
India is another example. The government of Narendra Modi, which came to power in 2014, has increasingly described India as a civilisation-state because, apparently, it predates colonial rule and Muslim invasions. Emphasis is put on the centuries-long practice of Hinduism, which dates back to the Bronze Age. Modi’s perception of India as a civilisation-state is therefore at odds with the secular and diverse nature of Indian society, enshrined in the Indian constitution. This has led to the ‘othering’ of minority groups, especially Muslims.
Turkiye under Recep Tayyip Erdogan (since 2001) has been positioning itself as a civilisation-state, undercutting the Turkish nationalism/republicanism first established by the founder of modern Turkiye, Kamal Ataturk. Erdogan defines Turkey’s identity and foreign policy as rooted in its long history and cultural heritage, encompassing various empires and civilisations that have existed on Anatolian soil — especially the Ottomans.
Iran too sees itself as a civilisation-state or as the continuation of an ancient civilisation, despite it being an Islamist theocracy since 1979. China also explains itself more than just a nation-state. It sees itself as a civilisation with a continuous cultural identity that spans millennia.
Interestingly, far-right parties and populists in the United States, and in many European countries too, have started to call their nation-states as civilisation-states, despite the fact that Europe is the birthplace of the idea of the nation-state. However, like in India, the emphasis in this regard in these regions also is more on ‘nativism’. In this case, white nativism. This marginalises non-white groups.
Pakistan has experimented with two competing narratives to add elements of the civilisation-state to its nationalism. The first sees the country as a continuation of ancient civilisations that emerged on the banks of the River Indus. The other sees the country as an outcome of the initial spread of Islam from the confines of Arabia.
According to the British political philosopher Christopher Coker, more and more governments and movements have been using the currency of civilisation for their policy ends. He wrote, “At the level of consciousness, political regimes are tapping into more primal identities.”
Coker spoke of ‘Mythopoeia’ — the process of making myths. According to him, “Mythopoeia took place in the West and in the East. Two opposing forces, cosmopolitanism and nativism, now confront each other, revealing how the imagination can shape identities in bizarre ways and how intellectuals in cahoots with a political class can hoodwink both themselves and others.”
The civilisation-state can be understood as a tool for a state that wants to legitimise the power of a particular kind of political system. Its overarching theme is the rejection of the aforementioned universalities and the insulation of societies from the influence of other civilisations. Civilisation-state may have a broader meaning, but its intent is largely myopic.

Lawmakers voted 51-49 to open debate on the 940-page megabill, with two of Trump’s fellow Republicans joining Democrats to oppose the legislation that would fund the president’s top immigration, border, tax-cut and military priorities.
Trump on social media hailed the “great victory” for his “great, big, beautiful bill”.
 


After hours of delay, during which Republican leaders and Vice President JD Vance worked behind closed doors to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the measure, Democrats demanded that the megabill first be read aloud in the chamber — a task that could delay the start of the debate until Sunday afternoon.
Democrats say the bill’s tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of social programs for lower-income Americans.
“Senate Republicans are scrambling to pass a radical bill, released to the public in the dead of night, praying the American people don’t realise what’s in it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor.
“Democrats are going to force this chamber to read it from start to finish,” he said.
Once the bill has been read, lawmakers will begin up to 20 hours of debate on the legislation. That will be followed by a marathon amendment session, known as a “vote-a-rama,” before the Senate votes on passage. Lawmakers said they hoped to complete work on the bill on Monday.
 
 

Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Rand Paul voted against opening debate, a move that seemed for a time to be in danger of failing.
Trump attacked Tillis, who opposed the bill’s cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for lower-income Americans, which he said would be devastating for his native North Carolina. Tillis is up for reelection next year.
“Numerous people have come forward wanting to run in the Primary against ‘Senator Thom’ Tillis. I will be meeting with them over the coming weeks,” the president posted.
Paul opposed the legislation because it would raise the federal borrowing limit on the $36.2 trillion US debt by an additional $5tr.
“Did Rand Paul Vote ‘NO’ again tonight? What’s wrong with this guy???” Trump said on social media.
In limbo
Saturday’s vote was in limbo for hours as Vance, Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other top Republicans sought to persuade last-minute holdouts to support the legislation. It was not clear what deals, if any, were struck to win over their support.
Hardline Republican Senators Rick Scott, Mike Lee and Cynthia Lummis, who want deeper cuts in federal spending, voted to support the bill in the end. Another hardliner, Senator Ron Johnson, initially voted no but flipped his vote and backed the legislation.
Trump was monitoring the vote from the Oval Office late into the night, a senior White House official said.
The megabill would extend the 2017 tax cuts that were Trump’s main legislative achievement during his first term as president, cut other taxes and boost spending on the military and border security.
The nonpartisan Joint Tax Committee released an analysis projecting that the Senate bill’s tax provisions would reduce government revenue by $4.5tr over the next decade, increasing the $36.2tr US government debt.
The White House said this month the legislation would reduce the annual deficit by $1.4tr.
The world’s richest person, Elon Musk, also took a swipe at the bill, which would end tax breaks for the electric vehicles that his automaker Tesla manufactures.
Calling the bill “utterly insane and destructive,” he risked reigniting a feud with Trump that raged earlier this month, before Musk backed down from his rhetoric.
“The latest Senate draft bill will destroy millions of jobs in America and cause immense strategic harm to our country!” Musk wrote in a post on his social media platform X.
Medicaid changes
Republicans from states with large rural populations have opposed a reduction in state tax revenue for Medicaid providers, including rural hospitals. The newly released legislation would delay that reduction and would include $25 billion to support rural Medicaid providers from 2028 to 2032.
The legislation would raise the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes to $40,000 with an annual 1pc inflation adjustment through 2029, after which it would fall back to the current $10,000. The bill would also phase the cap down for those earning more than $500,000 a year.
That is a major concern of House Republicans from coastal states, including New York, New Jersey and California, who play an important role in keeping the party’s narrow House majority.
Republicans are using a legislative manoeuvre to bypass the Senate’s 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation in the 100-member chamber.
Democrats will focus their firepower with amendments aimed at reversing Republican spending cuts to programs that provide government-backed healthcare to the elderly, poor and disabled, as well as food aid to low-income families.
The bill also would raise the Treasury Department’s debt ceiling by trillions of dollars to stave off a potentially disastrous default on the nation’s debt in the coming months.
If the Senate passes the bill, it will then return to the House of Representatives for final passage before Trump can sign it into law. The House passed its version of the bill last month.</p><small>2025-06-29 06:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611490-tunisian-girl-set-to-be-repatriated-after-social-media-love-marriage-ends-in-divorce' target='_blank'><strong>Tunisian girl set to be repatriated after social media love marriage ends in divorce</strong></a><br><p>

According to reports, a resident of Haseeb Town allegedly posted blasphemous content from his social media account, which subsequently went viral within the local community.
The content reportedly contained inflammatory sectarian comments, inciting discord among the residents of surrounding rural areas.
In the other incident, a resident of village 105/12-L was accused of sharing a video containing sectarian content and using hate speech against religious sects. Police claimed his mobile phone contained a video attacking revered religious figures.
Police started investigation but so far no arrest has been made in the cases.
BOOKED: A district and sessions judge booked ASI Maqsood Ahmed, a reader and two constables of the Yousafwala police for illegally detaining a citizen.
As per details, Shahid Ali, a resident of village 83/D Pakpattan, was returning home after a medical check-up when he was arrested by ASI Maqsood Ahmed near Ada Jahan Khan on June 22. The police officials also took two mobile phones and Rs10,000 cash from Shahid. His father, Abass Ali, inquired about the arrest but the police failed to satisfy him.
Later, his father filed a writ petition under section 491 in the court of D&SJ, Sahiwal. The court sent a ballif to Yousafwala police station and found that Shahid had been arrested in an old robbery case under section 288 of the PPC.
The judge found the case to be fake and also found the police record faulty and booked the officials under section 342 of the PPC and 155-C of Police Order for illegally detaining Shahid Ali. No arrest has been made so far by the police.

According to officials, a 17-year-old student reportedly suddenly developed fever, body aches and vomiting on June 25. A day later, he was admitted to the Aga Khan University Hospital where he tested positive for the deadly infection. On June 27, his condition deteriorated and he was shifted to ventilator support.
The patient had no history of swimming, the officials said and added that apparently he contracted the infection through the contaminated, or non-chlorinated, tap water.
According to experts, lack of filtration and chlorination of potable water is a major source of Naegleria’s infection. Besides, city’s water distribution system is faulty, allowing seepage of sewage in the domestic water supply lines, which in turn gets contaminated and causes harmful diseases.
Karachi recorded this year’s first death from Naegleria fowleri in March. The woman victim was a resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal and died at a private hospital in Karachi on Feb 23.
Commonly known as “brain-eating amoeba”, Naegleria fowleri is responsible for the disease called Primary Amoebic Meningoencephalitis (PAM). The infection is fatal in 98 per cent of the cases.
A free-living amoeba, Naegleria, is commonly found in warm fresh water (such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs) and soil. Only its one species, Naegleria fowleri, infects people. The germ cannot survive in cool, clean and chlorinated water.
It infects people when water containing the amoeba enters the body through the nose. This typically happens when people go swimming, diving, or when they put their heads under fresh water, like in lakes and rivers.
The amoeba then travels up the nose to the brain where it destroys the brain tissues and causes the PAM.
The first symptoms of the PAM usually start about five days after infection that may include headache, fever, nausea, or vomiting. Later symptoms can include stiff neck, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, seizures, hallucinations, and coma.
After symptoms start, the disease progresses rapidly and usually causes death within five days.

Information collected by this scribe about the excessive use of ecstasy pills and ice by local youth unfolds a horrifying situation as the drug is now considered an essential ‘ingredient’ in social gatherings like weddings, engagements and other festive or recreational ceremonies owing to its easy availability throughout Khyber.
Locals said that a majority of youth had gone out of the control of their parents or other family members as those two ‘lethal’ drugs were easily available in designated shops, kiosks, private houses and hujras and even outside educational institutions and sports grounds where those could be supplied through motorcycles or young carriers by using mobile phone service in all the three tehsils of Khyber.
Ghafoor Shah, a social activist in Landi Kotal, said that local drug addicts invented their own names for different types of ecstasy pills like Firoun, Trump, Kabaiga, Silver and Local, depending upon the ‘efficacy’ of those drugs.

Experts say effects of these drugs include hallucination, memory loss and psychosis

He said that such pills were openly offered to users during different types of parties at varying prices while reluctant or refusing youngsters were then ‘administered’ those pills either in a cool drink or green tea to make them addicts.
Ayaz Khan, a resident of Jamrud, told this scribe that initially parents were not aware about the negative effects of those drugs and ignored warnings by close relatives about addiction of their sons to ice and ecstasy pills but now they were mostly helpless to prevent such addicts from use of drugs.
Dr Feroz Shah, a health expert, was equally apprehensive about the spiralling use and sale of such lethal drugs and cautioned about serious health complications as their long term implications.
He said that excessive use of ecstasy pills mainly affected the central nervous system with short term or immediate effects such as increase in heartbeat, fast breathing and an addict becoming more alert, awake for a long time and talkative and in highly joyous mode.
“These are the signs and effects of these highly addictive pills, which attract most of our unemployed and depressed youth towards it with little or no knowledge of their worst side effects on their health,” he said.
He said that being highly addictive, long term effects of ecstasy pills could include depression, hallucination, memory loss, psychosis and other related mental issues among young users.
Dr Feroz Shah argued that most of addicts themselves or their relatives did not report those matters to doctors for possible treatment or therapy for fear of social stigma and lack of awareness about possible rehabilitation of addicts.
Sources said that absence of a specialist psychiatrist at the district headquarters hospital was hampering psychological treatment of such addicts as medical professionals contended that so far no proper medicine was discovered for treatment of such patients, except psychiatric counselling.
With Khyber police regularly claiming seizure of varying quantities of different types of illegal drugs, sources at Wazir Dhand market in Jamrud alleged that the illegal business was ‘thriving’ unhindered as police accepted ‘monthly’ from drug dealers.
They said that big time drug dealers ‘deputed’ their touts at different convenient points in the vicinity of Wazir Dhand market, situated on the border with Peshawar, to provide ice and ecstasy pills to interested buyers after issuing them a token for easy identification.
They said that currently Wazir Dhand market was considered the main ‘repository’ of illegal drugs including heroin, charas, ice and ecstasy pills with local police in complete knowledge of the daily ‘wheeling and dealing’ by dealers.
Replying to Dawn queries about the rise in use and sale of these drugs, DPO Rae Mazhar Iqbal claimed police seized huge quantity of drugs. He said that the menace could be wiped out with collective efforts.

Netanyahu was indicted in 2019 in Israel on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust - all of which he denies. The trial began in 2020 and involves three criminal cases.
“It is INSANITY doing what the out-of-control prosecutors are doing to Bibi Netanyahu,” Trump said in a Truth Social post, adding that the judicial process was going to interfere with Netanyahu’s ability to conduct talks with Palestinian militants Hamas, and Iran.
Trump’s second post over the course of a few days defending Netanyahu and calling for the cancellation of the trial went a step further to tie Israel’s legal action to US aid.
“The United States of America spends Billions of Dollar [sic] a year, far more than on any other Nation, protecting and supporting Israel. We are not going to stand for this,” Trump said.
Netanyahu “right now” was in the process of negotiating a deal with Hamas, Trump said, without giving further details. On Friday, the Republican president told reporters that he believes a ceasefire is close.
Hamas has said it is willing to free remaining hostages in Gaza under any deal to end the war, while Israel says it can only end if Hamas is disarmed and dismantled. Hamas refuses to lay down its arms.
Interest in resolving the Gaza conflict has heightened in the wake of the U.S. and Israeli bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities. A ceasefire to the 12-day Israel-Iran conflict went into effect early this week.</p><small>2025-06-29 03:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/29105816592aab4.jpg?r=105829' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1920917/swat-victims-funeral-held-in-daska' target='_blank'><strong>Swat victims funeral held in Daska</strong></a><br><p>NAROWAL:Funeral prayers for nine members of a family who drowned in the Swat River were offered in Daska, Sialkot, on Sunday.
A large number of grieving relatives and thousands of citizens attended the ceremony as the victims were laid to rest in their ancestral graveyard.
The bodies of the victims, who were swept away by flash floods on Friday, were brought to Daska by ambulances.
Among the deceased were 45-year-old Rubina Kausar, and her daughters 20-year-old Tazmeen and 16-year-old Shermeen, whose funeral prayers were held at Darul Uloom Madina, Daska.

On May 2, India imposed a ban on ships carrying goods originating from or destined for Pakistan, barring them from entering Indian ports or transiting through Indian territory. The move followed military aggression under ‘Operation Sindoor’ launched on May 7, which ended within four days due to Pakistan’s forceful retaliation.
While India initially sought to hurt Pakistan’s trade flows, the outcome fell short of expectations. Shipping companies reportedly adapted by separating cargo bound for and from Pakistan, thereby avoiding dependence on Indian ports.
Importers, however, said the Indian ban has resulted in longer shipping times and higher freight charges.
“Mother vessels are not coming to Pakistan due to this Indian action, which delays our imports by 30 to 50 days,” said Javed Bilwani, President of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He added that importers are now relying on feeder vessels, which raises costs.

Shipping delays push up costs, but exporters report minimal impact on overall trade

Exporters also reported a spike in shipping and insurance costs following the Indian aggression. However, they said the overall impact on exports remains minimal.
“There is no significant impact on exports after the Indian aggression, except for a rise in insurance costs. Shipping charges had already gone up even before the escalation,” said Aamir Aziz, an exporter of textile made-ups.
Pakistan’s exports are heavily reliant on imported inputs for value addition. With the government maintaining tight controls on imports to conserve foreign exchange, any disruption in supply chains has broader economic implications.
However, Pakistan Ship’s Agents Association Secretary General Syed Tahir Hussain dismissed claims that mother vessels have stopped calling at Pakistani ports.
“You can see mother vessels at Karachi and Port Qasim,” he said. “Feeder vessels are also sufficient to handle Pakistan’s trade volume, as they can carry between 6,000 and 8,000 containers — well above the current level of our exports and imports.”
Trade with India
Formal trade relations between Pakistan and India have remained frozen since 2019. Bilateral trade declined from $2.41bn in 2018 to $1.2bn in 2024. Pakistan’s exports to India decreased from $547.5 million in 2019 to just $480,000 in 2024.
Nevertheless, unofficial trade is thriving. Al Jazeera, quoting the India-based Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), reported last month that unofficial Indian exports to Pakistan are estimated at $10bn per year.
This parallel trade has been facilitated through alternate routes, including ports in Dubai (UAE), Colombo (Sri Lanka), and Singapore.
India’s exports include pharmaceuticals, petroleum products, plastics, rubber, organic chemicals, dyes, vegetables, spices, coffee, tea, dairy items, and cereals. Pakistan’s key exports to India consist of copper, glassware, organic chemicals, sulphur, fruits and nuts, and certain oilseeds.

• Accuse ‘establishment-backed elements’ of taking advantage of situation
• Vow to hold joint press conference to dispel impression of rift
ISLAMABAD: The recent dec­ision of the Supreme Court’s Constitutional Bench on the reserved seats has dealt a serious blow to the opposition Pak­istan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), which is already emb­roiled in numerous challenges, including internal disunity.
Background briefings revealed a complete lack of trust among PTI leaders, with doubts about each other’s sincerity and intentions, particularly regarding Imran Khan’s messages.
Despite having doubts about loyalties, the party leaders, however, were found united in their support for Imran Khan’s leadership, hoping that the issues would be resolved once Mr Khan was freed from jail.
Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, considered a close confidant of Mr Khan, had initially declared that he would not get the budget passed from the provincial assembly without consulting Imran Khan.
However, the swift and somewhat hasty passage of the KP budget without his meeting with Mr Khan further exposed fissures within the party ranks, as evident from statements of various PTI leaders and members, who questioned each other’s loyalty to the incarcerated party boss.
 
 

The statement by Aleema Khan, Imran Khan’s sister, about a “minus-Imran” formula sparked a heated debate within political and journalistic circles, as well as within the PTI, with some party leaders questioning the decision-making process.
Many senior party members believed that the party was facing a crisis-like situation due to a “communication gap” and the leadership’s failure to hold regular meetings with the jailed leader.
Another senior leader suggested that Aleema Khan’s statement was emotional and provided an opportunity for Maryam Nawaz to criticise the party.
Communication gap
According to prominent PTI leader Asad Qaiser, all the issues were due to a communication gap as the political leadership had no contact with Imran Khan.
“We remain unaware if the party’s patron-in-chief has really said it or not,” said Mr Qaiser, who served as the National Assembly speaker under the PTI government.
Mr Qaiser said that presently, only lawyers had been meeting with Mr Khan, and each of them had their own interpretation. He also mentioned the sisters of Mr Khan, claiming that they simply conveyed the message as they  heard. “I have no doubt but every person can understand the message as per his/her understanding,” he said.
During his conversation with Dawn, Mr Qaiser, without naming anyone, stated that some of the “friends of the PTI” were also responsible for the impression regarding rift within the party.
The former speaker said that they had decided that all the party leaders would hold a joint press conference in which they would give a clear message that “there is no rift within the party”.
Another senior leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, also endorsed Mr Qaiser’s view, stating that the major issue was that the leadership was not being allowed to meet Mr Khan.
“The lack of communication has been triggering the confusion. Moreover, there can be differences of opinion within political parties and no one can stop it,” the PTI leader said.
He also dubbed the reports about internal rifts in the party as part of “a disinformation campaign”.
“We have conducted an inquiry and reached a conclusion that there are five persons who have been running at least 25 social media accounts which are being used to create a negative impression about the PTI,” he claimed.
He admitted that there was frustration among the leaders and workers due to the “ongoing state oppression” and crackdown on the party for the last three years as well as the possible convictions of some party members and activists in the May 9 and Nov 26 cases.
‘Establishment-backed elements’
PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said some of the “establishment-backed elements” were taking advantage of the situation caused by miscommunication within the party.
“There are some paid people who have been criticising the party. However, we have decided to address the communication gap,” said Mr Akram.
“We have decided to hold physical meetings, instead of Zoom [virtual]meetings, to avoid chances of wrong interpretations,” he said.
Mr Akram termed the consensus over the leadership of Mr Khan a “positive sign”, stating that everyone in the party knew that “they cannot survive without the founding chairman”.
He emphasised that the party was united behind Mr Khan’s leadership and acknowledged that rifts within parties were normal.
“Rifts within parties are quite normal, as I have heard old PPP and new PPP, Zardari group and Bilawal group, Hamza group and Maryam group, and the rift between Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif,” he said in an effort to downplay the situation being faced by his party.
Fawad Chaudhry, former information minister in the PTI government, attributes the issues to the party’s lack of experienced leadership.
“Those taking decisions have limited experience, and the grouping in KP started in 2011,” he said, suggesting the formation of a committee to meet opposition parties and launch a movement to secure Mr Khan’s release.

He said this during a meeting with the airline’s chief executive, Air Vice Marshal Amir Hayat, who requested fresh diplomatic support to remove the long-running flight ban.
Mr Hayat appreciated the foreign minister’s continued support in helping to remove the ban on PIA flights to various countries.
He noted that compliance work begun under the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) coalition government of 2022-23 enabled both PIA and the Civil Aviation Aut­hority (CAA) to satisfy Inte­rnational Civil Avia­tion Organisation aud­itors, paving the way for the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) to lift its own suspension in November 2024.
Flights to the UK and Europe were halted in June 2020 after then aviation minister told parliament that roughly one-third of the country’s com­m­ercial pilots held “dubious” licences — a statement made in the aftermath of the May 22, 2020, crash of Flight PK8303 in Karachi, which claimed 97 lives.
The UK Civil Aviation Authority suspended PIA’s operating permit on June 30 that year, mirroring EASA’s action a day earlier.
 
 
;

Regulators cited systemic failures in licensing oversight and airline safety management. The grounding deprived PIA of one of its most lucrative long-haul markets and cost nearly 40 billion a year in lost revenue, according to government records presented in parliament.
After three years of remedial work — ranging from re-validation of pilot credentials to overhauling safety protocols — EASA reinstated PIA’s Third-Country Operator authorisation on Nov 29, 2024.
Earlier this year, the carrier resumed flights to Paris and plans to add further European destinations this summer.
Power sector meeting
In a separate development, Mr Dar reaffirmed the government’s commitment to making balanced decisions that uphold financial discipline without imposing an undue burden on the public.
Mr Dar chaired a high-level meeting to review matters related to the power sector. The meeting was attended by the ministers for power and petroleum, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, and senior officials, according to a press release issued by the Deputy Prime Minister’s Office.
Discussions centred on key aspects of the power sector, with a focus on ensuring financial sustainability and consumer protection.

• Nine children among 37 killed in military strikes across Gaza Strip
DOHA: Gaza mediators are engaging with Israel and Hamas to build on momentum from this week’s ceasefire with Iran and work towards a truce in the Palestinian territory, Qatar foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari said.
Israel and Iran on Tuesday agreed to a ceasefire brokered by the United States and Qatar just hours after the Islamic republic launched a salvo of missiles towards the wealthy Gulf state, targeting the American military base hosted there.
The unprecedented attack on Qatari soil followed Washington’s intervention into a days-long war between Israel and Iran which saw US warplanes strike Iranian nuclear facilities, prompting promises of retaliation from Tehran.
In an interview with AFP on Friday, Ansari said Doha — with fellow Gaza mediators in Washington and Cairo — was now “trying to use the momentum that was created by the ceasefire between Iran and Israel to restart the talks over Gaza”.
“If we don’t utilise this window of opportunity and this momentum, it’s an opportunity lost amongst many in the near past. We don’t want to see that again,” the spokesman, who is also an adviser to Qatar’s prime minister, said.
US President Donald Trump voiced optimism on Friday about a new ceasefire in Gaza saying an agreement involving Israel and Hamas could come as early as next week.
Mediators have been engaged in months of back-and-forth negotiations with the warring parties aimed at ending 20 months of war in Gaza, with Ansari explaining there were no current talks between the sides but that Qatar was “heavily involved in talking to every side separately”.
‘The right pressure’
A two-month truce, which was agreed as Trump came into office in January, collapsed in March with Israel intensifying military operations in Gaza afterwards.
“We have seen US pressure and what it can accomplish,” Ansari said referring to the January truce which saw dozens of prisoners held by Hamas released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.
The Qatari official said particularly in the context of US enforcement of the Israel-Iran truce, it was “not a far-fetched idea” that pressure from Washington would achieve a fresh truce in Gaza.
Another 37 Palestinians killed
Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed 37 people in the devastated territory on Saturday, including at least nine children who died in strikes.
Civil defence spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP 35 people were killed in seven Israeli drone and air strikes in various locations, and two others by Israeli fire while waiting for food aid in the Netzarim zone in central Gaza.
He said the dead included three children who were killed in an air strike on a home in Jabalia, in northern Gaza.
Bassal said at least six more children died in a neighbourhood in the northeast of Gaza City, including some in an air strike near a school where displaced people were sheltering.
AFP images showed mourners weeping over the bodies of seven people, including at least two children, wrapped in white shrouds and blankets at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City.
Video footage filmed from southern Israel showed smoke rising over northern Gaza after blasts. Other AFP footage filmed in Gaza City showed a cloud of smoke rising from buildings after a strike.

• ISPR blames India, ‘Fitna al Khwarij’ for attack
• 14 militants killed during military operation
NORTH WAZIRISTAN / PESHAWAR: Thirteen security personnel were martyred and 16 others injured while 14 militants were killed in two separate attacks in North Waziristan district on Saturday.
The deadliest attack occurred in the Khadi Khel area of Mir Ali tehsil around 7:15am, when an explosive-laden vehicle targ­eted a Mine-Resistant Ambush Prot­ected (MRAP) vehicle belonging to the security forces’ bomb disposal unit.
Sources said the blast claimed the lives of 13 soldiers and injured 10 others. Rescue operations were launched immediately, with the injured and the bodies shifted to Bannu district. The area was cordoned off following the incident.
In a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) described the attack as a “cowardly act” planned and orchestrated by the “terrorist state of India” and executed by its proxy Fitna al Khwarij — a term the military uses for the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
According to the ISPR, the suicide bomber attempted to ram a convoy, but was intercepted by the leading vehicle. In desperation, the vehicle was driven into one of the leading group’s vehicles, resulting in the casualties.
“Resultantly, 13 brave sons of soil embraced Shahadat. In this tragic and barbaric incident, three innocent civilians — two children and a woman — also got severely injured,” it said.
However, local sources said the number of civilian injuries was 14. They reported that an emergency had been declared at a hospital in Mir Ali, with all entry and exit points in the area closed.
They also said that the intensity of the blast caused the roofs of nearby houses to collapse, injuring several residents. A curfew had already been imposed in the area since 6am due to prevailing security concerns.
Following the attack, security forces launched a sanitisation operation. After an intense exchange of fire, 14 militants were killed. “The operations in the area would continue, and perpetrators of this heinous and cowardly act will be brought to justice,” the ISPR added.
The martyred personnel were identified as Subedar Zahid Iqbal (aged 45) from Karak, Havildar Sohrab Khan (39) from Naseerabad, Havildar Mian Yousaf (41) from Buner, Naik Khitab Shah (34) from Lower Dir, Lance Naik Ismail (32) from Naseerabad, Sepoy Rohail (30) from Mirpur Khas, Sepoy Muhammad Ramzan (33) from Dera Ghazi Khan, Sepoy Nawab (30) from Quetta, Sepoy Zubair Ahmed (24) from Naseerabad, Sepoy Muhammad Sahki (31) from Dera Ghazi Khan, Sepoy Hashim Abbasi (20) from Abbottabad, Sepoy Muddasir Ejaz (25) from Layyah, and Sepoy Manzar Ali (23) from Mardan.
Security officials pointed fingers at Afghan nationals for the attacks on security forces. “Afghans have infiltrated there in hundreds and they are playing havoc with everything on earth,” a senior security official said.
The ISPR reiterated the military’s resolve to eliminate “Indian-sponsored terrorism” from the country, adding that “such sacrifices of our brave soldiers and innocent civilians further reinforce our unwavering commitment to safeguarding our nation at all costs”.
Asood-al-Harb, a group linked to the banned Hafiz Gul Bahadur network — which has increased attacks in the region — claimed responsibility for the Mir Ali bombing.
Suicide attack
In a separate incident, a suicide attacker on a motorbike targeted a security convoy in the Saidgai area of Ghulam Khan tehsil near the Pak-Afghan border, leaving six security personnel injured.
Three of them were critically wounded and shifted to Bannu after initial treatment in Miramshah, sources said. No official statement from ISPR on the Ghulam Khan incident was issued at the time of reporting.
Cop martyred
Meanwhile, in another attack in Peshawar, a cop posted at Hashtnagri police station was martyred after unidentified motorcyclists opened fire on him in the Shahpur area on Saturday.
The officer, Constable Shahenshah, was en route to duty when he was attacked near Shah Ji Abad graveyard, the city police said in a statement.
The constable’s funeral was held at the Peshawar Police Headquarters and was attended by Inspector General of KP Police Zulfiqar Hameed, CCPO Peshawar Qasim Ali Khan, SSP Operations Masood Ahmad, senior military officials and the martyr’s family members.

KARACHI: At least 32 people have been killed in four provinces over the past two days as heavy rains triggered flash floods and damaged houses, according to rescue officials and disaster management authorities.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, two more casualties were reported on Saturday, a day after 17 people lost their lives in rain-related accidents.
According to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), one person each was killed in Charsadda and Shangla.
The NDMA reported that one person drowned in the river in Charsadda as continuous rainfall in the upper catchment area increased the flow downstream. His body was recovered near the Shahi Kaly Tranab by Rescue 1122 officials.
In Shangla, heavy rain triggered a landslide in Dhok area, killing a woman named Jan Ferroza.
The PDMA’s report stated that a total of 56 houses were damaged due to the rain, with 50 partially damaged and six completely collapsed.
Punjab
In Punjab, five people, including three minors, lost their lives and 20 were injured on Saturday.
Punjab Rescue spokesperson
Farooq Ahmad said most of the deaths occurred due to roof collapses. In Lahore, two minors died and four others inju­red when the roof of a house collapsed in Shahdra.
In Attock, a woman died after falling into a drain. In Faisalabad, four-year-old Umme Hania was killed and two injured when the roof of a house collapsed in Roshan Wali Jheel at Sumandari Road.

All the injured were shifted to hospitals where they were said to be stable.
Balochistan
In Zhob, four members of a family, including three women and a girl, were swept away in a flash flood on Saturday.
Officials said the victims were a family coming from Quetta to Multan via the Quetta-Zhob-Islam­abad highway.
They stopped at a picnic point in Salyazah to take some rest when a huge flash flood suddenly hit the area due to heavy rainfall in the mountainous areas of Zhob and Sherani.
“Six members of the family were swept away in the flash flood,” said Naveed Alam, the Zhob assistant commissioner.
He added that Levies and rescue officials managed to save a woman and the driver, but four others drowned in the gushing water.
“The bodies of the victims were sent to their native area of Multan alo­ng with the injured woman and driver,” a senior Levies official told Dawn.
In Khost, Harnai, the local administration and rescue teams saved three persons who got stuck in a heavy flood.
Sindh
In Karachi, four people lost their lives in two separate accidents on Saturday.
According to officials, two of them were killed when a roof collapsed in Lyari while two others died of electrocution.
More rainfall
Heavy rainfall continued across the country on Saturday, with the prediction for similar weather over the next few days.

Disaster alert
The NDMA has warned that intense rainfall and above-normal temperatures have increased the likelihood of Glof events in northern districts KP, including Upper Dir, Chitral, Swat, Reshun, Booni, Brep, Sardar Gol, Arkari, Dir Gol, Thalu 1 and 2 and Kumrat Valley.
A statement by the NDMA said these areas were at risk of Glof and sudden flash floods which could damage roads and infrastructure and disrupt public mobility.

Temperatures are set to rise to 37 degrees Celsius (99 Fahrenheit) in Rome, driving the Eternal City’s many tourists and pilgrims to the Vatican alike towards the Italian capital’s 2,500 public fountains for refreshment.
With residents of the southern French port city of Marseille expected to have to cope with temperatures flirting with 40C (104F), authorities in city ordered public swimming pools to be made free of charge to help residents beat the Mediterranean heat.
Two-thirds of Portugal will be on high alert on Sunday for extreme heat and forest fires, with 42C (108F) expected in the capital Lisbon, while visitors to — and protesters against — Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos’s Friday wedding in Venice likewise sweltered under the summer sun.
The heatwave is forecast to become even more intense on Sunday.

At least 16 scientists and 10 senior commanders were among those mourned at the funeral, according to state media, including armed forces chief Major General Moham­mad Bagheri, Revolutionary Gua­r­­ds commander General Hossein Salami, and Guards Aerospace Force chief General Amir Ali Hajizadeh.
 
 

Their coffins were driven into Tehran’s Azadi Square adorned with their photos and national flags, as crowds waved flags and some reached out to touch the caskets and throw rose petals onto them. State-run Press TV showed an image of ballistic missiles on display. Mass prayers were later held in the square.
State TV said the funeral, dub­bed the “procession of the Martyrs of Power”, was held for a total of 60 people killed in the war, including four women and four children.

In attendance were President Masoud Pezeshkian and other senior figures, including Ali Sham­khani, who was seriously wounded during the conflict and is an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as Khamenei’s son Mojtaba.
There was no immediate statement from Khamenei, who has not appeared publicly since the conflict began. In past funerals, he led prayers over the coffins of senior commanders ahead of public ceremonies broadcast on state television.
Bagheri, Salami and Hajizadeh were killed on June 13, the first day of the war. Bagheri was being buried at the Behesht Zahra cemetery outside Tehran mid-afternoon on Saturday. Salami and Hajizadeh were due to be buried on Sunday.
According to Iranian health ministry figures, 610 people were killed on the Iranian side in the war before a ceasefire went into effect on Tuesday. More than 4,700 were injured.
