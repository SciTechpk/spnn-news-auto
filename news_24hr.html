The statement came as the party camped outside Adiala jai, where he is imprisoned, and the Supreme Court after the government confirmed Imran underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad.
Speaking on Geo News programme ‘Naya Pakistan’, the state minister replied to a question about the secrecy of Imran’s treatment, stating that there was nothing secret about it.
“Their (the PTI) problem is that the glass is always half-empty to them; they cannot be realistic or positive,” Chaudhry said.
“They previously said that there were no health facilities and nobody was paying attention,” he explained. “If there has been a health issue, then he (Imran) was immediately taken to the best hospital nearest to the prison. He was taken, examined and then left after everything was fine.”
Chaudhry noted that upholding the rights of all inmates and ensuring their care was the government’s responsibility. At this point, the host asked why the government did not comment on the issue earlier.
“Do you know how many prisoners avail these facilities or how many decisions are made by the jail administration? There isn’t a press release or press conference about those,” he replied.
Pressed on why Imran’s family was not informed about the procedure, Chaudhry said that this was the “prime responsibility” of jail authorities, who had fulfilled their role.
“I’ll confirm, once again, that he (Imran) is absolutely healthy,” he said, calling Imran “privileged”. “Not every prisoner has a personal physician, or cook or an exercise machine.”
Chaudhry reiterated that “there cannot be a press release or press conference for everything”, stating that matters were confirmed publicly when the need arose.
At this point, Iqbal recounted the state minister’s comments on the matter on Wednesday, when he had neither confirmed nor denied reports about Imran undergoing treatment.
When asked if he knew of the treatment, Chaudhry replied that there were standard operating procedures (SOPs) for everything.
“State ministers, ministers and prime ministers are not told everything, which is why there are SOPs and rules in place among the various institutions,” he responded. “It happened according to those and it was very smooth.”
Questioned again about why the family was not informed, Chaudhry replied, “They don’t care; they only care about their politics. What do they do? They use meetings [with Imran] for political point-scoring.
“They come out [after meeting Imran] and use whatever is said inside to control the party and build their narrative,” he said. Chaudhry added that the PTI could not dictate prison meetings by staging sit-ins.
“You cannot get a meeting by dictating. They do not even consider the law and order situation in that area, where there are thousands of people and prisoners,” he added.
Adviser to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister on information, Shafiullah Jan, also a guest on the programme, responded to Chaudhry’s claims by stating that the party had requested that Imran be allowed to meet his personal physician.
“We only have one request, which we made before the Supreme Court today; please allow him to meet his personal physician,” Jan said.
Jan said that Imran was “not an ordinary prisoner” and said that his health was paramount for the PTI. “We cannot compromise on his health; it is the most important thing for us,” the adviser said.
Jan then stated, “He was taken to Pims, but his family wasn’t informed. Tallal sahib is not talking about it. Why did you hide it for five days? Tallal sahib is not talking about it. Your own minister confirmed the matter but Tallal sahib is not talking about it.”
‘He needs to see a retinal specialist’
Separately, Dr Aasim Yusuf — Chief Medical Officer at Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital and Imran’s longtime personal physician — said in a video statement that he had been denied access to examine the PTI founder, adding that he needed to see a retinal specialist.
He noted that he has no confirmation about the nature of his condition or what kind of treatment has been provided.
“We have every confidence in the abilities and professionalism of the physicians at the hospital in Islamabad, where Khan sahib was taken for treatment, but nevertheless, this is a serious condition and requires expert medical care,” Dr Yusuf said.
“This is ideally provided by an ophthalmologist with sub-specialty experience and training in diseases of the retina,” he added. “To the best of our knowledge, there are no retinal specialists at this hospital in Islamabad. If there are and it was a retinal specialist who saw Khan sahib, then that’s all well and good. But that remains a serious concern from our point of view.”



Dr Yusuf noted that Imran could have underlying medical issues, which may have caused the condition. He noted that alongside an ophthalmologist, a general physician would need to examine the PTI founder.
“Yesterday evening I received a phone call from Khan sahib’s legal team, in particular Salman Akram Raja, suggesting that it might be possible that it might be possible that we would get permission to see Khan sahib late last night,” Dr Yusuf said.
He added that he asked an ophthalmologist to accompany him to Adiala Jail.
“We got there just before 11pm. Unfortunately, permission could not obtained and we were not able to see Khan sahib on this occasion,” the physician recounted.
“It goes without saying that we are happy to go again as many times as necessary and whenever the legal team feels permission might be forthcoming or when, in fact, permission is obtained.”</p><small>2026-01-30 16:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/301856024aaf694.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969913/probe-initiated-into-alleged-torture-of-man-whose-wife-daughter-died-after-falling-into-sewer-in-lahore' target='_blank'><strong>Probe initiated into alleged torture of man whose wife, daughter died after falling into sewer in Lahore</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: A “high-powered committee” of police officials launched a fact-finding inquiry on Friday into the alleged torture of the husband of a woman, who, along with her 10-month-old daughter, died earlier this week after falling into an open sewer in Lahore, a source told Dawn.
The two had fallen into the sewer at the site of under-construction Data Darbar expansion project near Bhati Gate on Wednesday. While the woman’s body was found late night the same day, the 10-month-old child’s body was recovered on Thursday.
A first information report (FIR) of the incident has been registered on the complaint of the woman’s father at the Bhatti Gate police station under Section 322 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code. Three suspects have been nominated in the FIR and all three of them were arrested a day ago.
Meanwhile, the victims’ family alleged police had tortured the woman’s husband, accusing him of committing his wife’s murder. They also arrested him and released him after around six hours.
A police official told Dawn that the fact-finding committee probing the allegation was headed by the Internal Accountability Branch (AIB) additional inspector general (IG) and included Lahore Deputy Inspector General (Administration) Imran Kishwar. The Punjab police chief constituted it on Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s directives, he said.
According to the official, the committee has been asked to finalise a report on the matter in 24 hours.
“The inquiry was initiated following complaints that police misused their authority and handled the matter unprofessionally by allegedly torturing the deceased woman’s husband,” he said, adding that committee members had also visited and inspected the Data Barbar project site.
He further said that the committee had also recorded the statements of the victims’ family, witnesses and other relevant people, checked where Safe City cameras were installed at the site and had also visited spots where the victims’ bodies were found.
According to the official, the inquiry committee has question a station house officer, a deputy superintendent of police and divisional superintended on why was the woman’s husband taken into custody.
The woman’s husband had called Rescue 1122 as soon as his wife and daughter had fallen into the manhole at about 7:30pm, but the rescue operation was stopped after it was suspected that the man was lying.
“Rescue 1122 personnel had slowed down the search operation, saying that the wastewater was just two feet deep and suspecting that the call may be a “fake” one,” the police official told Dawn.
Subsequently, the victim’s husband was taken into custody along with two other members of the family. The family alleged that the police tortured him, accusing him of committing his wife’s murder. And he was released around six hours later.
The police official who spoke to Dawn alleged that following Rescue personnel’s claims, “provincial and district officials wrongly briefed selective media persons to build a narrative that the incident related to a domestic dispute, and so that the woman’s husband be questioned for making a ‘fake call’.”
He said that the inquiry committee would finalise and submit its report to the Punjab police chief “for a final consideration by the CM”.
Separately, Lahore DIG (Investigation) Zeeshan Raza told Dawn that police had arrested the chief executive officers (CEOs) of the company that had been awarded the contract for the Data Darbar expansion project.
“We have arrested the two CEOs of the company, Salman and Usman”, Raza said, adding that they had been taken to a police station.
The move comes hours after a police source told Dawn that the contractor of the under-construction project as well as CEOs of  M/S Design and Engineering Pvt Limited would be questioned in connection with the case.
He said the action was being taken on government’s directives.
“A team of senior officers will question them to determine why the company failed to ensure safety protocols and cover the loopholes that led to the incident,” the official said.
This the one of the latest measures in a string of steps that have been taken by the authorities following the incident.
Yesterday, the government suspended from service the entire team of the Data Darbar revamp project, which also includes Bhati Chowk remodelling, after the preliminary inquiry proved their negligence.
Meanwhile, the project consultant, Nespak, was issued a show-cause notice with a recommendation to suspend the resident engineer.
Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also took aim at senior officials, including the Lahore commissioner, assistant commissioner and the head of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) for the “negligence” which led to the incident.
Addressing a high-level meeting, she grilled the top bureaucracy in front of the camera and ordered the removal and arrest of four officers.</p><small>2026-01-30 16:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648123-cdf-munir-turkiyes-top-commander-vow-to-boost-bilateral-military-ties' target='_blank'><strong>CDF Munir, Turkiye's top commander vow to boost bilateral military ties</strong></a><br><p>

He made the remarks while speaking to the media outside the Supreme Court building in Islamabad, where the party, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, staged a day-long sit-in in an effort to facilitate a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians.
The development comes a day after Information Minister Attaullah Tarar confirmed that Imran underwent a medical procedure for an eye ailment last week at a hospital in Islamabad. According to the minister, the former premier was taken to the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for a “20-minute” medical procedure on the night of January 24.
Speaking outside the SC premises on Friday evening, Raja said, “As you know, we have been outside the SC building all day.”
Afridi and Senate opposition leader Allama Raja Nasir Abbas were also present alongside Raja.
He said PTI lawmakers were also present at the sit-in, adding that a similar sit-in was staged outside Adiala jail on Thursday night that lasted till 3am on Friday.
“There is nothing more important for us than Imran Khan sahib’s health,” he said. He added that the reports that had emerged about the ex-premier’s health were “unsatisfactory”.
He said that Imran was taken to a hospital, without the family’s knowledge. “And then lies are told. For five days, they say that no such incident has happened,” he said.
Raja said that he had held conversations with the chief justice of Pakistan, his staff and the attorney general for Pakistan all day. However, he said that whatever was “achieved” after their day-long efforts was “unsatisfactory”.
“It has been said that Imran Khan sahib’s medical reports — what happened in Pims hospital, the diagnosis in jail before that — that report will be given to Imran Khan sahib in a sealed envelope. And a copy of that report will be given to family, meaning his sisters, today,” he said.
He said that this would now show what the doctors had diagnosed Imran with and what medical procedure was carried out. “When this report comes in front of us, then the family will decide whether the medical treatment being provided is satisfactory or not,” he said.
He said that the decisions about further treatment would also be taken by the family. However, he said that the “real matter” was that Imran was wrongly arrested, calling for him to be released. He said that the party would continue to protest for Imran’s visitation rights.
He said that to decide the future course of strategy, the party’s political committee would meet later today. He said that the political party would also speak to the Senate and National Assembly opposition leaders, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas and Mehmood Khan Achakzai, respectively.
“So with their consultation, the PTI’s political party will decide the future course of action. We do not accept this current situation. Reciving the medical report is necessary,” he said.
The Senate opposition leader, meanwhile, said that every person had fundamental rights under the Constitution. “Creating hindrances in the path to the fundamental rights is oppression,” he said.
Referring to Imran’s incarceration and his treatment at the hospital, he said, “Whatever they are doing is illegal, unconstitutional, inhumane and oppressive from all perspectives.”
Meanwhile, Afridi said that the aim of the party’s sit-ins outside Adiala jail and the SC was to arrange a meeting between Imran and his personal physicians.
“Earlier, it was stated that political meetings [with Imran] are banned. They (personal physicians) will not participate in any political conversations,” he said.
PTI camps outside SC
Earlier in the day, PTI workers and lawmakers had camped outside the apex court. The KP chief minister had reached the SC in the morning, after a sit-in outside Adiala jail, which had continued into the early hours of Friday.
He had left for a short period of time to offer Friday prayer at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, before returning to the SC premises. Later, Senate opposition leader Abbas also joined the sit-in.
Speaking to the media during the day, Afridi said, “The whole nation is concerned about the health of the country’s most popular leader, Imran Khan.”
He had stated that he would try to arrange a meeting between the PTI founder and his personal physicians with the help of the chief justice of Pakistan (CJP).







The KP chief executive said the party would announce its future course of action if its attempts to arrange a meeting with Imran did not bear fruit. He had also lamented that while the courts were issuing decisions on petitions, “we are not getting justice”.
“Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi’s cases have not been listed for one year. If the cases are listed today and we are provided justice, Khan sahib and Bushra Bibi, along with other leaders, will be released from prison within half an hour,” he claimed.
“We were left with no option, so we opted for the only one available,” he added.
In response to a question on concluding the protest outside Adiala jail, where the KP chief minister, along with other lawmakers and party workers, had camped, he said, “I have come here.”
PTI leaders meet AGP
Following their arrival at the SC, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja and party leader and lawmaker Sardar Latif Khosa had met the registrar of the apex court and the attorney general for Pakistan (AGP).
During the meeting, Raja and Khosa had expressed the party’s concern regarding Imran’s eye ailment and requested that the medical report of the doctor who treated the former premier be provided.
Addressing the media outside, Khosa said he reminded the registrar and the attorney general of Pakistan that the CJP should promote good practices before he retired as “this (Imran’s case) is not only a human rights issue, but he (Imran) is also being deprived of his basic rights.”
“He (CJP) has taken an oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of the basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said.
Khosa claimed that the procedure of retina rupture did not last “20-minutes” as shared by the information minister, but “it is 2.5 hours”.
He said Imran’s health was PTI’s “red line” and any matter related to his health “will not be tolerated at any cost”.







“This is his legal and constitutional right,” added Khosa. “I told the registrar to share our concerns with the CJP,” he said.
Khosa also said that Imran was being deprived of his basic rights.







“He (CJP) has taken oath that implementation on Constitution and basic rights [of people] is his basic responsibility. He is the protector of basic rights of Pakistanis,” he said.
‘Secrecy is cancer to democracy’
PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Khan and party leader Babar Awan also addressed the media on Friday at KP House, saying that the “one-point agenda” for the press conference was Imran’s health.
Referring to the former prime minister’s brief stay at Islamabad’s Pims hospital, he said, “Secrecy is cancer to democracy. His (Imran Khan’s) family is worried due to his health.”
Gohar demanded that doctors from Shaukat Khanum Hospital be allowed to examine the former prime minister. “Dr Faisal and Dr Asim should be allowed to meet Khan sahib.”
The party chairman added that neither the party nor Imran’s family was informed about his health or treatment.
Awan, addressing the media, said if the report regarding Imran’s health is not made public, “it will have grave consequences” and added that the party and its supporters were anxious regarding the former premier’s health.

According to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the operations were carried out on January 29 (Thursday), in which terrorists belonging to Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan were killed.

Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), and the term Fitna-al-Hindustan has been designated by the state for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The military’s media wing said the presence of Fitna-al-Khawarij was reported on the outskirts of Harnai district, following which an IBO was conducted in the area.
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the hideout, and after an intense fire exchange, 30 India-sponsored khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement added.
According to ISPR, a large cache of ammunition and explosives was found in the terrorists’ possession and was destroyed by security forces.
Separately, an IBO was also carried out in the Panjgur district, where a “terrorist hideout was busted and 11 India-sponsored terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan were neutralised”, ISPR said.
The military’s media wing further stated that weapons, ammunition and money looted in a bank robbery in Panjgur on December 15, 2025, were found in the possession of terrorists killed in the second IBO.
“The terrorists were involved in numerous terrorist activities in the past” as well, ISPR added.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other India-sponsored terrorists found in the area.”
“Relentless counter-terrorism campaign, under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by the federal apex committee on National Action Plan), by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” added ISPR.
Thursday’s IBOs were carried out nearly two weeks after security forces killed 12 terrorists and effectively thwarted their attempt to create a hostage situation in Balochistan’s Kharan district during multiple operations.
An ISPR statement had said about the action that on January 15, “approximately 15 to 20 India-sponsored terrorists of Fitna-al-Hindustan carried out multiple terrorist activities in Kharan City, District Kharan”.
“The terrorists attacked [the] City Police Station, National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank Limited. They also looted Rs3.4 million from the banks,” ISPR said, adding that security forces effectively responded and engaged the them, prompting them to retreat.
During the ensuing clearance operation, 12 terrorists were killed in three different engagements.
More recently, on January 19, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) foiled an alleged terror plan of a banned organisation, killing five suspected terrorists during an operation in the Dasht area of Mastung district.
“A major intelligence-based operation was conducted by Quetta CTD in Dasht after receiving information about the presence of armed men,” a CTD spokesperson said at the time, adding that five suspected terrorists belonging to the proscribed Balochis­tan Liberation Army were planning to block the Quetta-Sibi Highway and carry out subversive activities.
Pakistan has been facing the problem of terrorism for long. Despite record militant deaths, the country saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21pc year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.</p><small>2026-01-30 14:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648117-islamabad-court-removes-terrorist-states-reference-from-imaan-chattha-verdict' target='_blank'><strong>Islamabad court removes 'terrorist states' reference from Imaan, Chattha verdict</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said General Bayraktaroglu called on CDF Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi.
“Upon his arrival at the General Headquarters, he was presented with the guard of honour by a smartly turned contingent of the Pakistan armed forces,” the statement said.
“During the meeting, besides dilating upon matters of mutual interest, prevailing regional and global security landscape, and prospects for strengthening bilateral defence and military cooperation were also discussed,” the statement said.
It added that the two also expressed satisfaction with the current trajectory of Pakistan-Turkiye relations, while underscoring the need for maintaining close coordination and enhancing defence collaboration.
The statement said that CDF Munir highlighted the longstanding brotherly relationship between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, mutual trust, and strong people-to-people ties.
“He appreciated the support and cooperation extended by the Turkish armed forces and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening bilateral military-to-military relations,” it added.
The statement said that General Bayraktaroglu expressed gratitude for the warm reception and appreciated the professionalism of the Pakistan armed forces.
“He reaffirmed Turkiye’s resolve to deepen defence cooperation, including training, joint exercises, and capacity-building initiatives,” it said.
“The visit reflects the enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Turkiye and their shared commitment to regional peace, stability, and security,” the statement concluded.</p><small>2026-01-30 14:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648118-gul-plaza-tragedy-pir-muhammad-shah-shown-the-door-as-karachi-dig-traffic' target='_blank'><strong>Gul Plaza tragedy: Pir Muhammad Shah shown the door as Karachi DIG Traffic</strong></a><br><p>

The premier stated this during an address to the country’s major exporters and business figures at a ceremony in Islamabad, which was held to honour their contributions.







“A Rs4.4 reduction is being made in the electricity unit rate for industries,” said the premier, adding that “if it were in his control, he would reduce it by another Rs10.”
“However, my hands are tied, as you all know well,” he said.
PM Shehbaz also announced a reduction in wheeling charges for industries, stating that “it will be less than Rs9”. He hoped that the move would help “industries sell their power to neighbouring industries”.
To provide additional relief, the premier said that “with the cooperation and support of Pakistan’s banks, we are announcing a reduction in the export refinance rate from earlier 7.5pc to 4.5pc”.
At the outset of his address, the premier lauded business leaders and major exporters for their “hard work and efficiency for achieving major milestones in their relevant sectors in the past year”.
“The billions of rupees you have earned for Pakistan, the entire nation congratulates you [on that],” PM Shehbaz said.
The premier recalled that in 2023, the country was on the brink of default.
“Day and night, there were reports that Pakistan was going to default,” he said, adding that it was a “big challenge for the nation”.
The premier recalled a meeting with International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva in Paris, during which she flagged Pakistan’s inconsistency during previous programmes.
He recalled the lending agency’s managing director as saying: “I was told that time was running out, and it will be difficult to offer a new structure.”
PM Shehbaz added, “I told her that I was giving her my word of honour that we will ensure implementation and commit to the agreement in letter and spirit.
“When I came back to Pakistan, she called me to tell me [..] that our team will sit down with you and you must honour the commitment you made. This is how Pakistan was saved from default.”
Shifting his attention to the present situation, PM Shehbaz continued: “At this moment, in the third quarter, our foreign exchange reserves have doubled, but that includes loans from friendly countries as well.”
PM Shehbaz detailed that he, along with Chief of Defence Forces and the Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, went to many countries for assistance, told them about the IMF programme and requested them for funds.
The premier said he was “grateful to the countries for helping, […] but you know whoever takes a loan, […] there are obligations associated with it”.
“China helped us out in the most difficult of times, as well as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar,” he said, adding that “this is how the programme was stitched”.
‘Pakistan has become a stable economy’
The premier, during his address, also stated that he could now say “without hesitation” that Pakistan’s economy had become “stable”.
PM Shehbaz noted that the inflation was in “single digits and the policy rate is at 10.5 per cent”.
The premier recalled that “there was a time when the policy rate used to be 21.5-22pc, and inflation was galloping,” adding that people did not know what was to come.
“We faced a lot of difficulties, and our industrialists and businessmen faced these difficulties head-on,” PM Shehbaz recalled. “There was hope that maybe there would come a better time, and Pakistan would be on its way to progress.”
However, he cautioned that while the “economy has stabilised, this is not enough”.
“I want to present a harsh reality to you,” he said and went on cite increased poverty and unemployment rates and the dearth of profits from current exports.
He noted that industries were struggling to compete with other countries due to higher costs.
The prime minister also acknowledged that “the government cannot dictate the private sector,” and stressed the need for moving towards sustainable growth.
“We have to grow our economy, and it has to be sustainable, and we must encourage export-led growth,” he said, stressing that there was “no other way”.
The premier also spoke in favour of encouraging small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). He stressed that the private sector and the government must “hold the hand of SMEs” in order to provide support.
PM Shehbaz expressed “full faith” in business leaders’ “vision and commitment, which he said held the potential to “transform Pakistan’s economy in a few years”.
As he appreciated their role, he also announced blue passports for the exporters awarded during the ceremony and declared them “ambassadors at large”.
‘Restore PIA to its past glory’
During his address, the premier also recalled the recent privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), expressing hope that the airline would soon be restored to its “past glory”
“PIA’s legacy — ‘great people to fly with’ — was on banners in London and Brussels […] Where did that era go?” he said, adding that it used to be one of the “top ten” airlines in the world.
“I think this is what we need to revive,” he stressed.
“I have full faith that he (Arif Habib) and his partners can revive that era. I want to reiterate that once again, you have the full support of the government,” the premier said.

A consortium led by Arif Habib Corporation Limited had won the auction for 75 per cent shares of PIA in December last year, after making a winning bid of Rs135 billion.</p><small>2026-01-30 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/301802258820e54.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969911/iran-prepared-for-fair-talks-with-us-but-not-on-defence-capabilities-fm-araghchi-says' target='_blank'><strong>Iran prepared for ‘fair’ talks with US but not on defence capabilities, FM Araghchi says</strong></a><br><p>Iran is prepared for the resumption of talks with the United States, but they should be fair and not include Iran’s defence capabilities, Iran’s chief diplomat said on Friday, as regional powers work to prevent military conflict between the two foes.
US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he planned to speak with Iran, even as the US sent another warship to the Middle East and the Pentagon chief said the military would be ready to carry out whatever the president decided.
One of the main demands by the US to resume talks with Iran is curbing its missile programme, a senior Iranian official told Reuters last week. Iran rejects that demand.
“If negotiations are fair and equitable, Iran is ready to participate in such talks,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a press conference with his Turkish counterpart in Istanbul.
Araghchi said no talks between Tehran and Washington were currently arranged.
Regional allies, including Turiye’s, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, have been engaging in diplomatic efforts to prevent a military confrontation between Washington and Tehran.
In response to US threats of military action, Araghchi said Tehran was ready for either negotiations or warfare.
Araghchi, who described his talks with Hakan Fidan as “good and useful”, also said Tehran was ready to engage with regional countries to promote stability and peace.</p><small>2026-01-30 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648097-pleasant-weather-forecast-as-lahore-finalises-strict-safety-plan-for-basant' target='_blank'><strong>Pleasant weather forecast as Lahore finalises strict safety plan for Basant</strong></a><br><p>

The alleged development was reported by journalist Muhammad Malick in his programme on ARY News, ‘Khabar Muhammad Malick Kay Saath’ on Thursday.
In the programme, Malick alleged “one or two important meetings” were held a few days ago, following which it had been decided at the “high-level” that a “final and firm offer” would be made to the PTI.

 

According to him, the government had decided to ask the PTI to “return to Parliament, rejoin [parliamentary] committees and participate in the parliamentary process”.
“In return, two things will happen: the entire ECP will be reconstituted and the law will be amended so that the next elections are free and fair. And more importantly, the government is ready to hold elections a year earlier than scheduled,” he said.
Malick further claimed that if this “package deal” was agreed upon, “you will see Imran’s and his associates’ legal problems easing in the coming days”.
“This is a package deal, take it or leave it,” he further said, apparently referring to the government’s stance regarding its supposed proposal to the PTI.
Malick said that according to the information he had, the offer should have been made by yesterday or the day before, but he had no confirmation of it yet.
However, Information Minister Tarar rejected these reports in a post on the social media platform X early on Friday.
“Absolutely false. I don’t know how these stories are cooked up every few days. Strongly rebutted,” his post said.







Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik also termed the reports “absolutely fake news”.
“No such offer has been made whatsoever! I would urge to check again with whatever ‘sources’ you might claim to have gotten this false information from. The only offer made thus far has been of ‘talks’ between political parties and nothing else with no conditions and/or pre-conditions, hence we must refrain from stating things that are not correct!” he posted on X, also sharing a clip from Malick’s show.







However, the state minister was present in the show when this matter was discussed between Malick and PTI leader Shaukat Yousafzai, who also negated the reports. But, neither was he asked nor did he himself comment on the matter on that occasion.
For, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan also appeared to dismiss the reports during a press conference at the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad today.
“Let me dismiss one thing before you all. It was said yesterday that the government has made an offer to us to hold elections after two years […] This is completely false […] These are all rumours,” he said without referring to any reports in particular.
He further stated that some issues related to his party, PTI founder Imran Khan and democracy were “very serious” and shouldn’t be reported on on the basis of sources.
“Kindly approach our information secretary, Sheikh Waqas, and you can surely quote him [on such matters],” he said.</p><small>2026-01-30 12:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/30170352f8ca024.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969906/trump-brands-minneapolis-nurse-killed-by-federal-agents-an-agitator' target='_blank'><strong>Trump brands Minneapolis nurse killed by federal agents an ‘agitator’</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump walked back his conciliatory tone on Friday after outrage over the killings of two American citizens in Minneapolis by federal agents, branding one of them, Alex Pretti, an “agitator.”
Footage shared online this week reportedly showed intensive care nurse Pretti in a scuffle with federal agents 11 days before he was shot dead on Saturday by officers enforcing an immigration crackdown.
The White House has scrambled to stem widespread outrage over Pretti’s killing, which came weeks after Renee Good, another US citizen and mother of three, was fatally shot by agents in the same city.
Trump claimed he wanted to “de-escalate a little bit” in the fallout of the killings and appointed a new point man in Minneapolis, border chief Tom Homan, who said on Thursday that some federal agents could be withdrawn from the city after weeks of protests against immigration raids.
On Friday, the US president said Pretti, 37, was an “agitator and, perhaps, insurrectionist,” on his Truth Social platform.







“Alex Pretti’s stock has gone way down with the just released video of him screaming and spitting in the face of a very calm and under control ICE Officer,” Trump wrote, referring to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency.
The video reportedly shows Pretti kicking the taillight of the federal agents’ car, before they emerge and tackle him to the ground.
AFP could not immediately verify the footage.
Government shutdown
Backlash over the deaths of Pretti and Good has landed in Congress, with the Senate edging closer to a vote on Friday on a funding deal to avert a government shutdown over the crisis.
Democrats have drawn a red line around funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), demanding it be stripped out and renegotiated to impose new constraints on immigration enforcement agencies.

 

Meanwhile, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman urged more tech figures to “speak out” on Thursday against the Trump administration’s “excesses” after the killings, which have had a global impact.
“We in Silicon Valley can’t bend the knee to Trump. We can’t shrink away and just hope the crisis will fade,” Hoffman wrote in an opinion piece Thursday in The San Francisco Standard.







Trump held a cabinet meeting that same day, but the Minnesota unrest did not come up while reporters were in the room, and he did not call on Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem when asking some officials to give remarks.
Trump sent Homan to Minnesota to take control of immigration operations with orders to report directly to him, effectively sidelining Noem.
Improvements needed
Homan said at his first news conference in the Minnesota city on Thursday that “certain improvements could and should be made,” a marked difference from his predecessor Greg Bovino, who was removed.
He urged Minnesotans to avoid “hateful rhetoric” against federal immigration officers.
He said his staff was “working on a drawdown plan” for some of the more than 3,000 federal agents who have been taking part in “Operation Metro Surge.”
One such measure, for example, would be notifying ICE agents about the release dates of incarcerated migrants considered “criminal public safety risks” so they could be detained by the agency, he said.
“This is commonsense cooperation that allows us to draw down on the number of people we have here,” Homan said.
Steven Gagner, a 41-year-old jewelry designer and “citizen observer” in Minneapolis, was skeptical about the drawdown.
“This administration has proven time and time again that they just lie to us and they do not really hold themselves or anyone else accountable,” he told AFP.
The two agents involved in Pretti’s shooting have been placed on leave, and Homan said any federal agents who breach standards of conduct “will be dealt with”.</p><small>2026-01-30 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/30113417b3a3ecd.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969888/kse-100-closes-in-the-green-at-18417448-points-on-friday' target='_blank'><strong>KSE-100 closes in the green at 184,174.48 points on Friday</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s benchmark index, KSE-100, rebounded slightly on Friday by 1836.36 points after shedding 6131.53 points on the previous day.
The benchmark index closed at 184,174.48 points, 1.01 per cent higher than its previous close of 182,338.12.
Trading was relatively volatile, with the benchmark hitting an intraday high of 186,619.51 points and a low of 182,347.47. Trading activity remained healthy, with volumes of 344.196 million shares and a total traded value of Rs37.47 billion, indicating active participation despite intraday swings.
K-Electric Limited was the top active stock with a volume of 81,415,506, followed by Hascol Petroleum Limited at 66,471,778, Worldcall Telecom Limited at 53,707,694, and Bank of Punjab at 28,310,030.
Chenab Limited (Pref) led the top advancers, gaining 18.34pc to Rs4.71, followed by Apna Microfinance Bank gaining 10.01pc to Rs17.92, Kohinoor Industries Limited gaining 10.01pc to Rs69.37, and First Tri-Star Modaraba gaining 10pc to Rs44.21.
According to Shoaib Memon, executive vice president of equities at AKD securities yesterday’s volatility in the market was on account of the central bank keeping the monetary policy rate unchanged, and “defying all expectations”. Memon noted that the State Bank’s decision caused a “short-term negative reaction for one day after which the market sentiment became positive,” which could be seen in the market’s uptick on Friday.







Despite geopolitical tensions leading to a spike in oil prices, Memon noted that “there is a lot of oil supply,” which will limit the impact of such geopolitical tensions, and an “overall positive sentiment will prevail, but people will wait and see what unfolds between the US and Iran”.

Additional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka removed the observation from the judgment and forwarded the amended version to the Islamabad High Court (IHC) registrar earlier this week in a sealed envelope, a senior court official confirmed.
Sources said the judge had dictated the judgment to his stenographer, and during the first reading, expressly directed that the paragraph containing the observation be deleted. However, the stenographer inadvertently retained the paragraph and resubmitted the judgment, which was signed by the judge later in the evening.
The issue came to light after the prosecution pointed out the paragraph and moved an application seeking its deletion. The judge subsequently expunged the observation, placed a corrected copy on the judicial record, and dispatched another sealed copy to the IHC registrar.
According to sources, disciplinary proceedings have also been initiated against the stenographer, who has been served a show-cause notice.
The deleted observation appeared in para 36 on page 18 of the verdict, where the court made remarks regarding the classification of certain countries as “terrorist states” while discussing the broader context of international conduct and security narratives. The paragraph had no direct nexus with the offences on trial, which related to alleged violations of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).
A day earlier, the Foreign Office distanced itself from the remarks, saying they did not reflect Pakistan’s policy and had no basis in international law.
“We have seen the judgment. These are views of the learned judge,” Foreign Office spokesperson Tahir Andrabi said during a weekly media briefing, when asked about the conviction of Imaan and Hadi.
“Pakistan, of course, does not subscribe to this opinion. This kind of designation of terrorist states does not exist either in UN parlance or under international law,” he added.
Judge Majoka on Jan 24 convicted Imaan and Hadi under Peca for social media posts critical of state institutions. Both were sentenced to 17 years’ rigorous imprisonment each, along with heavy fines, over posts made between 2021 and 2025 that the court deemed anti-state.</p><small>2026-01-30 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/30150458ffc25ce.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969903/syrian-government-kurdish-forces-announce-integration-deal' target='_blank'><strong>Syrian government, Kurdish forces announce integration deal</strong></a><br><p>The Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group declared a ceasefire deal on Friday that foresees a phased integration of Kurdish forces with the state, staving off a potentially bloody battle for the northeast.
The sides announced the agreement after government forces under President Ahmed al-Sharaa captured swathes of northern and eastern Syria from the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) this month, forcing the Kurdish forces to retreat into a shrinking enclave.
The fate of the SDF, which once held a quarter or more of Syria, has been one of the biggest issues looming over the country since fighters led by Sharaa toppled President Bashar al-Assad 14 months ago.
US envoy Tom Barrack, who has been closely involved in mediation efforts, declared the agreement “a profound and historic milestone in Syria’s journey towards national reconciliation, unity, and enduring stability”.







Deal aims to unify Syria
Under the agreement, forces that had amassed on front lines in the north would pull back and Interior Ministry security forces would deploy to the centre of the cities of Hasakah and Qamishli in the northeast, both held by the SDF.
The agreement includes the formation of a military division that will include three SDF brigades, in addition to the formation of a brigade for forces in the SDF-held town of Kobani, also known as Ain al-Arab, which will be affiliated with the governorate of Aleppo.
Governing institutions established by the Kurdish-led groups in the northeast are to be merged with Syrian state institutions.
Damascus and the SDF first struck an integration deal last March, but made scant progress towards implementation before a year-end deadline, paving the way for government forces to go on the march.
Noah Bonsey, senior adviser with the International Crisis Group think-tank, said the deal was “a potentially historic turning point”.
“It looks like both sides have succeeded in defining a middle ground that works for both of them on some incredibly difficult questions,” he said.
“It spares northeast Syria what could have been a really ugly military showdown. Implementation will be tricky. There are a lot of challenges ahead,” he said, adding that he was waiting to see all the terms.
An SDF statement said the deal “aims to unify Syrian territory and achieve full integration in the region by strengthening cooperation between the concerned parties and unifying efforts to rebuild the country”.
Syrian state-run broadcaster Al-Ikhbariya published an almost identical statement, citing a government official.
A senior Syrian government official told Reuters the deal was final and had been reached late on Thursday night, and that implementation was to begin immediately.
The United States has been closely involved in efforts to mediate a deal between the sides for almost a year.
The SDF was once Washington’s main Syrian ally, helping the US military fight the Islamic State. But its position grew weaker as President Donald Trump built close ties with Sharaa.
Kurds on high alert
The areas seized by Damascus this month have included Syria’s main oil fields and important agricultural land.
The statements did not address control of the last remaining SDF-controlled border crossing to northern Iraq, known as Semalka.
The Syrian official said the Syrian state would take over all border crossings. A spokesperson from the SDF did not immediately respond to a Reuters question on the crossing.
The Syrian official said the military division in the northeast would include “groups from the SDF within brigades, alongside other brigades”.
The official said that fighters would join such brigades as “individuals” and that the whole division would be under the authority of Syria’s Defence Ministry.
There was no immediate response from the SDF to questions on the method of integration and the command structure of the brigades.
Kurds have been on high alert for a potential government push into the Kurdish-majority areas of the northeast, mindful of last year’s violence against minority Alawites and Druze.</p><small>2026-01-30 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/30141304e90f785.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1969898/shc-denies-tessoris-request-for-judicial-commission-over-gul-plaza-inferno' target='_blank'><strong>SHC denies Tessori’s request for judicial commission over Gul Plaza inferno</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Friday turned down Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori’s request to constitute a judicial commission to probe the Gul Plaza inferno, citing non-compliance with the relevant law and case law “in letter and spirit”.
In his letter to SHC Chief Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput dated January 27, the Muttahida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader requested the SHC CJ to constitute a judicial inquiry commission to “investigate the Gul Plaza fire incident and to dig out the root cause, negligence facts or violations of law that may have led to this unfortunate occurrence”.
A letter was issued by the high court in response to the governor’s request to constitute a judicial inquiry regarding the incident, a copy of which is available with Dawn.
The response, dated January 28, stated that the chief justice was “pleased to record minutes that the procedure for a formal, independent inquiry into matters of public concern, typically led by a judge or legal expert, is to be appointed by the government so as to establish facts, determine responsibility and make recommendations for cases involving significant public interest, as stipulated under section 3 of the Pakistan Commissions of Inquiry Act, 2017”.
However, it added, the need for consultation with the head of an institution arose in the event where the inquiry envisioned was to be conducted by any member of that particular institution.
The letter stated that this need arose in view of the case law “reported as Abid Shahid Zuberi versus Federation of Pakistan PLD 2023 Supreme Court 493”.
“Accordingly, the entreaty made in the subject letter cannot be approved until the procedure enunciated in the above quoted statute and cited case law is not followed in the letter and spirit,” stated the response.
However, official sources in the SHC told Dawn that the Sindh government’s letter, formally requesting the court to nominate a sitting judge to conduct a judicial inquiry, was under consideration.
According to a letter from CM House to the registrar of the Sindh High Court, a cabinet sub-committee headed by Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah reviewed the matter during its meeting held on Thursday (Jan 29). The committee discussed the circumstances surrounding the fire incident at Gul Plaza and agreed that an independent judicial probe was necessary.
“In order to ensure transparency, accountability and institutional learning, the sub-committee decided that the Honourable Chief Justice of the High Court of Sindh may be requested to nominate a sitting judge of the High Court to conduct a judicial inquiry into the Gul Plaza fire incident to ascertain responsibility and regulatory lapses,” the letter stated.
The correspondence added that the inquiry would focus on fixing responsibility and examining any failures in regulatory oversight linked to the incident, which claimed multiple lives and caused extensive damage to the commercial building.
The CM House also urged the registrar to process the request promptly, stating that “an early response is solicited”.
The deadly inferno at Gul Plaza, which erupted on the night of January 17 and took nearly two days to be fully extinguished, claimed at least 73 lives and left over 1,100 shops in ruins.
Tessori’s letter was issued amid growing calls from the opposition parties to form an inquiry commission in response to preliminary findings on the incident, which suggested that the fire was caused accidentally by a minor son of the owner of a flower shop.</p><small>2026-01-30 10:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/301317497814671.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1965451/its-time-public-toilets-are-treated-as-core-urban-infrastructure' target='_blank'><strong>It’s time public toilets are treated as core urban infrastructure</strong></a><br><p>As cities swell and skylines thicken, urban planning has quietly become a matter of life and health. City planning and policy decisions increasingly dictate how people breathe, move, and survive within the urban sprawl.
From walkable neighbourhoods and cycling infrastructure to accessible parks and green spaces, modern urban planning is increasingly framed as a public health intervention. Efforts to curb air and water pollution through green infrastructure, wastewater management and hygiene facilities, alongside reducing vehicle emissions by promoting public transport, all sit at the heart of healthier cities.
Equally critical is the promise of equity: fair access to housing, healthcare and mobility for all residents, not just the privileged few.
Each of these pillars warrants scrutiny in its own right.
This article, however, narrows the lens to the provision of hygiene infrastructure and specifically examines the availability and condition of public toilets in Karachi’s market areas, where the absence of basic sanitation poses a serious public health risk.
Pakistan’s toilet crisis
Access to toilets is central to safe sanitation, which is fundamental to human health and dignity. This understanding has slowly gained global traction over the past two decades, beginning with the establishment of the World Toilet Organisation in 2001 and culminating in the United Nations’ recognition of World Toilet Day in 2013, observed annually on November 19.
Together, these milestones helped catalyse a broader shift in how cities approach public toilets. Long relegated to the margins of urban planning, public toilets have begun to enter mainstream policy conversations — a shift largely driven by efforts to break the silence surrounding sanitation and recognise toilets as essential urban infrastructure.
Despite this progress, the scale of the crisis remains staggering. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Unicef, 3.4 billion people worldwide still lack access to safe toilets. As a result, drinking water sources are routinely contaminated with human waste, leading to the spread of preventable diseases.
Each day, nearly 1,000 children under the age of five die from illnesses linked to inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene. Environmental damage is equally severe; lakes, rivers, and groundwater continue to be polluted due to insufficient sanitation infrastructure.
In Pakistan, the situation is particularly acute. An estimated 79 million people lack access to proper toilet facilities, per World Bank data. The crisis is most pronounced in rural areas, compounded by rapid population growth, weak infrastructure planning, recurring natural and man-made disasters, and shifting economic pressures. Open defecation contaminates groundwater and natural water sources, fostering bacteria and pathogens that make water unsafe for consumption.
Beyond public health, inadequate access to toilets has serious social and gendered implications. Limited or unsafe facilities disproportionately affect women, exposing them to harassment, abuse, and infection, while also forcing many to delay relieving themselves (behaviour that can result in severe medical complications). The Covid-19 pandemic and the continued emergence of infectious diseases have further underscored the importance of functional public toilets as a basic prerequisite for healthy cities.
A private struggle in a public space
Karachi, a city that contributes substantially to Pakistan’s national economy, continues to function with a strikingly minimal presence of basic public amenities. Among these, access to hygienic and dignified sanitation facilities remains severely limited. Embedding hygiene into dense urban environments requires deliberate planning aimed at providing a humane and convenient experience that can significantly enhance urban livability.
To examine this gap, a study was undertaken by the Department of Architecture and Planning at NED University, focusing on public toilet accessibility in Saddar, one of Karachi’s most prominent commercial localities. Saddar is characterised by a diverse mix of retail and wholesale activity housed within buildings of varying sizes, ages, and typologies. Its vibrancy and chaos are driven by constant flows of shoppers, vendors, workers, and vehicles, resulting in exceptionally high pedestrian and traffic density throughout the day.
The study revealed deeply concerning deficiencies in sanitation infrastructure and access to public toilets. This issue remains largely invisible because visitors and passersby may not immediately feel the absence. But for those who spend long hours in these areas, such as workers, vendors, and shoppers who stay from morning till evening, the lack of clean or even functional toilets is a daily hardship. In Pakistan, the much-discussed global “toilet revolution” has yet to meaningfully materialise.


Five key blocks in Saddar, each representing zones of high commercial activity.

For analytical clarity, Saddar was divided into five key blocks, each representing zones of high public or commercial activity. Toilet facilities located in ancillary spaces, such as petrol pumps, were also documented. The research team comprised the author alongside three student interns: Faryal Raza, Ghulam Rasool Magsi, and Khadija.
Block 1: NED University’s city campus and surroundings
The first block, encompassing NED University’s city campus, includes public toilets located within institutional premises such as SM Arts and Commerce College, the National Museum, and People’s Square. People’s Square, a pedestrianised public space, offers centrally located and reasonably maintained toilet facilities. However, these remain accessible only after 5pm, significantly limiting their utility during peak daytime hours.
Additional facilities are present near the mosque on Strachan Road, outside SM Arts and Commerce College. These are male-only and consist of three open WC stalls without doors and a single enclosed toilet. Such a layout not only raises sanitation concerns but also renders the facility entirely unusable for women.
Toilets at the National Museum, while clean and equipped with separate male and female sections, are semi-public (restricted to museum visitors or those visiting Burnes Garden), thereby limiting their role as truly public infrastructure.
Block 2: Lighthouse Market area
The Lighthouse Market area, one of Saddar’s busiest zones, is frequented by a constant stream of shoppers and vendors. Despite this, no formal public toilet facilities were identified, apart from those within a nearby mosque.
The mosque’s toilet complex includes several open WC stalls (without doors) and a limited number of enclosed units. Low partition walls, lack of women-only facilities, and poor maintenance make these toilets unsuitable. Notably, these inadequately maintained facilities are fee-based. Given the scale of commercial activity in the area, the absence of accessible public toilets is a particularly alarming finding.


Public toilets across Empress Market

Block 3: High Court and Sindh Secretariat area
Block 3 comprises the Sindh High Court (SHC) and Sindh Secretariat precinct, catering primarily to government employees, legal professionals, and visitors. Washrooms are available within the SHC premises near the entrance; however, these are semi-public and accessible only to authorised users. While these facilities are well-maintained, offering gender segregation, privacy, wheelchair accessibility, and acceptable hygiene standards, they do not cater to the broader public. Nearby areas, such as the passport office, where large crowds queue daily, remain entirely devoid of public toilet facilities.
Block 4: Zainab Market and surrounding shopping complexes
The retail hub surrounding Zainab Market, Medina City Mall, Victoria Mall, and the Leather Market was identified as Block 4. While toilets exist within these commercial buildings, their placement and design reveal that sanitation was treated as an afterthought. Facilities are typically located on upper floors, away from primary circulation areas, reducing visibility and accessibility.
Gender segregation is largely compromised, with minimal consideration for privacy or cultural norms. Circulation space within toilet areas is often restricted to the bare minimum (approximately 3ft), making movement difficult and uncomfortable. All documented stalls consisted of squatting WCs, with no alternatives for elderly users, people with disabilities, pregnant women, or children.
Medina City Mall contained the largest toilet complex, comprising 14 enclosed stalls and seven open toilets. However, only one toilet was designated for women, positioned directly at the shared entrance used by men. This arrangement reflects a disregard for privacy and cultural sensitivity, leading many women to avoid the facility altogether.
Additionally, the presence of only four washbasins is inadequate for the volume of users. Similar issues, such as a lack of gender segregation, poor sanitation, and insufficient privacy, were observed at the Leather Market and Victoria Mall.

Block 5: Jahangir Park, Empress Market, and Mochi Gali
The area encompassing Jahangir Park, Empress Market, and Mochi Gali was marked Block 5. In Mochi Gali, a well-used toilet facility is located at the Jamia Masjid at the end of the lane. This is accessible from outside the masjid and includes 12 closed toilets and eight open toilets, all of which are for men and unsuitable for women due to privacy concerns. These facilities are charged per user and also face sanitation issues.
Jahangir Park, located in close proximity, has comparatively well-maintained toilet facilities that are accessible during park hours, from 10am to 10pm. The park has two entrances: one opening onto Zebunnisa Street and the other facing Empress Market. Notably, the gate towards Empress Market remains closed to prevent users from Empress Market and Mochi Gali from accessing the park’s toilets. As a result, women from these areas must walk the full length of Mochi Gali, enter the park via Zebunnisa Street, and navigate through the park to reach the facilities. While the toilets are clean, adequately sized, and inclusive, with separate male and female sections, wheelchair access, and sufficient basins, their restricted accessibility significantly undermines their function as a public amenity.
Empress Market itself lacks any dedicated toilet facilities for its users. Directly across from the market, on a footpath, there is an illegally constructed toilet complex intended for market-goers. This facility includes nine enclosed stalls and three open toilets, but its placement on a pedestrian footpath results in severe spatial congestion.


Mapping public toilets in Empress Market area

The presence of open stalls, combined with the absence of gender segregation, renders the facility largely unusable for women. Compounding these issues is the availability of only a single washbasin for all users. Despite its inadequate design and poor accessibility, the facility charges users per visit through a payment counter at the entrance.
Accessibility remains a critical concern for women in Empress Market and Mochi Gali, many of whom are compelled to rely on Jahangir Park as the only viable option for safe toilet use. Opening both entrances of the park would substantially improve access for these underserved populations and enhance the overall usability of existing infrastructure.
Restroom facilities at petrol pumps were also assessed, as these are common alternatives for the public. Some petrol pumps, particularly those near Empress Market, keep their toilets locked due to theft concerns, while others restrict use exclusively to staff. A few stations, such as those near the provincial assembly, do provide facilities accessible to women; however, regular maintenance and oversight are required to ensure continued usability.
Across Saddar, the provision of toilet facilities remains grossly inadequate when measured against pedestrian footfall and the number of people who work in and rely on these markets daily. Existing standards for public buildings typically allocate sanitation facilities in proportion to user volume, yet the findings of this study suggest that toilets are designed only to serve those in absolute desperation.
Sharing this research is intended as an appeal to citizens, developers, regulatory authorities, and property owners to reimagine public toilets as essential market-support infrastructure. A 21st-century city cannot claim to be functional or inclusive without adequate and accessible sanitation facilities for all.
A crisis that demands immediate sanitation reform
Needless to say, there is an urgent need for improvements in public toilet facilities across Saddar. The existing infrastructure, both within the blocks and at petrol pumps, fails to adequately serve the public, especially women and vulnerable groups.
Most public toilets suffer from unhygienic conditions, including contaminated water, damaged or inappropriate flooring, and flimsy structures. Important elements such as properly defined access points and legible signage are almost entirely absent. Chronic neglect has also created serious safety hazards, including exposed and unsecured wiring that raises the risk of short circuits.
Internally, cramped circulation spaces, flawed layouts that compromise privacy, and the complete absence of waiting areas severely undermine functionality. These deficiencies are not merely design oversights but operational failures that demand immediate intervention to ensure safety, dignity, and usability.
Providing well-designed, easily identifiable convenience facilities is essential to creating humane urban environments. International case studies demonstrate that effective management and maintenance are often achieved through clearly defined public-private partnerships, where private operators maintain facilities while supporting costs through attached services, commercial activity, or advertising.
In the same vein, the public sector must play a facilitative role by ensuring access to appropriate locations, utilities, and regulatory support. As a historic and commercial heart of the city, Saddar deserves public sanitation infrastructure that pays heed to the needs of its diverse and vibrant users.

Spot gold lost 3pc to $5,232.57 per ounce, as of 05:20 GMT, after falling more than 5pc earlier. It scaled a record high of $5,594.82 on Thursday.
Prices have risen more than 20pc so far in January, heading for a sixth straight monthly gain and the largest monthly advance since 1980.
US gold futures for February delivery fell 1.8pc to $5,225.0 per ounce on Friday.
“So, a potentially less dovish Fed Chairman pick, a rebound in the dollar, and gold giving way to overbought conditions have contributed to the decline in the price of the precious metal,” KCM Chief Trade Analyst Tim Waterer said.
US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he intends to announce his pick to replace Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Friday, with speculation intensifying that the nod will go to former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.
“Rumours that Kevin Warsh will replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair have weighed on gold during Asian trade,” said Matt Simpson, a senior analyst at StoneX.
The dollar recovered from multi-year lows, supported in part by the Fed’s decision on Wednesday to leave interest rates unchanged, but was poised for a second straight weekly decline.
A stronger dollar makes greenback-priced gold more expensive for overseas buyers. Markets still expect two interest rate cuts in 2026.
Gold exports from Switzerland to the UK, home to the world’s largest over-the-counter gold trading hub, jumped to their highest since August 2019, customs data showed on Thursday.
The Hang Seng Gold ETF surged more than 9pc on its trading debut in Hong Kong in the previous session.

As Western leaders reel from Trump’s unpredictability, Starmer is the latest to head to China.
In three-hour talks with President Xi Jinping on Thursday, the British leader called for a “more sophisticated relationship” with improved market access, lower tariffs and investment deals while also discussing football and Shakespeare.

In Washington, however, replying to questions about the closer ties, Trump said, “Well, it’s very dangerous for them to do that.” He was speaking to reporters ahead of the premiere of the “Melania” film at the Kennedy Center.
He did not elaborate.
Trump, who plans to travel to China in April, threatened last week to impose tariffs on Canada after Prime Minister Mark Carney struck economic deals with Beijing on a recent visit.
A Downing Street spokesperson and China’s Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Around the time of Trump’s comments, Starmer told a meeting of the UK-China Business Forum in the Chinese capital that his “very warm” meetings with Xi had provided “real progress”.

Starmer hailed deals on visa-free travel and lower whisky tariffs as “really important access, symbolic of what we’re doing with the relationship”.
“That is the way that we build the mutual trust and respect that is so important,” Starmer said.
Before heading for the financial hub of Shanghai, he met Chinese business leaders, such as Yin Tongyue, chief executive of carmaker Chery, which plans to open a research and development centre for its commercial vehicle arm in the English city of Liverpool, a city official said during Starmer’s visit.
Not choosing between US and China
Starmer, whose centre-left Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, has made improving relations with the world’s second-largest economy a priority.
His visit to China comes amid Trump’s on-off threats of trade tariffs and pledges to grab control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which have rattled long-standing US allies, Britain among them.



Because of his country’s long history of working closely with the United States, Britain could continue to strengthen economic ties with China without angering Trump, Starmer told reporters on the aeroplane en route to China.
“The relationship we have with the United States is one of the closest … we hold,” he said, enumerating areas such as defence, security, intelligence and trade.
Starmer said Britain would not have to choose between closer ties with the United States or China, highlighting Trump’s September visit to Britain that unveiled 150 billion pounds of US investment into the country.
Washington also received advanced notice of Britain’s objectives for the China trip, a British government official said on condition of anonymity as the matter is a sensitive one.
Starmer, who normally avoids criticising Trump, has been more willing to defy the US president in recent weeks.
He urged Trump to apologise for his “frankly appalling” remarks last week that some NATO troops avoided frontline combat and said he would not yield to his demands to annex Greenland.
Tough export market
German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is expected to visit China soon, and Carney was preceded by French President Emmanuel Macron in December, when Xi accompanied him on a rare trip outside the capital.
“To all world leaders meeting with Xi Jinping: China sells nothing but cheap products and cheap friendships,” the Republican-led US House Foreign Affairs Committee said on X on Thursday.







Before Trump’s comments on the closer ties, his Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said it was unlikely that Starmer’s efforts with China would pay off.
“The Chinese are the greatest exporters and they are very, very difficult when you’re trying to export to them,” he told reporters. “So good luck if the British are trying to export to China … it’s just unlikely.”
Asked if Trump would threaten Britain with tariffs as he did Canada, Lutnick replied, “Unless the prime minister of Britain sort of takes on the United States and says very difficult things, I doubt it.”</p><small>2026-01-30 08:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648047-41-indian-backed-terrorists-killed-in-balochistan-operations-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>41 India-backed terrorists killed in Balochistan operations: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>

A total of 803 people lost their lives in traffic accidents in Karachi in 2025. The Karachi traffic police, however, maintains that the situation began to improve during the latter half of the year.
Deputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that one accident occurred at 1:05am on Friday morning.
According to him, a couple and a child were on a motorcycle when a trailer hit them at the Native Jetty Bridge. They sustained critical injuries and were transported to Civil Hospital Karachi, where doctors pronounced them dead.
The victims’ identity could not be immediately ascertained.
“The errant driver managed to escape from the spot along with the heavy vehicle,” Raza said.
In another fatal accident, a man was killed in Baldia Town.
The DIG said the man was on a motorcycle when a loaded dump truck hit him at Baldia-4. He suffered critical injuries and was taken to Civil Hospital Karachi, where he was declared dead.
“The police rushed to the spot, arrested the errant driver … and impounded the heavy vehicle,” the DIG said.
In December, the Sindh government banned the daytime movement of heavy traffic vehicles in Karachi for two months as the city had witnessed a steep increase in traffic accidents, with many resulting from collisions with heavy vehicles such as dumper trucks and water tankers.
A seven-year-old boy was killed on Wednesday when a truck ran him over in Korangi’s Mehran Town area, while another seven-year-old boy was killed earlier this month by a water tanker in Karachi’s Manghopir area.
Also this month, two men lost their lives in separate reckless driving incidents when they were hit by trailer trucks, near Mowach Goth and Valika, respectively, police and rescue service officials said.</p><small>2026-01-30 07:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648028-outdated-systems-equipment-plague-saddar-fire-station' target='_blank'><strong>Outdated systems, equipment plague Saddar fire station</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are among the Asian locations that tightened airport screening checks this week to guard against such a spread after India confirmed infections.
“The WHO considers the risk of further spread of infection from these two cases is low,” the agency told Reuters in an email on Friday, adding that India had the capacity to contain such outbreaks.
“There is no evidence yet of increased human-to-human transmission,” it said, adding that it has coordinated with Indian health authorities.
But it did not rule out further exposure to the virus, which circulates in the bat population in parts of India and neighbouring Bangladesh.
Carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, the virus can cause fever and brain inflammation. It has a fatality rate ranging from 40 per cent to 75pc, with no cure, though vaccines in development are still being tested.

 

It spreads to humans from infected bats, or fruit they contaminate, but person-to-person transmission is not easy as it typically requires prolonged contact with those infected.
Small outbreaks are not unusual and virologists say the risk to the general population remains low.
The source of infection was not yet fully understood, said the WHO. It classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen because of a lack of licensed vaccines or treatments, a high fatality rate, and a fear it could mutate into a more transmissible variant.
Nipah not new to India
The two health workers infected in India’s eastern state of West Bengal late in December are being treated in hospital, local authorities have said.







India regularly reports sporadic Nipah infections, particularly in its southern state of Kerala, regarded as one of the world’s highest-risk regions for the virus, linked to dozens of deaths since it first emerged there in 2018.
The outbreak is the seventh documented in India and the third in West Bengal, where outbreaks in 2001 and 2007 were in districts bordering Bangladesh, which reports outbreaks almost annually, the WHO said.</p><small>2026-01-30 06:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/648013-preps-in-full-swing-as-lahore-gears-up-for-three-day-basant-festival' target='_blank'><strong>Preps in full swing as Lahore gears up for three-day Basant festival</strong></a><br><p>

Trump said he is speaking with Iran and left open the possibility of avoiding a military operation after earlier warning that time was “running out” for Tehran as the United States sends a large naval fleet to the region.
When asked if he would have talks with Iran, Trump told reporters: “I have had and I am planning on it.”
“We have a group headed out to a place called Iran, and hopefully we won’t have to use it,” the US president added, while speaking to media at the premiere of a documentary about his wife Melania.
As Brussels and Washington dialled up their rhetoric and Iran issued stark threats this week, UN chief Antonio Guterres has called for nuclear negotiations to “avoid a crisis that could have devastating consequences in the region”.
An Iranian military spokesman warned Tehran’s response to any US action would not be limited — as it was in June last year when American planes and missiles briefly joined Israel’s short air war against Iran — but would be a decisive response “delivered instantly”.
Brigadier General Mohammad Akraminia told state television US aircraft carriers have “serious vulnerabilities” and that numerous American bases in the Gulf region are “within the range of our medium-range missiles”.
“If such a miscalculation is made by the Americans, it will certainly not unfold the way Trump imagines — carrying out a quick operation and then, two hours later, tweeting that the operation is over,” he said.
An official in the Gulf, where states host US military sites, told AFP that fears of a US strike on Iran are “very clear”.
“It would bring the region into chaos, it would hurt the economy not just in the region but in the US and cause oil and gas prices to skyrocket,” the official added.
‘Protests crushed in blood’
Qatar’s leader Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and Iran’s President Masoud Pezeshkian held a call to discuss “efforts being made to de-escalate tensions and establish stability,” the Qatar News Agency (QNA) reported.
The European Union, meanwhile, piled on the pressure by designating the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) a “terrorist organisation” over a deadly crackdown on recent mass protests.
“‘Terrorist’ is indeed how you call a regime that crushes its own people’s protests in blood,” said EU chief Ursula von der Leyen, welcoming the “overdue” decision.
Though largely symbolic, the EU decision has already drawn a warning from Tehran.
Iran’s military slammed “the illogical, irresponsible and spite-driven action of the European Union”, alleging the bloc was acting out of “obedience” to Tehran’s arch-foes the United States and Israel.
Iranian officials have blamed the recent protest wave on the two countries, claiming their agents spurred “riots” and a “terrorist operation” that hijacked peaceful rallies sparked over economic grievances.
In Tehran on Thursday, citizens expressed grim resignation.
“I think the war is inevitable and a change must happen. It can be for worse, or better. I am not sure,” said a 29-year-old waitress, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.
“I am not in favour of war. I just want something to happen that would result in something better.”
Another 29-year-old woman, an unemployed resident of an upscale neighbourhood in northern Tehran, told AFP: “I believe that life has highs and lows and we are now at the lowest point.”
Trump had threatened military action if protesters were killed in the anti-government demonstrations that erupted in late December and peaked on January 8 and 9.
But his more recent statements have turned to Iran’s nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at making an atomic bomb.
On Wednesday, he said “time is running out” for Tehran to make a deal, warning the US naval strike group that arrived in Middle East waters on Monday was “ready, willing and able” to hit Iran.
Iranian authorities acknowledge that thousands were killed during the protests, giving a toll of more than 3,000 deaths, but say the majority were members of the security forces or bystanders killed by “rioters”.
Billboards and banners have gone up in the capital Tehran to bolster the authorities’ messages.

According to Justice Arbab Muham­mad Tahir’s written order, released on Thursday, Advocate Salman Akram Raja told the bench that he was unable to effectively assist in the case as he had been denied access to his client.
He said meaningful progress on key legal points could not be made without receiving direct instructions from his client.
The court noted that it had earlier directed the authorities to allow the meeting and now sought an explanation for the non-compliance.
The state counsel has been ordered to submit a detailed report before the next hearing, scheduled for Feb 24.

State counsel told to submit detailed report before next hearing on Feb 24

The petition, currently being heard by the IHC, raises constitutional and legal questions relating to freedom of expression, due process and the regulation of social media platforms.
Meanwhile, a Pakistan Telecom-mu­nication Authority report submitted to the court revealed that over the past three and a half years, the PTA made three separate requests to X to block or restrict the PTI founder’s account but received no substantive response.
The first request was sent on Aug 21, 2022, followed by another on April 18, 2024, citing court convictions in the Toshakhana, cypher and unlawful marriage cases. Despite this, X did not act on the requests.
On Nov 27, 2025, the PTA sought the blocking of 47 tweets from the PTI founder’s account, but X blocked only one.
During recent proceedings, the IHC had expressed dissatisfaction with PTA’s response and questioned how the case could proceed if counsel continued to be denied access to the PTI founder.
The court had also taken note of increasing restrictions on meetings between the former premier, his family members and party leaders.

The operation, which continued from morning till evening, was launched in the Sperka and Kotka Akbar Ali Khan areas of the tehsil and at least seven militants were inju­red in the heavy shootout. The security forces targeted the terrorists’ hideouts with more than 25 quadcopter strikes, while a heavy exchange of fire continued throughout the clashes, sources claimed.
The slain commander was identified as Zewaran alias Al-Badri, who was wanted in several cases. Following the operation, continuous surveillance by drones and helicopters was being carried out in the region to round up the remaining terrorists trying to flee the area.
According to locals, the operation also resulted in the death of three civilians, including two women, whose bodies were retrieved from a house in the afternoon. A local resident told Dawn that the deceased included Naeemullah, his mother, and his grandmother. The deceased’s son, wife, sister and cousin also sustained injuries and were taken to a hospital. Separately, Khalifa Gul Nawaz Hospital spokesperson Muhammad Noman told Dawn that four injured persons were brought to the hospital, including two women and two children.
Sources said the operation started in the morning and heavy contingents of police and security forces reached the area, while the residents were told to stay inside their houses.
The operation was supervised by Bannu RPO Sajjad Khan, DPO Yasir Afridi, and other senior security officials. They remained present in the field and personally monitored the action.
Earlier this week, two terrorists were killed in a shootout with police in Domel. On January 13, armed assailants killed four members of a peace committee in the district. The incident took place in the Gulbadin Landi Dak area of Bannu district.

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Thursday opposed the use of force and coercive measures against Iran, stressing that disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy as Western pressure on Tehran intensified with a continuing US naval build-up in the Gulf and fresh European designations and sanctions.
The Pakistani position was articulated across official engagements and public statements, including a telephone call bet­ween Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Iranian President Masoud Pezesh­kian, con­­tacts between the two foreign ministers, and remarks by the Foreign Off­ice spo­kesperson at the media briefing.
In a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz “underscored the importance of sustained dialogue and diplomatic engagement for promoting peace, security and development in the region”.







Separately, the Foreign Office said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar spoke with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araghchi, conveying concern over the evolving situation and reiterating Pakistan’s position.
Mr Dar “expressed concern over the evolving regional situation and underscored that dialogue and diplomacy remain the only viable way forward”, the Foreign Office said in a statement.







At the weekly media briefing, Foreign Office spokesman Tahir Andrabi expanded on Islamabad’s stance, linking it explicitly to opposition to force, sanctions and external pressure.
“Pakistan has always advocated for peace and diplomacy to settle all outstanding issues. Our advocacy for peace diplomacy continues and this remains our stated position,” he said. “This region cannot afford war, turmoil because this in essence stops the economic development and prosperity. So, we hope that peace and diplomacy will prevail. We oppose the use of force. We are against coercive measures against Iran and interference in its internal affairs,” he added.
Referring to the nuclear issue and multilateral diplomacy, the spokesman said Pakistan supported efforts anch­ored in international law, citing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and subsequent UN Security Council resolutions, including resolutions presented at the Council in September last year.
He also cited a recent UN Human Rights Council resolution on Iran that opposed the use of force and called for upholding the UN Charter, noting that “we subscribe to these positions, and we will continue to do so”.
Islamabad’s emphasis on dialogue came as the European Union significantly hardened its stance on Iran and the build-up of US forces in the Gulf continued.

 

EU foreign ministers on Thursday unanimously agreed to designate Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organisation. At the same time, the Council of the European Union adopted a fresh sanctions package over human rights violations and Iran’s military support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, adding 15 individuals and six entities to its blacklist.
Moreover, a significant American military build-up in the Middle East is underway, which has been described by analysts as the largest since the 2025 strikes.
The US has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, accompanied by three destroyers and more than 5,000 troops, joining existing assets including F-15E Strike Eagles and THAAD and Patriot missile systems, raising total US forces in the region to around 50,000 by late January.
Meanwhile, the Trump administration is hosting senior defence and intelligence officials from Israel and Saudi Arabia for talks on Iran this week, American news website Axios reported on Thursday.
‘Crushing response’
Iran’s army chief Amir Hatami on Thursday vowed a “crushing response” to any attack, according to state television, which reported 1,000 “strategic drones” had joined the combat regiments.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman have pressed for dialogue while signalling they will not allow their airspace, territory or waters to be used for military action against Iran, because of fears of retaliation and economic disruption.
Turkiye on Thursday said it would offer to mediate between Washington and Tehran during an upcoming visit by Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, after Ankara’s top diplomat urged Washington to start nuclear talks with Tehran.
“It’s wrong to attack Iran. It’s wrong to start the war again. Iran is ready to negotiate on the nuclear file again,” Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Al-Jazeera.
Nato member Turkiye is also weighing contingency plans along its 530-kilometre border with Iran should the dispute escalate, a senior official told AFP.
Iran ally Russia on Thursday also said that “the potential for negotiations is not exhausted”.
“Any use of force can only create chaos in the region and lead to very dangerous consequences,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.
Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty in a call with his French counterpart Jean-Noel Barrot stressed the need for “the resumption of dialogue between the United States and Iran regarding the Iranian nuclear file”, Cairo said.

At a public hearing presided over by legal member of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), Amina Ahmed, the government also reported that it was working on another tariff package under which unutilised electricity would be offered at marginal cost — the actual cost of power supply — to various consumer categories during day time to absorb surplus capacity because of low demand amid rising solar penetration.
“The government is currently working on various options to offer an incentive tariff package (as an alternative to growing net metering), and soon we will approach Nepra for approval”, after its clearance from the federal cabinet, said an official of Power Planning and Monitoring Company (PPMC) of the Power Division.
He was responding to Nepra member Maqsood Anwar Khan, who asked whether the government intended to address the widening gap between day and night utilisation of grid electricity, as net-metered consumers draw from the grid at night. Officials cited a low of around 8,261MW and a peak of 14,888MW in Dec.

Consumers in for Rs1.41 per unit hike in February

A CPPA official said the consumers enjoyed a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of 93 paise per unit in January on account of consumption in November, which had come to an end. He said power distribution companies (Discos) would now need 48 paise per unit additional FCA on account of December consumption, resulting in a net increase of Rs1.41 per unit to be charged to consumers in February billing.

 

They confirmed that the higher FCA cost was mainly due to an incremental incentive package that increased consumption by about half a billion units, resulting in the need for utilisation of expensive power plants, given the limitations of hydropower and nuclear plants. On average, consumption in December was 6.5 per cent higher than in November and 8.47pc higher than in December 2024, while annual growth in demand was reported at 2.45pc.
Industrial representatives Rehan Javed and Amir Shaikh challenged a 22pc growth in consumption by the industrial sector on account of a three-year incremental incentive package claimed by the CPPA and PPMC officials and argued that official data was not based on facts.

PM Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir witness the exchange of PIA’s privatisation documents.—White Star

• PM says airline’s ‘glory days’ to return under Arif Habib-led consortium• NA panel seeks detailed report on PIA accord, employee safeguards
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said the “glory days” of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) would return under the new management, as the government signed transaction documents for the airline’s privatisation.
“PIA will reach new heights under the leadership of the Arif Habib Consortium. The airline will improve its performance, punctuality, cabin service and professional standards,” the prime minister said while speaking at the signing ceremony.
The ceremony was attended by Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and federal ministers.







PM Shehbaz congratulated the nation on the signing of the transaction and said Arif Habib and his team were among Pakistan’s “distinguished business ambassadors” who had contributed to the country’s progress. He said the new owners’ first priority would be passenger comfort and safety.
Recalling the airline’s past, the prime minister said PIA had been at its peak in the 1960s, with a recognised presence across Pakistan and in world capitals. He also praised the role of federal ministers and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Privatisation Muhammad Ali in completing the transaction.
The prime minister said the privatisation process was conducted transparently and telecast live. He said the bidding closed at Rs180 billion, of which the consortium would spend Rs135bn on improving PIA.
He hoped that the new PIA owners would help the airline regain its past glory through “untiring efforts and innovation”.
Mr Ali explained the salient features of PIA’s privatisation and said the public would benefit from improved services.
NA body seeks details
Meanwhile, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation on Thursday sought further clarification and comprehensive information on the transaction from the Privatisation Commission.
Chaired by Dr Muhammad Farooq Sattar, the committee asked the commission to submit a comprehensive report at its next meeting, including employee participation, consultation mechanisms and grievance redress.
The meeting was convened to review ongoing privatisation transactions. The secretary of the privatisation ministry briefed the committee on the PIA process, including its stages and the current status of the deal.
The committee was also briefed by the power ministry on the installation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) meters.
It was told that as of Jan 9, a total of 1,614,296 AMI meters had been installed across distribution companies, surpassing the target of 1.5 million.
The panel was also briefed on Pakistan Re-Insurance Company Limited (PRCL), which is listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange and remains majority-owned by the government.
The committee was told that PRCL is planned for partial privatisation through a secondary public offering, but the transaction has been deferred due to unfavourable market conditions and valuation concerns.
Regarding Sukkur Electric Power Company Limited (Sepco), the committee was informed that the government was considering private-sector participation as part of power sector reforms, given the utility’s high losses, weak recovery and governance issues.
Outright privatisation was not considered feasible at this stage, while options under consideration included a management contract or partial privatisation, supported by preparatory reforms and financial restructuring.
The committee str­essed that consumer protection, Nepra oversight and employee safeguards must remain integral to any reform process.

The border closure triggered sharp revenue losses for KP as the collection of infrastructure development cess (IDC) fell to Rs3.48 billion, from Rs7.42bn, during the first seven months of the current fiscal year over the corresponding period of last year.
Muzammil Aslam, the KP chief minister’s finance adviser, has written a four-page letter to Commerce Minister Jam Kamal, seeking an urgent meeting of provincial and federal stakeholders.
The meeting is expected to deliberate on the revenue implications for KP and the challenges faced by exporters and traders, including stuck payments and the loss of business activity.

Collection of cess has dropped to Rs3.48bn in 7MFY26 from Rs7.42bn

The provincial government has already constituted a revenue review committee to examine the situation and found an alarming decline in IDC since suspension of the border trade.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan remain heavily concentrated at Torkham and Ghulam Khan, while trade through Kharlachi and Angoor Adda, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, continues to decline, indicating a post-Taliban shift in cross-border trade patterns. Torkham’s growth reflects its role as the gateway to Afghanistan’s key consumption centres, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa border stations accounting for nearly 80 per cent of total exports in FY25.
Prolonged disruption
Mr Muzammil informed the federal commerce ministry that the prolonged border disruption was creating serious revenue, economic, and employment consequences for the province. He said revenue shortfall has emerged as a major blow to provincial finances.
He said the initial disruption in cess collection had originated from a court stay order, which was resolved in November. Recovery efforts were launched immediately after the legal hurdle was removed.
But those efforts failed to produce results as cross-border trade remained suspended, effectively bringing commercial activity to a standstill.

 

The adviser further pointed out that exporters and traders now face consignments and payments stranded across the border, intensifying liquidity pressures across the trading community.
The financial stress has left many businesses unable to meet their statutory cess obligations because of the sudden and prolonged trade suspension.
Muzammil Aslam further pointed out that the decline in IDC collection is visible each month, with particularly steep drops recorded since October, when receipts fell from Rs1.3bn to under Rs487 million. In November, collections dropped to just Rs198m from Rs1.29bn during the same month in FY25.
The collection of cess is directly linked to the movement of goods across borders and commercial activity. With trade suspended, achieving collection targets has become virtually impossible.
Traders’ grievances
Mr Muzammil also spoke about problems faced by traders. “They have genuine difficulty in making payments because they are unable to receive funds from buyers due to the overall stagnation of cross-border business.
“This situation is beyond the control of both traders and tax collectors and may result in a broader slowdown in economic activity across the province if trade disruptions continue.”

An office-bearer of a traders’ association said India “has now opened an economic front”, after facing defeat on the battlefield, by signing trade deals with several countries and the European Union.
Saquib Fayyaz Magoon, chairman of the Businessmen Panel Progressive (BMPP) and vice president of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), cautioned that the agreement could erode Pakistan’s competitive edge in European markets.
Despite Pakistan’s GSP Plus status, which allows duty-free access for nearly 80 per cent of its exports to the EU, the country’s textile exports stand at $6.2 billion, marginally ahead of India’s $5.6bn exports even though the latter faces a 12 per cent tariff.
“Once India secures zero-rated access under the EU deal, Pakistan’s advantage will vanish and our exports could suffer a severe blow,” Saquib Magoon warned.

Traders fear Pakistan could lose its ‘competitive edge’ if govt doesn’t take urgent measures

He feels Pakistan could lose its foothold in the European market if urgent corrective measures are not taken. “Once a market is lost, regaining entry becomes extremely difficult,” he said, urging the government to act decisively.
Magoon called for reducing power tariff to nine cents per unit, simplifying the tax regime, and offering incentives to exporters. “The government must declare an export emergency and adopt industry-friendly policies to safeguard the country’s economic interests.”
Drawing a parallel with military success, Mr Magoon observed: “Just as the armed forces secured victory on the battlefield, the business community now needs government support to win this economic war.”
A representative of JS Global said the EU and India had concluded the agreement after two decades of negotiations. Its upshot is that India’s textile and garment products would now “enjoy a reduction, or even elimination of tariff altogether, in EU states”.
India’s textile and garment exports are currently subject to an eight to 12pc tariff under the GSP regime (which was suspended last week), while Pakistan enjoys zero tariffs under the GSP Plus status.
With the FTA now in place, Pakistan is likely to lose its advantage, which was already thin, as India benefits from higher value addition and “vertical integration”, JS Global said.
The company fears the deal would hit Pakistan’s exports, 24pc of which go to the EU. The bloc remains the top destination for textile exports after the USA.
Price undercutting
Faisal Arshad, who heads the Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PHMA), said India-EU FTA could lead to aggressive price undercutting by Indian exporters in the EU market, an erosion of Pakistan’s market share in hosiery, knitwear, and value-added garments. This would have a knock-on effect in the form of an increased pressure on export margins, employment, and sector sustainability.
He cautioned that Pakistan’s reliance on GSP+ alone is no longer sufficient to safeguard its exports. “Tariff-free access without recognition of compliance and cost burdens creates an uneven playing field.
“Pakistan must not be disadvantaged for adhering to international conventions while competing with countries that do not face similar obligations,” Faisal Arshad said.
The PHMA chief urged the government to immediately take corrective measures, including rationalisation of power tariffs for export-oriented industries, provision of competitive financing and export refinancing schemes.
“If India secures FTA access while Pakistan’s structural cost disadvantages remain unaddressed, our textile exports will suffer,” he said. “Strategic and timely policy intervention is essential to protect exports and jobs.”
Tough conditions
According to Mr Arshad, Pakistan’s GSP+ access comes with strict conditionalities. “We are required to ratify, implement, and continuously report on compliance with 27 international conventions related to human rights, labour standards, environment, and governance.”
In contrast, the PHMA chairman observed, India’s market access under the FTA does not carry the same obligations.
He said Indian manufacturers benefit from cheaper energy, lower financing costs, large-scale manufacturing, integrated supply chains, and stronger logistics infrastructure.
“When tariff equality is combined with lower production costs and fewer compliance obligations, the competitive gap widens substantially against Pakistan,” Faisal Arshad added.
