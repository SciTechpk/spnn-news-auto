Noor, aged 27 years, was found murdered at Zahir’s Islamabad residence in July 2021, with the probe revealing she was tortured by him before being beheaded. Zahir’s death sentence by the trial court had already been upheld by the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
The 47-page review petition, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, was filed by Advocate Khawaja Haris on behalf of Zahir under Article 188 of the Constitution (review of judgments or orders by SC). The state and Noor’s father, Shaukat Ali Muqadam, were made the respondents.
The petition contended that the “plea of unsoundness of mind and mental
incapacity was also given short shrift by the learned trial court”.
 
 

It further said that “hype created on social media […] constantly created hatred towards the petitioner throughout the investigation and the trial (and even at appeal stage)”, which breached Zahir’s right to fair trial and due process.
“In [the] process of hurry, mistakes were made in the investigation and during trial,” the petition quoted a verdict from another case.
Zahir is also contemplating filing a mercy petition before President Asif Ali Zardari, with a letter by jail authorities seeking the formation of a medical board so its opinion could be included in the plea. A presidential pardon under Article 45 of the Constitution could provide Zahir pardon or reprieve, or remit, suspend or commute his sentence.
The SC had commuted Zahir’s death sentence on the rape charge to life imprisonment and reduced his sentence for kidnapping from ten years to one year — notably not acquitting him of either of the offences.
On the rape charges, the review plea argued that it was “apparent from the record that there is no evidence on the record in proof of this allegation”.

Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi as the head of the ACC was expected to leave for Dhaka on Tuesday night to head the said meeting.
The ACC meeting is considered important, particularly in the backdrop of the the Asia Cup, scheduled to be held in India in the month of September.
According to reports, no official of the BCCI will visit Bangladesh to attend the ACC meeting. There are also media reports that Sri Lanka, Oman and Afghanistan may also not attend.
Though the Asia Cup is an impo­rtant continental event, due to strained political relations between India and Pakis­tan, particularly after the military encounter between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May this year, the fate of the said competition is hanging in the balance.
On its part, the BCCI has said that the political relations between India and Bangladesh are not normal. Therefore, the ACC meeting should be shifted from there to any other venue. But the ACC did not change the venue.
Whether Pakistan visit India for the Asia Cup or a hybrid model will be followed — which was adopted for the ICC events — is yet to be decided.
Under the hybrid model, both India and Pakistan agreed to play their respective matches of ICC events — like the World Cups and the Champions Trophy — on neutral venues.

• Sindh Chamber of Agriculture vows to move court or go for some other crops
HYDERABAD: Sindh Chamber of Agriculture (SCA) has announced that it will challenge the 45pc agricultural income tax in court. It described the tax as ‘unconstitutional, illegal and unethical’, and asked its members and farmers across Sindh to boycott wheat cultivation this year.
The decision was taken at meeting of the chamber held here on Tuesday under the chairmanship of its patron-in-chief, Dr Syed Nadeem Qamar.
The meeting rejected the tax and claimed that it was imposed under directives of the Inter­national Monetary Fund (IMF).
The farmers who attended the meeting argued that they were not receiving fair prices for their produce and, as such, there was no justification for the imposition of such a tax.
The meeting asked farmers across Sindh not to pay the tax, and warned that if government resorted to arrest them for on this disobedience, millions of other farmers would also court arrest. “We are ready to face imprisonment, but will not pay the agricultural income tax,” farmers’ leaders at the meeting declared.
The participants announced a complete boycott of agricultural income tax and asked the government for the exemptions similar to those given to industrialists.
The SCA told farmers to boycott wheat cultivation for the 2025-26 season on the ground that they were not getting adequate support prices.
The farmers vowed to go for growing alternative crops, such as mustard, nigella (kalonji), sunflower and other oilseeds instead. They said that due to very low wheat prices, they could not even recover the cost of production, and this year will be marked as a ‘boycott year’ for wheat cultivation.
Decline in cotton production
The chamber expressed its deep concern over 40pc decline in cotton production, estimating that the yield would not exceed four million bales. It said farmers were receiving only Rs6,500 per maund for cotton although the Sindh agriculture minister had promised Rs11,000 per ma­und which did not materialise.
SCA demanded withdrawal of the 18pc local tax on cotton and imposition of a 25pc tax on imported cotton to discourage imports this promoting local production. It expressed its concern over rising cost of agricultural inputs, citing a Rs22 per liter increase in diesel prices and Rs600 per bag increase in DAP fertiliser over the last 15 days.
It said that skyrocketing prices of essential agricultural inputs were crippling farmers, especially since they were not receiving fair prices for their produce. These developments, it warned, indicated a deliberate destruction of agricultural sector. It demanded immediate rollback of increased prices of diesel, fertilisers, seeds, pesticides and other agricultural inputs.
The chamber urged farmers to contact their respective mukhtiarkars (administrative officers) and related officials to get themselves registered for the Benazir Hari Card. It demanded that the subsidy of Rs10,000 per acre, currently available to sunflower and canola crops, be extended to mustard and rapeseed crops as well.
The meeting was attended by Sindh Irrigation and Drainage Authority Chairman Kabool Khatian, general secretary Zahid Bhurgari, Nabi Bux Sathio, Shahnawaz Khan Jamali, Asghar Khan Noonari, Murad Ali Khan Nizamani, Sikander Ali Sariwal, Bilal Khan Laghari, Abdul Karim Talpur and others.

JOURNALIST Omar Al-Qattaa poses for a picture in the Gaza Strip.—AFP

GAZA CITY/PARIS: Journalists belonging to this news agency in the Gaza Strip said on Tuesday that chronic food shortages are affecting their ability to cover Israel’s aggression in the besieged territory.
Palestinian text, photo and video journalists working for the international news agency said desperate hunger and lack of clean water is making them ill and exhausted.
Some have even had to cut back on their coverage of the conflict, now in its 22nd month, with one journalist saying  “we have no energy left due to hunger”. The United Nations in June condemned what it claimed was Israel’s  “weaponisation of food” in Gaza and called it a war crime, as aid agencies urge action and warnings about malnutrition multiply.
Israel says humanitarian aid is being allowed into Gaza and accuses Hamas of exploiting civilian suffering, including by stealing food handouts to sell at inflated prices or shooting at those awaiting aid.

France’s top diplomat calls for foreign press access to the besieged territory

Witnesses and Gaza’s civil defence agency, however, have repeatedly accused Israeli forces of firing on aid seekers, with the UN saying the military had killed more than 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food since late May.
‘We have no energy’
Bashar Taleb, 35, is one of four photographers of this news agency in Gaza who were shortlisted for the prestigious Pulitzer Prize earlier this year. He lives in the bombed-out ruins of his home in Jabalia al-Nazla, in northern Gaza.
“I’ve had to stop working multiple times just to search for food for my family and loved ones,” he said.  “I feel for the first time utterly defeated emotionally. “I’ve tried so much, knocked on many doors to save my family from starvation, constant displacement and persistent fear but so far to no avail.” Another Pulitzer nominee, Omar al-Qattaa, 35, is staying in the remains of his wife’s family’s home after his own apartment was destroyed.
“I’m exhausted from carrying heavy cameras on my shoulders and walking long distances,” he said.  “We can’t even reach coverage sites because we have no energy left due to hunger and lack of food.” Qattaa relies on painkillers for a back complaint, but said basic medicines were not available in pharmacies, and the lack of vitamins and nutritious food have added to his difficulties.
The constant headaches and dizziness he has suffered due to lack of food and water have also afflicted contributor Khadr Al-Zanoun, 45, in Gaza City, who said he has even collapsed because of it.
“Since the war began, I’ve lost about 30 kilos and become skeletal compared to how I looked before the war,” he said. “I used to finish news reports and stories quickly. Now I barely manage to complete one report per day due to extreme physical and mental fatigue and near-delirium.” Worse, though, was the effect on his family, he said. “They’re barely hanging on,” he added.
‘Hunger has shaken my resolve’
Eyad Baba, another photojournalist, was displaced from his home in Rafah, in the south, to a tent in Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, where the Israeli military this week began ground operations for the first time. But he could not bear life in the sprawling camp, so he instead rented an apartment at an inflated price to try to at least provide his family some comfort.
Baba, 47, has worked non-stop for 14 months, away from his family and friends, documenting the bloody aftermath of bullets and bombs, and the grief that comes with it. Hardest to deal with, though, is the lack of food, he said.
“I can no longer bear the hunger. Hunger has reached my children and has shaken my resolve,” he added. “We’ve psychologically endured every kind of death during our press coverage. Fear and the sense of looming death accompany us wherever we work or live.” Working as a journalist in Gaza is to work  “under the barrel of a gun”, he explained, but added:  “The pain of hunger is sharper than the fear of bombing. “Hunger robs you of focus, of the ability to think amid the horrors of war.”
‘Living the catastrophe’
Text journalist Ahlam Afana, 30, said an exhausting  “cash crisis” — from exorbitant bank charges and sky-high prices for what food is available — was adding to the issue.
Cash withdrawals carry fees of up to 45 percent, said Zanoun, with high prices for fuel — where it is available — making getting around by car impossible, even if the streets were not blocked by rubble.
“Prices are outrageous,” said Afana.  “A kilo of flour sells for 100-150 shekels ($30-45), beyond our ability to buy even one kilo a day. “Rice is 100 shekels, sugar is over 300 shekels, pasta is 80 shekels, a litre of oil is 85-100 shekels, tomatoes 70-100 shekels. Even seasonal fruits now — grapes, figs — cost 100 shekels per kilo.
“We can’t afford them. I don’t even remember how they taste.” Afana said she keeps working from a worn-out tent in intense heat that can reach more than 30C, but going days without food and only some water makes it a struggle.
 
 

“I move slowly, unlike before,” she said.  “The danger isn’t just the bombing. Hunger is slowly killing our bodies and threatening our ability to carry on. “Now, I’m not just reporting the news. I’m living the catastrophe and documenting it at the same time.”
‘I prefer death over this life’
Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said on July 8 that more than 200 journalists had been killed in Gaza since Oct 7, 2023. Video journalist Yousef Hassouna, 47, said the loss of colleagues, friends and family had tested him as a human being  “in every possible way”. But despite  “a heavy emptiness”, he said he carries on.  “Every frame I capture might be the last trace of a life buried beneath the earth,” he added.
“In this war, life as we know it has become impossible.” Zuheir Abu Atileh, 60, worked at AFP’s Gaza office, and shared the experience of his journalist colleagues, calling the situation  “catastrophic”. “I prefer death over this life,” he said.  “We have no strength left; we’re exhausted and collapsing. Enough is enough.”
Calls for press access
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on Tuesday called on Israel to allow foreign press into the besieged Palestinian territory of Gaza, as warnings of famine mount after 21 months of war.
He spoke after this news agency warned that the lives of Palestinian freelance journalists it was working with in Gaza were in danger and urged Israel to allow them and their families to leave the occupied coastal territory.
“I ask that the free and independent press be allowed to access Gaza to show what is happening there and to bear witness,”  Barrot told France Inter radio in an interview from eastern Ukraine.
Asked if France would help stringers of this news agency leave Gaza, Barrot said France was  “addressing the issue” and hoped to be able to evacuate freelancers working with French journalists  “in the coming weeks”.
On Monday,  an association of journalists, the Societe des  Journalistes (Society of Journalists), sounded the alarm, urging   “immediate intervention” to help reporters working with the agency in  Gaza.
The SDJ cited the example of one such freelancer, a  30-year-old living with his family in Gaza City, who reported on Sunday that his older brother “fell because of hunger”. “We have lost journalists in conflicts, we have had injuries and prisoners in our ranks, but none of us can remember seeing a colleague die of starvation,” it said.
The management responded in a statement posted on X and Instagram which said that it shared the anguish about the  “dire situation” of colleagues in Gaza.
“Since Oct 7, Israel has prohibited access to the Gaza Strip for all international journalists. “In this context, the work of our Palestinian freelancers is crucial to inform the world,” it said.
“But  their lives are in danger, which is why we urge the Israeli authorities  to allow their immediate evacuation along with their families.” This news agency evacuated its eight staff members and their families from Gaza between  January and April 2024.
Barrot called for an  “immediate ceasefire” after Israel on Monday expanded military operations to the central city of Deir el-Balah. “There is no longer any justification for the Israeli army’s military operations in Gaza,” he said.
“This is an offensive that will exacerbate an already catastrophic situation  and cause new forced displacements of populations, which we condemn in  the strongest terms.”

A passing-out ceremony was held here on Tuesday in which Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz handed over the flag to the CNF.
She also met the CNF personnel and inspected vehicles and equipment.
CNF DG Brig Mazhar Iqbal gave briefing about the formation and work of the force to the CM.
Some 866 personnel have been recruited in the first phase in the CNF. It has been made functional in all divisions. In the first phase, CNF stations and regional directorates have been established in each division of Punjab. In the second phase, the scope of CNF will be expanded to the district level.
 






The CM was informed that the CNF officers and personnel were given 12 weeks of professional training at the Anti Narcotics Force (ANF) Academy, Rawalpindi.
Speaking on the occasion, CM Maryam said the future of Punjab was bright with the formation of the CNF. With the establishment of the CNF, she said the menace of drugs would soon be eradicated from Punjab.
“When I assumed the office, I received requests from the parents to protect their children from the menace of drugs. It is highly regrettable that drugs are being transported to every street, neighbourhood, universities and schools,” she said.
She said the CNF had become functional in all  divisions of Punjab. Some 12,000 applications were received for the recruitment in Punjab CNF, out of which 850 soldiers and officers have been selected.
She said: “Just as every disease cannot be cured with a single pill, similarly crime cannot be eradicated with a single force. There was a dire need for the establishment of a specialised department to solve the problems of a large chunk of population. Whenever any problem arises in Punjab, the commissioners and deputy commissioners are called upon to redress the grievance at the earliest, as a result they leave all their other administrative work and focus their attention towards achieving the assigned task.”

Area SHO Sadaruddin Mirani told Dawn that three-year-old Husain Ali had been kidnapped from Sector A-17 and the family had lodged an FIR (731/25) under Section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) of the Pakistan Penal Code against unknown persons around two and a half months ago.
The officer said, on Monday an uncle of the child had gone to offer prayer at a mosque in Sector A-16 of Shah Latif Town where he found his missing nephew begging outside the mosque along with a man. The uncle and area residents caught the man, who was beaten and handed over to police. He was identified as Shaharyar.
During grilling, the held suspect told the police that his in-laws had given him the child. On the information extracted from the suspect, the police also arrested the couple.
According to media reports, the child had been kidnapped when he was returning home from a local shop in Shah Latif Town. The family had been desperately searching everywhere for the missing child.
Area residents told the media that several children had been abducted from their area, and they strongly suspected that an organised kidnapping gang might be behind the disappearances.
They have urged the authorities to carry out a thorough investigation into the missing children.

Exports registered notable growth to Bangladesh, Afghanistan, and Sri Lanka, largely attributed to recent shifts in the regional political landscape. However, trade relations with these countries have remained strained in recent years, primarily due to challenges stemming from restrictive government policies.
Despite the uptick in exports, the overall trade gap with regional partners widened, driven predominantly by increased imports from China, India, and Bangladesh during the months under review.
In FY24, the trade deficit with these countries was $9.506bn, up 49pc from $6.382bn in the preceding year.
Pakistan’s exports to Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka saw a hefty growth in July-June FY25. Still, exports to other countries, especially China, continued to decline during the period, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.
The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — rose 1.49pc to $4.401bn in July-June FY25 from $4.336bn over the same period last year.
Contrary to this, imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.
Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 20.79pc to $16.312bn in FY25 from $13.504bn over the same period last year. In FY24, imports from China totalled $13.506bn, up by 39.78pc from $9.662bn over the previous year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, with partial contributions from India and Bangladesh.
Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 8.6pc to $2.476bn in FY25 from $2.709bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year.
Imports from India increased pc to $220.58m in FY25 from $206.89m over the last year. In FY24, imports from India rose 6.62pc to $206.89m — up from $190.04m in the same period last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $1.43m in FY25. Exports to India totalled $3.669m in FY24 against $0.329m in the same period the previous year.
Exports to Afghanistan increased 38.68pc to $773.89m in FY25 from $558.03m last year. Imports stood at $25.89m against $11.96 in FY24, a growth of 116.47pc. Pakistan’s main exports to Afghanistan include sugar in the current fiscal year. In the past four months, Pakistan has exported more than 700,000 tonnes of sugar, mostly to Afghanistan.
No data is available as most trade with Iran is conducted via informal channels. However, Pakistan has opted for barter trade amid the thriving smuggling of Iranian petroleum products and LPG via a porous border of Balochistan.
Exports to Bangladesh increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m in FY25 from $661.19m. Imports grew 38.47pc to $78.31m in FY from $56.55m over the last year. The increase resulted after the toppling of the Hasina government in Dhaka. Pakistan has started exporting rice to Bangladesh in the current fiscal year.
Exports to Sri Lanka dropped 4.14pc to $376.61m in FY25 from $392.89m over the last year. This decline in exports to Sri Lanka occurred following the recession in economic activity.

“The confidence of Chinese companies in the Pakistani economy is extremely important for our economic future,” Prime Minister Shehbaz said while chairing a meeting on Tuesday regarding security arrangements for Chinese citizens in Pakistan.
The prime minister acknowledged that multiple measures were being taken to enhance the security of Chinese nationals across the country, including in Islamabad.
 






He said that the Safe City projects were an excellent example of this increasing capacity. He added that Safe City projects were being built across the country as per the international standards.

Unveils plan to overhaul police training, align it with military academy standards

“China is our friendly country,” said the prime minister stressing that the protection of Chinese brothers was the top priority of the government. He said the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a highly important joint project between the two countries which had now entered its second phase, where business-to-business cooperation will be prioritized between the two countries.
In light of the development of CPEC, the protection of Chinese nationals in Pakistan had gained even greater importance, he said, while issuing directives that measures be taken on a priority basis at all airports to facilitate their arrival and departure.
 
 

During the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on the progress of special security arrangements for Chinese nationals across the country.
Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi informed the PM about the security arrangements being implemented nationwide. It was said special security arrangements for Chinese nationals had been enforced in light of potential terror threats.
The federal government and all provinces were working in full cooperation on this matter, while safe city projects were under construction across the country, it was highlighted.
Chinese nationals were also being provided with security escort facilities for travel, the PM was told.
The meeting was further informed that all new housing projects would be equipped with cameras that meet Safe City standards.
Training facility inaugurated
Earlier, the PM visited the National Po­­l­ice Academy (NPA) and Islamabad Safe City Capital Command and Control Centre.
Addressing the 52nd Commons Batch of Assistant Superintendents of Police (ASPs), the PM announced plans to undertake a comprehensive overhaul of the institution, aligning it with the standards of the Pakistan Military Academy.
He also inaugurated the ‘Raising the Standard: NPA Tactical Firing Range and Elite Police Training Facility’, a state-of-the-art complex designed to provide han­ds-on tactical training to police officers.
Besides, the PM performed the groundbreaking ceremony of the new ASP Hostel, aimed at providing modern residential facilities for trainee officers.
He outlined a bold vision for the academy’s revival, announcing the launch of a Master’s degree programme for trainees and the establishment of a 25-acre state-of-the-art campus where a training school, with a modern firing range, would be built. “Collaboration with international partners, including China and the United Nations, is planned to upgrade training standards,” he added.
In his address, PM Shehbaz praised law enforcement agencies along with security forces for their commitment to eradicate terrorism from the country. He urged police force to uphold justice and ensure safety and protection of the life and properties of the people.
He praised the leadership of police institutions, including trainers and course commanders, and encouraged enhancement of the Gilgit-Baltistan quota. “We aim to equip our officers not only with weapons but also with modern technology and critical thinking. From hostels to classrooms, the entire structure will be refurbished,” he said.

Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola, who belongs to the PPP, presented the resolution in the house on behalf of the Women Parlia­mentary Caucus and several ministers.
The house, presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Khan Achakzai, condemned the killing and termed the incident a horrifying example of the continued misuse of the concept of honour to justify the killing of innocent people, especially women. “Such acts are not only condemnable and shameful but also an assault on the peace and stability of society as a whole,” the resolution said.
The resolution emphasised that honour killings had no connection to the Baloch cultural values, provincial or national traditions, or any religious and moral principles, calling this practice entirely inhumane.
Speaking on the resolution, the members expressed concern over the recurring nature of such crimes. “No individual or group has the right to act as judge, jury, and executioner,” the resolution declared. “Justice is the sole responsibility of the state,” it said.
The provincial assembly urged the PPP-led Balochistan government to ensure immediate arrest and strict punishment to the perpetrators to discourage such heinous crimes to prevent such incidents in the future.
Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti also suggested forming a committee, comprising treasury and opposition members, to oversee progress in the case.
JUI-F member Shahida Rauf said that no one had the authority to hold tribal courts or take decisions outside the formal legal system. She stressed that legal disputes must be settled in courts, and even tribal feuds should be resolved through jirgas, not through violence.
Provincial minister Raheela Hameed Khan Durrani said the killing of the couple was a tragic event and a stark reminder that such incidents were occurring even in the 21st century. “No one has the right to take a life,” she asserted. Adviser to the Chief Minister Meena Majeed Baloch called for the elimination of outdated customs related to women.
 






JI leader Maulana Hidayatur Rehman also condemned the killings, affirming that while Islam promoted honour and modesty, it did not permit anyone to violate the sanctity of life or household.
Earlier, Balochistan National Party (BNP-Awami) MPA Mir Asad Baloch staged a walkout against a CTD raid at his residence. Speaking on a point of order, he stated that security forces stormed his home on July 9. “If there were any allegations, I should have been summoned,” he said, adding that he was taken to the CTD Centre and released after four hours. “The use of such force only breeds resentment,” he remarked before walking out.
BHC CJ briefed
Meanwhile, police officials informed Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech that no further arrests had been made in the case.
They said the brother of the slain woman had also been on the run. “Efforts are underway to arrest Jalal, who shot his sister after the jirga ordered the killing of the man and woman,” sources said.
Home Additional Chief Secre­tary Hamza Shafqaat, Additional IG Saeed Wazir, and SSP Serious Crime Investigation Abdul Saboor Agha appeared before the chief justice in his chamber and submitted a progress report.

The launch ceremony, held at the CM House, was attended by Federal Minister for Investment Qaiser Shaikh, provincial ministers, secretaries, senior bureaucrats, and members of the business community.
Speaking at the event, Mr Shah termed the initiative a “transformative moment” for Sindh’s economy and governance. “SBOSS is more than a digital solution — it is a foundational reform in the structure of governance,” he said, calling it a major step towards improving the ease of doing business and empowering the private sector.
The platform, developed under the World Bank-supported CLICK Project, currently offers 32 e-licensing services across nine key departments, with plans to expand to over 130 regulatory services from 16 departments. It operates 24/7 and is integrated with national databases including NADRA, SECP, 1LINK, and the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), enabling real-time identity verification and secure digital payments.

SBOSS offers 32 e-licensing services across nine key departments

For the first time in Pakistan, blockchain technology has been incorporated into a business facilitation portal to ensure data integrity, transparency, and protection against forgery.
“Whether you are a large investor or a small business own­er operating from home, SBOSS guarantees fair, predictable, and convenient access,” the chief minister said, inviting entrepreneurs to utilise the service.
He acknowledged the perception challenges facing the Sindh government but said the administration remained committed to modernising governance. “We must work at the pace of the world or risk falling behind. Sindh will lead in industrial development,” he said.
Mr Shah noted that Pakistan had improved its position on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index from 147th to 108th over the last three years. “To bring prosperity to the country, we must prioritise industrial growth,” he said.
He added that all licensing processes would now move online, allowing applicants to receive approvals digitally. The next phase of SBOSS will include the digitisation of all regulatory and licensing services, the establishment of Business Facilitation Centres across Sindh, and the launch of a 24/7 Digital Contact Centre.
“This launch is only the beginning. We are building a future defined by innovation, efficiency, and shared economic prosperity,” Mr Shah said, thanking the World Bank for its strategic support and lauding the Sindh Investment Department and partner agencies for delivering the reform.
Speaking at the event, Federal Minister Qaiser Shaikh termed SBOSS a “significant step” in facilitating business operations and said the federal government was committed to simplifying licensing procedures to improve the investment environment.
He appreciated the Sindh government’s efforts to promote business, noting improvements in the national currency and foreign exchange reserves. “Economic indicators are showing positive signs of growth. The first SBOSS license issued today marks a new beginning,” he said.
Special Assistant to CM Qasim Naveed and Secretary Inves­tment Raja Khurram Shahzad also spoke on the occasion.
The SBOSS platform is now live and accessible to users across Sindh.

The report simply reflects how the affairs of the government in the country’s biggest and most powerful province have virtually become a family enterprise.
There is nothing new about the dynastic stranglehold on Pakistani politics. But the kind of family rule that prevails in Punjab tells the story of an increasingly regressive power structure. Apparently, not only are decisions on important policy matters taken during family meetings, there is also a government-sponsored move to build a personality cult around former prime minister and head of the Sharif family Nawaz Sharif and his daughter Maryam Nawaz, Punjab’s chief minister.
It seems that most major government development projects in the province are named after either of the two. There has also been a move to rename some of the old government-run projects after the chief minister. Meanwhile, the provincial government has been running massive ad campaigns praising its own performance in various spheres, with life-sized pictures of the chief minister. Many also carry the image of her father.
This publicity drive is apparently being carried out at government expense. Recently, posters referring to the chief minister as ‘Madr-i-Millat’ (mother of the nation) appeared in the province. This campaign may not be sponsored by the provincial government but has certainly been orchestrated by the ruling party. Even with dynastic politics being the name of the game in Pakistan, rarely has the country witnessed this scale of personal glorification. Such campaigns are only seen in authoritarian regimes which lack legitimacy. But these publicity measures are short-lived and cannot serve the objective. Legitimacy and popularity cannot be won on the back of state-sponsored publicity drives. This kind of personalised publicity drive, paid for by the people’s tax money, is beyond narcissism and has clear political aims. In fact, placing personal photographs in government-sponsored ads and naming projects that use state funds after a sitting government head is seen as illegal in many countries.

The Sharifs’ personalised publicity seen in Punjab has clear political aims.

Even in Pakistan, a Supreme Court ruling in 2022, quoted by Naeem Sadiq on these pages, declared: “Paid servants of the state, constitutional office holders and politicians in government must not use their positions for personal, partisan or pecuniary gain”. It further noted: “Pakistan is not a kingdom, principality or fiefdom in which the people are to be beholden to their rulers.”
It seems that the country has actually been turned into a fiefdom where there is no respect for rules or moral values. Self-glorification of the ruling family, which returned to power with a questionable mandate, makes a mockery of the democratic process. Power is concentrated in the hands of the prime minister and the chief minister of the biggest province — both belong to the Sharif family.
Could this have happened without the establishment’s support? This self-glorification campaign is not limited to civilians and extends to the military leadership. It seems that the entire image-building effort for the civilian and military leadership is part of a concerted plan to strengthen the existing hybrid power structure. Behind the civilian façade, the spectre of those wielding the real power looms large. The Sharif family appears content to play second fiddle. After all, the family owed its return to power to the backing of the powers that be.
More than anyone, the Sharif family should know the slippery slope of power politics. They have been on it many times in the past and were swept away by the fast-shifting sands of Pakistani politics. Yet the lure of power is so strong that they tend to forget their own example. They have readily become an instrument in the move to undermine democracy. Their own return to po­­wer is the result of a manipulated electoral process, which also explains the fragility of a fabricated power structure lacking popular mandate.
It was a remarkable turn of events that allowed the once-disgraced family to return to the corridors of power. Three-time prime minister Nawaz Sharif was unceremoniously removed by the Supreme Court in 2017 and barred for life from holding public office through a controversial verdict the following year. He, along with his daughter and other members of the family, were convicted on multiple graft charges.
After being ousted from power, he and his party tried to mobilise public support on the back of the slogan ‘give respect to the vote’. But all the pro-democracy and anti-establishment rhetoric was set aside once a deal was struck. In less than four years after his exit, the PML-N was back in power, with Nawaz Sharif’s younger brother becoming prime minister in the new set-up formed after the removal of Imran Khan through a vote of no-confidence in parliament made possible by behind-the-scenes elements.
But the elder Sharif waited for the announcement of the elections before returning to the country. In no time, his convictions were overturned by the courts and his disqualification was lifted. He was sure of his party sweeping the polls, so it must have come as a rude shock when the counting started. He lost in Mansehra and his victory in Lahore was questionable. His dream of becoming prime minister was dashed. But the establishment’s backing for his party was assured no matter what the real results were.
Most Sharif family members who were earlier convicted and suffered prison are now part of the power structure, although Nawaz Sharif has opted to stay in the background and lead the party. He seems happy with his daughter becoming the first woman chief minister of Punjab and with himself being glorified as a great leader and helmsman. The great champion of democracy does not seem to have any problem now when the sanctity of the vote is being crushed.

A delegation of top businessmen, led by Gohar Ijaz and including Atif Ikram Sheikh, President of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI), met with the army chief at the General Headquarters (GHQ) on Monday.
According to a statement issued by the FPCCI, the delegation presented a detailed overview of the challenges facing the industrial sector, particularly concerns over the recently expanded powers of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). Special emphasis was placed on the controversial provisions under Sections 37A and 37B of the Sales Tax Act 1990, which allow for arrest and detention.
 
 

The FPCCI president said the business community was grateful to the army chief for directing that the enforcement of these provisions be held in abeyance. He also underscored the need for a meaningful dialogue between the FBR and business stakeholders to resolve ongoing disputes and rebuild trust.
The statement noted that GHQ, through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), would continue to support economic activities and foster an environment of collaboration. The delegation praised the government and SIFC for their efforts, which have brought a measure of stability to the economy.

Business leaders meet army chief, seek relief on taxes, energy, interest rates

The FPCCI chief also urged for a reduction in interest rates in line with inflation to support business growth. He highlighted delays in notifying amendments to the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS), particularly the exclusion of cotton, yarn, and greige fabric from the scheme, and the imposition of an 18pc sales tax on their imports.
He further drew attention to high electricity prices, which continue to weigh heavily on manufacturers and exporters. The FPCCI acknowledged the field marshal’s ongoing efforts to secure more competitive power tariffs, especially for industrial and export sectors.
The delegation assured the army chief of the business community’s unified commitment to reviving the economy. “Under Field Marshal Asim Munir’s guidance, we are confident Pakistan can unlock its full potential, restore investor confidence, and achieve inclusive economic growth,” the statement said.
Khalid Hasnain adds from Lahore: Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) President termed the meeting impressive, as the army chief assured the delegation that there would be no issues for the business community.
Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi managed the meeting, which lasted for almost four hours after starting around 8pm on Monday night, the LCCI president maintained.

The prospect on all three counts today is extremely bleak, since there is no apparent interest among the ruling elites of either country in dialogue for the resolution of the core issues. As the smaller country, Pakistan should have more interest in reducing tensions. However, in the aftermath of the four-day conflict, there is even less interest in dialogue in both countries.
There is also little demand from opposition parties and public opinion in either country for dialogue. The question of immediate interest in both countries is whether a second round of hostilities is likely, and, if so, what outcomes may be anticipated. This is a horrendous state of affairs considering both countries are nuclear weapons powers that may or may not have the necessary control over the so-called escalation ladder, especially in a conflict that in a second round would expand beyond the border regions, and whose outcome may depend on unanticipated technological capabilities and battle strategies.
This alone should justify exploring all possibilities for productive dialogue. However, even among seasoned diplomats, the effort to rise above zero-sum exchanges is largely absent. This is because we have so completely internalised mutually exclusive and hostile narratives that the costs of continuing with the present unavailing situation seem far less than the political risks of seeking diplomatic breakthroughs.

This is a losing situation for both countries and for South Asia.

In a recent interview of a former Pakistani foreign minister by a prominent Indian journalist, the questions asked more or less exclusively reflected India’s narrative, and the answers given more or less exclusively reflected Pakistan’s narrative. Audiences in both countries were apparently satisfied, although no serious attempt was made to explore possibilities for productive dialogue.
So where can the two countries go from here? I have attempted to address this in language that might elicit a measure of support from both sides. This is a losing situation for both countries and for South Asia. The region faces enormous challenges, including avoiding the spectre of nuclear conflict; mitigating and overcoming the fatal consequences of irreversible climate change; the whole range of good governance, development, and human rights issues; transforming South Asia into a hub of global economic activity, etc. Accordingly, the whole region has a critical stake in the transformation of India-Pakistan relations and the revival of Saarc from its moribund state.
All of this is possible but perceptions and possibilities will need to change. India sees Pakistan as a ‘structurally’ failing state with which any longer-term engagement is more or less irrelevant. Pakistan sees India acting as a regional hegemon instead of a first among equals, and being frustrated by the strategic entry of China into South Asia as an effective counterforce to India, which China sees as a US proxy. Within this unpromising scenario, India and Pakistan, not without justification, see each other engaged in a range of mutually destabilising activities.
Accordingly, the challenge is to get political leaders, policymakers, policy advisers, the political intelligentsia, academics, journalists, teachers, ‘culture vultures’ including artists, poets and humorists, etc, to create a national realisation of our shared survival stake and, accordingly, the need to situate policies towards each other in that context on a priority basis. What are the chances of this happening? Close to zero at present because of the anti-people nature of their respective politics and their governing institutions. Unless, of course, the political intelligentsia of the two countries are intelligent and motivated enough to meet their national responsibilities and do something more than articulate admirable expressions of hope and goodwill.
There is a whole list of implemented, unimplemented, terminated and contemplated confidence-building measures that can be considered to initiate a process of normalisation. For such a process to be sustainable, however, it will be essential for both countries to take measures aimed at building a minimum of mutual trust to fuel the process of accommodation, compromise, and eventually, significant normalisation.
An exchange of visits by the prime ministers of India and Pakistan should be considered with the purpose of building mutual trust, addressing each other’s concerns despite disagreements, and delineating measures to build a path towards realising the vast potential for mutually beneficial cooperation over a range of fields. All this could help develop influential trans-border constituencies for a sustainable normalisation process. Bureaucrats, diplomats and others can critically assist such a process, but they cannot or will not bring about real change on their own.
The Indians with justification see Pakistan’s military as institutionally unwilling to allow a lasting breakthrough in India-Pakistan relations, as the prevailing hostility facilitates its control of Pakistan’s politics. With equal justification, Pakistanis see the BJP and Modi’s electoral winning strategy of Hindutva, hostility to Pakistan, repression and refusal to negotiate on Kashmir, and threats to divert the Indus waters as equally insuperable obstacles to normalisation.
There are people of goodwill from all walks of life in India and Pakistan who wish to see the mutually debilitating hostility between India and Pakistan a thing of the past. But while many of them are highly respected, they do not add up to a political force that can bring about change. What is required are political movements, not to bring about improved India-Pakistan relations as such, but for democratic, people-based governance and equitable development in both countries. This would help rationalise their national policies and eliminate blind spots in the India-Pakistan relationship which serve the interests of exploitative and obstructive elites in both countries.
Finally, an India-Pakistan normalisation process should in no way hinder the further deepening of Pakistan’s relations with China, which does not see itself as an enemy or rival of India as long as the latter does not ally itself with the US against China. Involving the US or the Gulf countries in India-Pakistan relations would be thoroughly counterproductive.

• 156 lawmakers remained absent without submitting leave applications
ISLAMABAD: Only 78 members of the National Assembly (MNAs) attended every sitting during the budget session last month, while 10 did not attend a single sitting, according to a new report released on Tuesday.
The budget session, which lasted 13 sittings from June 5 to 27, was frequently marred by poor attendance of MNAs, particularly from the treasury side, forcing lawmakers to point out the absence of government ministers.
The protest prompted the speaker to direct government members holding finance-related portfolios to attend the sessions.
Yet the finance minister, who is a senator, attended nine, or 69 per cent of sittings, according to a report released by the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen).
The minister of state and parliamentary secretary for finance and revenue, both MNAs, were present in 11 or 85pc of sittings.
Notably, the economic affairs minister, also a senator, did not attend any sitting during the session, despite his portfolio being closely related to issues discussed during the budget session.
According to the report, 83pc of members in the 336-seat house were present on June 10 when the Finance Bill, 2025 was introduced.
However, as the discussion progressed into general topics, attendance declined, reaching its lowest point — 57pc — on the third sitting.
The attendance resurged again at 79pc on the final day of the discussion, which also included deliberations on Senate recommendations and charged expenditures.
A marked increase was observed towards the end of the session, with attendance rising above 9pc  during voting on demands for grants and the Finance Bill.
The highest attendance was 93pc, recorded on the day the Finance Bill was passed.
An analysis of the attendance and leave applications read during the proceedings showed 235 members, or 75pc of the current strength, missed at least one sitting during the budget session.
However, only 79 members submitted leave applications for their absence. Of them, 13 applied for leave in advance, while 46 submitted the application while on leave or after returning.
The leave applications of the remaining 20 lawmakers were read on a day falling in the middle of their period of absence.
As many as 46 members sought approval for the entire duration of their absence, while the remaining 36 were absent for longer than the number of days for which they had requested leave.
As many as 156 members remained absent without submitting any application during the session.
A total of 22 female MNAs, including 19 on reserved seats and three on general seats attended all sittings.
Meanwhile, all seven minority members attended more than half of the sittings, including three who attended all sittings.
Among male MNAs elected on general seats, 10 did not attend any sitting, 35 were present in less than half of the sittings and 208 attended more than half of the sittings. Meanwhile, 54 were present in every sitting.
Among the cabinet members, the federal ministers for parliamentary affairs and public affairs unit attended all sittings.
Likewise, the ministers of state for overseas Pakistanis and human resource development, national food security & research, and religious affairs & interfaith harmony were present throughout the session.
The majority of lawmakers from PML-N, PPP, MQM-P and Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) attended more than half of the sittings.
The sole member of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Pakistan attended every sitting.
Lawmakers from the Balochistan Awami Party, National Party and the PML-Zia attended more than half of the sittings.
The sole representative of the PkMAP attended less than half of the sittings.

• WHO accuses IDF of storming its facilities
• EU foreign policy chief asks Israeli counterpart to stop killings at aid points
GENEVA: The United Nations (UN) on Tuesday said Israeli forces have killed over 1,000 Palestinians trying to get food aid in Gaza since the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) started operations.
An officially private effort, the GHF began operations on May 26 after Israel halted supplies into the Gaza Strip for more than two months, sparking famine warnings.
GHF operations have been marred by chaotic scenes and near-daily reports of Israeli forces firing on people waiting to collect rations in the Palestinian territory, where the Israeli military is seeking to destroy Hamas.
“Over 1,000 Palestinians have now been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food in Gaza since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation started operating,” UN human rights office spokesman Thameen Al-Kheetan told AFP.
“As of July 21, we have recorded 1,054 people killed in Gaza while trying to get food; 766 of them were killed in the vicinity of GHF sites and 288 near UN and other humanitarian organisations’ aid convoys.” Kheetan added: “Our data is based on information from multiple reliable sources on the ground, including medical teams, humanitarian and human rights organisations.”
Malnutrition claims lives
Meanwhile, the head of Gaza’s largest hospital on Tuesday said 21 children have died due to malnutrition and starvation in the Palestinian territory in the past three days, while Israel pressed a devastating assault.
Gaza’s population of more than two million people is facing severe shortages of food and other essentials, with residents frequently killed as they try to collect humanitarian aid at a handful of distribution points.
“Twenty-one children have died due to malnutrition and starvation in various areas across the Gaza Strip,” Mohammed Abu Salmiya, the director of Al-Shifa Medical Complex in Gaza, told reporters.
Abu Salmiya told reporters that new cases of malnutrition and starvation were arriving at Gaza’s remaining functioning hospitals “every moment”.
“We are heading towards alarming numbers of deaths due to the starvation inflicted on the people of Gaza,” he added.
‘Horror show’
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called Gaza a “horror show” in a speech on Tuesday, with “a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times”.
Chaotic scenes have become frequent at aid distribution areas since the US- and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began overseeing aid operations.
Latest attacks
Earlier on Tuesday, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israeli forces killed at least 81 Palestinians, including 31 aid seekers, in attacks across Gaza since dawn, a day after tanks pushed into southern and eastern parts of Deir el-Balah for the first time, according to an Al-Jazeera report.
Also, the World Health Orga­nisation said Israel attacked its facilities amid its expanding ground operations. Agency spokesman Mahmud Bassal told AFP that Israeli strikes on the Al-Shati camp west of Gaza City had killed at least 13 people and wounded more than 50.
He said two people were killed in Deir el-Balah.
The UN agency’s chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus accused troops of entering its staff residence, and forcing women and children to evacuate, as they handcuffed, stripped and interrogated male staff at gunpoint.
‘Morally unacceptable’
Reports of the latest death toll came as the Roman Catholic church’s most senior cleric in the Holy Land said the humanitarian situation in Gaza was “morally unacceptable”.
“We have seen men holding out in the sun for hours in the hope of a simple meal,” Latin Patriarch Pierbattista Pizzaballa told a news conference in Jerusalem after visiting Gaza.
Civilian killings ‘must stop’
In the meantime, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told her Israeli counterpart Tuesday that Israel’s military “must stop” killing civilians at aid distribution points in Gaza.
Kallas wrote on X that “the killing of civilians seeking aid in Gaza is indefensible”.
“I spoke again with Gideon Saar to recall our understanding on aid flow and made clear that IDF must stop killing people at distribution points,” she wrote.

In Lahore, ATC Judge Arshad Javed announced the decision in Kot Lakhpat Jail around 9:30pm in the presence of the incarcerated PTI leaders, who were implicated in the Sherpao Bridge case.
The court awarded 10-year rigorous imprisonment to Dr Yasmin Rashid, Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, former governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema, and former provincial minister Mian Mehmoodur Rashid. Besides four senior leaders of the PTI, the judge sentenced as many accused to 10-year rigorous imprisonment, including Afzaal Azeem Pahat, Ali Hassan, Khalid Qayum and Riaz Hussain.
The court, however, acquitted PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi. This is the first verdict in any of the cases related to the May 9 riots in Lahore. The judge acquitted six accused, including Mr Qureshi, who, as per his defence, was in Karachi on the day of the alleged occurrence. PTI activists Hamza Azeem, Aitzaz Rafiq, Rana Tanvir, Iftikhar Ahmad, and Zayas Khan were also acquitted.
In this case, as many as 14 accused were indicted during the trial conducted in the jail for security reasons. The prosecution had submitted the challan (charge-sheet) on Sept 28, 2023.
In its final arguments, the prosecution had argued that the ‘May 9 conspiracy’ was hatched on May 7 at Zaman Park, the residence of Imran Khan.
 
 

Advocate Burhan Moazzam
Malik, the lead defence counsel, argued that the FIR mentioned 400 accused persons, but only 14 were being put on trial. The lawyer also pointed out that no medical certificate existed to prove that any person was injured on May 9. He said the prosecution failed to establish the presence of the PTI leaders at the place of alleged occurrence.
About Mr Qureshi, he said the former foreign minister was in Karachi on May 9, 2023. The Sarwar Road police registered the FIR, claiming that the accused delivered provocative speeches and incited rioting, attacks and public disorder at Sherpao Bridge during the widespread violent protests of May 9.
Sargodha ATC
Meanwhile, the Sargodha ATC awarded ten-year rigorous imprisonment each to dozens of PTI leaders, including Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Ahmed Khan Bhachar, in another May 9 riots case registered at the Musakhel police station.
ATC Judge Naeem Sheikh convicted as many as 32 accused, including sitting MNA Ahmad Chattha and former MNA Rana Bilal Ijaz. In this case, over 70 accused persons, including National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan, had been declared proclaimed offenders.
Over a dozen accused were granted exemption from personal appearance during the trial proceedings. The prosecution presented testimonies of 50 witnesses to prove charges of attacks, vandalism, and incitement to violence against the accused.
The PTI parliamentarians convicted in May 9 cases would face automatic disqualification under Article63(1)(g) of the Constitution, which bars members convicted of crimes involving moral turpitude or corrupt practices.
‘Unlawful, unjust’
Commenting on the conviction, Mr Ayub said the decision by the Sargodha court was unlawful. In a statement on his X account, he said the same prosecution witnesses were declared untrustworthy by the previous trial judge. He said the PTI leaders had been convicted unjustly. He said the PTI leaders will challenge the conviction before the higher courts.
 






Mr Bhachar also announced he would challenge the ATC verdict in the Lahore High Court. “Once the written verdict is received, I will approach the Lahore High Court,” he added.
Suspended PTI MPAs reinstated
Separately, Punjab Assembly acting Speaker Zaheer Iqbal Channar on Tuesday reinstated 26 opposition PTI members who had been suspended for 15 sittings for disrupting Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s speech on June 27.
During the session, Punjab Finance Minister Mujtaba Shujaur Rehman addressed the house and conveyed Chief Minister Maryam’s desire for the return of the suspended members. “These representatives have been elected by the people and have come to the assembly,” the minister said, adding, “I request the speaker to allow them back into the house so they can represent their constituencies.”
He emphasised the importance of the opposition’s presence, remarking, “The assembly lacks vibrancy without the opposition. The reinstatement of the 26 suspended members will enable them to represent their constituencies effectively. Frankly, I don’t enjoy the proceedings as much without the opposition.”
Earlier, Speaker Malik Muhammad Khan had rejected references against the 26 opposition MPAs seeking their disqualification on Saturday.
Meanwhile, the Punjab Assembly also unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the killing of nine bus passengers from Punjab while they were travelling in Balochistan on July 10.

According to the Indian Express, the fleet is scheduled to be retired in Septe­mber after serving the IAF for six decades. Inducted in 1963, at least four MiG-21 squadrons were number-plated or retired from service between 2017 and 2024, the newspaper said, quoting unnamed sources in the military.
Its sources said the IAF is set to retire the remaining Russian-origin MiG-21 fleet in a ceremonial decom­m­issioning at Chan­digarh airbase on Sept 19.
Two squadrons of MiG-21 Bisons are currently active.
India procured more than 700 MiG-21 aircraft of different variants, such as the Type-77, Type-96, BIS and the Bison, since the aircraft’s induction in the IAF in 1963.
The phasing out of the aging MiG-21 fleet was originally scheduled to be concluded by 2022, but was held up due to a delay in the planned induction of other fighter jets, including the indig­enous Light Combat Aircraft Tejas, which are set to replace the MiG-21 squadrons.
Four squadrons phased out
Between 2017 and 2024, at least four MiG-21 squadrons were phased out. India has a sanctioned fighter squadron strength of 42, but has 31 active squadrons.
The phasing out of the MiG-21 fleet will further bring down the IAF’s active fighter squadrons.
The MiG-21 Bison, which comprises the last two squadrons to be retired, is one of India’s six fighter jets.
The single engine, single-seater multi-role fighter/ground attack aircraft has been a key fighter jet with the IAF. The Bison is the latest upgrade of the MiG-21 jets.
 
 

Over 100 MiG-21s of the IAF have been upgraded to Bison over the last three decades.
The MiG-21 Bison upgrades included avionics and communication systems, electronics, multi-function display cockpits, the Kopyo light-weight multi-mode radar, radio sets, electronic warfare suite, inertial navigation system/GPS, a helmet-mounted display and a better windshield, among others. However, the engine performance and load carrying capacity of the jet could not be enhanced as part of the upgrades, with its airframe being the major limitation, the Express said.
With a maximum speed of 2,230 kilometres per hour, the jet carries one 23mm twin-barrel cannon with four R-60 close combat missiles. Initially developed as an interceptor, the supersonic jet was eventually upgraded to perform as a multi-role combat aircraft, including ground attacks.
Despite its significant role in all wars and conflicts fought by India, the MiG-21 jets had earned a mixed reputation due to several crashes, although it could have happened due to a multitude of reasons.
Some estimates say that India lost over 400 MiG-21 jets, including its variants and trainer versions, since its induction, and the crashes killed over 100 pilots and some civilians.
A MiG-21 fighter jet of the IAF crashed near Rajasthan’s Suratgarh in May 2023 while it was on a routine operational training sortie, killing three civilians. In July 2022, a MiG-21 trainer Type 69 aircraft crashed, killing Wing Commander M. Rana and Flight Lieutenant Adivitiya Bal.

• Orders special audit of IPP payments, sectoral inefficiencies
ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday conducted a detailed review of audit objections related to the Ministry of Energy, with a focus on independent power producers (IPPs), rising electricity costs, incomplete development schemes and excessive load-shedding.
Officials from the Central Power Purch­asing Agency (CPPA-G) briefed the committee on a sharp rise in the installed capacity of IPPs from 9,765MW in 2015 to 25,642MW in 2024.
They revealed that the annual capacity purchase price had surged from Rs141 billion in 2015 to a staggering Rs1.4 trillion by 2024. In contrast, power generation dropped from 90bn kilowatt-hours in 2014 to 58bn in 2015.
Chaired by MNA Junaid Akbar Khan, the committee questioned the rationale behind these increases. PPP’s Naveed Qamar challenged the power division’s justification of rising coal prices.
Mr Akbar expressed disbelief at claims of up to 200 per cent power generation efficiency from sugarcane bagasse, while CPPA-G officials clarified that the actual output had surpassed their benchmark estimate of 45pc.
The committee also raised concerns about inefficiencies at certain power plants. Riaz Fatyana criticised the closure of staff positions at the Balloki-based Bhikki plant, questioning why salaries were still being paid despite a lack of production.
He also questioned the decision to establish the Sahiwal coal-fired power plant in a region without coal deposits, suggesting the Kalabagh hydropower project as a more logical alternative.
 
 

Senator Mohsin Aziz inquired about the actual costs of these power plants, while Junaid Akbar sought to know why surplus electricity was not being directed towards industrial and agricultural sectors.
Another critical issue raised was the electricity billing structure. The committee discussed the financial burden placed on consumers using even slightly more than 200 units of electricity. “Even if usage crosses 200 units once, the consumer ends up paying higher bills for six months,” Mr Akbar said.
Power Secretary Dr Muhammad Fakhre Alam Irfan confirmed that 58pc of consumers fell in this category and acknowledged the dilemma of subsidy requirements if the limit was raised. He added that the government was working on shifting to a direct subsidy model using BISP data, aiming to phase out the existing system by 2027.
MNA Shazia Marri slammed the power division over prolonged power outages in her constituency, reporting 15 to 16 hours of loadshedding. She questioned the lack of transparency and poor sector management.
Dr Irfan attributed the high losses to technical issues and reiterated that policy decisions were subject to IMF conditionalities, requiring prior approval.
 
 

The PAC referred the IPPs-related issues to a subcommittee and directed a special audit.
In another session, the committee took up complaints over incomplete electricity schemes. MNA Sanaullah Khan Mastikhel revealed that Rs310 million was released to the Faisalabad Electric Supply Company (Fesco) in 2021 for a new scheme in his constituency, which remained unfinished.
MNAs Aamir Dogar and Khawaja Shiraz Mehmood highlighted discrepancies in the reported number of schemes in the Multan Electric Power Company, demanding a special audit to uncover the truth.
“This is a ruthless system,” said Khawaja Shiraz, who also accused officials of enabling transformer theft and manipulating the system.
“The power sector alone is enough to ruin the country,” he said.

• Fresh advisory for Glof, flooding, landslides issued for Punjab, GB, KP
• PM calls for liaison between national and provincial authorities for relief efforts
PESHAWAR / ISLAM­ABAD: At least 11 more people were killed due to heavy monsoon rainfall in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) on Tuesday as the national death toll surged to 234 since late June, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA).
Heavy rains triggered flash floods in several districts of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, damaging homes and increasing water levels in rivers and streams, prompting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to instruct NDMA to coordinate with provincial governments and relevant departments for immediate relief to the affected people.
According to the Prov­incial Disaster Management Auth­­ority (PDMA), six deaths, including four children, were reported from Swat, while two deaths were reported from Bajaur and each from Buner and Upper Kohistan.
In Swat, two children were washed away in Sur Dheri nullah, while three children were killed after a roof collapsed in Madyan area. A woman was washed away in a flash flood in Khawazkhela.
Two men in Bajaur’s Loe Mamond areas and a woman in Upper Kohistan were washed away in flash floods. A man also died in Buner.
In GB, flash floods triggered by heavy rainfall continued to devastate communities across the northern region on Tuesday.
Rescue 1122 said a flash flood in Danyor nallah inundated residential communities, destroyed crops, and irrigation channels. The deluge also damaged link roads and suspension bridges, cutting road links to affected areas.
The local administration reported that a high-level flood in Thor Nala of Chilas had inundated Wapda Colony, forcing residents to evacuate the area.
 
 

There are also reports of destruction in Bolan area of Astore district where a woman was killed.
Meanwhile, 250 tourists and passengers stranded at the Babusar Highway have been rescued by the Diamer district administration, volunteers, police, Rescue 1122 and army, according to GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.
According to eyewitnesses and local sources, 10 to 15 people were still missing, and a search operation was underway to find them.
Tourists stranded in Deosai due to the blocking of the Skardu-Deosai road have also been rescued.
 
 

Monsoon death toll
The monsoon rains, battering the country since late June, have resulted in widespread devastation.
According to NDMA, 234 people have lost their lives and 596 injured. Moreover, 826 houses have been damaged while 203 livestock killed since June 26.
Of the 234 deaths, 79 were men, 42 women and 113 children.
The highest number of casualties was reported from Punjab, where 135 people lost their lives. In KP, 56 people were killed; Sindh recorded 24 fatalities; and Balochistan 16.
Two fatalities have been reported from Azad Jammu and Kashmir, while one child has been killed in Islamabad. No loss of life has been reported so far from Gilgit-Baltistan, according to NDMA.
Two fatalities have been reported in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, involving one man and one child. In Islamabad, one child was killed due to heavy rain and flooding.
Glof, flood forecast
In Punjab, houses and standing crops in hundreds of villages have been inundated because of low-to-medium level flooding in various rivers.
The deluge in Ravi, Sutlej, Chenab and Indus rivers forced evacuations and displaced hundreds of people in riverine areas of Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan and Rahim Yar Khan.
Over 20 villages in Jhang district have been inundated due to the rising water levels in the Jhelum River. The Sutlej river has seen low-level flooding at Sulemanki, while there are concerns about the potential releases of water from Indian dams on the Beas and Sutlej rivers.
The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a fresh alert for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
Separately, KP PDMA has also issued a Glof alert for Chitral Upper, Chitral Lower, Dir Upper, Swat and Kohistan Upper.
A PMD advisory issued on Tuesday said the ongoing rainfall spell is likely to continue and can affect KP and GB during the week.
The prevailing weather conditions will increase the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable regions of GB and KP.
The Met Office has advised local authorities to remain alert and take necessary measures to protect human lives and property.
The NDMA has warned of landslides in northern regions in view of the forecast monsoon rains.
 
 

The authority has cautioned PDMAs, rescue services, local administration, armed forces and NGOs to prepare for possible emergency situations.
As per the projection, isolated rainfall is expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Astore, Diamir, Ghanche, Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, Haveli, Bagh, and Poonch areas of GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. A similar weather pattern is expected in Chitral, Dir, Kohistan and adjoining mountainous zones of KP.
The downpour will increase the risk of landslides, mudslides, rockfalls and ground subsidence in Kolai Palas, Lower Kohistan, Upper Kohistan, Tatta Pani, Jaglot, Nagar, Hunza, Rondu, Skardu and Chitral.
Relief operations
NDMA said it conducted 62 rescue operations across the country, rescuing 450 people stranded in flash floods during the monsoon season. The authority has established 27 relief and medical camps to serve the displaced population.
NDMA has also distributed 349 tents, 358 blankets, 500 sandbags, 266 quilts and sleeping bags, 76 mattresses, 554 kitchen sets and 305 mosquito nets.

Shalkot Sub-Divisional Police Officer Athar Rashid told Dawn.com, “The daughter and the nephew died in the firing, while the suspect managed to escape after the incident.”
The bodies were taken to the hospital for medicolegal formalities, after which they were handed over to the heirs.
Rashid added that a team from Kechi Baig police station was conducting raids to arrest the suspect.
“The suspect will be arrested soon, while further investigation into the incident is underway,” he said.
The incident comes two days after the police  arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the killing of a man and a woman in Quetta’s Degari area, who were shot dead on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’.
The arrests were made after a video of the killing went viral on social media, in which a group of people could be seen shooting the couple.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.
The previous two years also saw a consistent rise in murders related to the so-called ‘honour’.
Balochistan Assembly condemns ‘honour killings’
The Balochistan Assembly, during its session today, strongly denounced ‘honour killings’, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
Presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai, the assembly passed a joint resolution denouncing the brutal killing of the man and woman in Degari.
Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola presented the resolution, describing the act as inhumane, unlawful, and devoid of any cultural, religious, or legal justification. She reaffirmed that justice lies solely with the state, not individuals who take the law into their own hands, APP added.
The resolution urged the provincial government to ensure swift action against the culprits of the Degari incident and deliver appropriate punishment.
MPA Shahida Rauf decried the incident as barbaric and criticised unauthorised “Jirgas” for dispensing unlawful judgments, calling for tougher legislation and accountability.
Chief Minister Mir Sarfaraz Bugti proposed forming a parliamentary committee to monitor the investigation and ensure transparency in the dual murder case.
Education Minister Rahila Hameed Durrani emphasised the psychological impact of the incident across society and noted that while it occurred before Eid, it only recently gained public attention after circulating online.
Adviser Meena Majeed Baloch condemned the deep-rooted customs leading to recurring violence against women. She called for the elimination of parallel laws, underscoring the contrast between women’s global achievements and their oppression at home.
Maulana Hidayat-ur-Rehman Baloch addressed the need for both moral upbringing and systemic reform while acknowledging cultural sensitivities around honour. He strongly opposed vigilante justice.
MPA Farah Azeem Shah argued that the incident reflects a societal regression, urging adherence to the Islamic principles of compassion and justice.
She criticised unequal enforcement of law and challenged patriarchal norms surrounding honour.
Minister Haji Noor Muhammad Dummar called for decisive actions to prevent future tragedies, stating no one has the right to claim lives in the name of tradition.
The resolution was adopted unanimously after a thorough and impassioned debate.</p><small>2025-07-22 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615309-dr-yasmin-rashid-among-pti-leaders-sentenced-to-10-year-imprisonment-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid among PTI leaders sentenced to 10-year imprisonment in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

The PTI announced the death in a post on X and extended its condolences to his son and party leader, Hammad Azhar.
 






Communications Minister Abdul Aleem Khan praised him as a person of “noble character” whose “political and national services” would be remembered for a long time.
 






Former Sindh governor and ex-PTI leader Imran Ismail said he was deeply saddened to hear of the death and praised the deceased as a “distinguished political figure”.
 






He was the governor of Punjab from August 11, 1990, till April 10, 1993.
He was also the founding president of the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid and joined the PTI in October 2011.
He was the PTI-backed candidate in the February 2024 general elections for NA-129(Lahore-XIII) and joined the Sunni Ittehad Council later on.
In January 2024, he was also taken into custody in Lahore only to be released after a few hours as police launched a crackdown on PTI-affiliated candidates and supporters who took to the streets on party founder Imran Khan’s call.</p><small>2025-07-22 18:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/615300-minor-student-beaten-to-death-by-madrassa-teachers-in-swat' target='_blank'><strong>Minor student beaten to death by madrassa teachers in Swat</strong></a><br><p>

Ashraf hit an aggressive 32-ball 51 while debutant Daniyal smashed an 11-ball 17 but holed out off the second ball of the final over as Pakistan were all out for 125 in their chase of 134 to win in Dhaka.
Earlier, Jaker Ali struck a 48-ball 55 as Bangladesh — sent in to bat — were bowled out for 133 in 20 overs, with Salman Mirza taking 2-17 and Daniyal close behind on 2-23.
Left-arm Bangladesh pacer Shoriful Islam picked up his best T20I figures of 3-17 on a slow-paced Mirpur pitch as Pakistan lost their first five wickets for just 15 runs by the fifth over.
Ashraf cracked four sixes and as many boundaries to raise hopes of a comeback win, but spinner Rishad Hossain bowled him in the penultimate over.
Ashraf and Abbas Afridi, who scored a 13-ball 19, had revived the innings from 47-7 with a 41-run stand, but Bangladesh had the last laugh.
Bangladesh won the first match at the same venue by seven wickets and took an unassailable 2-0 lead with the final match on Thursday, also in Dhaka.
This was Bangladesh’s first T20I series win over Pakistan in four tries.
Pakistan lost opener Saim Ayub to a run out for one in the first over before Islam dismissed Fakhar Zaman (8) and Mohammad Haris (0) to hit Pakistan hard at the top.
Bangladesh skipper Litton Das praised a team effort.
“It’s wonderful to win back-to-back series,” said Litton, who also led the team to a 2-1 T20I series in Sri Lanka last week. “This shows good improvement in our standards.”
Pakistan captain Salman Agha rued his side’s batting lapses.
“We thought 134 would be gettable but we lost too many wickets early on and that’s something we must address quickly,” said Agha.
Earlier, Jaker smashed five sixes and a boundary for his third T20I half century.
Bangladesh had lost four wickets for 28 by the sixth over before Jaker and Mahedi Hasan revived the innings with a 53-run stand for the fifth wicket.
Mahedi scored a 25-ball 33 with two sixes and as many boundaries.
The final match is on Thursday, also in Dhaka.
Last month, Pakistan had whitewashed Bangladesh in a three-match home T20I series at the Gaddafi Stadium. Das-led Bangladesh came into the series on the back of an away 2-1 T20I series triumph over Sri Lanka.
Pakistan are visiting Bangladesh for the first time since December 2021 as they arrived in the country on Wednesday, after taking part in an extensive training camp in Karachi, the PCB said.

Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar opened the UNSC session as he was presiding over the UNSC Open Debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”.
This is the first of the two signature events of Pakistan in its capacity as president of the UNSC for July.
The UNSC unanimously adopted the Pakistan-sponsored resolution urging all nations to utilise effectively mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, such as negotiation, mediation, arbitration, judicial settlement or other peaceful means.
 






The Foreign Office (FO) said the adoption of the resolution on “Strengthening Mechanisms for Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” was a noteworthy development since it was an “important contribution to the promotion of international peace and security through the use of preventive diplomacy, conflict prevention measures and dispute resolution by peaceful means”.
It added that the resolution sought to strengthen mechanisms for peaceful settlement of disputes, as envisaged in Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter and urged member states to utilise peaceful means for settling disputes.
“The resolution called upon the member states to take necessary measures for the effective implementation of Security Council resolutions for peaceful settlement of disputes.
“Member states and the United Nations have been encouraged to explore ways and means to prevent disputes from escalating, including but not limited to timely diplomatic efforts, mediation, confidence-building and facilitation of dialogue at the international, regional and subregional levels. The resolution calls for enhancing efforts by all regional and subregional organisations for peaceful settlement of disputes and to strengthen cooperation between these organisations and the United Nations.”
The FO said that as an active UNSC member, Pakistan sought to contribute to the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, including through peaceful settlement of disputes.
“The adoption of Pakistan-sponsored resolution would serve as an important instrument to achieve these goals for peace and security at the regional and global level.”
 






Earlier, the FO said the signature event reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering belief in multilateralism and the UN Charter principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.
It said FM Dar would also hold bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of economy and planning, UK minister for Africa, the United Nations, Commonwealth and Multilateral, as well as Thailand’s foreign minister on the sidelines.
He would also give an interview to a foreign media outlet and attend a reception hosted by Pakistan Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad for selected UN ambassadors and senior UN officials.
FM Dar, UN chief call attention towards Gaza
Speaking at the UNSC session, FM Dar said, “We call for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.”
He added that Israel’s latest onslaught in Gaza had killed over 58,000 Palestinians — mostly women and children. “The humanitarian situation is dire, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence and deprivation,” Dar said.
“Today’s debate is both timely and urgent. Multilateralism is not merely a diplomatic convenience; it is the need of the hour. Peaceful settlement of disputes is not just a principle; it is the lifeline of global stability,” Dar continued.
 






On the issue of Kashmir, Dar said that the final disposition of the dispute has to be made in line with the relevant UNSC resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.
“No cosmetic measures can serve as a substitute for the fundamental and inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiris as guaranteed by the relevant UNSC resolutions,” Dar said.
Dar also spoke about India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, saying, “It is most unfortunate and regrettable that India has chosen to illegally and unilaterally hold this treaty in abeyance on baseless grounds, with the intention of withholding the flow of water to 240 million people of Pakistan, who rely on it for their livelihood and survival.”
The Deputy PM said, “Let this debate serve as a collective reaffirmation of our faith in multilateralism, a recommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, and a solemn promise to those who look to this Council not for words, but for action.”
 






UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also addressed the council on this occasion, followed by statements of other member states.
Guterres said that the “horror” facing Palestinians in Gaza under Israeli military attack was unprecedented in recent years.
“We need look no further than the horror show in Gaza — with a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times,” he said in a speech.
Guterres said ramped-up Israeli operations meant “devastation is being layered upon devastation” with the Gaza Strip’s humanitarian system in its “last gasp”.
He commended FM Dar for convening the debate and for utilising the council’s presidency to put forward a resolution urging all members to make full use of the tools in collective pursuit of global peace.
“This is needed now more than ever. The architects of the United Nations Charter recognised that the peaceful resolution of disputes is the lifeline when geopolitical tensions escalate, when unresolved disputes fuel the flames of conflict and when states lose trust in each other,” the UN chief said.
“Around the world, we see an utter disregard for, if not outright violations of, international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, international humanitarian law, and the UN Charter itself, without any accountability.
“These failures to uphold international obligations are coming at a time of widening geopolitical divides and conflicts” with staggering costs measured in human lives, shattered communities, and lost futures, Guterres said.
Diplomacy, he said, may not have always succeeded in preventing conflicts, violence and instability, but it still held the power to stop them.

On May 9, 2023, military installations and state-owned buildings were vandalised as PTI supporters protested the arrest of ex-premier Imran Khan — who was released later but has been imprisoned in various cases since August 2023. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including the party’s top leadership, were arrested.
 
 

Addressing a press conference today in Islamabad, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said: “Today, the Sargodha ATC issued an order and we welcome it … I think it is a very positive step as justice has been upheld.”
He said the verdict “fulfils all requirements of justice” and followed due process since the entire trial proceedings were carried out legally. “The decision announced is in accordance with the law and the Constitution,” Malik said.
The state minister said Bhachar, PTI MNA Ahmed Chattha and former MNA Bilal Ejaz were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment each in a case related to the riots.
“When you take the law into your own hand, whether you’re an MNA or MPA or opposition leader … the [status] doesn’t matter, as the law is equal for everyone and will come into force.”
Malik hoped that other May 9-related cases would be decided soon as well.
Assailing the PTI, he alleged that the riots were “carefully curated” via “planning” to precisely attack over 200 locations.
Meanwhile, Bachar said in a post on X that he would not abandon his support of Imran.
 






PTI MNA Asad Qaiser condemned the sentences, alleging that “neither was any transparent or legal procedure followed in the case, nor was any credible witness presented. The demands of justice were grossly violated.”
He said in a post on X that the party would challenge the “biased decision” in the high court.
 






Terming the decision “outright injustice”, the party’s South Punjab wing said, “The truth is that the establishment’s role in this entire process is evident to all, and nothing called justice remains.
“These punishments are not only vengeful actions but also an insult to the country’s democracy, judiciary, and people, and now the people will no longer stay silent!” the statement read.
 






PTI MNA and lawyer Shafqat Awan also condemned the decision. “I have never seen a more horrific and brutal decision than the one given by the Sargodha ATC judge,” he told reporters.
 






Punjab Assembly PTI MPAs restored
Today’s conviction follows a recent tussle between the PML-N’s Punjab government and the PTI, after PA Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan suspended 26 opposition MPAs and sought their disqualification for their “unparliamentary conduct”.
However, days ago, in a significant step towards de-escalation of political tensions, Ahmad formally rejected the disqualification petitions following negotiations between the government and the opposition.
A notification by the assembly secretariat today said the 26 PTI lawmakers stood restored as MPAs.
The notification, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, said that the earlier order to suspend the provincial assembly members was withdrawn. The order listed the names of the 26 PTI MPAs.</p><small>2025-07-22 13:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/2216565381fb3c0.png?r=175310' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1925829/pmd-issues-glof-alert-for-gb-kp-as-over-200-stranded-tourists-rescued-from-diamer-amid-floods' target='_blank'><strong>PMD issues Glof alert for GB, KP as over 200 stranded tourists rescued from Diamer amid floods</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Tuesday warned of a heightened risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as over 200 stranded tourists were rescued from GB’s Diamer district as heavy floods battered the region.
The devastating impacts of climate cha­nge have become more visible in GB as cloudburst-induced floods wreaked havoc across the region. The flood-related death toll in the region rose to five today, after four lost their lives and 15 went missing yesterday in Diamer’s Babusar area.
In its alert, the PMD warned that the prevailing weather conditions increased the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable glaciated regions of GB and KP.
It forecast that the wet spell was likely to continue and could affect GB and KP in the current week, adding that scattered rain and thunderstorms, with isolated heavy falls, were expected in both regions.
 






The death toll in GB since yesterday currently stands at five, according to Diamer District Commissioner Attaullah Kakar.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said in a statement: “More than 200 rescued tourists have been shifted to Chilas and provided shelter in hotels and guest houses.”
He added that the tourists were now able to contact their families after being stranded for hours.
DC Kakar detailed that rescue operations were still underway to look for missing tourists, while four of the five deceased have been identified. According to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed, 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.
According to DC Kakar, the Force Command Northern Areas (FCNA) of the Pakistan Army has been providing medical assistance and food to stranded tourists on Babusar via helicopters.
“One of the five bodies will be transported via helicopter later today,” he added.
 


Meanwhile, the Diamer administration declared a state of emergency along Thack-Babusar Road, suspending all tourist movement between Zero Point and Babusar Top.
A notification by Diamer District Magistrate Ataur Rehman, seen by Dawn.com, said all travellers “should be stopped at both ends” of the road until further notice.
“All tourists and local residents are strongly advised to evacuate to designated safe zones immediately and to avoid any travel on Babusar Road until its complete rehabilitation,” the notification read.
An emergency control room was also established that will operate “round the clock”. It can be contacted at 05812-920181 and 05812-930037. The district magistrate also ordered six companies to dispatch at least two excavators each to the Babusar area to assist in road rehabilitation and retrieval of bodies, if any.
Muhammad Ali, a local social worker, told Dawn.com: “Thirty vehicles were swept away by the floods, and most people have been rescued by the locals.”
Shahabuddin, a resident of Chilas, said the local people provided food and accommodation to some stranded tourists in Babusar’s Thak area of Babusar and were also assisting the rescue operation.
All doctors and paramedical staff of the Chilas District Headquarters Hospital were called on an emergency basis, according to a notification issued by medical superintendent Dr Abdul Mobin.
 


Outlining the damage caused by the floods in a statement, DC Kakar said that more than 100 houses had been fully damaged in GB in the recent torrential rains.
Faraq told Dawn.com: “In Babusar, a wheat depot, a girls’ school, a police checkpoint, a tourism police shelter and four bridges have been washed away, while two mosques and a windmill have also been damaged.
Efforts underway to re-open Karakoram Highway
The process of removing debris and re-opening the Karakoram Highway (KKH) was underway by the Pakistan Army, Frontier Works Organisation, National Highway Authority and the GB administration, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
“Several points from Thalichi to Chilas have been cleared. Similarly, traffic has been restored at Jaglot-Skardu road,” the report said.
It added that the process of road clearance was underway in Tatta Pani and Jalipur, while heavy machinery had been dispatched to reopen three points at Gandola Nullah.
“Babusar road was still blocked due to heavy mud on the road, but authorities have been instructed to reach the area,” Faraq said earlier today.
The GB government spokesperson shared that construction has begun on the restoration of highways and connecting roads, after the floods damaged a portion of the KKH, stranding tourists.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed authorities to provide every possible assistance and rehabilitation facilities to the flood-affected people across the country, Radio Pakistan reported.
In their separate statements, they directed relevant departments to accelerate relief activities in the affected areas, as well as expressed deep grief and sorrow over the loss of precious lives due to rains.
 






‘Hundreds’ of stranded tourists rescued in Skardu
Skardu Rescue 1122, in its WhatsApp channel, said three people were injured due to the flood in the Sadpara village, while the deluge has also hit the Kharmang district.
Ghulam Muhammad, spokesperson for the Baltistan Division Police Department, said in a statement: “In Deosai, 413 tourist vehicles were stranded on the road connecting Sadpara and Deosai, after it was closed at ten different points due to the floods.”
According to the spokesperson, the stranded people were rescued by the police and shifted to Skardu in the morning after the damaged roads were restored overnight.
 
 

He said, “Heavy rain in Skardu triggered flash floods in Barge Nullah, Dhagyol Nullah and Shagri Bala Nullah on the outskirts of the city.”
“The flood water entered homes and caused severe damage to public infrastructure and crops,” the official added.
NDMA issues landslide alert
According to an NDMA advisory, the following areas in the country’s north may potentially face landsliding: Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Astore, Diamer, Ghanche in GB; Muzaffarabad, Neelum, Haveli, Bagh, Poonch in Azad Jammu and Kashmir; and Chitral, Dir, and Kohistan in KP.
In these areas, the following roads have been identified as prone to landsliding: Kohistan Road, Kolai Palas Road, Jaglot Road, Nagar Road, Hunza Road, Tatta Pani Road, Jaglot Skardu Road.
 






The NDMA advised citizens to avoid travelling to mountainous areas and directed authorities to remain alert in case of an emergency.
On June 26, the GB Disaster Management Authority issued a warning of increased risk of glacial lake outburst floods (Glof) and flash floods. The public and tourists were advised to avoid going near rivers, streams and other waterways, and avoid bathing or washing clothes in streams since the water flow can reach dangerous levels.
In KP, the tourism department established a flood emergency response unit and appointed six focal persons for different areas of the province.
A notification issued by the department’s secretary Abdul Samad today, seen by Dawn.com, said that the unit was in the office of KP Culture and Tourism Authority with the helpline number 1422.
Two swept away in Rawalpindi’s DHA
Separately, rescue efforts were underway after a retired army officer and his daughter went missing after the car they were in was swept away by the rainwater drain in Rawalpindi, according to the police.
Retired Colonel Ishaq Qazi, aged approximately 62–64 years and a resident of Defence Housing Authority Phase 5, “left his home along with his daughter, aged around 25 years, in a grey Honda City vehicle”, said a statement by Islamabad’s Sihala police station.
“Due to heavy rainwater accumulation on a nearby road, their vehicle stalled. While Colonel Ishaq attempted to restart the car, the flow of water intensified, and both individuals were swept away by the rainwater drain,” it added.
A search operation by the police, Rescue 1122, DHA Phase 5 staff and a team of divers was underway, the statement said. A car bumper was recovered later as the search went on.
A video showed a man steering the vehicle in accumulated floodwater, with a person in the back waving their hand out. The car took a short, sharp slide downwards, after which it got swept away in the water, as some people gathered on a nearby bridge.
 


Rain-related death toll rises to 234
Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country.
According to the NDMA’s website, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 234 people across the country and injured 596. Of these, 13 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.
The majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 135 deaths and 470 injuries. KP reported 56 fatalities, Sindh 24, Balochistan 16, two in Azad Kashmir and one death in Islamabad.

Over 61 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by house-collapse incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 826 houses and led to the deaths of 203 livestock.
A spokeswoman for the agency told AFP that the heavy rains usually start later in the monsoon season.
“Such death tolls are usually seen in August, but this year the impact has been markedly different,” she said.
 






PTA directs telecom operators to ensure uninterrupted services
Separately, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) issued an advisory to telecom operators, directing them to ensure uninterrupted services and maintain contingency plans for emergencies amid the ongoing floods.
A press release by the PTA said: “The advisory stresses the protection of telecom infrastructure in high-risk areas, availability of critical resources, immediate reporting of service disruptions, and dissemination of flood-related information to the public.”
“Operators have been advised to ensure the continuity of essential services, deploy trained teams, coordinate with local authorities, and efficiently address consumer complaints in affected regions.”
The PTA also activated its National Emergency Telecommunication Coordination Centre and established contact points at its headquarters and zonal offices for real-time coordination, the statement said.
The authority affirmed it was “closely monitoring the situation and will keep the public updated on service restoration efforts in flood-affected areas”.
