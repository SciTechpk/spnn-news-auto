In their separate message on the 40th anniversary of Saarc Charter Day falling on Monday, they said that Pakistan is committed to a cooperative, inclusive and forward-looking regional order that can unlock South Asia’s vast potential and ensure a better tomorrow for all.
President Zardari said that Pakistan is ready to work with all willing states in South Asia to promote trade, transit, energy linkages and people-to-people relations that benefit the entire region.
“Pakistan remains committed to a cooperative, inclusive and forward-looking regional order. Our geography places us at the meeting point of South Asia, Central Asia and the Middle East. We are ready to work with all willing states to promote trade, transit, energy linkages and people-to-people ties that benefit the entire region,” the President said.

PM Shehbaz says Islamabad firmly committed to principles, objectives of Saarc Charter on 40th anniversary

He said: “On this Charter Day, I encourage South Asian nations to approach the future with clarity and sincerity. The region’s challenges are shared and so must be the solutions. With a spirit of respect and practical cooperation, we can shape a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia for our future generations”.
PM Shehbaz’s message
In his message, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan remained firmly committed to principles and objectives of the Saarc Charter as it believed that genuine cooperation, guided by sovereign equality, mutual respect and constructive engagement, can unlock South Asia’s vast potential and ensure a better tomorrow for all.
He said that in an era of growing regional cooperation, the necessity of economic, digital, and people-to-people connectivity in South Asia could hardly be over emphasised.
“Together, we must work to enhance linkages that facilitate trade, investment, innovation, and cultural exchange in our region,” the prime minister said.
“Our region also faces common challenges such as poverty, climate induced natural disasters, food and energy insecurity and public health issues. These challenges transcend borders and require collective responses based on mutual trust, goodwill, and a spirit of mutual cooperation. It is only by acting together that we can build a resilient and inclusive future for our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said.

According to a report iss­ued by the Meteo­ro­logical Department, the province received only 8.6 mm of rainfall during Sep­tember, October and Nove­mber, significantly lower than the normal 14.8 mm.
Temperatures during this period also remained 0.9°C above the average.
The Met Office’s dro­ught advisory (pre-alert) stated that from May to November, western and southwestern Balo­chistan witnessed a decline in rainfall, along with a rise in the num­ber of consecutive dry days.
Forecasts indicate rainfall in the affected regions below normal till February 2026, while temperatures higher than usual, thus aggr­avating drought conditions in Quetta, Chagai, Gwadar, Kech, Kharan, Mastung, Nushki, Pishin, Panjgur, Qilla Abdullah and Washuk. However, the Met Office also expects partial relief due to a weather system that may bring rainfall to some areas later this month.

KARACHI: Leaders from political spectrum on Sunday rallied behind the country’s armed forces, accusing the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) of driving a coordinated campaign to malign state institutions and sow instability.
However, the party remained defiant, and in a show of strength in Pesha­war, claiming that attempts to discredit them or their leader would only increase their popularity.
A day earlier, the PTI had lashed out at a press briefing by the military’s media wing, calling it “inappropriate and unfortunate” after the spokesperson accused incarcerated Imran Khan of being a “narcissist” and a “mentally ill person” who was edging into “security threat” territory through his persistent anti-army rhetoric.
Taking to X (formerly Twitter), PML-N leader and Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal called Imran’s political rhetoric “a deeply irresponsible and dangerous trend that seeks to undermine Pakistan’s state institutions, weaken national cohesion, and erode public trust in the armed forces who defend our borders with courage and sacrifice.”
“Political differences are part of any democracy — but when politics crosses the line into anti-state narrative building, deliberate misinformation, and attacks on the integrity of Pakistan’s Armed Forces and its leadership, it threatens the stability, security, and uni­ty of the country,” he wrote. Mr Iqbal added that no leader had the right to wea­ponise divisive rhetoric for personal gain at the cost of Pakistan’s national security.







‘Choose state over leader’
Offering PTI what he described as a lesson from his own party’s history, Mu­t­tahida Qaumi Move­ment-Pakistan (MQM-P) convener Dr Khalid Maq­bool Siddiqui on Sunday said that just as his party had once chosen the state over the narrative of its own founder, PTI now faced the same choice.
Addressing a press conference along with senior leaders Mustafa Kamal, Dr Farooq Sattar, Anis Qaim­khani, Aminul Haque and others, he warned that Pakistan stood at one of the most critical crossroads in its history and could no longer afford prolonged political instability.
The political turbulence, he said, continued to haunt the country, while foreign interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs had become increasingly evident.
Dr Siddiqui declared that Pakistan had already “defeated India decisively this year” and would now defeat “its proxies as well”.
“We never claimed that our leader was bigger than Pakistan. We detached ourselves from him for the sake of the state. If PTI believes its leader is greater than the country, then it must make a choice,” said the MQM-P leader.
Federal health minister and senior deputy convener of the party Mustafa Kamal alleged that PTI and its leadership were actively maligning Paki­tan’s military and its commanders internationally.
“These attitudes are shameful,” he said. “Thank them that the army is only holding press conferences to expose your actions. Karachi’s missing persons’ families knocked on every door in search of justice. You are still fortunate that dialogue is ongoing.”
‘Hostile agencies’ agenda’
Balochistan Chief Minister and PPP leader Sarfraz Bugti also assailed Imran Khan for “spreading propaganda against the army and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies”.
Speaking at a press conference in Islamabad, he said that today, the nation needed to stand with its security forces more than ever before, as two provinces were facing a serious insurgency.
“In this situation, the nation has to choose, and the nation has chosen to stand with its forces,” he asserted, adding that there was an urgent need to “abandon the narrative which was weakening the state”.
Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi also assailed Imran Khan during a press conference in Rawalpindi, saying that had his claims about the former premier receiving funding from India and Israel been taken seriously, Pakistan would not be in the state it is now.
“I had said that the PTI was receiving Indian and Israeli money. This was proven. I took the foreign funding case to the Supreme Court,” he added. “Had the decision been made then and had he (Imran Khan) been disqualified, then there would not be anarchy or terrorism.”
Reacting to Mr Abbasi’s presser, PTI, in a statement, said that “it would be difficult for individuals like Abbasi to understand that Imran always stood firm for his country, its institutions, and the people of Pakistan at every forum.”
PTI demands apology
Meanwhile, through a resolution adopted at a large protest rally in Peshawar on Sunday, the PTI demanded an apology for what it called derogatory language used against its patron-in-chief Imran Khan and accountability of those responsible to prevent such statements in future.
Leaders of PTI and Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen Pakistan (TTAP), addressing the gathering, strongly condemned Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry for his remarks about Mr Khan and Khyber Pakhtu­nkhwa Chief Minister Muhammad Sohail Afridi in a media briefing, and urged the institution to “remain within its constitutional limits”.
Most speakers at the rally, held at the Sports Complex in Peshawar, argued that attempts to malign Mr Khan in order to weaken his political standing only served to increase his popularity. A large number of PTI workers attended the event as the party continued to contest the ISPR presser on social media as well.
Head of the Pashto­onkhwa Milli Awami Party and TTAP leader Mehmood Khan Achakzai, TTAP’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, PTI provincial president and MNA Junaid Akbar, Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, provincial ministers, MNAs and MPAs were among those who addressed the rally.
A resolution moved by MNA Sher Ali Arbab said: “We, the people of Pakistan, consider Imran Khan a national hero and the elected and genuine prime minister of Pakistan, who was elected by the people on Feb 8, 2024. We categorically reject that he or his associates are in any way a threat to national security.”
The resolution said an unelected military spokesperson had used “derogatory language” towards elected leadership, and termed this behaviour contrary to the principles of civilian supremacy espo­used by Quaid-i-Azam.
The party also rejected any talk of imposing governor’s rule in KP, saying the people of the province had given a clear mandate to Imran Khan and PTI “despite all obstacles and rigging”.
“Any government formed as a result of the governor’s rule will be illegal and unconstitutional in the eyes of the people,” the resolution stated.
Addressing the rally, Mr Achakzai said “undemocratic elements” had become panicked by the struggle of TTAP and PTI, which was why they had begun using “derogatory and improper language”.
Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said the DG ISPR had alleged that the KP government was not serious about security. “You are not serious, as many military operations have been launched in the previous 21 years,” he retorted.
The young chief minister said PTI could not be held responsible if peace had not returned to the region “because of your security policies”.
PTI leaders also announ­ced another rally in Kohat on Dec 14.

Rehman was arrested in August at Lahore Airport by the NCCIA for allegedly promoting online gambling and betting applications through his platform. He was granted bail in the case by the Lahore High Court on November 25, but was not released from official custody.
Meanwhile, in September, NCCIA Lahore Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry was removed from his post, reportedly over different controversies, including allegedly beating Rehman.
In the video uploaded on Sunday, Rehman outlined the timeline of events from his arrest and being remanded into the NCCIA’s custody. He described meeting Chaudhry, alleging that he was verbally and physically abusive.
“He stood up from his chair and verbally abused me,” Rehman alleged. “He asked me, ’Where does your money come from?’ I replied that it comes from YouTube. I have eight million subscribers. He accused me of corrupting the minds of children.
“He kept verbally abusing me and slapped me so much I lost count.”



Rehman further alleged that officials tried to bribe him, offering to resolve the issue for Rs70-80 million, which he said he did not have.
“When I was in NCCIA custody, you probably heard about $326,000 during a podcast with the assistant director. He said that they seized this money from me … the investigating officer (IO) ordered me to open my Binance account,” Rehman alleged.
“He closed all my trades and tokens at a loss and converted them to US dollars. He then ordered me to transfer it.”
The YouTuber further accused the IO of transferring the sum to his own personal account.
Rehman said that he felt “very helpless” during the first day of custody, further alleging that he was beaten by authorities despite cooperating with the investigation.
He added that when he met with someone he knew, he asked them to request that the guards “beat him less”.
An NCCIA Lahore spokesperson responded to Dawn’s request for comment on the allegations, replying that it is individuals who engage in corrupt practices, not institutions.
“The NCCIA maintains an uncompromising zero-tolerance policy toward any form of corrupt conduct by its officials,” the spokesperson said.
“All proceedings in this matter are being pursued strictly on merit and in full accordance with due process, and an investigation is already underway with FIA Anti-Corruption,“ he added.
On October 28, six NCCIA personnel were arrested and remanded on allegations of misusing their authority and taking bribes.
Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq told Dawn the six were “taken into FIA custody and arrested on charges of misuse of authority and bribery” and would be produced in district court, where he would represent them.
Ashfaq said the six staffers were Additional Director Sarfraz Chaudhry, In-charge Zawar, Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Yasir Gujjar and Mujtaba Kamran.
The first information report (FIR) of the case was registered against nine people, including eight NCCIA personnel, with the FIA Anti-Corruption Circle Lahore on the complaint of Rehman’s wife, Aroob Jatoi.</p><small>2025-12-08 02:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/08071700f2279c2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959875/bulk-of-nab-recoveries-in-form-of-assets-land' target='_blank'><strong>Bulk of NAB recoveries in form of assets, land</strong></a><br><p>• Anti-graft body claims to have retrieved Rs9tr since 2023• Instead of clipping its wings, changes to NAB law expanded scope of its work, says chairman
ISLAMABAD: Claims by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) of recovering almost Rs9 trillion in just two years (2023–25) may seem unbelievable, but the data reveals that most of the anti-graft watchdog’s recoveries are not in cash.
Instead, they consist of non-monetary assets such as land and properties belonging to various state institutions that had been illegally occupied by individuals and groups.
After the ouster of the PTI-led federal government in April 2022, the PML-N-led coalition amended the National Acc­o­untability Ordinance 1999 so that NAB could only take up cases involving Rs500 million or more.
These new laws, which seemingly curtailed its powers, actually ended up expanding the anti-graft body’s scope and led to remarkable recoveries, according to its chief.
“Since passage of the legislation, everybody assumed NAB had become redundant. but in fact, it was a blessing in disguise as we approached many government institutions, offering them help in recovering their illegally occupied land worth trillions,” NAB Chairman retired Lt Gen Nazir Ahmed Butt said in a recent media briefing.
“This has made NAB’s job more demanding but also more useful for the state and its institutions,” he added.
This was the maiden formal media interaction for Lt Gen Butt, who took charge in March 2023.
Comparing his performance with NAB’s past record, he recalled that from its creation in 1999 to March 2023, the bureau recovered $3.15 billion. However, the two-and-a-half-years that he has been in charge, he said the bureau had recovered a staggering of $29.99bn.
These include cash recoveries of Rs1.124tr (roughly $4bn), with the rest coming in the form of assets.
In his remarks, the chairman said that over the past 26 years, the government provided Rs62bn to NAB, while the bureau had recovered Rs9tr, making its performance unmatched by any anti-corruption agency in the world.
New measures
According to NAB documents seen by Dawn, the 2022 reforms made affidavits and undertakings from complainants a mandatory process, and the term “accused” was replaced with “defendant”.
The bureau also developed a mechanism for handling cardinal consideration-complaints against parliamentarians, government officials and businessmen.
In addition, Accountability Fac­ilitation Cells were set up in Nat­ional and provincial assemblies, the Establishment Division and the offices of chief secretaries.
“We don’t approach any lawmaker or businessman directly, but through their respective speaker and chamber of commerce,” the chairman said.
He said this approach had restored bureaucrats’ confidence, as many had earlier stopped signing important files.
Under its new strategy, NAB has been now focusing on recovering several categories of state land, including misappropriated, underutilised, illegally possessed and hidden land, as well as land not registered with revenue authorities.
Meanwhile, the bureau has geared up its efforts to curb money laundering, trace illegal foreign assets, freeze bank accounts and properties, make immediate arrests and ensure swift recovery of crime proceeds.

Pakistan, for better or worse, is a different story, though. Its banks have fared much better than the country’s economy as a whole.
But they lend more to the government than the real economy, and there seems to be a compelling reason why banks avoid private-sector lending and prefer safer government securities: the nation’s loan recovery laws and inefficient judicial system reward default rather than punish it. You can borrow money from banks and avoid or delay repayment for years — even decades — because litigation would drag on endlessly.
“Weak enforcement, legal loopholes and slow courts collectively make loan recovery extremely difficult,” says a senior executive of a foreign bank speaking on condition of anonymity. “As a result, banks are reluctant to lend to the private sector, especially where default risk is higher. They know that if a loan goes bad, they would be stuck in legal limbo.”

 

The case with public-sector banks is different, he says. “They can afford default and write-off losses. But private banks cannot afford this because they don’t have government support or guarantees to absorb their losses like the state-owned lenders.”

The economic fallout of a weak loan-recovery framework is huge, with SMEs and farmers struggling to access finance

The consequences of delays in recovery case decisions are evident in Pakistan’s exceptionally high loan infection ratio, with the current non-performing loan (NPL) ratio well above global trends.
In the US, the NPL ratio stands at 1.5 per cent and in the UK at only 1pc. Even emerging markets like Indonesia and Malaysia have impaired-loan ratios of 2.25pc and a 1.6pc, respectively. In contrast, Pakistan’s NPL ratio remains significantly higher at 7.4pc, underscoring persistent asset-quality challenges and weaker recovery systems relative to regional and global peers.
The State Bank data shows that the country’s top 13 banks, which carry a high volume of bad loans, hold a very large portfolio of Rs622.84 billion in domestic NPLs, with the industry’s total NPL standing at Rs964bn as of September. National Bank of Pakistan tops the list with bad loans of Rs158.3bn followed by United Bank with roughly Rs76bn and Habib Bank with Rs70.6bn. Bank of Punjab ranks fourth with NPLs of Rs54.3bn and Bank Alfalah holds fifth place with Rs42.4bn.
The law — Financial Institutions (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001 — that is supposed to fix this situation falls short of its purpose, says a corporate lawyer who has represented various banks during the last couple of decades. The law creates special banking courts, promises speedy decisions, and gives lenders a clearer path to repossessions.
“The law allows lenders to sell mortgaged property like land, houses, and equipment through a public auction without the intervention of any court after serving a final notice and following the prescribed legal procedure and timeframes. Suits are expected to be disposed of within 90 days. The court may also require defaulters to deposit cash or provide security equal to the claim amount if proceedings extend beyond this period due to their conduct.

‘Borrowers routinely obtain stay orders, file parallel suits, drag out appeals, and exploit every procedural loophole the system offers to avoid repaying loans’

“The Ordinance includes penalties, including imprisonment and fines, for deliberate default, fraudulent activities, or intentionally destroying or removing secured property,” he says.
But in practice, the system still favours delays.
“Borrowers routinely obtain stay orders, file parallel suits, drag out appeals, and exploit every procedural loophole the system offers. Even when a decree is issued, repossession remains a political, administrative and logistical nightmare. Police hesitate, revenue officials duck responsibility, and borrowers simply refuse to hand over pledged assets.
“Vehicles vanish, equipment goes missing, and properties remain stuck in litigation. Banks either spend heavily to trace and seize assets or simply write-off the loss,” maintains the lawyer, who says some of the cases he is pursuing date back to 2009.
The State Bank regularly collects data on all pending court cases from banks, but it does not publicise this information for good reasons, as per global practices. However, data obtained by Dawn privately from five of the 13 banks mentioned above on recovery suits pending with high courts across Pakistan, shows that recovery suits involving an aggregate amount of Rs75bn are pending decision at various stages.
Additionally, cases involving a cumulative amount of Rs43bn decided or decreed in their favour are at different stages of execution. This represents only the tip of the iceberg, as it does not include details of litigation pending in banking courts, nor does it capture the total volume of appeals and petitions filed by borrowers or banks against high court decisions.
“When a borrower defaults, our whole recovery system turns into a labyrinth of court cases and delays. Even after a decree, actual recovery drags on for years. Banks suffer losses. They will lend to what you call underserved or unserved segments of the economy only when they are confident that they will get their money back,” the foreign bank executive says.
The banking industry has regularly taken up this issue with both the previous and incumbent governments, urging reforms to Pakistan’s weak loan recovery laws and procedures. It has repeatedly been pointed out that Pakistani courts operate at a painfully slow pace, and recovery suits often take years to resolve, calling for the implementation of Sri Lanka’s Parate Execution mechanism in the country to expedite the recovery of bad loans.
Sri Lanka solved its chronic delays in loan recovery decades ago through this mechanism. Under it, banks can seize and auction mortgaged assets without first going through courts. Courts intervene only when a borrower can show a clear legal violation. The process is swift: after default, the bank issues a notice; if no payment is made within 14 days, a board resolution allows the bank to auction the property.

 

Auctions are publicly advertised, and recovery is completed within weeks rather than years. If an auction fails, the bank may temporarily take the property onto its books but must resell it and return any surplus to the borrower. This non-judicial foreclosure system has transformed Sri Lanka’s credit market by giving banks confidence to lend to small and medium enterprises, homebuyers, and consumers.
Another banking sector lawyer says the country’s loan recovery law itself is straightforward; the flaw lies in its weak implementation. “The core problem is the lack of competent judges who understand banking and recovery laws. Those judges who do have the expertise are overworked.
“This is a specialised area, and without the right judicial capacity, cases cannot be decided correctly or on time. Banking courts perform somewhat better because they handle only these matters, but high court judges are overwhelmed and simply do not have the time to hear our cases. The systemic delays have made the foreclosure process ineffective despite what the law promises.”
The economic fallout of a weak loan-recovery framework is huge. Small and medium enterprises and farmers struggle to access finance. The mortgage market is virtually non-existent, as no lender can offer long-term housing finance without the assurance of repossession in the event of default. Even consumer credit — personal loans and credit cards — remains underdeveloped.
These segments pay the price for a legal system that is unable to enforce contracts while banks retreat to the safer options of lending to government or large corporations, leaving the broader economy starved of credit.

ISLAMABAD: The government’s expenditure on civil administration and pension payouts has continually climbed over the last five years, with the first quarter of the current fiscal year seeing a double-digit increase despite a strict official austerity policy and an aggressive downsizing exercise.
Fiscal data released by the Ministry of Finance indicates a 13pc increase in ‘Running of the Civil Government’ expenditure in the first quarter, which runs from July to September. The costs rose to Rs161.2bn in the current fiscal year, compared to Rs142.5bn during the same period last year.
This rise in expenses comes as the government claims to be tightening its belt through significant staffing and structural reforms.
The increase is notable as the government abolished more than 150,000 posts last year and has been “rightsizing” various ministries, divisions and their subordinate departments through mergers and closures.
Additionally, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb anno­unced about a week ago that the government had abolished an additional 54,000 vacant posts across various departments, resulting in an annual saving of more than Rs56bn to the exchequer.
He added that the process of merging and restructuring several ministries and divisions was also underway as part of fiscal reforms.
The trend of rising costs is not new. Civil government expenses in the first quarter of last year saw an 8pc increase compared to the same period of FY24, which itself had posted a 29pc surge over FY23.
The data showed that the running of civil government expenses has jumped by almost 80pc since the first quarter of FY22 when the expenditure amounted to Rs89.5bn. The full-year bill for running the civil government had crossed Rs892bn.
Similarly, pension expenditures continue to climb. In the first quarter of the current year, pension payments amounted to Rs249.5bn, a 10pc increase over the Rs223bn spent in the comparable period of FY25.
A year earlier, pension payments had witnessed a 9pc increase. Over the past five years, pension expenditure has surged by almost 125pc, up from the Rs111bn reported for the first quarter of FY22. The total pension bill at the conclusion of the last fiscal year reached Rs911bn.
In contrast to the rigid and monthly due expenses of pensions and civil administration, the official data showed large var­iations in subsidy payments, which the government can postpone. These payments saw a six-time surge in the first quarter of the current year, reaching Rs120bn compared to Rs20bn last year.
The government had disbursed only Rs2.5bn for subsidies in the first quarter of FY24, while payments in the preceding two years were Rs93bn and Rs74bn, respectively. The subsidy bill last year reached Rs1.298 trillion.
On paper, the government has adhered to an austerity policy across all sectors since 2021, driven by stringent fiscal oversight mandated by successive IMF programmes.
In June, the government ann­ounced the continuation of austerity measures for FY26, which included a complete ban on the purchase of all types of vehicles, the procurement of machinery and equipment, and the creation of new posts throughout the federal government.
However, various ministries, divisions and entities kept on fi­n­d­ing ways to bypass such banks on one pretext or another.

Key stakeholders now hope the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will recognise the centrality of economic expansion to durable stabilisation and ease pressure on the government, allowing it fiscal space to recalibrate its tax policy.
They contend that only such flexibility can unshackle the country’s economic potential and unlock its vast productive capacity.
Under the IMF oversight and a strict focus on fiscal stabilisation, Pakistan’s tax collection has risen sharply over the past two years.
According to the State Bank, tax revenue grew by a notable 12.5 per cent year-on-year in Q1FY26. However, despite repeated claims of broadening the tax base, tangible progress remains elusive.

‘Out of the proposed Rs975bn package, the bulk of the relief may go to companies, with super tax potentially cut from 10pc to 5pc’

Large sectors, including agriculture, wholesale, retail trade, real estate, and high-earning service providers such as lawyers, doctors, architects, artists, consultants, etc, continue to operate largely outside the tax net. As a result, the burden of additional revenue mobilisation has fallen disproportionately on those already within the tax system.
This pattern is also reflected in official publications. According to the ‘21st Edition of the Revenue Division Year Book 2025’, the share of direct taxes in total taxes rose from 37.2pc in FY22 to 49.3pc in FY25. A review of the Pakistan Economic Survey 2024-25 and related publications confirms that the government does not regularly publish a clean breakdown of the share of categories of direct taxpayers, such as corporations or salaried individuals, in total direct tax collection.
However, the corporate sector is understood to account for around 65pc of direct tax collections. The salaried individuals, presumed to be captive taxpayers, whose taxes are deducted at source and who constitute less than 8pc of the labour force, are believed to be contributing far more than their proportional share to the tax take.
Acknowledging that Pakistan’s unusually high tax burden has become a drag on growth, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif reportedly directed his economic team last week to engage the IMF on a proposed Rs975 billion tax-relief package as a part of a strategy to spur job creation and capital formation.

‘High taxation is the single biggest obstacle to investment, and we are hoping the IMF will approve the relief package’

The package was crafted by one of the government’s working groups, which included representatives from civil society and the private sector, to recommend tax structure reforms. The private-sector-led group on taxation, chaired by Shahzad Saleem, proposed phasing the relief over three years, with an estimated immediate cost of Rs600bn. The government, however, opted to seek the IMF’s endorsement before proceeding with implementation.
Senior members of the economic team were approached for comment, but no response was received by the time of filing. However, a source familiar with the deliberations said the prime minister’s close advisors broadly support the tax panel’s proposals, viewing them as critical for kick-starting growth.
“High taxation is the single biggest obstacle to investment, and we are hoping the IMF will approve the relief package,” a senior official noted privately. “We have some fiscal space, with the fiscal deficit down from over 8pc to around 5pc, but we need the Fund’s relaxation on the primary-surplus target to move ahead.”
Responding to a question on how much of the proposed relief targets the salaried class, former FBR chairman Shabbar Zaidi noted, “The maximum salary tax rate is proposed to be reduced by five percentage points. The impact will be no more than Rs30–40bn. So, out of a Rs975bn package, the bulk of the relief would go to companies. Super Tax is to be cut from 10pc to 5pc.” He pointed out that the proposal contains no concrete measures to offset the resulting revenue shortfall.
Business leaders serving on government working groups declined to comment under their engagement terms. However, former Pakistan Business Council CEO Ehsan Malik endorsed the proposed tax relief, arguing that Pakistan’s tax regime renders businesses uncompetitive and punishes the most tax-compliant. “Salaried employees and formal-sector firms bear a crushing tax burden while large segments of the economy remain untaxed.”
He warned that the high-tax approach under the 24th IMF programme is stifling investment, destroying jobs and accelerating skilled emigration, while repeated pledges to tax retailers, wholesalers, transporters, doctors, lawyers and salon operators have produced little progress.
“In this context, tax cuts are not just desirable but essential. Proposed measures include lowering the corporate tax rate from 29pc to 25pc; bringing maximum individual and AOP rates down from 38–49pc to a rational 25pc; abolishing the super tax; removing taxes on inter-corporate dividends; cutting sales tax from 18pc to 15pc; and withdrawing the Capital Value Tax. The real challenge, as always, will be closing the fiscal gap and securing IMF approval,” Mr Malik remarked.
“That requires political will. The government must cut expenditure, fast-track privatisation, and phase in tax reductions over three years. Evidence shows that lower, predictable taxes stimulate investment, create jobs, and ultimately raise revenue. Pakistan cannot grow while choking its most productive sectors.
“Above all, personal income tax rates need an immediate cut. Salaried workers have become the easiest target, taxed far beyond economic reality. Easing this burden is vital to restore confidence, stem the brain drain, and put the country on a sustainable growth path,” he concluded.
Abdul Aleem, Secretary General, Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry, supported a calibrated reduction in tax rates for both the corporate and salaried groups. He noted that publicly available details do not explain how the Rs975bn figure was derived or what share is intended for salaried taxpayers.
He believed that the IMF is broadly aligned with the proposed relief but urged the Ministry of Finance to clarify how the resulting revenue shortfall would be addressed.

With teams arriving and no court to play on, the event itself was in jeopardy.
“We arranged everything in almost two days,” PBBF secretary Yaqoob Qadri told Dawn, revealing a significant off-court challenge. “There were some people who don’t want the event to happen.”
Yet, on Sunday, the roar of a packed crowd for the Army-Sindh clash at the North Nazimabad Gymkhana in Karachi was the definitive answer. Against a backdrop of administrative hurdles, the players delivered a classic on the hardwood: a tale of Army’s clinical system slowly dismantling Sindh’s passionate home stand, culminating in a 97-62 victory.
The roar in the arena was for Sindh. Every steal, every basket by the home team sent waves of noise crashing onto the court. But standing across from that passion was the cold, tall geometry of the Pakistan Army team. What unfolded was a classic clash of heart versus system.
The start was all Sindh. Feeding off the overwhelming home support, they edged a tight first quarter 6-4. Army’s towering presence, anchored by the 7’3“ frame of Taglub Ammar, was a problem.
“We took our competition lightly that’s why Sindh edged us in the first quarter,” Taglub admitted to Dawn.
Army’s top-scorer Shiraz Aslam, who initially missed some of his three-point shots struggled in start found his rhythm.
Sindh’s in-game leader, Ans Azhar, pinpointed the turning point.
“In the first quarter we started brilliantly and I guess that’s where we spent most of our energy,” he told Dawn. “In the second quarter when that wave passed we couldn’t keep the same intensity and that’s where they hurt us.”
That hurt was methodical. Army began dominating the second balls, converting rebounds into points and punishing every seldom mistake.
The tall player was no longer just a threat; he became the central piece of an unsolvable equation.
“We were to some extent not able to overpower them in some exchanges,” Ans conceded. “I wouldn’t say that it was a total mismatch but Army’s athletes are fittest of our country.”
By halftime, Army led 15-12. By the third quarter, the lead had swelled to 20. The crowd, still raising the roof, willed a comeback, but Army had locked in.
“We came prepared and were always confident of the comeback,” Shiraz said, who revelled in the electric atmosphere. “This is what we play for… The atmosphere today made the match very exciting.”
The final quarter was a formality, the gap insurmountable. Sindh’s physical effort, which saw them “commit too many fouls” and give away nearly 20 points from the line, was a testament to their fight.
“Against a team like Army you can’t shy away from those duels,” Ans stated. “We were very physical in the game… you play to win no matter what.”
Despite the loss, Sindh’s leader found perspective and promise.
“Obviously wasn’t the result we wanted… but we are still a work in progress,” Ans said, already looking ahead. “But one thing that I can ensure is that it will be improved and [we will] beat those professional sides at the top level with the same bunch.”
A theme of dominance
The men’s result echoed through the women’s bracket, where professional department teams showcased their structural advantage. The Army women routed Balochistan 56-6, while Wapda, the most dominant force in women’s basketball, cruised past Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 66-24.
For Wapda’s Kainat Zafar, the win was a controlled step towards the gold.
“We were trying to conserve our energy and avoid injuries,” she explained while talking to Dawn. “We tried to stick to the basics.”
She credits their dynasty to chemistry built over years together as a department — a key edge over provincial sides.
“The chemistry among the players is what I think keeps us on the top,” she said.
Yet, even in dominance, there’s respect. “Our main rivals are always Army,” Kainat noted, setting the stage for the tournament’s likely climax.</p><small>2025-12-07 19:24</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07235448368f26d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959764/israels-netanyahu-to-discuss-second-phase-of-gaza-plan-with-trump-later-this-month' target='_blank'><strong>Israel’s Netanyahu to discuss second phase of Gaza plan with Trump later this month</strong></a><br><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that the second phase of a US plan to end Tel Aviv’s genocide against Palestinians in Gaza was close, but cautioned several key issues still needed to be resolved, including whether a multinational security force would be deployed.
Netanyahu, speaking to reporters alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in Jerusalem, said that he would hold important discussions with US President Donald Trump at the end of the month on how to ensure the plan’s second phase was achieved.
The prime minister’s office in November said that Trump had invited Netanyahu to the White House “in the near future”, although a date for the visit has not yet been made public.
Netanyahu said that he would discuss with Trump how to bring an end to Hamas rule in Gaza. Israel and Hamas entered a ceasefire two months ago, but Israel has continued its bombardment of Gaza, killing Palestinians, as the death toll in the besieged enclave reached over 72,300 as of November 19, 2o25. Gaza’s health ministry says 373 Palestinians have been killed since the ceasefire started. Israel says three of its soldiers have been killed by Hamas.
Earlier today, Israel’s army killed seven Palestinians in northern Gaza, including a 70-year-old woman and her son. Attacks also wounded a child in Gaza City, according to Al Jazeera. Tel Aviv also alleges that Hamas has been violating the ceasefire.
Netanyahu said that it was important to ensure Hamas not only upholds the ceasefire but also follows through on “their commitment” to the plan to disarm and for Gaza to be demilitarised.
Israel retained control of 53 per cent of Gaza under the first phase of Trump’s plan, which involved the release of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and of Palestinians detained by Israel. The final hostage remains to be handed over are those of an Israeli police officer killed on October 7, 2023, fighting Hamas.
Phase 2 must come out now: German chancellor
According to the plan, Israel is to pull back further in the second phase as a transitional authority is established in Gaza and a multinational security force is deployed, Hamas is disarmed, and reconstruction begins.
A multinational coordination centre has been established in Israel, but there are no deadlines in the plan and officials involved say that efforts to advance it have stalled.
“What will be the timeline? What are the forces that are coming in? Will we have international forces? If not, what are the alternatives? These are all topics that are being discussed,” Netanyahu said, describing them as central issues.
Merz said that Germany was willing to help rebuild Gaza but would wait for Netanyahu’s meeting with Trump, and for clarity on what Washington was prepared to do, before Berlin decides what it would contribute, but that phase two “must come now”.
West Bank annexation remains subject of discussion: Netanyahu
Netanyahu said that he would also discuss with Trump “opportunities for peace”, an apparent reference to US efforts for Israel to establish formal ties with Arab and Muslim states.
“We believe there’s a path to advance a broader peace with the Arab states, and a path also to establish a workable peace with our Palestinian neighbours,” Netanyahu said, asserting Israel would always insist on security control of the West Bank.
Trump has said he promised Muslim leaders that Israel would not annex the occupied West Bank, where Netanyahu’s government is backing the development of Jewish settlements.
The “question of political annexation” of the West Bank remains a subject of discussion, Netanyahu said.</p><small>2025-12-07 18:57</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0718360742a870d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959752/45-arrested-as-citizens-clash-with-police-during-sindh-culture-day-rally' target='_blank'><strong>45 arrested as citizens clash with police during Sindh Culture Day rally</strong></a><br><p>Karachi police arrested 45 people participating in the Sindh Culture Day rally on Sunday, after people allegedly pelted police personnel with stones.
South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that upon being attacked by participants, police responded with a baton charge and tear gas shelling.
“We detained 45 people on Sharea Faisal,” DIG Raza said. “The South SSP (Senior Superintendent of Police) is at the scene, and the situation is under control.”
The DIG said that since the Red Zone has been closed, alternative traffic routes are being provided for citizens and commuters.
He added that the law enforcers asked the rally participants to use the Lines Area route towards Saddar and subsequently the venue of the rally at Karachi Press Club (KPC), but “they were bent upon using the main Sharea Faisal from Jinnah Bridge”.
“They allegedly pelted stones on the police when they were stopped, resulting in injuries to five policemen,” he said, adding that it prompted the police to resort to tear gas shelling to disperse them.
According to police sources, participants at the rally were arguing with police over being stopped and that dispute escalated into stone-throwing.



Asked as to why the law enforcers blocked the road at the Finance and Trade Centre (FTC) flyover, DIG Raza said that an advisory was issued pertaining to the Cultural Day, as multiple rallies and cultural processions were expected to assemble at the FTC and intend to move towards the KPC via Sharea Faisal.
“In view of certain past untoward incidents, the law enforcers were asked to ensure that no participant was allowed to move beyond FTC under any circumstances, as the area ahead leads into the Red Zone, which contains sensitive installations.
“Thus, the police and rangers were deployed at the FTC bridge to enforce the diversion and prevent any unauthorised movement.”
Later, the DIG said that 12 of the 45 arrested were released on the surety of the Karachi Bar Association president.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar took strict notice of the incident on Sharea Faisal and ordered immediate action against those involved, according to a statement from his office.
In a phone call with the additional inspector general, Lanjar ordered, “Those damaging police vehicles and citizens’ property should be arrested immediately.”







Celebrated on the first Sunday of December each year, Sindh Cultural Day was first observed in 2009. Political parties, social organisations and civil society, as well as government bodies, organise a wide range of events, including seminars, debates, folk music programmes, theatrical performances and literary sittings to highlight the rich culture and history of Sindh.



Raza recalled that in 2023, during Sindh Cultural Day celebrations, there were violent confrontations between law enforcers and protesters in which a first information report was also registered.
Similarly, last year, Raza said a police van was damaged, and police personnel were manhandled, while some of the protestors managed to cross into the Red Zone and reached the KPC via Jinnah Bridge.
“Around 10-12 rallies came from different parts of the metropolis and reached the Fawara Chowk and KPC with around 17,000 to 18,000 participants,” he said.

Their goldrush on Sunday was spearheaded by utter dominance in taekwondo and sharp shooting on the ranges.
The clearest demonstration of authority came in the taekwondo Poomsae events, where Army fighters ruled the roost, clinching eight gold medals across age categories.
Their women set the tone: Sana Sabir (Under-50), Naila (U-30), Mehar-Un-Nisa (U-40) and Zeena Sheraz (Under-20)  all stood atop the podium. The men followed suit with Adil Hussain (U-30), Mohammad Mumtaz (U-40), Irshad Ali (U-50) and Syed Zohaib (U-20) securing their own golds.
On the shooting ranges, Army and Navy engaged in a high-class duel, sharing three gold medals apiece.
Navy swept the 10m air pistol events, with Rabia Kabir (232.2) edging Army’s Rimsha Nadeem (231.6) for individual glory before teaming with Rasam Gul and Hadia Liaquat for team gold.
Army struck back in the 25m rapid fire pistol through Mohammad Shabbir while Navy’s G. M. Bashir, Maqbool Hussain and Abdul Quddus took the team title.
Army also claimed both skeet Olympic titles, with Imam Haroon (score 49) leading the charge.
Sindh’s first gold
The day’s most dramatic narrative unfolded away from the established powers, as the Sindh women’s netball team rose above a feisty, fractious final to secure a domineering 20-12 victory over favourites Wapda, claiming a statement gold — a first for the contingent.
It was a triumph of provincial grit over a departmental side with year-round training access.
“That makes this even better,” Sindh skipper Quratulain told Dawn. Team-mate Huma echoed the hunger for more support: “We’ll go a long way if we get that opportunity.”
The match itself descended into chaos. After Sindh seized a 13-9 half-time lead, the stifling heat seemed to boil over.
A third-quarter collision escalated into a shoving match. In the final quarter, a Wapda player made an expletive gesture, inciting the crowd. Sindh held their nerve, but sportsmanship evaporated at the final buzzer.
Handshakes were skipped, and an hour later, a sullen Wapda and bronze-winning Army drowned out Sindh’s celebrations with chants of “losers, losers!”
“The girls need their own court,” said Sindh coach Humaira Huma, a pioneer of Pakistan’s first national team. “Today was just a month’s practice. Imagine what they could do.”
In stark contrast, the men’s final was a pure sporting contest, with Army staging a last-gasp comeback to clinch gold 27-26 against Navy.
Hosts overwhelmed
On the basketball court, Army’s men showcased their systemic power, overcoming a raucous home crowd to dismantle Sindh 97-62.
Sindh started strong, leading 6-4 early. “We started brilliantly, but I guess that’s where we spent most of our energy,” Sindh’s leader Ans Azhar told Dawn.
Army’s towering 7’3“ center, Taglub Ammar, proved unsolvable. “We took the competition lightly initially,” Taglub conceded. Once settled, Army took control, leading 15-12 at halftime and stretching it to 20 by the final quarter.
Top-scorer Shiraz Aslam revelled in the atmosphere: “This is what we play for… The crowd made the match very exciting.”
Sindh’s physicality cost them nearly 20 points from free throws.
“We were very physical… you play to win,” said Ans, who vowed improvement: “We will beat those professional sides.”
In women’s basketball, the powerhouses marched on.
Army delivered a merciless 56-6 rout of Balochistan while Wapda, led by Kainat Zafar, powered past Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 66-24.
“We were trying to conserve energy and avoid injuries,” said Kainat, highlighting Wapda’s key advantage. “This chemistry is the advantage we have over provincial teams.”
Crushing win
Other sports saw their opening salvos. In a staggering display, Wapda’s women’s hockey team crushed Balochistan 18-0, with ten players on the scoresheet.
On the badminton courts, stars like Mahoor Shahzad (Wapda) and Palwasha Bashir (Sindh) led their teams comfortably into the semi-finals.
Army and Punjab also ensured progress with dominant wins.
Murad Ali (KP), Pakistan’s number one, led his team into the last-four in the men’s section as his side beat Railways to advance in the semis.
Army and Police also confirmed their berths in the next round.
The fencing mat witnessed a historic gold for the Higher Education Commission (HEC), delivered by Abdul Mussawir, who dashed Balochistan’s title hopes in the final.
Other sports that kicked off on Sunday included, rugby, volleyball, baseball, softball and table tennis.
Action continues across Karachi on Monday, with Army’s golden machine looking to build on a formidable lead, and provincial sides like Sindh aiming to channel their fighting spirit into more podium finishes.</p><small>2025-12-07 18:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/0722580207891a6.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959760/transporters-press-ahead-with-wheel-jam-strike-in-islamabad-rawalpindi-tomorrow-despite-administrations-appeal' target='_blank'><strong>Transporters press ahead with wheel-jam strike in Islamabad, Rawalpindi tomorrow despite administration’s appeal</strong></a><br><p>Local public transporters on Sunday announced a wheel-jam strike for tomorrow (December 8) in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, rejecting the local administration’s request to delay the protest against the new traffic ordinance, which has raised fines for heavy vehicles.
The strike was announced on the call of the Punjab Public Transport Association. Before the announcement, representatives of the association, along with the Goods Transporters Association, met City Traffic Police officer Farhan Aslam and Regional Transport Authority Secretary Asad Shirazi. The administration urged transporters not to observe a wheel-jam strike in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.
However, local transporters refused to withdraw their decision, insisting they would go ahead with the strike to pressure the provincial government into repealing the ordinance.
“We tried to convince the transporters not to go for a wheel-jam strike, but they demanded to abolish the new amendments, and it was beyond our authority to do anything about it,” Shirazi said.
He added that the Punjab government had been informed of the demands of the transporters, and it would hold negotiations with the United Transport Association in Lahore.
Mutahida Transport Federation of Twin Cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Chairman Raja Muhammad Riaz told Dawn that “transporters were facing problems due to heavy fines, and it was difficult to manage their household budgets.”
“Heavy fines from Rs5,000 to Rs20,000 had become routine, and it destroyed their business,” Riaz said, adding that the government was trying to recover its financial burdens from transporters, who were already struggling with fuel and spare parts.
He demanded an immediate reduction in fines and an end to policies that “destroyed the sector.”
During the meeting, he said that the traffic police agreed not to impose fines on vehicles having a fitness certificate.
Meanwhile, the President of the Goods Transport Association, Shakeel Qureshi, said that freight vehicles and goods transporters in Rawalpindi would support the wheel-jam strike on Monday.
“We will join them in the decision of the Pakistan United Transporters Committee to strike on December 8,” he said, adding that the Rawalpindi transporters will keep their bases completely closed.
“We strongly condemn the traffic laws passed by the Punjab Assembly and the rate of fines,” he said. “Amendments to the customs laws that will be made are tantamount to economic murder of transporters.”
Qureshi went on to say that the government should take the time to be conscious and make decisions, keeping in mind the interests of the people. “It should not be that decisions are made by listening to one side and making laws without consulting stakeholders,” he said.
On the other hand, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI) Rawalpindi district has announced its full support for the December 8 strike of the Transport Action Committee against heavy traffic fines.
Spokesperson JUI Rawalpindi Hafiz Ziaullah said that heavy fines imposed by the Punjab government have made life difficult for the people of Rawalpindi, especially the poor motorcyclists.
He demanded that the Chief Minister of Punjab, Maryam Nawaz, “adopt a people-friendly policy and reduce the unnecessary and unfair burden of fines.”</p><small>2025-12-07 17:59</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/07222639a82bbc8.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959758/un-calls-on-taliban-to-lift-ban-on-afghan-women-in-its-offices' target='_blank'><strong>UN calls on Taliban to lift ban on Afghan women in its offices</strong></a><br><p>The United Nations called on the Taliban authorities on Sunday to lift its ban on Afghan women working in its offices, saying the restriction puts “life-saving services” at risk.
Since the Taliban regained power in 2021, Afghan women have been barred from doing most jobs, visiting parks and beauty salons, and attending school beyond the age of 12.
In September, the Taliban authorities began prohibiting women staff members from entering UN offices.
“We call for the ban on Afghan women staff and contractors from entering United Nations premises to be reversed, and for their safe access to offices and the field,” Susan Ferguson, the special representative of the UN’s women’s agency in Afghanistan, said in a statement.
“The longer these restrictions remain in place, the greater the risk to these life-saving services,” Ferguson said, adding that they violated the UN’s principles of human rights and equality.
The statement did not say how many staff were affected, but UN sources indicated that several hundred women were facing the ban.
Staff have been working remotely for the past three months, notably assisting the victims of deadly earthquakes and Afghan migrants deported from neighbouring Pakistan and Iran, Ferguson said.
Describing their work as “indispensable”, she said: “Only through their presence can we reach women and girls safely and provide culturally appropriate assistance.”
The Taliban authorities did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment.
In September, the UN’s refugee agency suspended cash aid to returned Afghan migrants, citing the impossibility of interviewing and collecting information on more than 50 per cent of returnees who were women.</p><small>2025-12-07 17:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/072023361df514e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959755/pti-says-attempts-to-malign-imran-will-only-increase-his-popularity' target='_blank'><strong>PTI says attempts to malign Imran will only increase his popularity</strong></a><br><p>The PTI on Sunday stated that “further attempts to malign” party founder and former prime minister Imran Khan in a bid to diminish his popularity would only cause his popularity to rise with each narrative orchestrated against him.
The party presented its stance during a rally held at Peshawar’s Sports Complex, where its leadership was joined by its political ally, the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP). Both parties expressed their solidarity with Imran as they took exception to the recent remarks made against him, urging that “those responsible be held to account” to prevent similar remarks in future.
Speaking to the participants of the rally, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party and TTAP chief Mehmood Khan Achakzai said that undemocratic elements were apprehensive of the struggle of genuine political movements like the TTAP and PTI, prompting them to resort to using “improper language”.
“Pakistan is our country, and we will make all efforts to save it from disintegration,” Achakzai said, adding his party and its allies wanted a Pakistan “where no one harms others, where people with different schools of thought could live together peacefully, and this country moves forward with constitutional supremacy and rule of law”.
He also warned against a governor’s rule in KP, saying that such a move would lead to negative consequences.
Meanwhile, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, while addressing the rally, said that the PTI was not responsible if peace had not returned in the region due to the state’s security policies.
He added that since taking the oath as chief minister, he fulfilled all legal and constitutional obligations, but a different narrative was being built up against him, and elements were trying to show the world that PTI has adopted confrontational politics.
A resolution passed during the rally stated, “We, the people of Pakistan, consider Imran Khan a national hero and the elected and genuine prime minister of Pakistan, who was elected by the people on February 8, 2024. We categorically reject that he or his associates are in any way a threat to national security.”
The resolution, moved by PTI MNA Sher Ali Arbab, stated that the party recorded its strong protest against the recent remarks against Imran.
It said that such a language against a political leader was “against the principles of civil supremacy of Quaid-i-Azam”.
The PTI also condemned how those with dissenting political opinions were called “a growing threat to national security”.
Their statement came in reference to a press conference held on Friday by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, during which he assailed the incarcerated PTI founder for creating and spreading an “anti-army” rhetoric, stating that such narratives were now out of the realm of politics and had become a “national security threat”.
The party announced another rally in Kohat on December 14.
Political figures assail PTI, Imran for ‘anti-army rhetoric’
Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, meanwhile, took to X and assailed the PTI founder, stating that it is justified to call any individual “delusional” or “mentally ill” if they target the state in pursuit of political interests.
“Behind the response given in the DG ISPR’s press conference lies the incessant hate-mongering rhetoric of that person and his followers, for which there is no parallel in Pakistan’s history,” the post read.
Asif also condemned the PTI’s attempt to create divisions between the armed forces and their leadership and stated that “no effort contrary to the country’s dignity, sovereignty, and national security” would be allowed to succeed.
“The criminal sitting in Adiala cannot be permitted under any circumstances to toy with the country’s stability,” he wrote.







Earlier today, several political figures belonging to different parties — including PML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal and Hanif Abbasi, PPP’s Sarfaraz Bugti, and the leadership of MQM-P — showed solidarity with the armed forces of Pakistan. They slammed Imran and the PTI for spreading propaganda against the armed forces and attempting to hatch an alleged conspiracy against the country.
“Political differences are part of any democracy—but when politics crosses the line into anti-state narrative building, deliberate misinformation, and attacks on the integrity of Pakistan’s Armed Forces and its leadership, it threatens the stability, security, and unity of the country,” Iqbal wrote on X.
MQM-P Chairman Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui said the PTI was continuing its politics of hurling allegations, and instead of choosing the right forum to address those allegations, it was “creating political instability in the country.”
Bugti, addressing a press briefing, said that Imran was “spreading propaganda against the armed forces and maligning them in line with the agenda of hostile agencies,” calling it “an intelligence-driven war against Pakistan”.
Meanwhile, Abbasi echoed Lt Gen Chaudhry’s words and called Imran a “mental patient“. He also assailed the PTI founder’s family for giving interviews to Afghan and Indian media.</p><small>2025-12-07 17:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637954-not-our-fault-kp-cm-rejects-blame-over-security-lapses-urges-policy-reform' target='_blank'><strong>'Not our fault': KP CM rejects blame over security lapses, urges policy reform</strong></a><br><p>

Red Bull’s Verstappen, who ended the campaign with more wins (eight) than any driver, triumphed in the season-ender with McLaren’s Oscar Piastri second and 12.5 seconds behind at the chequered flag.
Norris, Britain’s 11th Formula One world champion, took his points tally to 423 with Verstappen on 421 and Piastri third with 410.

McLaren, who secured the constructors’ championship in October for the second year in a row, won both titles in the same season for the first time since 1998.
“I’ve not cried in a while. I didn’t think I would cry but I did,” said an emotional Norris in a post-race interview, after also shedding tears inside his helmet.

“It feels amazing. I now know what Max feels like a little bit.

“I want to congratulate Max and Oscar, my two biggest competitors the whole season. It’s been a pleasure to race against both of them. It’s been an honour, I’ve learned a lot from both,” he added.
Norris’s mother Cisca gave Piastri a consoling hug while both Verstappen and the Australian congratulated the new champion in a show of sportsmanship.
The victory denied Verstappen the achievement of five titles in a row, something only Ferrari great Michael Schumacher has managed so far.
Charles Leclerc finished fourth in Sunday’s race for Ferrari with George Russell fifth for Mercedes and Fernando Alonso sixth for Aston Martin.
Esteban Ocon was seventh for Haas, ahead of Ferrari’s seven-times world champion Lewis Hamilton – who failed to stand on the podium all year in a career low for the 40-year-old who joined the Italian team this year from Mercedes.
Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg was ninth in the German’s 250th race and Lance Stroll 10th for Aston Martin.</p><small>2025-12-07 15:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637936-three-women-found-dead-inside-home-in-karachis-gulshan-e-iqbal' target='_blank'><strong>Three women found dead inside home in Karachi's Gulshan-e-Iqbal</strong></a><br><p>

According to the statement issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the IBO was conducted on Saturday on the reported presence of “terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna-al-Hindustan”.
The state has designated Balochistan-based terrorist groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.
The ISPR statement detailed that during the operation yesterday, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, 12 Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”.
Weapons, ammunition and explosives were found in the terrorists’ possession, it said, adding that they had been “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”.
“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored terrorist found in the area as [a] relentless counter-terrorism campaign under [the] vision [of] ‘Azm-i- Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and -supported terrorism from the country,” the statement concluded.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
Yesterday, a statement issued by the ISPR had said that 14 terrorists had been killed in three separate intelligence-based IBOs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Balochistan’s Tank.
Earlier this week, security forces had killed seven terrorists in two separate operations in KP’s North Waziristan district.
President, PM laud forces for successful operation in Kalat
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the security forces for their successful operation against terrorists in Kalat, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The president, in his statement, said the state of Pakistan was “fully capable of taking enemies of peace to their end at all costs.”
He reiterated that the “resolve of the nation will foil every conspiracy of Fitna al Hindustan.”
In his statement, PM Shehbaz said security forces were “achieving great successes against terrorism under the vision of Azm-e-Istehkam.”
“The nation is united against terrorism and is determined to completely eradicate all forms of this menace from the country,” the report quoted him as saying.

According to a letter dated November 26 and addressed to Barrister Gohar, which is seen by Dawn, the PTI leader had written an application to the commission on November 13 regarding the inclusion of senators into the PTI.
While the letter did not elaborate on the matter raised by Barrister Gohar, he seemed to have sought the inclusion of those senators into his party who were elected to the upper house of Parliament from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly in July after much delay.
The ECP said in its letter that “after due deliberation, it was observed that the issue of intra-party election of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf is pending before the commission due to the stay order obtained by the party from the Lahore High Court (LHC)”.
“Hence, in the above circumstances, the commission is not in a position to accept you as chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf. Therefore, you do not have any locus standi, and you are informed, accordingly,” the letter read.
The PTI has held intra-party elections three times, but the initial two were voided by the commission. Following the third election, the PTI approached the LHC, which restrained the commission from issuing any final order in proceedings related to the intra-party polls.
On Saturday, Barrister Gohar also addressed the matter during a press conference, recalling that the last intra-party election of the PTI was held on March 3, 2024.
“We filed documentation pertaining to it, but there was no [confirmation of] acceptance by the election commission. Today, for the first time, I received the election commission’s letter in which they formally said that ‘we do not recognise you’. It is very unfortunate that they do not recognise the PTI,” he said.</p><small>2025-12-07 13:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637893-fo-rebuffs-indian-fms-highly-inflammatory-baseless-remarks-against-pakistan-army' target='_blank'><strong>FO rebuffs Indian FM's 'highly inflammatory, baseless remarks' against Pakistan Army</strong></a><br><p>

The FO’s condemnation came a day after Jaishankar alleged that India’s core challenges with its neighbouring country stemmed directly from Pakistan’s military establishment.
In its reaction to his remarks, the FO underscored that Pakistan was a responsible state, and all its institutions, including armed forces, were a pillar of national security, dedicated to safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country.







The FO’s statement also referred to a brief four-day conflict between India and Pakistan in May, saying that it “vividly demonstrated Pakistan armed forces’ professionalism as well as their resolve to defend the motherland and the people of Pakistan against any Indian aggression in a befitting, effective yet responsible manner”.
“No amount of propaganda can belie this truth,” the statement added.
It labelled attempts by the Indian leadership to defame Pakistan’s state institutions and its leadership as “part of a propaganda campaign designed to distract attention from India’s destabilising actions in the region and beyond, as well as state-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan”.
“Such incendiary rhetoric only exemplifies the extent of India’s disregard for amity, peace and stability in our region.”
The statement said that instead of making misleading remarks about the armed forces of Pakistan, “India must investigate the fascist and revisionist Hindutva ideology that has unleashed a reign of mob justice, lynchings, arbitrary detentions and demolition of properties and places of worship”.
Indian state and leadership both had become “hostage of this terror in the name of religion,” it added.
The statement further stressed that “Pakistan believes in co-existence, dialogue and diplomacy. However, it stands united and resolute in its intent and ability to safeguard its interests and sovereignty”.</p><small>2025-12-07 10:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/071431438ed8305.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959746/pakistan-to-sell-excess-gas-in-international-markets-from-january-1-petroleum-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to sell excess gas in international markets from January 1: petroleum minister</strong></a><br><p>Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik said on Sunday that Pakistan would begin selling excess liquefied natural gas (LNG) in international markets from January 1.
Malik’s statement during a press conference in Lahore came months after it was reported that Pakistan was exploring ways to sell excess LNG cargoes amid a gas supply glut that could cost domestic producers millions in annual losses.
He noted that Pakistan had been importing gas from “our friend” Qatar and Italian energy company Eni. But, he continued, there was an excess of this imported gas as the use of this fuel for power generation had reduced in the country during the past few months.
Resultantly, “we were compelled to divert it to domestic consumers, due to which circular debt was increasing in the gas sector”, he said, adding that it also caused a loss of around Rs1,000 billion to Pakistan from 2018-19 till now.
“From January 1, we will sell this excess fuel in international markets and reduce our burden while limiting the loss caused by it,” he added.
Moreover, he said, the measure would also allow Pakistan’s state-owned enterprises in the sector to operate on their full capacity and generate profit.
Last month, it was reported that Pakistan had struck a deal to cancel 21 LNG cargoes under its long-term contract with Eni as part of a plan to curb excess imports that have flooded its gas network. Meanwhile, sources also said that Pakistan was in talks with Qatar about gas supplies from the Gulf state, with options including deferring some cargoes or reselling them under existing contract clauses.
Foreign investment
During his press conference, Malik also outlined the expected investment in the petroleum sector by foreign companies.
He recalled that Turkiye’s energy minister had visited Pakistan recently and “after 20 years, Turkish Petroleum, in collaboration with Pakistani companies”, would be taking part in onshore and offshore exploration activities.
“Turkish Petroleum will also open its office in Islamabad, where 10 to 15 Turkish nationals will be working,” he said, adding that Pakistanis would also get employment there.
“We are moving towards decreasing our reliance on imported oil and gas,” the minister further stated.
He said a delegation of the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR) would be visiting Pakistan in the coming week, adding that it was also expected to collaborate with local companies for oil and gas exploration.
The minister said SOCAR was also opening its office in Pakistan. “It will also invest millions of dollars in the construction of an oil pipeline from Machike to Thalian in collaboration with the PSO (Pakistan State Oil) and FWO (Frontier Works Organisation).”
He said the pipeline’s construction would begin in a month or month and a half.
Malik said private fundraising of $3.5 billion for the Reko Diq project had been finalised, and now the banks were finalising the agreements. In addition, he said, local companies and Canadian mining giant Barrick Gold would invest more than $3.5bn in the project.
In total, $6-7bn would be invested in the first phase of the project, following which “you will see the face of Chaghi (the site of the project) changing”, he added.
The minister said Reko Diq’s signing ceremony was expected to take place in a month or two at the Prime Minister’s House.

A chain of tropical storms and monsoonal rains has battered Southeast and South Asia, setting off landslides, flooding vast tracts and cutting off communities from Sumatra island’s rainforests to the highland plantations of Sri Lanka.
At least 1,812 people have been killed in the natural disasters rolling across Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam over the past two weeks.
Indonesia’s president on Sunday vowed to step up aid, with demonstrators rallying after the country’s death toll surpassed 900.
More than two million people in Sri Lanka — nearly 10 per cent of the population — have been affected by last week’s floods and landslides triggered by Cyclone Ditwah, the worst on the island this century.
The Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said monsoon storms were adding more rain and making hillsides unstable, including in the central mountainous region and the north-western midlands.
Helicopters and planes were being used on Sunday to supply communities cut off by landslides in the centre of the country.
The Sri Lanka Air Force said it had received a planeload of relief supplies from Myanmar on Sunday, the latest batch of foreign aid.
The government has confirmed 618 dead — 464 from the lush tea-growing central region — while 209 people remain unaccounted for.
The number of people in state-run camps had dropped to 100,000 from a peak of 225,000 as floodwaters receded across the island by Sunday, the DMC said.
More than 75,000 homes were damaged, including close to 5,000 that were completely destroyed, it added.
‘Disaster tourism’
In Indonesia, President Prabowo Subianto on Sunday flew back to Sumatra’s hard-hit Aceh province, with a ministry saying his visit was “to ensure the acceleration of emergency response and recovery in affected areas”.
The Indonesian government has so far shrugged off calls to declare a national disaster, which would free up resources and help government agencies coordinate their response. The toll in Indonesia on Sunday remained at 916 dead, with 274 still missing.

 

Prabowo will also “monitor the distribution of aid, the evacuation process of residents, and measures to reopen road access,” the Ministry of the State Secretariat said.
“The government emphasises that the handling of the floods in Aceh is a national priority and all resources are being mobilised to expedite the recovery of community conditions,” it added in a statement.
Speaking shortly after arriving in the capital Banda Aceh, Prabowo promised that “we will put all our efforts into this, and later we will repair all the bridges, hopefully within one or two weeks”.
Many survivors said their greatest need remained clean drinking water.
Some victims accused the Indonesian leader and other officials of engaging in “disaster tourism” and failing to address the crisis.
“We see that, including Prabowo’s visit in Bireuen today, it seems like a disaster tourism trip,” said Syahrul, a 35-year-old protester in northern Aceh province.
“We don’t need officials to just observe. We need their presence to address the issues faced by the community,” Syahrul told AFP.
Protesters carried placards reading: “The Aceh disaster is not a tourist spot; it’s not enough for Prabowo to just take a stroll.” In Sri Lanka, the government unveiled a major compensation package on Friday to rebuild homes and revive businesses wiped out by the natural disaster, which hit the island as it was emerging from its 2022 economic meltdown.
A senior official earlier said recovery and reconstruction might cost up to $7 billion.
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday it was considering Sri Lanka’s request for an additional $200 million to help with rebuilding.
The money is on top of the $347 million tranche due later this month, part of a four-year, $2.9 billion IMF bailout loan agreed in 2023.
President Anura Kumara Dissanayake told parliament on Friday that Sri Lanka’s economy had made a significant recovery, but was not strong enough to withstand the latest shock alone.</p><small>2025-12-07 09:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637878-sngpl-issues-new-winter-gas-schedule-for-punjab-kp' target='_blank'><strong>SNGPL issues new winter gas schedule for Punjab, KP</strong></a><br><p>

According to the FO statement, President Subianto will arrive in Islamabad and will be accompanied by a high-level delegation comprising key ministers and senior officials.
“This will be President Prabowo’s first visit to Pakistan. The last presidential visit from Indonesia was undertaken by President Joko Widodo in 2018,” the statement said, adding that the upcoming visit carries added significance as it coincides with the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Indonesia.
During his stay, the statement said, President Prabowo will hold delegation-level talks with PM Shehbaz and meet President Asif Ali Zardari. Chief of Army Staff and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir will also call on President Prabowo, it added.
“The two sides will discuss a wide-ranging agenda aimed at further strengthening Pakistan-Indonesia relations and exploring new avenues of cooperation, including trade, investment, defence, health, IT, climate, education and culture, as well as enhancing collaboration at regional and global levels.”
The statement also said that several memoranda of understanding are expected to be signed during the visit.
It further stated: “Pakistan and Indonesia enjoy close, cordial and long-standing relations, underpinned by shared values and mutual interests. The visit of President Prabowo will provide an important opportunity to deepen bilateral ties and expand mutually beneficial cooperation, contributing to the continued growth and diversification of the partnership between the two countries.”</p><small>2025-12-07 07:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/637853-pti-leaders-admit-imrans-x-posts-against-military-sparked-isprs-strong-response' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leaders admit 'Imran's X posts against military sparked ISPR's strong response'</strong></a><br><p>

Parallel findings from UN monitoring teams and a Washington Post investigation indicate that some of these weapons have already filtered to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), strengthening a group responsible for escalating attacks inside Pakistan.
The 137-page report, released this week by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), recounts the scale of the two-decade American project to rebuild Afghanistan. Congress, it notes, provided roughly $144.7 billion between 2002 and 2021 to reconstruct the country and to support a democratic transition — “yet ultimately delivered neither.”
Recent UN assessments reinforce the regional implications of that failure. A UN panel reported that the Afghan Taliban continue providing logistical and operational support to the TTP, while the Washington Post has documented that dozens of US-origin weapons are now surfacing in Pakistan in the hands of terrorists targeting the state.

 

SIGAR attributes part of this spillover to the abrupt loss of visibility after the Taliban takeover in Afghanistan. “Due to the Taliban takeover, SIGAR was unable to inspect any of the equipment provided to, or facilities constructed for, the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) following the Afghan government’s collapse,” the report states.
The US Department of Defence, however, has confirmed that approximately $7.1bn worth of American-provided equipment was left behind — including thousands of vehicles, hundreds of thousands of small arms, night-vision devices and more than 160 aircraft.
The consequences of this transfer are already manifesting in Pakistan.
According to the Washington Post, serial numbers of at least 63 seized weapons inside Pakistan match those originally supplied by Washington to Afghan forces. The Washington Post report cited Pakistani officials as saying that some of these rifles and carbines are “significantly superior” to the weaponry commonly used by TTP fighters before 2021.
UN monitoring reports echo this concern. The 36th Monitoring Report (2025) estimates that the TTP maintains a force of around 6,000 fighters spread across Ghazni, Helmand, Kandahar, Kunar, Uruzgan, and Zabul provinces of Afghanistan, and shares training facilities with Al Qaeda.
Addressing the UN Security Council, Denmark’s deputy permanent representative Sandra Jensen Landi said the TTP continues to receive “logistical and substantial support from the de facto authorities” in Kabul.
Earlier UN reports detailed Taliban-provided guesthouses, weapons permits, movement authorisations, and immunity from arrest for TTP leaders — arrangements that have allowed the group to entrench itself deeper in Afghan territory. SIGAR’s own quarterly reports for 2025 cite a string of cross-border attacks, including an assault in South Waziristan that killed 16 Pakistani security personnel.
SIGAR’s final review also revisits the scale — and the futility — of US investment in Afghanistan’s security sector. Between 2002 and June 2025, Washington obligated $31.2bn for ANDSF infrastructure, transportation, and equipment. The US purchased 96,000 ground vehicles, more than 427,000 weapons, 17,400 night-vision devices, and at least 162 aircraft for Afghan forces. As of July 2021, just before the then-Afghan government collapsed, the Afghan Air Force still had 131 operational US-supplied aircraft — virtually all of which are now under Taliban control, according to the report.
Another $11.5bn funded construction of bases, headquarters, and training facilities across Afghanistan, most of which are now either controlled by the Taliban or completely inaccessible to US inspectors, it says.
The report concludes that America’s ambition to build a stable and democratic Afghanistan was hamstrung from the outset by flawed assumptions and misaligned partnerships. Early US decisions to back “corrupt, human-rights-abusing powerbrokers,” SIGAR argues, undermined governance, fuelled insurgent recruitment, and gradually hollowed out the institutions the US was trying to build. The watchdog estimates that $26–29.2bn was lost to waste, fraud, and abuse.
The human cost was far greater. Tens of thousands of Afghans and more than 2,450 US service members were killed, only for the Taliban regime to be restored — and now strengthened by the very equipment the US spent years procuring for its adversaries, it adds.
Despite the collapse, the United States has remained Afghanistan’s single largest donor, having disbursed more than $3.83 billion in humanitarian and development assistance since August 2021 — underscoring Washington’s continued struggle to balance humanitarian obligations with security fears.
As SIGAR ends its mandate after nearly two decades, the final report offers a sobering warning. The Afghanistan experience, it concludes, should serve as a cautionary tale for any future effort to rebuild fragile states on a massive scale — a failure whose ripple effects are now reshaping the security landscape of the wider region.</p><small>2025-12-07 06:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/071131269ccd240.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1959611/13-europe-bound-passengers-offloaded-in-faisalabad-over-suspicious-umrah-plan' target='_blank'><strong>13 Europe-bound passengers offloaded in Faisalabad over suspicious Umrah plan</strong></a><br><p>TOBA TEK SINGH: The Faisalabad FIA immigration officials have offloaded 13 passengers, including three women, who were illegally traveling to Europe on the pretext of Umrah.
