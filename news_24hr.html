The Long March-2F rocket carrying Shenzhou-22 lifted off shortly after midday from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in northwest China, footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed.
Shenzhou-22 was originally slated for a crewed launch in 2026. But it was launched early after a suspected space debris strike to the Shenzhou-20 return capsule made it unsafe for re-entry to Earth, leaving its crew briefly stranded.
 






The Shenzhou-20 team returned aboard Shenzhou-21 on November 14 — nine days later than planned — leaving their relief crew without a reliable return vehicle.
Recent Shenzhou missions have been used to crew China’s Tiangong space station, exchanging teams of three astronauts every six months.
The accelerated launch ensures Shenzhou-21 astronauts Zhang Lu, Wu Fei, and Zhang Hongzhang have a safe return option.
The three were “working normally and in good condition”, the China Manned Space Agency said on Monday before the Shenzhou-22 launch.
China is the third nation to put humans in orbit after the United States and the former Soviet Union. It has been excluded from the International Space Station since 2011, when the US banned Nasa from collaborating with Beijing.
It has since sought to bring other countries into its efforts and signed a deal with Pakistan in February to recruit the first foreign “taikonauts” — a term used for astronauts in China’s space programme.</p><small>2025-11-25 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/25102921c42777b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957260/pindi-police-say-3-arrested-after-video-of-girls-hair-being-forcibly-cut-goes-viral-on-social-media' target='_blank'><strong>Pindi police say 3 arrested after video of girl’s hair being forcibly cut goes viral on social media</strong></a><br><p>Rawalpindi police have stated that three suspects have been arrested after a harrowing video of a girl’s hair being forcibly cut went viral on social media.
The video, which has been making the rounds on social media since Tuesday, shows a man standing over what appears to be a young girl and cutting her hair with a pair of scissors while others in the background watch.
Subsequently, another video also surfaced on social media, purportedly of the victim, in which she alleged that the incident occurred one-and-a-half months ago in Rawalpindi’s Christian Colony. She also alleged that she was beaten and threatened, adding that four men were involved in the incident.
In a statement early on Tuesday, Rawalpindi police commented on the incident. The statement referred to the victim as a “girl”.
“A video of a girl being beaten and her hair being cut has come forward, after which a video statement also came forward,” the statement said.
The incident took place in Rawalpindi and Islamabad a month and a half ago, the statement said, adding that it was not reported to the police earlier.
It went on to say that the Rawalpindi City Police Officer (CPO) Syed Khalid Hamdani had taken notice of the incident, adding that police had gotten in touch with the girl in the video.
“Legal action is being taken at her request at the Naseerabad Police Station,” it said.
“Three accused have been taken into custody in light of the victim’s statement,” the statement added.
It said that crimes pertaining to violence, coercion and exploitation of women would not be tolerated.
“All the accused involved in the incident will be arrested and punished to the fullest extent of the law,” the statement quoted the Rawalpindi CPO as saying.
 






Last night, Islamabad police also commented on the incident, saying that it had taken place in Rawalpindi and not in the capital’s Lohi Bher area as was being reported.
“Islamabad police have traced the girl and have recorded her statement,” it said. Police further said that they had “conducted raids” and taken those involved into custody.
“However, since the incident took place in Rawalpindi, the suspects are being handed over to the police concerned,” it added.

The 27th Amendment burns it</strong></a><br><p>The promulgation of the 27th Amendment marks a moment of unmistakable constitutional rupture in Pakistan. For the first time, the Supreme Court has found its writ substantially curtailed.
The jurisdiction to enforce fundamental rights and to pronounce upon the central questions of our constitutional order has been transferred elsewhere, leaving the once apex court — the ultimate sentinel of our basic freedoms — ‘supreme’ largely only in name.
Yet, this is not the first time our subcontinent has grappled with the creation of a federal court.
For an all-India federation
In 1935, the British Parliament enacted the Government of India Act. Among its many innovations, it established a federal court for the nascent Indian federation. It provided, for the first time, a higher court within India to hear certain appeals from the high courts.
But the new court’s remit was intentionally narrow: its concern lay with disputes arising from the architecture of the federation itself; from the allocation of powers between the centre, the provinces, and the princely states. It had no role in enforcing fundamental rights, for none existed in a justiciable form, and it remained subordinate to the Privy Council in the UK, which retained the final word.
The impulse for a federal court was rooted in the ambition to create an all-India federation in the 1930s. The idea was shaped at the Indian Round Table Conferences held between 1930 and 1932, where delegates from British India and the Indian States gathered to chart a path towards self-government.

The conferences followed the Simon Commission Report of 1930, a document notable both for its diagnosis — that any meaningful constitutional settlement must include the Indian states — and for the controversy it provoked, owing to the absence of any Indian representation at the commission itself.
The Muslim League and the Congress rejected it. Nehru countered with his own report but failed to address the demands of Muslims, so Jinnah advanced his Fourteen Points, in which federalism, provincial autonomy, minority safeguards, and the treatment of the States formed recurring themes.
At the time, the high courts of India were, for most practical purposes, the final judicial authorities in their provinces. There was no apex court within India; only the distant Privy Council stood above them. It was therefore natural that, when the first Roundtable Conference convened in late 1930, the question of a supreme court, or at least some kind of federal court, should arise.
Although the discussion was preliminary, Lord John Sankey, the Lord Chancellor, observed that any federal constitution must have at its centre a federal court, as was the case in Canada, Australia, and the United States.
 
 

The real work took place at the second Roundtable Conference in 1931 within the Federal Structure Committee. Here, the delegates concurred that a new court was needed to manage disputes inherent in federal design and to interpret the new constitution.
Opinions diverged on whether this new body should also assume the mantle of a supreme court for ordinary appeals. Some wished to fold all appellate functions into a single institution; others preferred a more cautious approach, starting with a federal court of limited jurisdiction. The discussions, spread over several meetings, circled the twin questions of scope and composition.
Political necessity
Jinnah, during these sessions, played the part of the measured inquirer. His interventions reveal a statesman preoccupied with the fragile architecture of an all-India federation. He made clear that “the question” which they had to approach was one “which must be approached from a very different point of view … for the simple reason that we are proceeding now on the basis of all-India Federation”.
His principal concern was the position of the princely states, which resisted any arrangement that would permit their ordinary cases to be appealed to a federal court. As he pointed out, a court with broad appellate jurisdiction would be one to which “one third of India does not submit”. Yet, Jinnah added that he personally favoured a supreme court, and had done so since the early 1920s, when the issue was debated in the Legislative Assembly. He said:
“[P]ersonally, I have no hesitation in saying that I have always been a supporter of the Supreme Court, and I have always maintained that it is high time that we had a Supreme Court in British India. The question has been debated more than once since 1921, and even before that it was discussed, and we pressed in the Legislature more than once that a Supreme Court should be established; but then we were contemplating a very different state of things; we were then confining our attention only to British India, and the question did not present itself in that difficult aspect which it now bears”.
It is here that Jinnah’s strategy becomes unmistakable. His preference for a federal court with narrow, constitution-specific jurisdiction was not born of constitutional philosophy but of political necessity. He understood that the Indian states would refuse to join a federation if it meant subjecting themselves to a general appellate court.
 
 

Thus, the limited federal court was a temporary accommodation, a means of keeping the States at the table long enough for a federation to take shape. In reality, his goal remained unchanged: an Indian supreme court that would ultimately replace the Privy Council and exercise the full range of appellate and constitutional jurisdiction befitting a sovereign people.
This becomes clearer as the Committee’s debates matured. Jinnah submitted that the federal court should initially be confined to exercising “only original jurisdiction” over constitutional questions so as not to jeopardise the larger federal settlement:
“You may be startled when I say that you have to divide this thing into three parts, and keep them separate. I would suggest that we should start with the Federal Court on the hypothesis that we have solved this conundrum of all-India Federation, and confine ourselves to giving jurisdiction to the Federal Court only in matters relating to the constitution and arising out of the constitution.”
The ultimate objective
But he immediately tied this limited beginning to a much broader future. He articulated a clear, sequential vision: first a narrow federal court; then a full supreme court with the same civil appellate jurisdiction as the Privy Council; then, in time, the addition of criminal appellate jurisdiction; and ultimately, an apex court to which even the Indian states would voluntarily accede.
His words are unmistakable: “let us develop the idea of a separate Supreme Court having the same jurisdiction as the Privy Council has now, and, in the course of time, that Supreme Court may succeed in attracting the attention of the Indian States…”
Towards the end of the Committee’s work, Jinnah emphasised that the separation between a federal court and a supreme court was a temporary necessity, an accommodation to the peculiarities of federal formation. Ultimately, he insisted, India ought to aspire to its own supreme court, as other dominions had done.
 
 

No nation, he observed, should remain permanently tethered to the Privy Council.
“Above all, Sir, I cannot understand why India should not aspire to its own Supreme Court. Other Dominions have got it. There can, therefore, be no question as to the necessity and as to the justice of this; and accordingly, I say that we should have a Supreme Court. … I am only prepared to agree to this separation in view of the idea of an all-India Federation, apart from which our task would have been much easier.”
Although the Roundtable Conferences faltered on larger political questions, the idea of a federal court survived. It was endorsed in the British government’s subsequent white paper, examined by the Joint Committee of Parliament, and carried into the Government of India Act, 1935.
The committee, wary of jurisdictional overlap, postponed the creation of a supreme court, though it recommended that the federal legislature retain the power to enhance the federal court’s jurisdiction in time. This became the basis of the Supreme Court of Pakistan in the 1956 Constitution, with an extended jurisdiction to enforce fundamental rights and hear ordinary appeals arising from the high courts.
Jinnah’s accommodation in favour of a narrowly drawn federal court during the Roundtable Conferences was therefore a transient one, adopted only to secure the federation; the ultimate objective, to which he returned repeatedly, was the establishment of a true supreme court.
His proposals reveal a statesman intent on building durable institutions suited to the realities of a diverse subcontinent at the time. He was motivated by the ideal to create unity and build long-lasting, sustainable institutions — not to tear down existing ones.

CM Shah described the remarks as “a historically illiterate and diplomatically reckless statement”.
In a post on X, formerly Twitter, he wrote: “Sindh chose to separate from the Bombay Presidency in 1936, even before the Partition of Pakistan, because the people of Sindh sought autonomy, dignity and their own political identity. Sindh is an integral, inseparable part of Pakistan — yesterday, today, and forever.”
 






CM Shah advised India’s defence minister to focus “on his own country’s internal divisions instead of daydreaming about ours”.
Meanwhile, Ms Rehman said that India’s defence minister’s comments are “provocative, revisionist, and deeply irresponsible”, reflecting a dangerous pattern of rhetoric that undermines regional stability and violates internationally recognised norms governing state sovereignty.
 






She noted that such statements were not just factually baseless but also expose an alarming escalation in expansionist Hindutva narrative within India that has no place in responsible statecraft.
“The Indian Defence Minister’s remarks on Sindh are not only offensive, but expose an aversion or ignorance of history that borders on self-sabotage,” she said.
It may be recalled that India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had in a recent speech said that although Sindh is not part of India today, borders can change in the future and Sindh may return to India.

A statement by the ISPR said that security forces conducted the IBO on Monday, based on the reported presence of khawarij belonging to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“During the conduct of the operation, own troops effectively engaged the khawarij location and after an intense fire exchange, 22 khawarij were sent to hell,” the statement said.
It added that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists in the area.
The ISPR also said that the counter-terrorism campaign by security forces and law enforcement agencies would continue with full pace to “wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to the security forces for the successful operation, saying that they were achieving “major successes” against terrorism under the vision of Azm-i-Istehkam.
“The entire nation stands with Pakistan’s armed forces in the war against terrorism,” the PM said. “We are determined to completely eradicate all kinds of terrorism from the country.”
 






Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The latest in the string of terror incidents is a suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary’s (FC) headquarters in Peshawar yesterday morning, in which three FC men were martyred and 12 injured.
The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage.
The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered.
According to the state-run APP, initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals.</p><small>2025-11-25 05:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/250841314285aa2.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957247/pakistan-carried-out-strikes-in-afghanistan-claims-taliban-spokesman' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan carried out strikes in Afghanistan, claims Taliban spokesman</strong></a><br><p>Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesman for the Taliban government in Afghanistan, claimed on Tuesday that Pakistan had carried out overnight strikes in the neighbouring country.
In a post on social media platform X, he said that Pakistan had “bombed” Khost province, and carried out air strikes in Kunar and Paktika provinces.
No official statement has been issued by Pakistan thus far.
The strike was reported the same day a deadly suicide attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar had intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Ankara stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul in November.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.
Subsequently, Turkiye announced that its top officials would visit Pakistan to discuss tensions between Islamabad and Kabul. Pakistan welcomed Ankara and Doha’s “sincere efforts” on Nov 14, but the delegation’s arrival is still awaited, amid reports of complexities in the process.
Last week, the Foreign Office (FO) said that the resumption of trade with Afghanistan depended on the Taliban regime ending cross-border terrorism, and also linked the fate of key regional energy projects to Kabul halting its support for terrorist groups.</p><small>2025-11-25 05:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635371-security-forces-eliminate-22-india-backed-terrorists-in-bannu-ibo' target='_blank'><strong>Security forces eliminate 22 India-backed terrorists in Bannu IBO</strong></a><br><p>

His plan was to showcase the acclaimed calisthenics of Indian Air Force’s largely homegrown if acrimoniously delayed light combat aircraft Tejas before a global audience at the Dubai Air Show last week. Fate had other plans. The Tejas fell silent as it dove to the ground during an aerobatic manoeuvre killing Syal in the horrific fireball it became.
Things go wrong when least expected. The Titanic comes to mind. Another example is of Yuri Gagarin, the hero of our world of science and wonder, the first man to go into outer space in 1959. The Soviet cosmonaut died eight years later when the MiG-15 he was flying with a co-pilot in a test flight crashed in bad weather. For the Tejas, it was the second crash in 20 months, but the pilot had bailed out safely then. The high-profile Apollo disasters showed the best technology can be flawed. All three astronauts perished in the 1967 fire in a pre-launch test of Apollo-1. The Apollo-13 accident on the other hand happened in outer space, but miraculously no lives were lost.
 
 

Syal’s tragedy prodded a gentle side of the human spirit when deeply felt tributes started coming from across the border to the fallen Indian. One heartwarming letter published on Indian social media apparently from a Pakistani well-wisher is the kind of stuff that helps tone down the toxicity unleashed on both sides by the short and bitter military stand-off in May between the two countries.

Syal’s tragedy prodded a gentle side of the human spirit when deeply felt tributes started coming from across the border.

“To the Indian Air Force, to the family now navigating an ocean of absence: I offer what words can never carry — condolence wrapped in understanding that only those who’ve worn wings can truly know. A pilot has not merely fallen. A guardian of impossible altitudes has been summoned home. Somewhere tonight, a uniform hangs unworn. Somewhere, a child asks when the father returns. Somewhere, the sky itself feels emptier.” This letter from Pakistan was shared online by Sabrang India, an NGO that works for human rights and communal harmony in South Asia.
Among the grieving recipients would be Syal’s wife Afshan, herself an IAF officer. The condolence message reflected a sense of empathy from across the borders. It slammed the loutishness that passes for patriotic fervour between the two countries.
The letter purportedly from a PAF veteran could not be completely ascertained for authenticity, but such sentiments are not unknown to exist in India and Pakistan and occasionally do carry the day on both sides.
There is palpable moping in the Indian media about the likelihood of business loss from the second consecutive crash of Tejas in 20 months. This is the kind of stuff that makes the soul cringe. I had a similar experience working with a Western news agency when the Rwanda massacres were happening. The news of daily gory killings had become smaller than a single column weather insert. Then one day, the stringer in Kigali filed a story about how the massacres were negatively impacting Rwanda’s coffee crop. The bells at the New York Stock Exchange went wild, and the news agency’s stringer was publicly praised as a role model.
Britain’s fabled Red Arrows flying heroes have been involved in several flight accidents, but did we ever hear of the Hawk T1 jet losing money in the bargain? Red Arrows lost Flt Lt Jon Egging in 2011. Egging’s Hawk T1 jet crashed after a display at the Bournemouth Air Festival, leading to the determination that G-force impairment may have contributed to the crash. There is speculation that a similar roller-coaster-like impairment may have visited Syal, which comes with sharp acceleration against gravity. Cpl Bayliss died in 2018 when his plane crashed at RAF Valley shortly after take-off during a faux engine failure manoeuvre as the pilot Flt Lt David Stark ejected safely.
The Wire carried a troubling report on the problems India has faced in defence manufacturing and vending hardware to foreign buyers. “The Tejas crash inevitably revives memories of an earlier disastrous export venture: the sale of its seven Dhruv Advanced Light Helicopters (ALHs) to Ecuador in 2008-2009 for $42.5 million, of which four crashed,” wrote well-regarded defence analyst Rahul Bedi. “These crashes eventually led to the Ecuador Air Force (EAF) terminating its ALH contract with HAL in October 2015, in a major setback to what was then the first ever major export of an indigenous military platform.”
If money is really a concern, then a great tribute to Syal’s death could be a national call for total transparency in arms deals that Indian governments have become so brazenly infamous for.
Instead, Syal’s death has set off a frantic search for someone to blame. The official inquiry hasn’t begun, but the more nationalist TV discussants on Indian channels are blaming the US for allegedly selling Indian Air Force inferior engines used in Tejas.
At a human level, Syal’s death and the heart-tugging tributes pouring in for him can be seen as a reminder that people-to-people ties deserve to be placed at the heart of promoting a nicer, friendlier future for both countries. Let that be the essence of what the letter said in its tribute to the Indian pilot.

Given the vast experience of dealing with survivors of terror attacks, LRH recently organised training wherein healthcare professionals from Karachi, Lahore and other cities were imparted training in mass emergencies.
LRH, the 1,800-bed oldest hospital of the province, has the first-ever emergency specialist due to which the level of mortalities from the terror strikes is very low.
“During the last few years, we have handled 320 mass emergencies including suicide and bomb attacks. We treated affected persons with fractured bones, head and chest injuries and multiple wounds. The ratio of deaths remained extremely low because our staff has mastered the art of lifesaving procedures,” LRH spokesman Mohammad Asim told Dawn.
According to him, more than 600 staffers, including doctors, nurses and paramedics have been deployed in addition to radiologists, pathologists and cardiologists and other consultants in accident and emergency department of the hospital to make it sure that people receive services during ‘golden hour’ –the critical 60-minute period after a traumatic injury when a patient’s chances of survival are the highest with prompt medical attention.

Spokesperson says 10 injured were treated effectively at the hospital after attack on FC headquarters

“So, our doctors are well-trained to make prompt decision in first hour about patients. LRH is the only hospital where basic life support and mass emergency preparedness, advanced cardiac life support and other trainings are happening on regular basis. Traditionally, our staff, even not on duty, rushes to the hospital to support lifesaving efforts,” said Mr Asim.
He said that emergency department of the hospital had consultants round the clock. “Recently, we started collaboration with American Heart Association and partnership with ICRC for scaling up emergency response as a regular feature,” he added.
He said that the hospital could manage 300 patients simultaneously. LRH is the first priority of patients as people are rushed to it not only from sites of terror attacks in Peshawar but from every nook and corner of the province.
“On Monday, we received 10 wounded persons from the suicide attack at Federal Constabulary’s headquarters in Peshawar. They were treated effectively,” he said.
Mr Asim said that more often people from manmade or natural disasters were brought to the hospital with multiple wounds. “They are given first aid in emergency and subsequently shifted to orthopaedic, neuro-surgery, general surgery and other wards for proper medication,” he said. He said that after every attack, most patients were sent home after their recovery with the advice for follow-ups while some remained for their surgeries and reconstruction procedures at general surgery and plastic surgery units of the hospital.
“None of the injured persons are referred outside because the hospital has all specialties with more than two-decade experience,” he said. He also appreciated the people, who donated blood on every occasion due to which the hospital had enough stock that was transfused to patients. Mr Asim said that senior doctors in LRH were getting invitations from organisers of international seminars and symposiums where they shared their experiences regarding management of trauma patients.
A doctor at the emergency department of the hospital said that first they carried out priority surgical procedures and stoppage of bleeding and later focused on other issues of blast victims.
He said emergency department was headed by trauma specialist where all the facilities including operation theatres, blood bank, pharmacy, CT scan, ultrasound and X-ray machines and pathology were available under one roof and patients received implants, blood and surgical disposable free of cost.
“The endless wave of terrorism in the province resulted in huge destruction and killing of security people but at the same time we have upgraded facilities and skills of health professionals to manage trauma incidents effectively,” he said.

But boy, would she have turned out to be right! May onwards, it seems as if the government — and others in the vicinity — can do no wrong.
Islamabad (and Pindi) seemed to have been gifted with the Midas touch. Pushed into a conflict with India, it came out on top with an air combat that is being discussed around the world. The number of planes that Pakistan shot down is a topic no one can get enough of. But this wasn’t all. Even the communications battle was won hands down. And since then, there has been no looking back.
This was followed with a romance with the US that no one had predicted. There was a one-on-one lunch at the White House and then a few months later a meeting at the Oval Office where both the field marshal and the prime minister were present. And before, during and after these meetings, the US president can’t stop praising the country and its military leadership. Some put it down to the decision to nominate Donald Trump for the Nobel or give him credit for the cessation of hostilities in South Asia or lobbying. Regardless, it now appears to be a match made in heaven.
Along with this came warmer relations with the Middle East and respect that perhaps had been missing in the past few years. Pakistan now has a seat at the table in the Middle East, whether on discussions on Gaza or in relations with Iran — and also thanks to the Saudi-Pak defence pact, which has ears wagging everywhere.
If this weren’t enough, the government has been managing the IMF programme well enough so that no one fears any delays or any calls to ‘do more’ from the Fund. The missions visit Pakistan and leave without any major hiccups in terms of expectations or conditionalities, compared to the mess back in 2022.

Foreign policy miracles and numerous trips abroad still haven’t yielded the awaited manna.

And now there are no local challenges either. Legislation has taken care of all else. In the rest of the world, they may have forcible conversions but in Islamabad, we have forcible consensus, which allowed for the 26th and 27th Amendments to the Constitution. ‘Pesky’ judges have been reined in and the entire judiciary defanged with the government in charge. If this weren’t enough, immunity was granted to the president and field marshal. The opposition is now in jail or disqualified. If someone still wants to be a troublemaker, Peca is there to the rescue. Even reporting or commenting on cricket can get one in trouble. Journalists have taken note.
 
 

Is there anything left for Santa Claus to bring for the inhabitants of Constitution Avenue and Pindi?
But for those gossiping in the drawing rooms in Islamabad, there is one question left unanswered. The great foreign policy miracle and the innumerable trips abroad still have not yielded the manna from the skies that is anxiously being awaited. For the well-heeled, foreign policy success is not entirely a success if it doesn’t bring foreign rents for the state and good times for the former. This also allows them to let the vulnerable breathe.
So be it a lunch at the White House, or the defence pact with Saudi Arabia, or rumours about troops for Gaza, the relevant press release is scanned minutely for mention of aid, assistance or any such word that holds out the promise that the dollars-are-a-comin’. But so far, the press releases have let us all down.
As a result, ministers wax lyrical about foreign policy successes and point at the plane flying over, carrying the PM or the FM or the DPM to the next trip but the ordinary citizens get easily distracted by the grocery bill or the latest message from FBR. The more generous and patriotic among the citizenry may even have felt happy that government officials could burn jet fuel for Pakistan’s success and worldwide fame, although the former could barely pay the monthly petrol bill. The rulers can make pit stops in London while the ruled cannot even fly from Karachi to Lahore. But it’s all about loving your country. For another, who woke up to the news of another attack in the nearby town, the debate over whether Pakistan shot down five planes or six by an American publication may also not bring much joy.
The government ignores this just as some of us ignore the pressure of the ever-increasing waistline on the hapless button. Easy to do especially as the press/ media has also been reined in through hook and by crook and compelled to avoid the real stories out there. Be it the crisis in the agricultural sector, or the export and import of sugar or the whispers about corruption matters, few in the journalistic community are going to run with this.
But a government of boomer uncles trying to adopt a Gen Z philosophy of ‘delulu is the solulu’ will eventually end up like Joe Biden. By the time it will fall apart, no one will be interested in their side of the story, while dumping all the blame on them. More importantly, like Biden, they also have a narrow window to take decisions. After that, it will be too late.
And by this, I don’t mean they need to retire in time. But that if they don’t manage to improve the life quality of those paying the taxes and struggling with no purchasing power or get a handle on militancy, the photo ops abroad and foreign policy successes will be hard to wax lyrical about. Without improving the economy and addressing militancy, the successes in the air, the constitutional amendments and by-election wins will soon outlive their efficacy. The party is not going to last forever.
The writer is a journalist.

With its main rival, the PTI, largely absent from the lacklustre contest, its victory, at least in Punjab, which it has dominated for the better part of the last four decades, was a foregone conclusion.
What was surprising, however, is that the party still felt compelled to deploy the state machinery to allegedly manipulate results for inflating its votes in many constituencies. The PML-N’s victory is real; but the method allegedly employed to construct a narrative of reclaimed popularity makes it questionable, even if it does not totally discredit this success. A victory that requires the absence of a credible opponent from the contest and a suspect voting process is without substance.
On its part, the PTI has done itself or democracy no service by staying away from the process. With the viewpoint that certain quarters would not in any case let it win the polls prevailing in its rank and file, its decision was apparently influenced by the persecution of the party and its leadership and the way it was denied its mandate in the February 2024 elections. Nonetheless, the boycott of the by-election meant serving the national and provincial seats it had won then on a platter to its rival.
 
 

More importantly, the PTI missed a huge opportunity to mobilise its popular support by conducting a rigorous campaign for its candidates. Any crackdown on its support base would have further exposed its opponents. Late PPP leader Benazir Bhutto had for years regretted the decision to give an open field to pro-Zia forces by boycotting the 1985 party-less elections. The PTI may also regret its decision unless it is still banking on a break-up between the ruling PML-N and the powers that be.
While its ‘overwhelming’ victory has delivered the PML-N a simple majority in the National Assembly and freed it from its dependence on its coalition partners for legislative changes, the by-polls have killed whatever little hope the PPP had of regaining some ground it has lost in Punjab over the past decade and a half. The only provincial seat from which it has returned its candidate is the one that was doled out in Muzaffargarh by the PML-N. That its coalition partner refused to accommodate the PPP in D.G. Khan underscores that it wants not just the PTI out of its way in Punjab but also its coalition partner which will continue to exist on the margins in the province in the foreseeable future.
In short, it is not just that major political parties have lost something on the weekend; democracy too has emerged as a loser in the process.

The decision was made during a meeting, chaired by the prime minister, during which proposals from a dedicated working group were reviewed. Among the key recommendations was the removal of the EDS to ease pressure on the export sector and strengthen its global competitiveness.
An official announcement from the Prime Minister’s Secretariat said that the premier has directed the immediate abolition of the EDS imposed on domestic exports. He also directed the review of the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan for reforms and its revamp.
Earlier, the premier had constituted a dedicated Working Group on the Export Development Surcharge (EDS), led by convener Musadaq Zulqarnain. The group included private sector members Shahzad Saleem, Misbah Naqvi, Khurram Mukhtar, Arif Saeed, Ahmad Umair, and Sualeh Faruqi. State Minister for Finance Bilal Azhar Kiyani and Secretary Commerce Jawad Paul were also part of the group.

Directs EDF money must be spent on boosting competitiveness of Pakistani goods on world markets

The terms of reference (TORs) of the group were to evaluate the efficacy of existing projects under the Export Development Fund (EDF) and propose measures to enhance the competitiveness of Pakistan’s exporters. After extensive deliberations and consensus-building, the Working Group submitted its recommendations to the Prime Minister last week.
PM Shehbaz issued special directives for a third-party audit of the EDF for the past five years, in accordance with international standards. He emphasised that the fund must be utilised to enhance domestic exports, support related research and development, provide skill training to the sector’s workforce, and provide world-class facilities. He added that any irrelevant or unjustified use of the fund would not be tolerated.
It was also decided that an interim steering committee, led by the private sector, will be constituted to ensure that the Rs52 billion currently available in the EDF is allocated strictly to projects that directly contribute to export enhancement. The projects should be carried out solely for R&D and skill development, and no money should be spent on infrastructure.
The matter of excessive taxation on exports was also raised during the meeting. It was highlighted that the effective tax burden on exporters is currently much higher than on domestic businesses.
Another Working Group, under the convenorship of Shahzad Saleem, has already submitted its recommendations on the tax burden on the export sector.The premier also instructed that a competent private sector chairman be appointed to ensure the optimal use of the fund’s available resources.
He resolved to promote and market Pakistan’s export products worldwide. He emphasised that providing maximum support to industrialists to enhance domestic exports is one of the government’s top priorities.

GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly completed its five-year tenure on Monday at midnight. During the final session, held here on Monday in the GB Assembly Hall and chaired by Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate, members passed a dozen bills, including one related to the management of adventure tourism, by majority vote. They also unanimously approved two resolutions.
The assembly passed 12 bills, including the GB Tourism Adventure Tourism Management Bill 2025 and the GB Tobacco Control Bill.
The house also unanimously approved a resolution demanding the regularisation of Rescue 1122 and local council contractual employees.
Speaking on the occasion, GB Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate said the democratic process in the region began later than in other parts of the country.
“We are in an evolutionary phase. GB Assembly members are elected by the public, and over the past five years, lawmakers have attempted to solve problems faced by the public,” he said.

He noted that it had been difficult to conduct assembly proceedings in a natural manner.
GB Minister Abdul Hameed told the house that education and health issues remained serious, and that the region could progress only by developing its tourism sector.
Speaking on the occasion, Advocate Amjad Hussain, assembly member and PPP GB chapter president, said the assembly had completed its five-year tenure today.
He added that the members tried to fulfil the responsibilities entrusted to them by the public through legislation and practical measures.
Five-year background
The GB Assembly elections were held on Nov 15, 2020 across 24 constituencies. The PTI formed the government, and Khalid Khurshid was elected chief minister.
However, in July 2023, the GB Chief Court disqualified CM Khurshid. Subsequently, a coalition government was formed by members of the PTI disgruntled group, the PPP, and the PML-Nawaz, which elected Haji Gulbar Khan as the new chief minister of the region.
According to Abbas Ali, deputy director information for the house, the assembly adopted 63 Acts during its five-year tenure, including one pertaining to land reforms as well as six federal ones.
The GB Assembly passed 114 resolutions on various issues, including a demand that the federal government declare Gilgit-Baltistan a provisional province of Pakistan.
Later, GB Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed Advocate hosted a farewell event for all outgoing assembly members.
Caretaker CM
According to a statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office, PM Shehbaz, being the “Gilgit-Baltistan Council chairman, has appointed retired Justice Yar Muhammad as the caretaker GB chief minister, “in terms of Article 48-A(2) of the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan Order, 2018”.
It added that caretaker GB chief minister “shall take oath before entering upon the office in the form set out in the First Schedule of the Government of Gilgit-Baltistan Order, 2018”.
Under the GB Order 2018, elections must be held within 60 days. The GB chief minister, the opposition leader, and the Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan federal minister are required to agree on a single name for the caretaker chief minister.
“If we cannot agree on one name, the proposed names will be sent to the prime minister, who, as chairman of the GB Council, has the discretion to nominate any suitable person for the position,” Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam told Dawn recently.

It was the sixth attack on the Jaffar Express bet­ween Quetta and Sibi during the past one and a half months.
Railway officials said the Jaffar Express depar­ted Quetta for its destination, Peshawar, on schedule, and after crossing Mach station, when it rea­ched near Aab-i-Gum, ar­­med men opened fire on the train from the nearby mountains.
Security personnel, in­­cluding Railways Police tr­­­avelling on the train, im­mediately retaliated and returned fire. How­ever, after a brief exch­an­­ge, the assailants escaped from the area.
Railway officials said all bogies of the Jaffar Express remained safe in the armed attack. “No cas­ualty was reported in the shooting and all passengers travelling on the train remained safe,” a senior railway official said.
He said the train was stopped after the firing in­­cident and later procee­ded to its next destination after security clearance. Security on the railway track was tightened following the armed attack on the train.
The Jaffar Express has been facing continuous attacks, including a bomb blast on the railway track between Quetta and Jacobabad.

Nations sealed a modest agreement at the UN climate summit in the Brazilian Amazon on Saturday as many countries swallowed weaker terms on a fossil fuel phaseout to preserve unity.
The agreement calls on countries to voluntarily “accelerate” their climate action, but only with an implicit nod to phasing out fossil fuels.
 
 

In an address to the UN’s business and human rights forum in Geneva, UN rights chief Volker Turk warned that the “meagre results of COP30 in Belem” illustrated how “corporate power imbalances … play out in the climate emergency”.
“The fossil fuel industry is generating massive profits while devastating some of the poorest communities and countries in the world,” he said. “There needs to be proper accountability for this injustice, and for all other harms related to climate chaos.”
Turk highlighted a recent ruling by the International Court of Justice determining that “governments need to prevent significant harm to our climate, including by regulating businesses”. And the Inter-American Court of Human Rights had also recognised the right to a stable climate and called on countries to “enforce corporate due diligence and provide remedies for climate related harm”, he said.
 
 

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights told Monday’s gathering that he often wondered “how future generations will judge our leaders’ actions — and their fatal inaction — on the climate crisis in 50, 100 years from now”.
“Could the inadequate response of today be considered ecocide or even a crime against humanity?”

• Gaza truce progress slow as Israel kills three more Palestinians in latest assault
JERUSALEM: Israel’s military announced the dismissal of three generals and disciplinary actions against several other senior officers over their failure to prevent the October 2023 assault by Hamas, the deadliest attack in the country’s history.
The move comes two weeks after Israeli military chief Eyal Zamir called for a “systemic investigation” into the failures that led to onslaught, even as the government dragged its feet on establishing a state commission of inquiry despite public pressure.
The list of generals fired included three divisional commanders, one of whom was then serving as the military intelligence chief.
A military statement released on Sunday said they bore personal responsibility for the armed forces’ failure to prevent the attack.
The firing comes after all three had already resigned from their posts, including the former head of the southern command General Yaron Finkelman.
Disciplinary actions were also announced against the heads of the navy and air force along with moves against four other generals and several senior officers.
It remains to be seen how or if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu might also be pinned with blame for having a role in the inability to prevent the Hamas onslaught. For the past two years, Netanyahu has repeatedly said that the failures that lead to the October 7 attacks should be addressed after the war in Gaza ended.
According to polls, a large number of Israelis across the political spectrum support the establishment of an inquiry to determine who is responsible for the authorities’ failure to prevent the attack.
Netanyahu’s government has so far refused to form such a commission.
Missile attack
Meanwhile, Israeli forces killed three Palestinians in Gaza near the line demarcating areas of Israeli control on Monday, underlining the struggle to broaden a fragile ceasefire deal approved over six weeks ago to global acclaim.
Palestinian medics said incidents involved an Israeli drone firing a missile at a group of people east of Khan Younis, killing two and wounding another, and a tank shell killing a person on the eastern side of Gaza City.
Israel’s military said it had fired after identifying fighters crossing the so-called yellow line and approaching its troops, posing an immediate threat to them.
Hamas and Israel signed a truce on October 9 halting two years of devastating warfare but the agreement left the most intractable disputes for further talks, freezing the conflict without resolving it.
Both sides have since accused each other of deadly breaches of existing commitments in the agreement and of pushing back against later steps required by US 20-point peace plan for Gaza.
 
 

Former British prime minister Tony Blair, who helped the US develop the plan and who Trump has said may join the board of peace, met the PA’s deputy leader Hussein al-Sheikh in the West Bank on Sunday.
Sheikh said in a social media post they had discussed developments following the Security Council resolution and requirements for Palestinian self-determination.
Meanwhile, a Hamas delegation in Cairo, led by its exiled chief Khalil al-Hayya, held talks with Egyptian officials on exploring the next phase of the ceasefire, according to Hazem Qassem, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza Separately, the Gaza health ministry said on Monday that at least 342 Palestinians had been killed by Israeli fire since the start of the truce.

PESHAWAR: Investi­gators and intelligence agencies are hunting for facilitators and support networks behind an attack on the Federal Constabulary headquarters here on Monday, which saw three personnel embrace martyrdom and 12 sustain injuries.
The attack, which began after a suicide bomber blew himself up at the entrance to the FC headquarters, was swiftly repulsed as personnel engaged and shot his two accomplices dead before they could enter the installation to inflict any major damage.
The three attackers ostensibly planned to target the FC’s weekly assembly near the main gate on Sonehri Masjid Road, where around 400 personnel had gathered.
Capital City Police Officer (CCPO) Dr Mian Saeed Ahmad said three militants tried to attack the headquarters in the morning. The first blew himself up at the main gate, while two others managed to enter the premises.
However, snipers and the armoured personnel carrier (APC) engaged the remaining bombers, restricting them to a parking lot reserved for motorbikes, he said, adding that the bombers sustained injuries in precise shots fired by the snipers and personnel from the APC.
Initial investigations revealed that the bombers had been waiting to carry out the attack. They reached the area at 7:35am while they executed the attack at 7:50am, the official said, hinting at a possible security breach that was the focus of their investigation.
“The bomber can be seen in the area at around 7:35am; the question is why did he take at least 25 minutes to carry out the attack despite the fact that he had passed the main gate twice — once while riding on a motorbike and then on foot,” a senior official said, fearing possible ‘facilitation’ from inside the headquarters.
CCTV footage showed the first suicide bomber, clad in a chador, approaching the main gate and blowing himself up, clearing the path for his accomplices, who were waiting at a distance. These bombers had arrived on a motorbike and travelled towards the FC HQ via Charsadda Road. Their movement was also captured around the Nishtar Hall.
During the investigation, it was revealed that they had been carrying backpacks, which suggested that they might have planned to take hostages once inside the premises.
According to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan, initial investigations revealed that all three terrorists involved in the attack were Afghan nationals.
It said that weapons and explosives were recovered from the deceased militants, adding that the specific identities of the Afghan terrorists were being ascertained.
 
 

According to an APP report, investigations were underway to trace the facilitators behind the attempted attack, with intelligence agencies focusing on identifying possible support networks.
The government is also expected to announce enhanced security measures for sensitive federal installations in the coming days, the agency said.
Condemnations
Soon after the attack, BRT services were suspended and the road was closed for all kinds of traffic, except for Rescue 1122 vehicles. An emergency was declared in all the hospitals as 11 injured persons were shifted to Lady Reading Hospital, while one was shifted to Khyber Teaching Hospital.
During his visit to LRH, Chief Minister Sohail Afridi said that militants had always intended to disturb peace in the province and the country and that those who had resorted to such acts were the province’s and country’s enemies.
He said that the provincial government would not let them do this.
In a statement issued from his office, CM Afridi sought an immediate report from the KP police chief and directed that all available resources be utilised to bring the elements involved in this inhumane act to justice.
Asked whether he had held any talks with security agencies regarding security issues, CM Afridi told reporters at LRH: “I have been briefed. The provincial government has ordered modern equipment for [police], but unfortunately, its delivery is taking time. Bullet cars are here, and we are working on capacity building of police.”
 
 

Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif strongly condemned the terrorist attack and lauded security forces for their “timely action,” as per a statement issued by the PM Office.
“Timely action taken by security forces saved us from major harm,” he said, praying for the recovery of the injured.
President Asif Ali Zardari, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi and Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti also condemned the attack, offering condolences to the families of the martyrs.

“If the FCC hears and decides ICAs that were moved against decisions of the Supreme Court, it will create the impression that the court is sitting as an appellate forum over Supreme Court judgements, whereas the 27th Constitutional Amend­ment contains no such provision,” argued senior counsel Ibad-ur-Rehman Lodhi.
Consequently, Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, who was heading a six-member FCC bench, adjourned the proceedings to allow the counsel to file an appropriate petition on the matter. The counsel later told Dawn that he would file a miscellaneous application within the present ICA instead of submitting a separate petition.
 
 

The issue arose when the FCC bench, also comprising Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Ali Baqar Najafi, Muhammad Karim Khan Agha, Rozi Khan Barrech and Arshad Hussain Shah, took up a set of ICAs concerning the All Public Universities BPS Teachers Association (APUBTA), an organisation that had earlier highlighted vacant positions across public-sector universities, including vice-chancellors, presidents, vice presidents, registrars, faculty heads, department heads, controllers of examination, and directors of finance.

Question of jurisdiction surfaces when court takes up varsity teachers’ appeals

When the case was taken up, Advocate Lodhi representing one of the petitioners, vice chancellor Dr Akhtar Ali Kalhoro of the NFC Institute of Engineering, Multan, argued that the FCC could not hear the matter because the appeal had been filed under Section 5 of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act, 2023.
He contended that the matter should instead be referred back to the SC, which had issued adverse remarks against the petitioner. However, the CJ reminded him that the SC could no longer hear petitions filed under Article 184(3), which relates to the enforcement of fundamental rights, now omitted under the 27th Constitutional Amendment. “Where is Article 184(3) in the Constitution as it stands today?” Justice K.K. Agha asked.
The counsel responded that at the time the appeal was filed before the SC, Article 184(3) was still in effect, even though Article 175(E) now vests original jurisdiction in the FCC to hear such matters. He noted that no appeal or petition under Article 175(E) was pending before the SC that would require transferring cases to the FCC; rather, the appeals had been filed under Article 185 of the Constitution. Justice Najafi observed that the amendment had broadened the scope and concept of the Article, bringing such matters within the FCC’s domain.
 
 

“Confusion inevitably arises when matters are left to assumption,” the counsel argued, adding that lawmakers did not address this anomaly. He reiterated that the SC was not seized of any petition under Article 175(E) that would warrant transferring cases to the FCC after its creation.
“Why don’t you file a separate petition on this point?” Justice Najafi suggested.
The counsel replied that if the FCC proceeded with the appeal, it would give the impression that the court was acting as an appellate body over SC decisions. He added that Article 175(F) of the 27th Ame­ndment clearly states that the FCC may hear and determine appeals arising from judgements of a high court made under Article 199 — and not those of the SC.
During the hearing, the FCC also appeared constrained by the lack of readily available copies of the Pakistan Legal Decisions or the Supreme Court Monthly Review for quick reference to prior decisions. The bench had to rely on books provided by the counsel, with two judges sharing a single copy at a time.

In a determination sent to the federal government, Ogra worked out the average revenue requirement for Karachi-based Sui Southern Gas Company Ltd (SSGCL) at about Rs370bn — up from Rs354bn it was allowed in July — for the next fiscal year. As such, the regulator determined SSGCL’s prescribed price at Rs1,777 per million British thermal unit (mmBtu), up from Rs1,659 per mmBtu, an increase of 7.11pc, or Rs118 per unit.
On the other hand, the regulator determined the revenue requirement for Lahore-based Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Ltd (SNGPL) at Rs516bn for FY2025-26 and set its final prescribed price at Rs1,853/- per mmBTU, about Rs87 per unit, or 5pc higher than the existing price of Rs1,766 per unit.
At the start of the fiscal year on July 1, the government had already increased fixed gas charges for all consumers by 50pc and up to 17pc increase in per unit gas sale rates for industrial, power and bulk consumers, envisaging around Rs85bn additional financial burden to consumers in FY26 to meet a structural benchmark of the IMF.

Semi-annual adjustments committed to IMF

Based on Ogra’s latest determinations, the government has to decide whether to increase consumer-end gas rates and, if so, by how much for each consumer category, or to further jack up fixed rates. The government has committed to “continue to notify semi-annual gas tariff adjustments as determined by Ogra. Gas tariff adjustments will continue to include the cost of imported RLNG”, the finance minister had given to the IMF in writing.
The SNGPL and SSGCL had sought increases of more than 10.7pc and 7.6pc in their prescribed gas prices, respectively, to meet their revenue requirements for 2025-26, but the regulator worked out increases of 5pc and 7pc, respectively. Under the practice in vogue, the government notifies uniform natural gas rates across the country based on the higher prescribed price of any of the two utilities. As a result, the revenue difference between the two gas companies generates a gas development surcharge (GDS) to the provinces based on the location of the gas production.
The prescribed gas prices are revised twice a year under the law, following determinations by the Oil & Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra), based on which the government sets consumer gas prices for various consumer categories.
The government has also committed to the IMF to provide timely biannual notifications of gas rates to avoid a further buildup of circular debt, which has already exceeded Rs3 trillion.
 
 

The Ogra asked the government “that all the categories of consumers should at least pay the average cost of service or the average prescribed price” that comes to Rs1,853 and Rs1,777 per mmBtu for SNGPL and SSGCL, respectively, to ensure the full cost of gas delivery. The government has, however, been setting different gas rates for various categories by imposing an extra-fiscal burden on middle-class and high-end residential, industrial, commercial, and power sectors through a cross-subsidy mechanism to ensure the revenue requirement determined by Ogra.
Under section 8 (3) of the Ogra law, the federal government is required to “advise the Ogra within 40 days” of the Ogra determination about the revision of prescribed prices, the minimum charges and the sale price for each category of retail consumers, for notification in the Official Gazette” provided that the overall increase in the average prescribed price remains unchanged so that the gas companies are able to achieve their total revenue requirements.

The tribunal, headed by Justice Muhammad Amir Nawaz Rana, directed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to cancel Mr Samiullah’s notification and hold fresh polling at 22 disputed stations of the constituency. 
In his petition, PkNAP chief Kakar alleged gross violations and bogus votes during the 2024 general elections in NA-251 (Zhob/Qila Saifullah/Sherani) and requested that the JUI-F candidate be de-seated and that he himself be notified as the successful candidate. 
After hearing the case, the tribunal instead ordered re-polling at the 22 controversial stations. 
In a statement, the PkNAP expressed disappointment over the ruling and said that despite presenting undeniable evidence, certified records from all polling stations and what it called solid proof of Mr Kakar’s victory, the decision to order re-polling made no sense. 

Orders ECP to hold fresh polling at 22 disputed stations of NA-251

The party said it had expected the tribunal to uphold Mr Kakar’s success, noting that the ECP had already acknowledged his clear lead on its website, during formal proceedings and through a specially formed inquiry commission. 
The statement added that the tribunal had earlier declared Mr Kakar successful and ordered a recount at 22 polling stations only to satisfy the opposing side. 
That recount again confirmed Mr Kakar’s lead by more than 4,000 votes, and the result was officially submitted by the returning officer, it said, adding that polling agents and presiding officers also testified in his favour, while the ECP produced complete records supporting his claim. 
Terming the order for re-polling disappointing and contrary to electoral justice, the party alleged that Mr Kakar’s original margin of more than 20,000 votes had been unlawfully altered after the Feb 8 elections.

Pahalgam is the site where gunmen on April 22 killed 26 mostly Hindu tourists. New Delhi blamed the attack on Pakistan, which strongly denied the allegations while calling for a neutral investigation, triggering a series of tit-for-tat diplomatic measures that escalated into a four-day conflict.
In the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, Indian forces arrested more than 2,000 Kashmiris and demolished several homes in a sweeping crackdown.
The arrests were carried out across multiple districts, including Srinagar, Ganderbal, Bandipora, Kupwara, Baramulla, Budgam, Islamabad, Pulwama, Shopian and Kulgam.
“We unequivocally condemn the brutal terrorist attack on a tourist area and extend our condolences to the victims, their families, and the Government of India. However, all governments must respect international human rights law while combating terrorism,” the experts said in a press release issued today on India’s response to the attack.
They noted that Indian authorities launched sweeping operations across the territory in the attack’s wake, resulting in the arrest and detention of around 2,800 individuals, including journalists and human rights defenders.
They pointed out that some were detained and charged under the Public Safety Act or the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, which permitted prolonged detention without charge or trial and contained “vague and overbroad definitions of terrorism”.
The experts noted that some detainees were allegedly tortured, held incommunicado, and denied access to lawyers and family members.
“We condemn reports of arbitrary arrests and detentions, suspicious deaths in custody, torture and other ill-treatment, lynchings, and discriminatory treatment of Kashmiri and Muslim communities,” the experts said.
They further highlighted reports of punitive house demolitions and forced evictions and arbitrary displacement, targeting families of individuals perceived as supporting freedom fighters, and carried out without court orders or due process.
“Such actions constitute collective punishment and defy the 2024 ruling by India’s Supreme Court, which found that such demolitions are unconstitutional and violate the rights to life and human dignity, which includes the right to protection against arbitrary displacement,” the experts said.
They also expressed concern at communication blackouts and restrictions on press freedom, saying that authorities reportedly suspended mobile internet services and blocked around 8,000 social media accounts, including those of journalists and independent media outlets.
“These measures are disproportionate restrictions on freedoms of expression, association and peaceful assembly,” the experts noted.
They remarked that India’s response to the attacks was “also felt elsewhere in India”, with Kashmiri students subjected to surveillance and harassment, following government directives requiring universities to collect their personal data.
“Hate speech and incitement to violence increased against Muslims, inflamed by political figures in the ruling party. Demolitions were reported in Gujarat and Assam, where thousands of Muslim homes, mosques, and businesses were destroyed.”
“Nearly 1,900 Muslims and Rohingya refugees were also expelled to Bangladesh and Myanmar, often without due process,” the press release said.
The experts stressed that such expulsions violated the international obligation of non-refoulement, which prohibited returning individuals to countries where they risked persecution, arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, or other serious harm.
They further highlighted what they said was the “persistent nature of violations” in the territory with several human rights defenders, including Irfan Mehraj and Khurram Parvez, being arbitrarily detained for years under draconian security laws.
“We urge the immediate unconditional release of all individuals arbitrarily detained in Jammu and Kashmir.”
The experts also urged India to bring its counter-terrorism laws and practices “in line with international human rights obligations and independently investigate all alleged violations” and ensure accountability, including through prosecutions.
“Excessive counter-terrorism measures not only violate human dignity, the Indian constitution and international law but counter-productively fuel social division and grievances that can spiral into further violence,” the experts warned.
They lastly asked Pakistan and India to peacefully resolve the Kashmir dispute, which they said had “fuelled human rights violations and the destructive cycle of cross-border violence”.</p><small>2025-11-24 19:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/2423422523c3393.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957104/pakistani-diplomat-afghan-governor-meet-to-ease-bilateral-tensions' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani diplomat, Afghan governor meet to ease bilateral tensions</strong></a><br><p>A Pakistani diplomat in Afghanistan met a key Afghan governor amid tensions over rising terror incidents in Pakistan, saying efforts were underway to thaw bilateral ties, according to Afghan state media and Pakistani sources who spoke to Dawn.
The meeting was held hours after three Federal Constabulary men were martyred in a suicide attack on the force’s headquarters in Peshawar’s Saddar area this morning. Security forces quickly neutralised the attackers.
This was the first high-level contact in months between the Pakistani Consul General in Jalalabad, Shafqatullah Khan and Nangarhar Governor Mullah Muhammad Naeem Akhund.
Akhund is an important Taliban leader and is considered a confidant of Taliban Supreme Leader Hibatullah Akhundzada.
Governor Akhund has previously served as deputy minister of Borders and Tribal Affairs and deputy minister of Civil Aviation during the Taliban’s first government from 1996-2001. He had played a key role in the Taliban’s military commission during the 20-year war against the US and its NATO allies and also led the Taliban’s military activities in southern Helmand province.
He was a close confidante of the late Taliban’s chief, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, and is considered a close associate of Defense Minister Mullah Yaqoob Mujahid.
“The Islamic Emirate has a constructive stance towards good relations, cooperation, and safeguarding common interests with the region, neighbouring countries, and other countries of the world, and relevant efforts in this regard are ongoing,” Afghanistan’s official Bakhtar news agency reported.
Pakistan has long said that terrorist groups have used Afghan soil to plot and stage attacks across the border; a charge the Afghan Taliban deny.
“The governor of Nangarhar noted the goodwill, brotherhood, and historical kinship of the Afghan people, and explained that the foundation of positive relations can remain strong in the presence of mutual respect, understanding and systematic coordination,” according to the report.
No statement was issued by the Pakistani consulate about the meeting. The consulate and the Foreign Office spokesman did not reply to queries when approached for comments.
However, sources with knowledge about the meeting said the Afghan governor told the diplomat that he has already “made efforts to reduce tension between the two countries”.
The diplomat explained Pakistan’s position on the current security issues to Akhund, who is also keen to bring the relationship back on track.
“The meeting discussed ethnicity, language, religion, culture, and other commonalities, and discussed the current situation in the region and the daily amenities of the people based on the tradition of good neighbourliness,” Bakhtar said.
The meeting was attended by Nangarhar Deputy Governor Maulvi Azizullah Mustafa, Foreign Affairs Director Maulvi Jan Mohammad Inqelab, provincial spokesman Qari Ehsanullah Usmani and a number of other officials.
Breakdown in Pak-Afghan ties
Pakistan’s bilateral relations with Afghanistan have come under strain in recent times as the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) remains the main point of contention between the two countries.
Pakistan has demanded that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism, but the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegations of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
During a process of dialogue, which followed border clashes between the two countries in October, the two sides had met in an effort to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. Information Minister Attaullah Tarar then announced that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
On November 7, however, after the third round of talks, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge big differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban suspended trade ties with Islamabad. Pakistan had already closed its border for trade soon after the October clashes.</p><small>2025-11-24 19:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/242227218fe7114.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957101/pti-slams-govt-for-1971-style-power-grab-in-by-elections-urges-course-correction' target='_blank'><strong>PTI slams govt for ‘1971-style power grab’ in by-elections, urges course correction</strong></a><br><p>The PTI lashed out on Monday at the incumbent government over the recent by-elections, alleging it revived the 1971 blueprint for stripping the people of their mandate to prolong its rule.
According to provisional results, the PML-N won all six National Assembly (NA) seats and six of seven Punjab Assembly seats up for grabs. One provincial seat was won by the PPP, which fielded its candidates in only three of the 13 constituencies.
Most of these seats were vacated following the disqualification of PTI members due to their convictions in May 9 cases.
Reacting to the results, PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram slammed the authorities for repeating history’s “gravest mistakes”.
He insisted that the country was on the verge of security, economic, political and social collapse, and urged the authorities to learn from past mistakes by taking corrective and remedial measures instead of repeating old blunders while expecting different results.
Akram recalled that, just like the Awami League, the PTI secured a landslide victory in the February 8, 2024, general election, only to be “robbed” of its mandate, with a subsequent spree of disqualifications against PTI candidates under flimsy excuses and the denial of reserved seats.
He pointed out that in the 1970 election, the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, won a clear majority, but the party was deliberately cut down by declaring around 183 seats vacant, depriving it of the ability to form a government both at the federal level and in East Pakistan.
The PTI spokesperson expressed surprise at why the government was so adamant on replicating the same disastrous model of 1971, noting that those who repeated a calamitous model while expecting different results were “living in a fool’s paradise”.
He stated that instead of recognising the gravity of the situation and taking remedial measures to pull the country out of a deep abyss, the rulers were busy taking steps to perpetuate their rule, caring for nothing but retaining power.
Akram emphasised that such “controlled and rigged” polls could never serve as a true measure of PTI or former prime minister Imran Khan’s popularity.
He recalled that Imran had repeatedly demonstrated the overwhelming public support for him in the past.
The PTI spokesperson warned that even the PPP had not learned from past mistakes, as it allowed itself to be exploited for petty political gains and expediencies, ultimately paying a heavy price.
“Now, after securing a simple majority, PML-N could reveal its true colours and give the party a cold shoulder,“ he noted.
He challenged the government to announce fresh elections and dared all political forces to unite under one election symbol against the PTI. He vowed that the PTI would not just defeat, but obliterate all rival parties from the political landscape.</p><small>2025-11-24 18:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24170311550018f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957085/ash-cloud-from-ethiopian-volcano-eruption-to-have-no-significant-impact-on-southern-pakistan-says-pmd' target='_blank'><strong>Ash cloud from Ethiopian volcano eruption to have no significant impact on southern Pakistan, says PMD</strong></a><br><p>The ash cloud from a volcanic eruption in northeastern Ethiopia would have no significant impact on the coastal areas of Pakistan, including Karachi, and would pass over the Arabian sea, confirmed the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday.
The Hayli Gubbi volcano, located in Ethiopia’s Afar region about 800 kilometres northeast of Addis Ababa near the Eritrean border, erupted on Sunday for several hours. This was the first recorded eruption in nearly 12,000 years.
The eruption sent thick plumes of smoke up to 14 kilometres into the sky, blanketing nearby villages and drifting toward the Arabian Sea region. The volcano, which rises about 500 metres in altitude, sits within the Rift Valley, a zone of intense geological activity where two tectonic plates meet.
Met Office Spokesperson Anjum Nazeer Zaighum, while speaking to Dawn, said the effects of the ash cloud would not be felt in Karachi and it would pass over the Arabian Sea.
“The projections are from last night, and the impact would be felt in the deep Arabian Sea, in Oman, and within the Mumbai FIR (flight region),” the spokesperson explained, referring to earlier projections by Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) which stated that the ash cloud would affect southern Pakistan after passing over Yemen and Oman.
The spokesperson added that the ash cloud would be at an altitude of around 50,000 feet. He elaborated that the ash cloud was witnessed 60 nautical miles south of Gwadar today and the office has issued a warning to the concerned authorities, which is still in place.
 






A local resident told The Addis Standard that the eruption occurred eight kilometres from the main mountain itself.
“Afar TV … described a “massive eruption” late in the morning, noting that the force and sound of the blast were stronger than any previous events recalled by residents,” the Standard reported.
“‘We were extremely shocked by the sound and engulfed in fear,’ one resident said. Phone interviews conducted by the station indicated that the sound and its effects were felt as far away as Djibouti, Tigray and towns in the Wollo area.”
The Standard reported that the explosion caused tremors in the surrounding area and could be heard as far away as Djibouti. The subsequent ash cloud plunged surrounding settlements into “near-darkness”.

Citing Dutch news agency BNO News, the Standard said that the eruption began at 8:30am UTC (1:30pm PKT) and explosions continued throughout the afternoon.
“An advisory from the Toulouse Volcanic Ash Advisory Centre (VAAC) said ash rose to about 45,000 feet (13.7 km) before activity subsided,” the Ethiopian outlet reported, adding that according to the latest VAAC update they received, the eruption had reportedly stopped.
The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program said Hayli Gubbi has had no known eruptions during the Holocene, which began around 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age.
Simon Carn, a volcanologist and professor at the Michigan Technological University, confirmed on Bluesky that Hayli Gubbi “has no record of Holocene eruptions”.
An update from flight tracking monitor FlightRadar at 3:31am this morning showed the projected path of the ash cloud, which was being blown towards the Arabian Peninsula and the Arabian Sea.
Pakistan will come directly in its path, the monitor showed in its post, stating that the cloud would arrive in approximately 18 hours.
 






An interactive map from VAAC shows that the ash cloud will pass over southern Sindh before heading northeast into India.

Saudi Armed Forces Chief of General Staff General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili is currently on a visit to Pakistan and held meetings with senior officials.
A statement from state broadcaster PTV News, on his meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, said: “General Al-Rowaili conveyed felicitations from the Saudi leadership to the prime minister and the people of Pakistan. He reaffirmed the kingdom’s strong desire to elevate the current excellent defence and strategic partnership with Pakistan to new heights.”
PM Shehbaz also reaffirmed his firm commitment to further strengthening the “historic fraternal relations” between the countries in all sectors, including economic, defence and security.
“The prime minister welcomed General Al-Rowaili and commended Saudi Arabia for the unwavering support and solidarity it has always extended to Pakistan. He emphasised that the relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are based on shared faith, common values, and mutual trust.
“The prime minister mentioned his highly successful visits to Riyadh over the past two months, during which historic Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement was signed between the two sides. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to further deepening bilateral defence cooperation, including joint training, exercises, and exchange of expertise.”
PM Shehbaz also highlighted the joint resolve of both countries to combat all forms of terrorism and extremism and to promote peace and stability in the region.
 






Earlier, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia’s military leadership discussed strengthening the “longstanding and strategic” cooperation between the two countries, focusing on defence, security and counterterrorism efforts, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
The discussion took place during a meeting between Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir and General Al Rowaili at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, according to the ISPR.
“During the meeting, both leaders discussed matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on strengthening the longstanding and strategic military cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia,” the statement said.
“They emphasised the importance of further enhancing defence collaboration, security cooperation, and counter-terrorism efforts, which continue to be pillars of the deep-rooted bilateral relationship,” it added.
 






The visiting dignitary, according to ISPR’s statement, appreciated Pakistan’s cooperation in multiple fields with the Saudi armed forces and “reaffirmed his commitment to furthering the strong bonds of cooperation”.
“Upon arrival at GHQ, General Fayyadh Bin Hameed Al Rowaili laid a floral wreath at Yadgar-e-Shuhada and was presented a Guard of Honour by a smartly turned-out contingent of the Pakistan Army,” said the statement.
 






General Al Rowaili later called on Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza at the Joint Staff Headquarters.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed evolving global and regional security environment. The dignitaries also explored concrete measures to deepen engagements between the armed forces of both countries and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthen defence and security ties.
“The CJCSC reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and ensuring the protection of Harmain al-Sharifain,” the ISPR said.
 






In September, Islamabad and Riyadh signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
Earlier this month, CGS Lieutenant General Aamer Raza met General Rowaily in Riyadh to discuss broadening strategic ties and strengthening the mutual defence agreement signed by the two nations.
The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.</p><small>2025-11-24 18:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/241907132f8bb0f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957089/lahore-qalandars-peshawar-zalmi-and-quetta-gladiators-renew-psl-franchise-rights-for-next-decade' target='_blank'><strong>Lahore Qalandars, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators renew PSL franchise rights for next decade</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan Super League (PSL) outfits Lahore Qalandars, Peshawar Zalmi and Quetta Gladiators have renewed their franchise rights for another 10 years, the country’s cricket board announced on Monday.
The agreements, finalised at market valuations determined by global audit firm Ernst & Young after what the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) described as a “comprehensive and transparent assessment”, come ahead of the league’s expansion to eight teams from its 11th edition next year.
Lahore Qalandars — the PSL’s most valuable franchise and winners of three of the last four editions under Pakistan ODI captain Shaheen Shah Afridi — were among the first to extend their rights.
“It gives me immense pleasure that Lahore Qalandars will continue to stay with its current owners,” PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi said in a statement.
“[Qalandars owners] Atif Rana and Sameen Rana have worked extremely hard to turn this franchise into a household name across Pakistan and a reputable brand around the world.”
Peshawar Zalmi, one of the league’s most recognisable brands and champions in 2017, also renewed their decade-long rights on Monday.
Led by owner Javed Afridi, the franchise has cultivated one of the strongest fan bases in the league and was the most-watched team during the last PSL season, said the PCB.
Mohsin lauded Javed’s “commitment, professionalism and passion”, saying his leadership had “played a fundamental role in elevating the Zalmi brand into one of the most dynamic and admired sporting entities in Pakistan”.
“Javed Afridi’s vision has contributed immensely to the growth of the HBL PSL,” he added. “His decision to renew reflects a strong belief in the league’s future potential.”</p><small>2025-11-24 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24154447cb06b79.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957067/pakistan-seeks-to-buy-100000-tonnes-of-rice-for-supply-to-bangladesh' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan seeks to buy 100,000 tonnes of rice for supply to Bangladesh</strong></a><br><p>The Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has issued a tender to purchase 100,000 tonnes of rice for supply to Bangladesh, it emerged on Monday.
After decades of troubled relations, Islamabad and Dhaka have seen improved ties and increased bilateral engagement since the August 2024 ouster of ex-premier Sheikh Hasina.
The deadline for submission of price offers is 11:30am on November 28, according to the TCP tender issued on November 20, which was seen by Dawn.
The tender invites “separate sealed bids” from companies, partnerships and sole proprietors for buying 100,000 tonnes of long grain white rice (IRRI-6) “for export to Bangladesh in the shape of break bulk cargo” through Karachi ports.
Price offers have to be valid for 21 working days after submission. The rice must be available for shipment within 45 days after the contract award.
The bids shall be submitted for a minimum quantity of 25,000 tonnes, or multiples thereof, and a maximum quantity of 100,000 tonnes, +/- 5 per cent MOLSO (5pc variance margin).
 
 

As per the tender, the rice should be supplied from the “stocks of latest crop of Pakistan origin”, and must be fit for human consumption without any unpleasant odour, sign of mould, poisonous weed seeds, insects, and infestation.
According to Reuters, traders regarded the tender as a possible move to bring Pakistani rice into Bangladesh’s import supplies, with market expectations that Indian-origin rice will be used to supply some recent purchases by Bangladesh.
Bangladesh also announced another rice tender today, continuing a series of import tenders in the last few weeks to cool local prices.
Pakistan and Bangladesh started direct government-to-government trade in February with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice.
At the 9th Joint Economic Commission (JEC) last month, Pakistan offered the use of Karachi Port Trust as a gateway for Dhaka’s trade with regional countries, including China and the Central Asian states.
Rice exports
Pakistan’s rice exports fell 28pc in the first quarter of FY26, raising concerns within the sector about policy and regulatory barriers that continue to undermine competitiveness.
A Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan official had attributed the decline to India’s 2024 decision to resume rice exports and the government’s removal of the basmati minimum export price (MEP) and zero-rate rice exports.
 
 

However, as Pakistani exporters avoided a direct price war, India’s re-entry failed to significantly disrupt Pakistan’s rice trade in the following six months (October 2024 to March 2025), with the latter retaining its foothold in high-end markets.
Moreover, a 50 per cent tariff imposed by the United States on Indian goods, including basmati rice, in August has provided Pakistan an opportunity to expand its share in the American market.
Data from Volza’s Global Trade platform showed that between November 2023 and October 2024, the US accounted for 24pc of Pakistan’s total basmati exports.</p><small>2025-11-24 16:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635293-adviser-to-iranian-supreme-leader-set-for-unprecedented-pakistan-visit' target='_blank'><strong>Adviser to Iranian supreme leader set for 'unprecedented' Pakistan visit</strong></a><br><p>

A media monitoring and advocacy organisation, Uks, for over two decades, has been engaged with the media on how to report women’s issues in general, and cases of violence against women in particular.
In the press release, Uks said it would observe “16 days of activism” against gender-based violence in Pakistan under the theme ‘Unite to End Digital Violence against All Women and Girls’.
The published reports are part of Uks’ 2023–2024 initiative ‘Safe Word, Safer Word’, which was done in collaboration with the World Association for Christian Communication (WACC).
The report, titled ‘365 Posts, One Message: Stop Online Sexualised Violence!’, is a collation of 365 harmful posts shared by Uks over the course of one year, tracking people’s responses.
“Respond they did, sometimes with support, sometimes with criticism, and sometimes with honesty,” the report read.
Uks said that the report, combined with the compendium, “offers a very telling snapshot of how women in Pakistan experience online spaces, and how the public engages when these issues are consistently highlighted”.
“The comments in this compilation make it clear that online misogyny is routine for many women. They also show that sustained conversation does make an impact,” the report read.
“This effort succeeded in documenting lived experiences and sparking a dialogue. It also encouraged individuals and institutions to take online abuse more seriously.”
Uks announced that alongside the publications, it launched a 16-video campaign featuring prominent people from media, show business, academia, civil society, and other walks of life, the press release read.
“It brings together diverse viewpoints on why women face disproportionate online harassment and how collective action can create safer digital spaces,” it read.
Uks also announced it would be publishing the Global Media Monitoring Project National Report on December 9, stating in the press release that it is “the world’s largest and longest-running research project on gender representation in news media, which has been conducted every five years since 1995”.
“It monitors how women are portrayed in print, broadcast, and online news across more than 100 countries,” the press release read.
“Uks has been the official GMMP national coordinator for Pakistan since the first cycle, and is responsible for gathering data, training volunteers, monitoring media content, and reporting on gender portrayal trends in Pakistan’s media landscape,” Uks added.
In February this year, Uks announced the launch of its Uks AI (Beta) platform, describing it as an artificial intelligence tool that calls out gender bias in media content, “whether it’s hiding in plain sight or lurking between the lines”.
In a press release, the organisation said the tool was built particularly for journalists, editors and reporters to address a “persistent challenge” in media creation: the unconscious perpetuation of gender stereotypes that shaped how society viewed and valued women.
Uks added that the tool scanned text for both glaring and subtle biases, offering “immediate, actionable feedback” to media professionals.</p><small>2025-11-24 16:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635290-pmd-issues-warning-as-ethiopian-volcanic-ash-drifts-into-pakistani-airspace' target='_blank'><strong>PMD issues warning as Ethiopian volcanic ash drifts into Pakistani airspace</strong></a><br><p>

The statistics were revealed in the Sustainable Social Development Organisation’s (SSDO) Factsheet on Violence Against Children (VAC) in Punjab, covering the period from January to June 2025.
A press release issued by the organisation said that of the 4,150 cases, challans were presented in 3,989 cases, while 3,791 were under trial, with an average of 23 cases reported daily, based on district-level police data obtained through the Punjab Transparency and Right to Information Act 2013.
It added that Punjab’s reporting mechanisms had improved over the past year, resulting in increased registration of cases. However, the SSDO noted that conviction rates remained “critically low and require immediate attention”.
It noted that “despite the volume and severity of offences, only 12 convictions were recorded during the six-month period”, making for a conviction rate below one per cent.
The SSDO said sexual abuse remained “one of the most troubling” categories with 717 cases registered, 658 challaned and 581 still under trial.
“The category saw 12 acquittals and eight withdrawals but zero convictions,” it pointed out.
Meanwhile, child beggary was the most frequently reported offence, with 2,693 cases registered across the province, adding that 2,674 of these were challaned and 2,669 remained under trial, yet none resulted in a conviction.
“Other forms of exploitation also pose serious threats. Child trafficking registered 332 cases, resulting in four convictions, while 182 cases of child labour led to eight convictions, the comparatively highest outcomes among categories, yet still alarmingly low relative to the number of offences. Meanwhile, 87 cases of physical abuse and 27 kidnapping cases produced no convictions.
“Child marriage continues to be severely underreported, with just 12 cases registered in the first six months of 2025 and no convictions or acquittals, pointing to entrenched cultural and procedural barriers that obstruct reporting,” the SSDO said.
It reported that district-level data identified Lahore, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Rawalpindi and Sialkot as the “major hotspots for child abuse, exploitation and trafficking.
“Lahore recorded the highest numbers of sexual abuse, child beggary and trafficking cases, while Nankana Sahib, Gujrat and Mandi Bahauddin also showed elevated trafficking trends.”
The organisation said that its findings overall revealed “critical gaps” in Punjab’s child protection ecosystem, extremely low conviction rates, thousands of cases pending trial and persistent underreporting of sensitive crimes.
It called for urgent reforms, including strengthened investigative capacity, fast-tracked trials, increased coordination between departments, expanded child protection units and awareness efforts to encourage reporting at the community level.
“SSDO emphasised that protecting children in Punjab requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach to ensure justice, accountability and long-term safety for every child.”
Earlier this month, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Ministry of Human Rights launched consultations to prepare a national Strategic Action Plan on Violence Against Children, aiming to strengthen prevention and protect the country’s 112 million children.
The initiative addresses multiple forms of violence against children in Pakistan, including killings, physical and sexual violence, psychological abuse, and neglect. The plan comes as the country faces challenges where only one in three children under five is registered at birth and over 12.5 million are involved in child labour.
The consultations, which included experts, partners, participants from all provinces and self-governed areas, began in Karachi and concluded in Islamabad.
The new strategy will be grounded in the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and the INSPIRE framework, an evidence-based package developed by international agencies under WHO’s leadership.</p><small>2025-11-24 16:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/24185809f34193d.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1957086/pti-did-not-boycott-recent-by-elections-but-contested-all-13-seats-cm-maryam' target='_blank'><strong>PTI did not boycott recent by-elections but contested all 13 seats: CM Maryam</strong></a><br><p>Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz claimed on Monday that the PTI did not boycott yesterday’s by-elections but rather participated in all 13 constituencies up for grabs.
By-elections were held on six National Assembly and seven Punjab Assembly seats on Sunday. The PML-N fielded its candidates on all seats except a provincial one in Muzaffargarh, and secured victory on all 12 of them.
The PPP contested on three seats but could only win the Punjab Assembly seat from Muzaffargarh. The PTI failed to grab either of the Haripur or Lahore NA seats it campaigned for.
“This was not even a boycott of the elections. What they are describing as a boycott, I have not seen such hypocrisy during my entire life,” CM Maryam said while addressing a meeting of provincial ministers today.
“PTI candidates contested in all constituencies. They contested on ‘qaidi No. 804’ (Imran) with photos of their leader. They set up polling camps, displayed pictures and campaigned while taking the [PTI’s] name.
“And when they lost, they said ‘we boycotted’,” the chief minister said.
 






The PML-N leader said the PTI employed a strategy where it would claim popular support “despite a boycott” if it won, but also attribute any loss to its boycott call. “This is a drama,” she quipped.
During her address, Maryam repeatedly criticised the PTI’s “narrative” of a boycott, contending that politicians never opt out of democratic processes even if they have slim chances of emerging victorious.
“[Lt] General Faiz Hameed went to jail, Umar Ata Bandial and Imran-daar judges went home, so they do not want to contest elections now,” she said, referring to the former intelligence chief and the ex-chief justice.
The Punjab CM slammed the PTI for indulging in “politics of narrative”, saying that narratives had a shelf-life, which had now ended.
The PML-N leader also recalled the July 2018 elections won by the PTI in the wake of the imprisonment of the top PML-N leadership, including her and her father Nawaz Sharif, who had been ousted as the prime minister the year prior.
“Even us in 2018, when Nawaz Sharif sahib and I were in jail, I was perhaps the first Pakistani woman they jailed and did many injustices to,” Maryam claimed.
“But we did not boycott the elections. We contested even in the worst circumstances,” she added, terming them the “most difficult elections” of the PML-N’s history.
“I was alone here; Maryam Nawaz vs the entire power of the state,” she said, adding that the now-banned Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) was “also created during that election”.
 
 

“General Faiz’s entire power was with the PTI and Yasmin Rashid. It was the most difficult election in history [for us],” Maryam said.
Addressing the PTI, the Punjab CM said, “When you break laws, when you take up militancy, you have no right to call yourself a political party.”
“You conducted rigging, but were allowed to continue. You did manipulation and made people lose elections, but no one said anything. But the day you attacked your own country, your downfall started,” she said, referring to the May 9, 2023 riots.
Maryam went on to assert that the “extra votes in all constituencies” were from people who switched support from PTI to PML-N.
“The public accepted service, they stamped Nawaz’s ideology and buried the politics of lies, hypocrisy and conspiracy forever,” she added.

The launch of outlets in the eastern province of Dhahran and one for diplomats in the port city of Jeddah would be a further milestone in efforts, led by de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to open up the country.
The kingdom last year opened an alcohol store serving non-Muslim diplomats in the capital Riyadh — the first such outlet since a ban was brought in 73 years ago.
Store planned in Aramco compound, says source
The new store in Dhahran will be set up in a compound owned by Aramco, one of the three people who talked to Reuters said.
That store would be open for non-Muslims working for Aramco, the source added, who said Saudi authorities had informed them of the plan.
Two of the sources said a third liquor store was also in the works for non-Muslim diplomats in the city of Jeddah, where many missions have honorary consuls.
Both stores were expected to open in 2026, but no timelines had been released, two of the sources said.
The government media office did not immediately reply to questions over the plans for the stores in both locations, which were previously unreported. Aramco declined to comment.
There was no officially announced change made to regulations after the opening of the Riyadh store in a nondescript building in the diplomatic quarter known to some diplomats as the “booze bunker”.
The Riyadh store’s customer base was recently expanded to include non-Muslim Saudi Premium Residency holders, two of the sources said. Premium residencies have been awarded to entrepreneurs, major investors and those with special talents.
Before the Riyadh store, alcohol was largely only available through diplomatic mail, the black market or home brewing.
In other Gulf countries, apart from Kuwait, alcohol is available with some restrictions.
Reforms cover events, women’s driving
While alcoholic drinks are still off limits for the vast majority of the population, under the crown prince’s reforms, both Saudis and foreigners can now take part in once-unthinkable activities, from dancing at desert raves to going to the cinema.
Other reforms have included allowing women
The kingdom has been easing restrictions to lure tourists and international businesses as part of an ambitious plan to diversify its economy and make itself less dependent on oil.
In May, a media report, picked up by some international media after appearing on a wine blog, said Saudi authorities had planned to allow alcohol sales in tourist settings as the country prepares to host the 2034 soccer World Cup.
The report, which was denied at the time by a Saudi official, did not give a source for the information.
That report had sparked a vigorous online debate in the kingdom.
Social liberalisation has proceeded at a breakneck pace, but the leadership have taken a more gradual and cautious approach to the question of alcohol. The ban on alcohol is still in place, a measure not uncommon in Muslim countries, where alcohol use is often restricted.
Saudi Arabia has been aggressively expanding its local tourism portfolio with the giant Red Sea Global development, which includes plans to open 17 new hotels by next May.
These ultra-luxury resorts remain dry.
Asked by Reuters this month if there were any plans to ease restrictions on alcohol to help attract foreign visitors, Saudi Tourism Minister Ahmed Al-Khateeb said: “We do understand that some of the international travellers want to enjoy alcohol when they visit the Saudi destinations, but nothing has changed yet.”
Pressed on whether “yet” meant that it could soon change, he said: “I will leave it to you on how to elaborate on it.”
Saudi residents report booze ban eased for select foreigners
Separately, diplomats and premium visa-holders in Saudi Arabia also told AFP that the conservative kingdom has quietly eased restrictions on purchasing alcohol for select foreign residents.
While the government has not made any statements regarding the sale of alcohol in recent days, the sources said non-Muslim individuals with so-called premium resident status are now able to buy booze at the country’s sole liquor store in Riyadh, which was previously reserved for diplomats.
AFP spoke with four people who said the rules had changed, including two diplomatic sources and a couple of residents with premium visa status.
“I heard about it from friends who tried it. I went there two days ago and it actually worked,” one premium visa-holder told AFP on condition of anonymity.
“It saved me a lot of money rather than buying from the black market. Prices are reasonable and we finally can buy alcohol.”
AFP reached out to Saudi authorities for comment on the reports, but they did not respond by the time the story was published.
Started in 2019, premium resident status in Saudi Arabia is available to a select group of foreigners who meet a variety of requirements, including making a one-time payment of 800,000 riyals ($213,000).
The visa allows people to live, work and invest freely in Saudi Arabia without a local “sponsor” — a kind of guarantor required for other non-nationals to live in the kingdom.
A premium residency-holder told AFP that he went to the liquor store and saw a man with the same status purchase alcohol before buying bottles himself.
“It actually worked for me, it’s so easy,” he said.
‘Walking out with 30 bottles’
A Western diplomat told AFP that acquaintances of his with premium residency had managed to buy alcohol in the past few days.
“Expats WhatsApp groups are being flooded with the news,” he added.
A diplomat told AFP that “the [liquor] store was packed” on Saturday, when she saw “people walking out with 30 bottles”.
 
 

The apparent loosening of the liquor regulations comes nearly two years after the kingdom opened its first and only liquor store in January 2024 in the capital’s diplomatic quarter, catering exclusively to non-Muslim foreign envoys.
There was no official announcement at the time, with two sources confirming the reports to AFP at the time.</p><small>2025-11-24 15:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/635271-girl-missing-from-islamabad-reunited-with-parents-in-karachi-after-17-years' target='_blank'><strong>Girl missing from Islamabad reunited with parents in Karachi after 17 years</strong></a><br><p>
