Earlier today, the PDMA urged citizens and provincial authorities to remain on high alert.
PDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia directed deputy commissioners and rescue agencies across the province to remain alert amid reports of wind and rain in various districts of Punjab, a statement by the PDMA said.
“Relevant departments to be on alert to deal with emergency situations,” the statement read, adding that the provincial control room and all district emergency operation centres have also been alerted.
The situation was being monitored 24/7 in the PDMA control room, DG Kathia said.
He added, “Citizens should be careful and stay away from electric poles and hanging wires.
“Stay in safe places to avoid lightning. Never stay in open places during bad weather and lightning. Avoid unnecessary travel and drive slowly.”
PDMA spokesperson Mazhar Hussain said, “The public can call PDMA helpline 1129 for assistance.”
Motorway Police spokesperson Syed Imran Ahmed said that M2 Motorway from Thokar to Kot Momin, M3 Motorway from Faizpur to Darkhana and Lahore-Sialkot Motorway were all closed due to the severe weather.
“Motorways are closed to ensure public safety and safe travel,” he added.
The spokesperson also said that dark clouds were visible on M4 Motorway from Abdul Hakeem to Sher Shah and M5 Motorway from Multan to Rahim Yar Khan.
“There is a severe thunderstorm at various places on the national highway from Lahore to Chichawatni as well as from Mian Channu, Khanewal, Multan and Lodhran,” he added.
He urged the public to be careful while driving and avoid speeding.
WASA DG Ghufran Ahmed also said, “All staff and machinery were instructed to remain on full alert. Pumps and staff will remain ready at all underpasses.”
Separately, the roof of a local factory in Sheikhupura collapsed due to a strong wind, killing a worker from Sadiqabad and seriously injuring five others, state media Pakistan Television reported.
The report stated that Rescue 1122 teams pulled out the dead body and the injured from the rubble and shifted them to the Sheikhupura District Headquarters Hospital.
The authority released a preliminary report on the damage caused by the storm across the province.
PDMA spokesperson Mazhar Hussain said, “Eight civilians have died and 45 people are injured due to the wind and storm.”
“The deaths occurred due to the collapse of dilapidated houses and being in unsafe locations,” he added.
The data released by the PDMA showed that three people died in Jhelum, one each in Rawalpindi, Sheikhupura, Nankana Sahib, Sialkot and Mianwali.
Several mud and dilapidated houses were also damaged due to the storm, the spokesperson said, adding, “There were incidents of falling trees and damage to solar panels in Lahore.”
Punjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed announced that medical assistance will be provided to the injured people, the PDMA statement read.
DG Kathia said that financial assistance will be provided to the affected families.
On Friday, the PDMA issued an alert about wind and dust storms in different areas of Punjab.
It said that the wind and dust storms would continue today with a possibility of rain in Rawalpindi, Murree, Attock, Chakwal, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Lahore, Kasur, Sialkot, Narowal, Faisalabad, Okara, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Khushab, Sargodha and Mianwali.
There would be rain in the south Punjab areas, including Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Bahawalpur and Bahawalnagar, it added.</p><small>2025-05-24 16:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/24141259b47c243.png?r=142019' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913040/pakistani-users-able-to-access-x-after-brief-disruption-amid-global-outage' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani users able to access X after brief disruption amid global outage</strong></a><br><p>Services on social media platform X were restored on Saturday evening as users in Pakistan were able to access the site.
According to real-time monitor Downdetector, fewer problem reports were submitted on Saturday evening, with a low of 40 complaints reported by 8:36pm.

Earlier, the Pakistan Telecommunications Authority (PTA) noted that social media platform X was facing a mass global outage, including in Pakistan, but stated that the country’s internet services “remain fully functional”.
According to a statement, the telecom body said that this disruption follows a similar one reported on Thursday, which was resolved by the platform itself.
“PTA’s investigation into the matter has confirmed that there are no technical issues at Pakistan’s internet gateways,” the statement read. “All other internet services across the country remain fully functional.”
The PTA added that global internet observatory NetBlocks also confirmed that the outages are international and “not related to any country-level internet disruptions or filtering”.
Users in Pakistan previously reported mass disruption on the social media platform, with real-time monitor Downdetector showing a peak of 372 outages at 5:36pm.
Over 600 complaints in total were reported on Saturday.

Earlier today, X said that it was working to resolve issues with various services that continued for a second day.
“We’re still experiencing issues from yesterday’s data centre outage. Login and signup services are unavailable for some users, and there may be delays in notifications and Premium features,” the engineering department of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s platform said on X.
“Our team is working 24/7 to resolve this. Thanks for your patience — updates soon,” it said at 5am PKT.
 






In the early hours of Friday, the platform had said: “X is aware some of our users are experiencing performance issues on the platform today. We are experiencing a data centre outage and the team is actively working to remediate the issue.”
 






With X stating a “data centre outage” as a reason for the service disruption, users speculated that a fire at the platform’s data centre in the US state of Oregon’s Hillsboro city was the cause of the issues.
A fire broke out on Thursday morning at the data centre leased by X, forcing an extended response from emergency crews, Wired reported, citing multiple sources. The sources required anonymity as they were not authorised to speak publicly about the company, it added.
According to the report, firefighters arrived at the Hillsboro Technology Park and found a “room with batteries that were deemed to be involved in the fire”.
Hillsboro Fire and Rescue spokesperson Piseth Pich told Wired that the fire had “not spread to other parts of the building, but said the room in question was heavy with smoke”.
X did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Wired. “It could not be learned whether server operations at the data centre had been affected by the incident,” the outlet noted.
Downdetector, which tracks outages, did not show problems reported by users at 1pm. However, outages had spiked to 76 at around 8:30pm last night.

While updates by X did not mention issues with messaging services, many users reported not being able to access their direct messages (DMs), with an error reading: “Cannot retrieve messages at this time. Please try again later.”
Some users also reported being logged out of their accounts, with an error stating “something went wrong”.
 






X had remained blocked in Pakistan since Feb 17, 2024 — when allegations of widespread rigging during the general elections gained momentum — but was restored on May 7 amid the recent conflict with India.
Musk, the billionaire head of Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, bought the platform (formerly Twitter) for $44 billion in late 2022. He rebranded it to X in July 2023, with the domain fully migrating to X.com in May 2024.
In March this year, Musk’s artificial intelligence company xAI acquired X in a deal that valued the social media network at $33 billion.
Musk, the world’s wealthiest man, is also a close ally of US President Donald Trump and heads the Department of Government Efficiency.</p><small>2025-05-24 16:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/242023207dc21ef.jpg?r=202418' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913074/anti-polio-campaign-to-vaccinate-over-10m-children-in-sindh-starts-on-may-26' target='_blank'><strong>Anti-polio campaign to vaccinate over 10m children in Sindh starts on May 26</strong></a><br><p>The Sindh government on Saturday announced that it is launching a five-day polio vaccination campaign in the province from May 26 to inoculate over 10 million children in the province.
Earlier this week, two new cases of polio were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Lakki Marwat and Bannu districts, taking the tally for the current year to 10.
According to a press release, the campaign aims to immunise more than 10.6m children under the age of five across all 30 districts of Sindh.
“The campaign is taking place from May 26 to June 1, 2025, and involves the efforts of over 80,000 trained polio workers going door-to-door with support from 25,539 law enforcement personnel to ensure that no child is missed,” the statement said. “Children between the ages of 6 and 59 months will also receive Vitamin A supplements to help boost their immunity.”

According to the press release, this new campaign follows two previous drives in February and April. Earlier this week, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah raised the issue of rising polio cases and expressed the need for accountability and collective action.
“With continued virus circulation in some environmental samples and four polio cases reported in Sindh so far this year, this latest round of vaccinations reinforces the province’s resolve to interrupt transmission and protect children from the lifelong consequences of this preventable disease,” the press release read.
“Polio anywhere is a threat to children everywhere,” it added, quoting a spokesperson from the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC) Sindh. “This campaign reflects our commitment to reach every child, even in the hardest-to-reach communities, and to ensure that Pakistan moves closer to eradication.”
According to the EOC, polio teams will be active in 1,292 union councils, supported by district administrations and healthcare partners, delivering polio drops and engaging families at the doorstep.
“EOC Sindh appeals to parents, teachers, religious leaders, community elders, and the media to join hands in this vital national effort,” the press release added. “To report missed children or ask questions about the vaccine, citizens can call the 1166 helpline or WhatsApp 0346-777-6546.”
Pakistan, one of the only two polio-endemic countries in the world, reported 74 cases in 2024.
Earlier today, the KP government set a target of vaccinating approximately 7.3 million children under the age of five during a five-day anti-polio campaign, which also begins on Monday.
Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah inaugurated the campaign during a ceremony at Services Hospital, according to a press release.
Additional Secretary Health and Emergency Operations Centre coordinator Shafiullah Khan, representatives from Unicef and the World Health Organisation, and other officials were in attendance.</p><small>2025-05-24 15:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606030-private-airline-flight-to-lahore-escapes-disaster-caught-in-heavy-turbulence' target='_blank'><strong>Private airline flight to Lahore escapes disaster, caught in heavy turbulence</strong></a><br><p>

The suspect, a 39-year-old woman, is accused of going on a stabbing spree on Friday at the main station in Hamburg, stunning the northern city in the middle of the evening rush hour.
The woman has “very clear indications of a psychological illness”, police said in a statement, without giving further details on her condition. They added that there were no signs she was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the attack, which left four victims seriously wounded.
The woman was subdued by two passersby and law enforcement officers before being taken into custody at the scene without resisting arrest, police said. She was due to appear before a judge later on Saturday.
Police say they have ruled out a “political motive” for the attack and believe the suspect acted alone.
The victims range in age from 19 to 85.
The four in serious condition were a 24-year-old man and three women, aged 24, 52 and 85, police said. Emergency officials initially said their wounds were life-threatening, but police say all the victims now appear to be out of immediate danger.
Rush hour
The attack took place just after 6:00 pm (1600 GMT) on Friday on one of the platforms in front of a standing train, German media reported.
The suspect was thought to have turned “against passengers” at the station, a spokeswoman for the Hanover federal police directorate, which also covers Hamburg, told AFP.
Some of the victims were treated on board waiting trains in the station, German daily Bild reported.
Images of the scene showed access to the platforms at one end of the station blocked off by police and people being loaded into waiting ambulances. Forensic police could also be seen walking up and down the platforms where the attack took place.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz expressed his shock in a call with the mayor of Hamburg.
“My thoughts are with the victims and their families,” Merz said, according to a readout from a spokesman.
Germany has been rocked in recent months by a series of violent attacks with often extremist motivations that have put security at the top of the agenda.
The most recent, on Sunday, saw four people injured in a stabbing at a bar in the city of Bielefeld.
The investigation into that attack has been handed over to federal prosecutors after the Syrian suspect told the police officers who arrested him that he had extremist beliefs.
The question of security, and the immigrant origin of some of the attackers, was a major topic during Germany’s recent election campaign.
Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU topped the February vote, which also saw a record score of more than 20 per cent for the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Last year, Germany toughened its legislation on carrying knives, now banned at public gatherings and on long-distance trains. They are also banned in specific zones in some cities, including Hamburg’s train station.
Experts and police unions have previously questioned whether such bans are effective.</p><small>2025-05-24 14:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2417382632715f9.jpg?r=191445' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913061/field-marshal-munir-lauds-political-leaderships-strategic-foresight-during-marka-i-haq' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Munir lauds political leadership’s strategic foresight during Marka-i-Haq</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has lauded the strategic foresight of the country’s political leadership during Marka-i-Haq that ensured the country’s success in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos against India, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.
Earlier this week, the government promoted Gen Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his “strategic leadership and decisive role” in defeating India during the military confrontation between the two countries that ended with a US-mediated ceasefire.
Field marshal is the highest rank in armies modelled after the British Army. In Pakistan, it was awarded only once before, to General Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1959.
President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated the army chief with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at the Presidency earlier this week.
According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), while hosting a dinner, the army chief expressed profound gratitude to the political leadership for their strategic foresight during Marka-i-Haq and lauded the seamless inter-services coordination that ensured operational success in Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos.
Field Marshal Munir also acknowledged the unwavering role of the youth and media in countering the disinformation campaign waged by India, describing them as a “steel wall” against malign propaganda.
“The COAS also commended the outstanding contributions of Pakistani scientists, engineers, and diplomats, whose professionalism and resolve proved critical during the conflict,” the press release said.
“The dinner was hosted to honour the political leadership, steadfast commitment of the armed forces, and the indomitable spirit of the people demonstrated during Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos,” it added.
According to the ISPR, the participants of the event included President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, federal ministers, governors, chief ministers, chairman joint chiefs of staff committee, air and naval staff chiefs,  senior leadership of major political parties, high-ranking government officials and senior officers from the three services.
“Participants paid tribute to the sagacious leadership that steered the nation through a defining moment, hailed the courage and sacrifice of the armed forces, and commended the resolute patriotism of the Pakistani people,” it added.
“The evening stood as a powerful affirmation of national unity and the collective resolve to advance with renewed strength and cohesion,” the press release said.</p><small>2025-05-24 14:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606004-pakistanis-deported-abroad-to-face-passport-cancellation-police-action-naqvi' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistanis deported from abroad to face passport cancellation, police action: Naqvi</strong></a><br><p>

Nahid Islam, leader of the National Citizen Party (NCP), made up of many students who spearheaded the uprising that ended Hasina’s 15-year iron-fisted rule last year, said he worried about an “anti-democratic” future.
Muhammad Yunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner leading the caretaker government until elections are held, has called for rival political parties jostling for power to give him their full support.
Bangladesh has a long history of coups, and the army retains a powerful role.
Islam, an ally of Yunus who previously served in his cabinet, told reporters on Saturday that he foresaw a situation similar to January 11, 2007, when a state of emergency was declared, resulting in a two-year-long military-backed government.
“There are indications that a 1/11-style military-backed government could re-emerge — one that is anti-democratic and anti-people,” Islam said.
‘Should not interfere’
Bangladesh’s political crisis escalated this week as rival parties protested with competing demands.
Army chief General Wakeruz Zaman said this week that elections should be held by December, Dhaka’s newspapers reported, aligning with the demands of the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
But Islam said that the military’s role was “to ensure national security” and not to get involved in politics.
“While the military is an essential institution for state security, it should not interfere in political affairs,” he said.
Yunus has said elections could come as early as December, but holding them later, at the latest by June 2026, would allow more time for the democratic reforms he says are needed.
Islam said it was for those reforms that students launched their protests last year, but that Yunus told him during a meeting on Thursday that the pressure put on him had frustrated him.
“He assumed office to bring about fundamental change. People expect to see trials, reforms, and a peaceful transition of power. Under the current circumstances, he feels he cannot deliver to those expectations,” Islam said.
“There is a real fear that elections may not be free and fair but instead heavily restricted.”</p><small>2025-05-24 13:32</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/241811109bb393f.jpg?r=181123' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913054/sindh-cm-meets-wb-delegation-to-discuss-wash-project-flood-relief-housing' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh CM meets WB delegation to discuss WASH project, flood relief housing</strong></a><br><p>Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Saturday held a meeting with a World Bank delegation to discuss the launch of the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) project and the ongoing flood relief housing efforts as well as other initiatives in the province.
The meeting, which took place at the CM House in Karachi, included WB managing director Anna Bejarred, country director Naji Bin Hussein and other officials from the Bank, a statement by the CM House read.
 






Both the Sindh government and WB sides agreed on the effective initiation of the WASH project aimed at improving access to clean water, sanitation, and hygiene practices across the province, according to the statement.
“The initiative targeted 3,200 flood-affected villages, providing essential facilities to enhance public health and living conditions,” it added.
CM Murad highlighted that the WASH project was being launched with a total budget of $270 million, benefiting approximately 1.5m people, with breakdown includes $75m from the World Bank, $13m from the Islamic Development Bank, $100m from the Asian Development Bank, and $100m from the Sindh government.
The meeting also discussed the Sindh People’s Housing Project. CM Murad noted that the 2022 floods submerged 70 per cent of Sindh, affecting 12.36 million people and destroying 2.1 million homes.
“The housing project covered a rural population of 15 million, exceeding the population of 154 countries worldwide,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying.
 
 

“So far, 120,000 bank accounts of eligible beneficiaries were opened, and financial assistance was distributed to 1.15 million individuals,” he added.
“Around 750,000 house foundations have been completed, with 500,000 homes in the final stages of construction. Additionally, 900,000 land ownership certificates have been issued in the names of women, empowering them economically and socially.”
The chief minister also said that the project has generated over one million employment opportunities, providing vital livelihoods for affected communities.
During the visit, the WB delegation also toured a photo gallery at the CM House featuring prominent Pakistani women, from Fatima Jinnah to other national icons. The delegation appreciated the historical architecture and artistic presentation of the residence.
A day earlier, CM Murad and Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari visited a flood rehabilitation housing project in Shaheed Benazirabad district of Sindh, accompanying a delegation of WB officials. During the visit, WB’s Bejerde reaffirmed the bank’s commitment to supporting the Sindh government’s flood recovery efforts.</p><small>2025-05-24 13:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606010-four-missing-tourists-from-gujrat-found-dead-in-skardu-ravine' target='_blank'><strong>Four missing tourists from Gujrat found dead in Skardu ravine</strong></a><br><p>

Earlier this month, the minister had announced that the federal budget would be presented on June 2, however, Adviser to the Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad said yesterday that the budget would be presented on June 10, while the Pakistan Economic Survey would be released a day earlier.
Meeting a delegation at the Institution of Engineers Pakistan (IEP) in Lahore, led by IEP Secretary General Engr Ameer Zameer, the planning minister told reporters that the budget had not been delayed due to any pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but because of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s upcoming visit to friendly nations and the Eidul Azha holidays.
“We had very good negotiations with the IMF,” Iqbal said. “As you’ve seen, they acknowledged our government’s efforts. The main reason behind the delay is the PM’s five-day visit to friendly countries … and Eid after that.
“We decided to present the budget after Eid so that we can easily convene a meeting of parliament afterwards,” he added.
Iqbal said that the government wants to minimise the burden on the general public, but noted that defence spending would increase to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty.
“It is our national duty to provide the armed forces with whatever they need in this budget to bolster their capacity and defend our country in the future,” the minister said. “It has been proven that we have a dangerous neighbour (India) who attacked us in the night, but we gave them a befitting response.”
He added that the country must “remain ready to respond if they attack again”.
Speaking about Pakistani water security, Iqbal said that the country will fast-track water projects, including the Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams.
“We are prioritising them so that Pakistani water is secure,” he said.
“The PM has sent over a thousand agricultural engineers to China for training, who will complete their training this year and bring about an agricultural Green Revolution 2.0,” he explained. “We aim to develop our own seeds and modernise our dairy and livestock sectors.”
Iqbal added that within the budget, funding has been allocated for an internship for engineers. “Thousands of young engineers across the country will be able to receive on-the-job training so that they receive better job opportunities in the market.”
However, he stated that Pakistan would only have a development budget of Rs1 trillion to do all of this.
“Our ministers required Rs3tr to complete our ongoing projects. But, because of this shortfall, we are putting a cap on low-priority projects and will try to complete our high-priority projects as quickly as possible.
Political unity
When asked about political relations with the PTI and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, Iqbal expressed that there needs to be unity among all political actors.
Criticising the PTI, he said, “When we passed the 26th Constitutional Amendment, we tried to take all parties on board and reach a consensus. But when the PTI took this to their founder, he vetoed it.
“Similarly, when the nation is standing behind Field Marshal Asim Munir’s leadership, look at the statements the PTI founder is giving about him,” Iqbal added. “At a time when we need national solidarity, he is only thinking about retaliation.”</p><small>2025-05-24 12:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/241649419278b98.jpg?r=164947' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913053/indias-monsoon-rains-arrive-8-days-early-earliest-in-16-years' target='_blank'><strong>India’s monsoon rains arrive 8 days early, earliest in 16 years</strong></a><br><p>Monsoon rains hit the coast of India’s southernmost state of Kerala on Saturday, eight days earlier than usual, marking the earliest arrival in 16 years and providing the promise of a bumper harvest and relief from a gruelling heatwave.
The monsoon, the lifeblood of the country’s $4 trillion economy, delivers nearly 70 per cent of the rain that India needs to water farms and replenish aquifers and reservoirs. Nearly half of India’s farmland, without any irrigation cover, depends on the annual June-September rains to grow a number of crops.
Summer rains usually begin to lash Kerala around June 1 before spreading nationwide by mid-July, allowing farmers to plant crops such as rice, corn, cotton, soybeans and sugarcane.
The onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala on May 24 is its earliest onset since May 23, 2009, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday.
The monsoon has covered Kerala and parts of neighbouring Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, as well as parts of the northeastern state of Mizoram, the IMD said.
Conditions are favourable for the monsoon’s further spread into Goa, parts of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, the northeastern states, West Bengal, and the remaining parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu over the next two to three days.
Surplus pre-monsoon rainfall and an early monsoon onset will help farmers, especially in the southern and central states, to sow summer crops earlier than usual, said Ashwini Bansod, vice president for commodities research at Phillip Capital India, a Mumbai-based brokerage.
“Abundant soil moisture and early sowing could potentially boost crop yields,” Bansod said.
Last year, the monsoon reached the coast of Kerala on May 30, and overall summer rains were the highest since 2020, supporting recovery from a drought in 2023.
The IMD last month forecast above-average monsoon rains for the second straight year in 2025.
The department defines average or normal rainfall as ranging between 96pc and 104pc of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the four-month season.</p><small>2025-05-24 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/241404082dd1201.png?r=151213' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913042/four-missing-tourists-from-gujrat-found-dead-along-river-bank-in-skardu' target='_blank'><strong>Four missing tourists from Gujrat found dead along river bank in Skardu</strong></a><br><p>Four tourists from Gujrat who went missing in Gilgit-Baltistan on May 16 were finally located on Saturday morning at the bank of Indus River near Istak village in Skardu’s Roundu valley.
Family sources said Wasif Shahzad, 36, and Umar Ehsan, 20, both cousins from Kot Gakka near Mangowal; Salman Nasrullah Sandhu, 23, of Jassoki village; and Usman Dar, 23, of Saroki had arrived in Gilgit on May 13.
Gilgit range Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Raja Mirza Hassan said that according to police records, the four friends had started their travel from Hunza to Skardu on May 15. On the way they had stayed in a hotel near Karakoram at Danyor in Gilgit.
The four friends had resumed their journey to Skardu on May 16 and since then their mobile phones could not be reached.
Skardu Deputy Commissioner Arif Ahmad today confirmed that the location of the missing tourists’ vehicle has been traced near Satak Nala.
The vehicle had fallen into a deep gorge on the bank of the river below the Baltistan Highway after an accident.
Rescue 1122 and other rescue teams had been immediately dispatched to the scene to retrieve the bodies of the victims.
The relatives of the deceased youth were also taken to the accident site.
DIG Hassan said the last location of the missing friends was Jaglot town in Gilgit.
The DIG, citing the travellers’ reported plan, said they were supposed to arrive at Skardu’s Istak area. He said their whereabouts could not be traced by search teams till Saturday.
The GB police and Rescue 1122 had been jointly searching the missing friends at Jaglot-Skardu from Jaglot to Istak, according to the DIG.
An official of Rescue 1122 told Dawn.com that the car which was travelling to Skardu fell down in a deep ditch around 500 feet below the road.
Local police were busy searching for the missing tourists when this morning a white vehicle was seen down in a deep gorge on the bank of the river below Ganji Padi below the Baltistan Highway.
Istak Station House Officer (SHO) Ali Faro called the rescue team to the scene. A joint team of police and rescue was trying to reach the vehicle, but they were facing a lot of difficulty it.
A crane was being arranged to bring the car up.

“The accident occurred due to high speed, due to which the vehicle went straight into a deep gorge,” the SHO said.
“One body is seen out of the vehicle while three are inside it. Rescue personnel are using ropes to reach the bodies.”
According to a statement issued by Rescue 1122, its Gilgit team launched the search operation soon after they went missing on May 16.
Father of one of the missing person said they lost communication with them on May 16. He had appealed to the GB government, chief secretary and police chief to help trace the missing friends.
The search operation was carried out at various locations from Alam bridge to Shangus area, while Rescue 1122 team searched in Skardu. During the operation, the rescue personnel obtained information about the movement of tourists from police check posts while information was collected from local hotel owners and people of the area.
“The road passes through terrain along with Indus River, where flow of water is dangerously high these days,” DIG Hassan said.
The search was extended in remote and difficult areas with the help of binoculars to scout possible accident sites.
Many incidents happen at Baltistan road due to the difficult terrain, particularly from Gilgit’s Jaglot to Skardu’s Istak area, where vehicles fall into Indus River.</p><small>2025-05-24 11:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/2415562965866ad.jpg?r=155642' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1913049/nab-recovers-and-disburses-rs88bn-during-first-quarter-of-2025' target='_blank'><strong>NAB recovers and disburses Rs88bn during first quarter of 2025</strong></a><br><p>The National Accountability Bureau recovered and disbursed over Rs88 billion during the first quarter of 2025, state-run Radio Pakistan reported on Saturday.
This was announced during the 24th “DGs Conference” of the bureau, a three-day event that concluded at NAB headquarters in Islamabad.
According to a press release, these recoveries included direct recoveries worth over Rs2bn and indirect recoveries amounting to Rs86bn.
The recoveries were made from public and private lands associated with cases of illegal transfer and occupation, Radio Pakistan said, adding that the disbursed amounts were returned to the relevant affected entities.
Regarding indirect recoveries, NAB Balochistan retrieved state land measuring 340 acres of Chiltan Park and 250 acres of forest department which translate into Ra6.45bn.
NAB Lahore recovered Rs70.87bn in three mega cases including Employees Cooperative Housing Society, State Life Insurance Employees Cooperative Housing Society and Sarwar Omega Villas.
NAB Multan recovered Rs13 million in GFS 7 Wonders Housing Scheme while NAB Sukkur recovered 610 acres of NHA land worth of 8.53bn.
Regarding disbursement of direct recoveries, NAB transferred Rs9.72m directly to the federal government, Rs10.80m to provincial governments and Rs73. 51m to different departments or financial institutions.
A significant portion amounting to Rs1.99bn has also been directly distributed to over 19,000 victims of various scams.
These recoveries were made from individuals and entities through plea bargains, voluntary returns and settlements.
“NAB remains resolute in its mission to recover looted public funds and advance its vision of a corruption-free Pakistan,” Radio Pakistan reported.</p><small>2025-05-24 11:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605992-pakistan-to-fast-track-hydro-projects-following-indias-suspension-of-water-treaty' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan to 'fast-track hydro projects' following India's suspension of water treaty</strong></a><br><p>

Last week, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to send a “high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to expose Indian propaganda” in the aftermath of the recent military escalation with India.
Speaking on DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’ on Friday night, when asked if PTI should also be included in the delegation, Khan said: “All stakeholders are welcome to get this country out of this crisis.”
“We need to be on one page and fight the country’s case. Prime Minister [Shehbaz] sahib has made the right choice by choosing Bilawal [Bhutto-Zardari] sahib to continue fighting Pakistan’s case in international forums,” Khan added.
 


The military confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad came as tensions over last month’s Pahalgam attack continued to build up, as India — without evidence — blamed Pakistan for the attack. On the night of May 6-7, India launched a series of air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir, resulting in civilian casualties. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets.
After intercepting drones sent by India and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally drop their guns and declare a ceasefire. India has since continued its aggressive posturing even as Pakistan has warned against any further military aggression and offered talks.
In light of the situation, PM Shehbaz decided to send a high-level diplomatic delegation to important world capitals to counter Indian propaganda related to the escalation and the Pahalgam attack.
The premier entrusted the delegation’s leadership to PPP chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, who said he would “present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.
The delegation also includes Climate Change Minister Dr Musadik Malik; former foreign ministers Khurram Dastgir and Hina Rabbani Khar; Senators Sherry Rehman and Faisal Subzwari; as well as senior diplomats Tehmina Janjua and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
 
 

“The delegation will visit London, Washington, Paris and Brussels to highlight India’s disinformation campaign and its attempts to destabilise regional peace,” Radio Pakistan had said.
A PPP delegation comprising Bilawal, Rehman and Khar met with PM Shehbaz yesterday to seek guidance to highlight Pakistan’s stance before important global powers.
In a similar development, the Indian government has also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.</p><small>2025-05-24 10:14</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605983-woman-abducted-in-broad-daylight-from-lahores-dha' target='_blank'><strong>Woman abducted in broad daylight from Lahore's DHA</strong></a><br><p>

Saudi Arabia deported a total of 5,033 Pakistani beggars whereas another 369 individuals have been apprehended for begging in five other countries in the last 16 months.
Last month, the interior minister had said that the government would block the passports of Pakistanis deported, and tighten the process of issuing new travel documents.
Around 106 Pakistanis were also deported from European countries arrived in Islamabad last month.
According to state-run PTV News, an important meeting, led by the interior minister, was held in Islamabad where it was decided that deportees who were coming back will have their passports cancelled and an FIR will also be registered against them.
The names of the deportees will also be put on the passport control list for five years, PTV News added.
A committee was also formed under the chairmanship of the interior secretary to further tighten and improve passport laws.
Naqvi was quoted as saying that the deportees were causing embarrassment to Pakistan at an international level, adding that no concessions would be made to them in the future.</p><small>2025-05-24 10:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605979-rain-spell-brings-relief-to-islamabad-rawalpindi' target='_blank'><strong>Rain spell brings relief to Islamabad, Rawalpindi</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan and the Fund had opened high-level policy talks in Islamabad on May 19 to discuss the FY2025-26 budget. As deliberations with the IMF remained inconclusive, the government has postponed the budget announcement till June 10.
In a statement issued today, the IMF’s Pakistan mission chief Nathan Porter termed the recent discussions “constructive” and said: “We will continue discussions towards agreeing over the authorities’ FY26 budget over the coming days.”
“Discussions focused on actions to enhance revenue — including by bolstering compliance and expanding the tax base — and prioritise expenditure,” Porter added.
 
 

“We held constructive discussions with the authorities on their FY2026 budget proposals and broader economic policy, and reform agenda supported by the 2024 Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the 2025 Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF),” Porter said, referring to the $7 billion loan programme and the climate fund deal, respectively.
“The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation while safeguarding social and priority expenditures, aiming for a primary surplus of 1.6 per cent of GDP in FY2026,” the IMF official added.
The Fund noted that the staff visit “focused on recent economic developments, programme implementation, and the budget strategy” for FY2025-26.
Shedding light on other matters reviewed, Porter said: “Discussions also covered ongoing energy sector reforms aimed at improving financial viability and reducing the high-cost structure of Pakistan’s power sector as well as other structural reforms which will help foster sustainable growth and promote a more level playing field for business and investment.”
The government emphasised its commitment to “ensuring sound macroeconomic policy making and building buffers”, according to the statement.
“In this context, maintaining an appropriately tight and data-dependent monetary policy remains a priority to ensure inflation is anchored within the central bank’s medium-term target range of 5–7 per cent,” Porter stressed.
“At the same time, rebuilding foreign exchange (FX) reserve buffers, preserving a fully functioning FX market, and allowing for greater exchange rate flexibility are critical to strengthening resilience to external shocks.”
The IMF mission appreciated the federal and provincial authorities for their “hospitality, constructive discussions, and strong collaboration and commitment to sound policies”.
Affirming that it will continue its close dialogue with the authorities, the IMF said its next mission associated with the next EFF and RSF reviews was expected in the second half of 2025.
Imran seeks meeting with finance minister
As the federal government gears up for the budget, incarcerated ex-prime minister Imran Khan, whose PTI rules Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has called on Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to meet him before the budget announcment.
A post on Imran’s X account quoted Imran’s purported conversation with lawyers at Rawalpindi’s Adiala Jail, where he is imprisoned. The former premier doesn’t have access to his X account and someone else posts on his behalf, but the PTI has never revealed the identity of the social media handler.
The post read: “As party chairman, it is necessary for the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to seek my guidance on budgetary and policy matters.
“The people have elected PTI to govern, and therefore, the responsibility for policymaking also rests with us. Consequently, it is essential that [KP Chief Minister] Ali Amin Gandapur and the finance minister meet with me before the budget is presented,” it added.
 






In his post, Imran again stressed the importance of national unity. “The economy is in shambles; investors and the youth are steadily leaving the country,” he claimed, stating it as one of his reasons to call for a dialogue.
The KP government has called upon its federal counterpart to immediately convene a meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) and ensure the transfer of the constitutional share of funds allocated for the merged districts to the provincial government before the budget announcement.
Considerations for budget
During the staff visit, the IMF mission had multiple rounds of discussion yesterday, including a wrap-up session with Aurangzeb, informed sources said.
An IMF delegation led by the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department, Jihad Azour, met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday and with President Asif Ali Zardari the next day.
 
 

The defence allocations for next year had a reasonable budgetary impact, which could not be settled with the IMF staff before the meeting with Aurangzeb, although discussions between the Federal Board of Revenue’s top brass and the staff mission continued until evening.
Sources said the engagements with the IMF would now continue virtually over the next week till finalisation of the defence budget, and as a result, the revenue side of the equation and other estimates under the budget, including the federal public sector development programme that was now estimated at Rs1tr.
Sources said there is no plan to increase the rate of petroleum levy in the near future, except for a separate imposition of carbon levy on a number of items, starting with about Rs3 per litre and going up to Rs5 in the second year to meet a requirement of the RSF.
 
 

The sources said the relief measures for the salaried class, real estate, and expenditure control measures had been discussed with the IMF staff, but this would remain subject to an alternative resource envelope to be presented by the authorities, as fiscal consolidation would remain one of the central themes of the next year’s budget.
The budget announcement would be immediately followed by a comprehensive debate in the house and enable standing committees on finance to read through budget proposals and give their input before its passage by the two houses, well before June 30.</p><small>2025-05-24 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605962-more-than-63000-pakistani-quotas-haj-allocations-lapse' target='_blank'><strong>More than 63,000 Hajj quota allocations for Pakistan lapse</strong></a><br><p>

The sharp escalation in US President Donald Trump’s longstanding feud with the prestigious university came as tensions simmer between Washington and Beijing over trade and other issues.
The Trump administration’s decision on Thursday — which was temporarily halted by a US judge after Harvard sued — has thrown the future of thousands of foreign students and the lucrative income stream they provide into doubt.
On Friday, Hong Kong Education Secretary Christine Choi called on universities in the Chinese city to welcome “outstanding students from all over the world”.
“For international students affected by the United States’ student admission policy, the Education Bureau (EDB) has appealed to all universities in Hong Kong to provide facilitation measures for eligible students,” Choi said in a statement, noting the ban on Harvard’s admission of international students.
She said local universities were making use of government measures, including relaxing the maximum limits on foreign students to attract more to Hong Kong.
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Friday invited international students enrolled at Harvard, as well as anyone with offers to attend the elite school, to continue their studies at HKUST.
“HKUST is extending this opportunity to ensure talented students can pursue their educational goals without disruption,” it said in a statement.
The university “will provide unconditional offers, streamlined admission procedures, and academic support to facilitate a seamless transition for interested students”, it added.
Harvard is ranked number one in US News and World Report’s most recent list of the world’s top universities, while HKUST is 105 out of more than 2,000 ranked.
President Trump is furious at Harvard for rejecting his administration’s push for oversight on admissions and hiring amid his claims the school is a hotbed of anti-Semitism and “woke” liberal ideology.
A US judge on Friday halted the administration’s move to prevent Harvard from admitting foreign students after the university sued, calling the government’s action unlawful.
US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Thursday that the administration’s decision would hold Harvard “accountable for fostering violence, anti-Semitism, and coordinating with the Chinese Communist Party on its campus”.
Beijing condemned the “politicisation of educational cooperation”, adding that the move by Washington would “only harm the image and international standing of the United States”.
Around 1,300 Chinese students are enrolled at Harvard, around a fifth of its international student body, according to university data.
Hundreds of thousands more attend other US colleges and universities, long viewed by many in China as beacons of academic freedom and rigour.</p><small>2025-05-24 07:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/23143057fdaa0b3.jpg?r=120348' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1912827/in-new-attack-trump-spending-bill-will-hike-taxes-on-elite-colleges' target='_blank'><strong>In new attack, Trump spending bill will hike taxes on elite colleges</strong></a><br><p>The spending bill passed by the US House increases a tax the richest private universities pay on their endowment investment gains, a move proponents say reins in “woke” schools but that critics say will wind up hurting the poorest students the most.
Tucked within US President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill the House narrowly passed on Thursday is a proposal to increase a tax that some universities pay on the investment returns of their endowments from 1.4 per cent to as high as 21pc for some of the most elite colleges in the country.
The measure, part of the bill headed to the Republican-controlled Senate, is considered another front in Trump’s attack on elite colleges that he says are overrun by left-wing extremist thought and are cradles of anti-American and antisemitic movements. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University’s ability to enroll foreign students, a move the university said was illegal.
Representative Jason Smith, a Republican of Missouri and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said shortly after his committee passed the bill that “for too long, universities have received beneficial treatment from our tax code while disregarding the interest of taxpayers.” A fact sheet Smith put out states that the tax “holds woke, elite universities that operate more like major corporations and other tax-exempt entities accountable.”
Premier universities say the bulk of most endowments is attached to specific projects as mandated by donors. So if they are spending more money on taxes, they will not be able to make up for it from their endowments. Instead, they will spend less elsewhere.
 
 

Luisa Rapport, a spokesperson for Stanford University, said the proposed tax hike “will directly reduce financial aid for undergraduates, support for faculty and graduate students, and funding for research programs.”
Kimberly Allen, a spokesperson for MIT, said the proposal is “basically a tax on national research and student aid, and at MIT alone it would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from our budget each year.”
Excellence, access at risk
During Trump’s first term in office, the current 1.4pc tax was levied on schools whose per student endowment was $500,000 or more — that is, the size of the endowment divided by the number of full-time students.
In 2023, 56 private schools paid that tax, and total receipts were about $380 million, according to the IRS.
Under the new proposal, schools with a per student endowment of $2 million or more would pay 21pc. International students would not count in that denominator under the bill, meaning schools with large populations of foreign students, like many of the elite universities Trump has targeted, would be punished.
Schools with a per student endowment of $1.25m to $2m would be taxed 14pc; schools with a per student endowment between $750,000 and $1.25m would be taxed 7pc; and those with endowments of $500,000 to $750,000 per student would be taxed 1.4pc.
The American Council on Education, a higher education lobbying and advocacy organization with 1,600 members, has fought the endowment tax since it was first created. Steven Bloom, who specializes in tax issues and endowments at the council, said the new proposal “takes very bad tax policy passed in 2017 and makes it more expensive and more complicated”.
Phillip Levine, an economics professor at Wellesley College, estimates the new tax would cost elite universities like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT and Princeton, between $400m and $850m a year each.
Levine said that despite having some of the highest tuition prices, elite Ivy League schools with large endowments are able to offer massive financial aid packages for kids from poorer backgrounds.
“These are institutions that can offer excellence and access for lower-income students,” Levine said. “Both of those are at risk in the presence of a large endowment tax.”
Laura Wirick, a managing principal at Meketa Investments, a consultancy firm that advises endowments on how to allocate money, said if the highest proposed tax rate of 21pc goes through, it may push money away from elite schools as donors “might not donate funds because they might be best put to work with a tax-exempt institution”.</p><small>2025-05-24 07:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/605957-us-based-pakistani-doctors-back-in-country-for-fresh-backdoor-talks-on-imran-khan' target='_blank'><strong>US-based Pakistani doctors back in country for fresh backdoor talks on Imran Khan</strong></a><br><p>

In another incident, a woman was gunned down allegedly by her husband in Orangi Town on Friday.
Mominabad police officer Mohammed Shoaib said that Rukhsana, 56, was shot and killed by her husband Gul Sher, 58, inside their home in Fareed Colony, Sector-10. 
The suspect managed to escape, he said, adding that the couple often quarrelled with each other over some family issues. 
He said that Gul Sher shot at and wounded his wife in the morning and fled.

The game to decide which side faces Quetta Gladiators in Sunday’s final of the HBL Pakistan Super League turned out to be a show of Qalandar’s potency as they swept past United with unenviable ease — it was a no-contest in the end.
Now-deposed champions United had started the season with a bang, only to be left limping in the end. The Qalandars had a see-saw campaign but turned when it mattered most — in the clutch moments. A day after they sank Karachi Kings in the Eliminator, they thrashed United by 95 runs at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday.
They wrapped up United’s response to an imposing 203-run target with 4.5 overs to spare; skipper Shaheen Shah Afridi leading from the front with incredible figures of 3-3 and ending the proceedings with his new-ball partner Salman Mirza, who took 3-16, taking a superb catch to dismiss Haider Ali.
 


Half centuries earlier by Kusal Perera (61) and Mohammad Naeem (50) had laid the platform for the Qalandars and with pacers Shaheen and Salman on fire, United folded for a paltry 107. Spinner Rishad Hossain also worked his magic for the Qalandars with 3-34.
Shaheen and Mirza sent the respective stumps of United openers Mohammad Shahzad and Sahibzada Farhan flying in the first two overs as the new ball seamed sharply off the surface.
Mirza returned to find the edge of Rassie van der Dussen’s bat for the South African to get caught behind by a diving Perera. The left-armer got another wicket in form of Imad Wasim, who failed to clear mid-on, where Fakhar Zaman took an easy catch as United reeled at 33-4 by the end of the powerplay.
Salman Ali Agha initiated a fightback of sorts, cutting for four and pulling for six off leg-spinner Rishad Hossain in the eighth over. Another attempt to go big did not fare well for Agha, who holed Rishad out to Naeem at long-on as the scorecard read 72-5 by the 10th over.
United captain Shadab Khan, who too had tried to get his team out of trouble with his 26 off 14 (three sixes), also fell to Rishad, miscuing to find Asif Ali at long-off before the spinner caught the incoming James Neesham off his own bowling as United crumbled.
Naseem Shah’s run out pushed United further into doom before Shaheen cleaned up Tymal Mills and dismissed Haider to end the proceedings.
Earlier,  Naeem unleashed an onslaught over United right from the word go, especially taking on Naseem for three boundaries and a six in the fifth over as Qalandars posted 58-1 in the powerplay.
The emerging right-hander swept Shadab for a four before launching the leg-spinner over long-on for six, but another attempt to go for a big shot in the next over saw Naeem get stumped off Imad’s left-arm spin.
Abdullah Shafique and Perera — who had combined to win the first Eliminator a day earlier — hit a boundary each off Shadab as Qalandars reached 93-2 at halfway stage.
However, Abdullah, who had shown immense form in the previous match, became prey to Shadab’s acrobatic dive to his right for a catch at mid-off off Neesham’s medium pace in the 12th over.
But Perera, still at the crease, continued to show his prowess, especially through the off-side, gloriously driving Neesham for four before finding the gap through backward point off Salman Irshad.
Qalandars crossed the 150-run mark after Perera’s compatriot at the other end, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, lifted Tymal Mills over extra cover for six before driving through mid-off for four. The left-hander, however, fell victim to a perfect yorker by Salman after adding 22 off 13 (two fours and a six).
Perera brought up half half-century in 31 balls, pulling over fine leg and slashing over third man for sixes off Naseem in the 18th over, in which the pacer conceded a total of 21 runs.
Asif’s ramp and drive for sixes off Salman before getting dismissed and boundaries each by Perera and Rishad then took Qalandars to a total that was more than enough for the side to seal a place in the decider.

He was addressing a press conference at Gurdwara Panja Sahib Hassanabdal on Friday. Chairman of the Evacuee Trust Property Board Dr Muhammad Sajid Chau­han, Additional Secretary Shrines Saifullah Khokhar, Rawalpindi Zone Administrator Tanveer Hus­sain, Deputy Administrator Yasir Asghar Monga, and other leaders of the Sikh community were also present on this occasion.
He strongly condemned the Indian government’s move to not allow Indian Sikh pilgrims to offer religious rituals in June on the martyrdom anniversary of Guru Arjan Dev Ji and the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.
The minister stated that the Modi-led government is rattled by Pakistan’s diplomatic success and is now resorting to religious restrictions in clear violation of international laws.

Minister says Modi-led govt rattled by Pakistan’s diplomatic success

“By denying pilgrims the right to perform their religious duties, India is undermining religious freedom,” he said.
 
 

He condemned what he called the “misleading and false narrative” regarding a recent attack on the Golden Temple, calling it a deliberate distortion aimed at fuelling tensions, adding that the respect and protection provided to religious sites of minorities in Pakistan is exemplary to the world.
The minister also lauded the unwavering support shown by religious minorities in Pakistan, especially Sikhs, for the government and armed forces, especially in times of regional tension.
“Any restrictions imposed by India on pilgrims wishing to undertake the pilgrimage would be a blatant violation of religious freedom and fundamental hum­an rights,” he said.
Urging the Indian government to abandon religious discrimination, he cal­led for the immediate issuance of visas to Sikh pilgrims.
“Reli­gious freedom must be upheld, not restricted,” he asserted.
Private Haj operators slammed
While responding to a question, the minister blamed private operators as thousands missed Haj under private schemes.
He was of the opinion that private tour operators were responsible for the losses faced by pilgrims, explaining that no new quota was being granted and that only 25,698 pilgrims would be able to travel to the holy land under the private Haj scheme.
He said the current Haj policy was approved in November, and its implementation began thereafter. He said that Pakistan’s total Haj quota is 179,210.
The government successfully utilised its share according to Saudi regulations, but the private sector failed to use its full 50 per cent share. He said that Pakistan’s Haj quota was divided equally between the government and the private sector.
 
 

The government fulfilled its res­ponsibility in a timely manner, com­­pleting the process and getting approvals for pilgrims without del­ay.
He blamed the private sector for failing to act on time, working against Saudi guidelines, and ultimately causing harm to the pilgrims.
He said the private operators are to blame for the disruption. He revealed that the Saudi government had set a deadline of Feb­ru­ary 14 for private operators to de­­posit 25pc of the required amount.
Even after an extension, they managed to collect payments for only an additional 10,000 pilgrims.
He revealed that the prime minister’s inquiry committee is investigating the matter. Its findings will determine responsibility.
He said that the ministry had repeatedly reminded private operators.
Pilgrims under the government scheme are staying in Aziziyah, and the companies responsible for their services have been instructed to ensure proper arrangements.
Earlier, he reviewed the renovation and facelift work being carried out at Gurdwara Panja Sahib by ETPB.

Former prime minister Imran Khan is one of the accused in the case. The protests, triggered by Mr Khan’s arrest in a corruption case from the Islam­abad High Court, turned violent as protesters torched and vandalised government buildings and military installations.
Following the violence, the government launched a crackdown on PTI leaders and supporters, making several arrests.
Mr Khan was indicted in the case on Dec 5, 2024.
The PTI founder, who has been incarcerated in Adiala Jail since August 2023, was arrested by the Rawalpindi police in the protest case in January 2024.
He, however, filed an application seeking acquittal, which was also rejected by the ATC earlier this year.
Special Prosecutor Raja Ikram Ameen Minhas produced the IO before the trial court.
The investigating officer informed the court about the incident, police action, arrests and recoveries made from the PTI workers.
The prosecution has produced only 26 out of a total of 102 witnesses before the ATC so far. Most of the prosecution witnesses who have testified before the court till date were police officials and witnesses to the vandalism.
The next hearing will be held on June 29.

While half of this portfolio was legacy rollovers from China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, fresh loans and grant inflows amounted to $6.086bn in July-April, almost 15 per cent lower than the comparable period of last fiscal year.
In its monthly report on Foreign Economic Assistance (FEA) released on Friday, the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) said that against its annual target of $19.4bn, FEA in July-April amounted to $6.086bn compared to $7.142bn in the same period last year with an annual target of $17.6bn.
This does not include about $1bn disbursed by the IMF in October as an upfront payment under the $7bn ongoing Extended Fund Facility (EFF) that is accounted for separately by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This also does not include the subsequent $1bn IMF inflow last week.
 
 

With three rollovers and fresh disbursements, the total external assistance in 10MFY25 amounted to $16.08bn. This included $3bn rollovers by Saudi Arabia, $2bn by the UAE, and $3bn by China. Pakistan has a total annual rollover portfolio of about $12.7bn in safe deposits and loans from these three countries, leaving the country’s net international reserves (NIR) at around $3.3bn.
The foreign economic assistance recorded by the EAD showed inflows fell by about 15pc to about $6.086bn in July-April, apparently because of delayed IMF bailout and subsequent $1bn disbursements. Last year, these inflows, including IMF, amounted to $8.2bn during 10MFY24.
In April, the EAD reported monthly inflows at $576 million, compared to $555m in March, $237m in February and $830m in January.
The EAD said that out of $6.086bn, about $3.45bn was received for budgetary support or programme loans and the remaining $2.6bn for project financing. During the same period last year, the EAD secured about $2.3bn as project aid and $4.8bn as programme loans.
Of the total, inflows from multilaterals stood at $2.98bn in 10MFY25 compared to $2.86bn last year, while bilateral disbursements stood at $372m against $878m last year, down 58pc.
The EAD reported receiving about $706m in loans from foreign commercial lenders (UAE-based) in 10MFY25, showing a minor recovery from commercial banks that had stayed away from financing Pakistan last year. It may be noted that the government has budgeted $3.8bn in financing from foreign commercial banks for the current year, showing a poor outcome, again due to the delayed IMF umbrella and economic conditions.
The government has also targeted $1bn in international bonds for the current year. A projection for $9bn inflow from China and Saudi Arabia was targeted for FY25. These projections include a $5bn time deposit from Saudi Arabia and $4bn China’s SAFE deposit. These projections are critical for Pakistan to meet its external financing gap as part of the IMF programme.
In addition, Pakistan also received $1.61bn from overseas Pakistanis through Naya Pakistan Certificates compared to $8861m in the same period last year. The Asian Development Bank disbursed $1.253bn in 10MFY25 compared to $708m a year ago, and $1.07bn was received from the World Bank.

• Zafar says ‘ticking water bomb must be defused before it goes off’
• Caution advised when ministers discuss water issue
• Shibli decries ‘tyranny of majority’ in Senate
ISLAMABAD: Senators on Friday made it clear that India would not be allowed to suspend or amend the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) warning that any unilateral move to this effect would be treated as an act of war.
They said the treaty was a settled matter and international law would justify Pakistan’s military response if India blocked the water.
Speaking on a motion on the unilateral suspension of IWT by India, PTI parliamentary leader Ali Zafar said the impending water crisis was as serious a threat as terrorism.
“This is also a war thrust on us. The ticking water bomb must be defused before it goes off,” he remarked.
 


The PTI lawmaker said international law and UN resolutions have called water a fundamental human right for the lower riparian regions.
Noting that India was violating international law by holding the IWT in abeyance, Mr Zafar said the UN Charter and resolutions and international conventions would permit any action taken by Pakistan in self-defence, including military action if India stops its share of water.
“If India stops a drop of our water, the [international] law, UN resolutions and international conventions say that Pakistan can destroy the structure through missiles, planes and soldiers”.
Calling the matter highly sensitive, he advised the government to be cautious while speaking about the issue because it may damage Pakistan’s case.
Senator Zafar stressed that Pakistan was fast moving towards a water-scarcity crisis due to climate change and increasing population.
The Indus basin is a “lifeline” for 90 per cent of people and crops that depend on its water.
He stressed the need to rise above party lines to tackle the water issue with India.
The opposition leader, Shibli Faraz, said IWT was a settled matter and Pakistan “should not even talk to India over the treaty”.
“It is a treaty and can only be changed with both parties’ consent. Otherwise, it stands as it.”
No government in Pakistan even has the mandate to change the treaty, he said, adding the government should not give a knee-jerk reaction and build up its case carefully.
He said water was a serious crisis for Pakistan and called for a “well-thought-out plan” to address it technically and internationally.
PTI Senator Humayun Mohmand also said talks shouldn’t be held on IWT.
The officials “should not be apologetic on the issue”.
 
 

JUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza took a more cautious tone, saying it would be difficult for Pakistan to give a military response to a country that has an economy of $700 billion.
He said Pakistan had already lost its case over water with India at the international forums.
The JUI-F lawmaker said that a house committee comprising legal experts from all parties should be formed to examine all agreements with India, including the Shimla Agreement and IWT.
‘Tyranny of majority’
Earlier, at the outset of the proceedings, Mr Faraz deplored the way the Senate had been run for the past year.
He observed that democracy does not mean the tyranny of the majority.
“The house has been turned into a mere post office. We have to make ourselves relevant”, he remarked.
 

Opposition leader Shibli Faraz speaks in the Senate on May 24, 2025. — screengrab via Senate YouTube

He regretted the frequent suspension of rules and hasty legislation, saying the role of the upper house of parliament must not be compromised.
Mr Faraz said the house “should be run in a democratic manner” and lamented that bills were tabled in the upper house without even sharing their copies with lawmakers.
He said the culture of debate in the upper house had vanished and stressed that it was a dangerous tradition.
Mr Faraz said it was the opposition’s responsibility to keep an oversight on the government’s affairs.
But the ruling coalition kept key committees, including the Finance Committee, with it to “willingly and wilfully destroy this spirit”.
He asked the members to play their role in restoring the dignity of the Senate and earn respect for themselves.
The PML-N parliamentary leader, Irfan Siddiqui, who was presiding over the sitting, agreed to most points raised by the leader of the opposition.
However, he recalled when he became senator in 2021 — with PTI in power — the situation in the house was no different.
He said only one minister used to respond to questions for all ministries back then too.
Mr Siddiqui agreed the question hour should be held. He said it may be taken as his ruling that any decision on the question hour in the future should be taken after mutual consultation between the government and the opposition leadership instead of taking a unilateral decision.
“I also agree that we should all try to enhance the dignity of the House and ensure good presence and representation. Details about legislation should also be provided to the members well in time,” he maintained.
Former deputy chairman and PPP lawmaker Saleem Mandviwala also said the question hour should be held regularly.

• FO slams Modi’s allegations
• UNSC condemns school bus attack
ISLAMABAD: Pakistani authorities on Friday said they would continue with intelligence-based operations (IBOs) to combat terrorism in Balochistan, instead of launching a large-scale kinetic military campaign at this stage.
“The intelligence-based operations would continue,” said Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, director general of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), during a joint press briefing with Federal Interior Secretary Khurram Agha near the military headquarters in neighbouring garrison city of Rawalpindi.
The joint appearance of military and civilian officials underscored the government’s unified approach to counterterrorism, especially in the wake of escalating regional tensions with India and aggravating security situation in Balochistan.
Their remarks come days after a suicide attack in Khuzdar targeted a school bus carrying children of military personnel, in which eight people, including six children, were martyred and dozens others were injured. Two more students Haider, 13, and Malika, 12, succumbed to their injuries, bringing the death toll to eight.
 






Pakistan’s military had accused India of “planning and orchestrating” the att­ack using its terrorism proxies in the restive province.
Condemning the attack, Interior Secretary Agha said, “The attack on school bus in Khuzdar was an attack on our values, our education system and the very fabric of our society.” He added that initial investigations indicated the assault was orchestrated by India-backed terrorist operating as “Fitna al Hindustan” (Indian mischief).
The term ‘Fitna al Hindu­stan’ is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
Lt Gen Chaudhry emphasised that terrorism in Balochistan was being tackled “rationally”, noting that Pakistan had developed advanced counterterrorism techniques through decades of experience.
 


“Intelligence-based operations are very effective way of dealing with terrorists. We are hunting them down and eliminating them,” he said. “The number of terrorists killed in these intelligence-based operations are much higher as compared to the large-scale operations.”
This emphasis on intelligence-based operations highlights the government’s preference for targeted strikes to minimise collateral damage, possibly in response to past criticisms of heavy-handed military campaigns.
Soft targets
The military spokesman said the military is currently conducting nearly 150 IBOs on a daily basis without disrupting civilian life. “The terrorist groups after suffering heavily at the hands of law-enforcement agencies are now attacking soft targets. This shows the effectiveness of our operations,” he added.
Interior Secretary Agha echoed the approach, noting that a broader military campaign akin to Operation Zarb-i-Azb could be launched if necessary, but only after all preparatory steps are completed. “If need be, there can be a major operation like Zarb-i-Azb but that would be at a later stage. Currently, all operations are continuing,” Agha said.
 
 

The reference to Zarb-i-Azb, a 2014-17 operation that significantly reduced militancy in the country, signals the government’s readiness to escalate if IBOs do not bring the problem of terrorism under control, but also its caution to avoid destabilising Balochistan further.
He added that the National Action Plan (NAP) was being “reinvigorated” to support future counterterrorism efforts. “All facets of the national action plan are being reinvigorated so that all domains including social, economic, legal, counterterrorism, information and political are fully functional,” he stated. “So that when we go into a big operation… all facets are in place.”
The NAP, introduced in 2014 after the Peshawar Army Public School attack, is a comprehensive counterterrorism framework. Its reinvigoration suggests a holistic approach to address not just security but also socio-economic drivers of unrest in Balochistan.
Proxies activated
Lt Gen Chaudhry highlighted how synchronised attacks during the night of May 9 and 10 — involving 33 terrorist incidents in Balochistan — demonstrated collaboration between India and proxy groups in Balochistan.
“At a time when India was firing projectiles and missiles into Pakistan, it had also activated these proxies,” he said. “This synchronisation of attacks proved the collaboration between Fitna al Hindustan and India.”
 
 

He attributed India’s alleged targeting of Balochistan to Pakistan’s recent economic advancements in the province. “Balochistan has reached its take-off phase with improvements in the socio-economic sector… the inauguration of the airport in Gwadar and expansion of road network,” he said.
“Balochistan’s terrorism issue is being addressed rationally where military approach is one aspect. The problem is being addressed synergetically by all elements of national power.”
This holistic approach reflects the recognition that military solutions alone cannot resolve Balochistan’s complex issues
Agha reiterated the government’s readiness and resolve: “The state has the wherewithal and will to dismantle these networks and bring their handlers and perpetrators of these acts of terrorism to justice. Such actions will have consequences… Our resolve is firm and response will be decisive.”
Touching on recent tensions with India, the DG ISPR warned of dire consequences if provocations continue. “India is using terrorism as a tool against Pakistan through Fitna al Hindustan and Fitna al Khawarij,” he said. “Pakistan is on the other hand maintaining peace as a rational actor through the resolve of the people and the capabilities of the armed forces.”
He further condemned India’s “arrogant political mindset,” citing its refusal to address the Kashmir dispute and alleged suppression of minorities as the reasons behind India becoming a source of instability in the region.
FO rejects allegations
Earlier on Friday, Pakistan categorically rejected the “baseless, provocative, and irresponsible” allegations made by the Indian prime minister during a recent public address in Rajasthan, asserting that such statements clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains, APP adds.
“The remarks, replete with distortions, misrepresentations, and inflammatory rhetoric, are clearly aimed at stoking regional tensions for narrow political gains. Such statements not only reflect a deliberate attempt to mislead the public but also violate the norms of responsible statecraft,” Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said.
 
 

He said that resorting to threats and boasting about military action against a sovereign nation was a grave breach of the UN Charter and established principles of international law and that this dangerous approach also undermined regional peace and stability.
The spokesperson said that Pakistan remained a consistent and proactive partner in the global fight against terrorism and any insinuation seeking to associate Pakistan with acts of terrorism was factually incorrect and patently misleading. He said it was a tactic often employed to divert attention from India’s own internal challenges, as well as its repressive policies in India-held Kashmir.
“India’s attempts to mask its serious human rights violations are well-documented and well-recognised by the international community. The plight of the Kashmiri people and their just struggle for self-determination cannot be obscured by aggressive rhetoric and political deflection,” he remarked.
He urged the Indian leadership to exercise responsibility and restraint as escalatory statements and belligerent posturing serve no purpose other than exacerbating tensions.
UNSC condemns Khuzdar attack
The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) has strongly condemned the terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar, Balochistan, calling it a heinous and cowardly act that claimed the lives of at least six people, including four children, and left more than 50 others injured.
 
 

In an official press statement, the Council members expressed profound sorrow over the attack, which occurred on May 21, and extended heartfelt condolences to the victims’ families and to the government.
The UNSC members expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of Pakistan, and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured, the statement read.

A Notam (notice to airmen) issued by the Pakistan Airports Autho­rity (PAA) said the ban on Indian aircraft using its airspace will remain in place till June 24.
“The ban on Indian aircraft flying through Pakis­tani airspace has been extended until 4:59am on June 24, 2025,” the PAA said.
The airspace will not be available for Indian-regis­tered, operated or owned aircraft or those leased by Indian airlines, including military flights with no exceptions, the Notam stated. The restriction will apply to airspace starting from the ground to unlimited airspace height, it added.
Under the directive, no flight operated by Indian airlines or operators will be allowed to enter or transit through Pakistani airspace. However, other inte­r­national airlines would not be affected by the ban.
 
 

India’s Civil Aviation Ministry issued a corresponding Notam, saying Pakistani-registered, operated, owned, or leased aircraft, including military flights, would be barred from Indian airspace through June 23.
India and Pakistan first imposed the airspace restrictions last month after the shooting in India-occupied Kashmir.
On April 24, Pakistan had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country.
