RAFAH: Palestinians gather to collect what remains of relief supplies from the distribution centre of a US-backed humanitarian foundation.—Reuters

• Survey shows rate of children suffering acute malnutrition nearly triples
• Four journalists among 20 Palestinians killed in fresh Israeli strikes
CAIRO: A US- and Israeli-backed organisation distributing aid in Gaza said on Thursday it was reopening two distribution sites a day after shutting them following a series of deadly shootings close to its operations.
The US-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said only two sites in southern Gaza’s Rafah area would operate on Thursday, after all sites were closed the day before for maintenance. The GHF had opened three sites earlier in the week, and one of Thursdays sites was in a new location, it said.
The GHF, which has been fiercely criticised by humanitarian organisations, including the United Nations for alleged lack of neutrality, began distributing aid last week. The UN has warned that most of Gaza’s 2.3 million population is at risk of famine after an 11-week Israeli blockade of the enclave.
According to data collected by humanitarian groups and released by the UN on Thursday, the rate of young children suffering from acute malnutrition in Gaza has nearly tripled since a ceasefire earlier this year when aid flowed more freely.
Around 5.8 per cent out of nearly 50,000 children under five who were screened in the second half of May were diagnosed with acute malnutrition, an analysis by a group of UN and other aid agencies known as the nutrition cluster showed.
This was up from 4.7pc in early May and nearly three times the rate in February.
Meanwhile, Israel announced it had recovered the bodies of two dual nationality Israeli-American prisoners from Gaza. Gadi Hagi and his wife Judy Weinstein-Hagi were killed and taken to Gaza after Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war. Fifty-six prisoners remain in captivity, with fewer than half believed to be alive.
The Israeli military has intensified operations in Gaza since breaking a fragile ceasefire with Hamas in March, taking more territory with the government pushing to wipe out the Islamist militant group.
At least 20 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes across Gaza on Thursday, including four journalists in a hospital in the enclave’s north, local health authorities said.
The Hamas-run government media office says that 225 journalists in Gaza have been killed since the war began.

• Ex-US diplomat endorses call for neutral Pahalgam probe, regrets Pak-US ties ‘still stuck in the past’
• VP Vance meets Indian delegation as US officials assure Pakistan of ‘equal representation’
WASHINGTON: As fomer foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari blamed India for pushing South Asia towards the first nuclear war over water, a former US ambassador to Pakistan endorsed Islamabad’s demand for an independent inquiry into the Pahalgam incident, which led to a full-blown conflict between Islamabad and New Delhi.
At a policy forum hosted by the Middle East Institute (MEI) in Washington, former US ambassador to Islamabad Anne Patterson stressed that the United States-Pakistan relationship was hindered by mistrust, despite ongoing security cooperation.
“The US-Pakistan relationship is so stuck in the past that India was not required to present any forensic or investigative evidence after the Pahal­gam attack,” Ms Patterson said.
“It (India) had simply said that Pakistan was still engaged in terrorism. And international observers, I hate to say, tended to believe this claim.”
She added, “This incident almost led to a nuclear war, and it’s critically important to get to the bottom of what happened. An independent investigation, possibly by agencies like the FBI or Scotland Yard, should be the first step.”
Mr Bhutto-Zardari highlighted Pakistan’s core concerns: terrorism, Kashmir, and the ongoing water dispute with India. “Water wars used to be a theory. India shutting off Pakistan’s water supply is laying the foundation for the first nuclear water war,” he said, referring to repeated violations of the Indus Waters Treaty.
“We have said that cutting off our water supply will be an act of war. We don’t say it in a jingoistic manner… It’s an existential crisis for us. Any country would fight for its survival and for its water,” he added, urging global powers to take a firm position against what he described as Indian aggression.
Balancing act
Delegations from both countries are in Washington this week, engaging with US officials, who are trying to strike a delicate diplomatic balance.
The Pakistani delegation includes Senator Sherry Rehman, former foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar, Dr Musadik Malik, Engineer Khurram Dastgir, Faisal Subzwari, Tehmina Janjua, Senator Bushra Anjum Butt, and Jalil Abbas Jilani.
The Indian delegation is led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor and includes Shambhavi Chaudhary (Lok Janshakti Party), Sarfaraz Ahmed (Jharkhand Mukti Morcha), G. M. Harish Balayogi (Telugu Desam Party), Shashank Mani Tripathi, Tejaswi Surya, and Bhubaneswar Kalita (all from the BJP), Mallikarjun Devda (Shiv Sena), former Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, and Shiv Sena MP Milind Deora.
The Indian delegation met US Vice President JD Vance on Thursday, taking advantage of his links to India.
Michael Kugelman, a US scholar of South Asian affairs based in Washington, described the visits as “a high-octane diplomatic effort on both sides meant to secure buy-in from Washington on key positions at a high-stakes moment for both Islamabad and New Delhi”.
He noted that India’s approach is “especially striking” as New Delhi typically avoids internationalising its bilateral disputes.
Mr Kugelman explained: “India’s position is that Pakistan isn’t sufficiently acting against terror. … For Pakistan, it’s about getting Washington to view New Delhi in ways that it tends not to: as untrustworthy and as an aggressor. In effect, each side is trying to not only advance its narratives but also change perceptions in Washington.”
He added: “Here, New Delhi has an advantage as Washington, on bipartisan levels, tends to sympathise more with Indian than Pakistani positions. And that includes most importantly not wading into the Kashmir issue.”
Other scholars, however, urged the United States to manage engagements with both sides carefully and equitably.
Hassan Abbas, another scholar associated with the National Defence University in Washington, noted that Pakistan had “already done a lot to fight terrorism” and was paying the price for it. “Now, Pakistan needs US appreciation and cooperation in dealing with the terrorists. Intelligence-sharing platforms need to be revived.”
Both delegations are also lobbying for their countries on Capitol Hill, meeting senior US lawmakers and chairs of various Congress committees.
The Pakistani delegation met the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and other congressmen and senators. “They told us they are ensuring equal representation for both,” said a Pakistani diplomatic source.
The Indian delegation met members of the Senate Foreign Relations and Intelligence Committees, including senators Dave McCormick, Jacky Rosen, Jim Risch, Mark Warner, John Cornyn, and Elissa Slotkin.

According to the advisory, a high-pressure weather system is likely to develop over the country on June 7 and is expected to grip most parts from June 8.
Under the influence of these meteorological conditions, daytime temperatures are likely to remain 5 to 7 degrees Celsius above normal in central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan from June 7 to 12.
In upper and central Sindh, southern Punjab and parts of Balochistan, daytime temperatures are likely to remain 04 to 06°C above normal from June 7 to 12.

Advisory urges citizens to avoid exposure to direct sunlight

Dust storms and gusty winds are also expected over the plains due to excessive heat.
“Rising temperatures in northern areas may enhance snow-melting rate during the forecast period,” the advisory stated.
The PMD has advised citizens, especially children, women and older people, to take precautionary measures — avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the daytime and stay hydrated.
Farmers have been advised to manage their crop activities as per the forecast.
The PMD has warned the authorities to remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any mishap due to severe heatwave conditions.
The heatwave advisory was issued a day after PMD officials informed a high-level meeting that temperatures were already above normal in Gilgit-Baltis­tan and were forecast to remain so in the days ahead, resulting in above-normal snowmelt.
The annual flood preparation meeting of the federal and provincial governments on Wednesday was told that there could be higher and repeated chances of glacial lake outburst flood during the monsoon season.
Rainfall was also projected to be higher than normal across the country, particularly in the northern parts of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, GB, Potohar and parts of KP.
There could be an increased frequency of all-weather events, including severe thunderstorms and hailstorms.
An official statement issued after the meeting said the PMD has “forecasted normal to slightly above-normal rainfall across central and southern Pakistan from July to September”.
Meanwhile, excess rainfall was also expected in northeastern Punjab and Kashmir, while northern KP and GB may experience “normal to below-normal rainfall”.
Ill-prepared healthcare system
Last month, the National Institute of Health (NIH) issued a heatstroke advisory and urged public and private sector hospitals to make arrangements.
The country is experiencing severe climate changes due to global warming, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality due to heat stroke, the NIH added.
It called for immediate measures to prevent and treat heat-related illnesses.
The World Health Organisation has highlighted the impact of climate change on human health, including increased frequency and severity of heatwaves.
Pakistan has experienced severe heat waves in recent years, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality.
The country’s healthcare system faces challenges in responding to these events, particularly in rural and underserved areas, said the NIH.

Addressing pilgrims gathered for the pinnacle of Haj, Dr Humaid emphasised the profound spiritual and unifying significance of the Day of Arafah and urged Muslims around the world to uphold the true essence of Islam through faith, humility, and sincere devotion to Allah.
“Oh Allah, take care of our brothers and sisters in Palestine. Feed the hungry among them, shelter the displaced. Grant security to the fearful and protect them from their enemies,” he prayed.
During the high point of the pilgrimage, Muslims prayed on Mount Arafat as authorities urged them to avoid the hottest hours of the day.

Over 1.6m brave extreme heat to perform pilgrimage

Thousands of white-robed pilgrims recited verses from the Holy Quran from dawn on the 70-metre rocky rise near Makkah.
But numbers thinned by midday following official warnings for pilgrims to stay inside between 10am and 4pm.
“I came here early to (avoid) the sun and later I will pray inside my tent,” said 54-year-old Adel Ismail, from Syria.
 
 

Saudi authorities have taken several steps to reduce the risk from heat at the Haj, which has drawn more than 1.6 million pilgrims to one of the world’s hottest regions, according to fresh figures published on Thursday.
Barring a few years of Covid restrictions from 2020-2022, this Haj season has recorded the lowest number of pilgrims in over three decades.
On Thursday, icepacks were handed to people walking towards Mount Arafat, with some placing the small bags on their heads.
With temperatures reaching 42C, officials ushered people away if they spent too long in one place near the bouldered hill, which had fans spraying mist and cool air at its foot.
Towards Muzdalifah
Later in the afternoon, pilgrims began making their way to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles for Friday’s symbolic “stoning of the devil”.
Despite the heat, they were generally delighted to be performing the Haj. “I don’t think about the sun or the temperature or anything like that,” said Ahmed, a 44-year-old from Egypt.
“Because standing in Arafat is a great thing and a beautiful day, and as you can see, all the pilgrims” are doing it.
Ali, 33, from Pakistan, said he felt blessed to take part.
“This is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Haj and I always thought: ‘I wish I could be here’,” he said.

In a statement issued here on Thursday, the Uzbek embassy in Islamabad said that operating every Saturday, the new route underscored the shared commitment of Uzbekistan and Pakistan to strengthen their long-standing partnership and deepen cooperation across multiple sectors. This direct link marked a strategic advancement in bilateral relations and aligned with the broader goals of the Central and South Asia connectivity initiative.
In addition to the new Islamabad route, Uzbekistan Airways currently operates biweekly direct flights to Lahore on Wednesdays and Fridays. These connections were helping expand the airline’s regional footprint, linking Pakistan’s major cities not only with Uzbekistan, but also with the wider Central Asian region and beyond.
“Together, these routes support cross-border mobility, business travel, educational exchange, and cultural cooperation,” the embassy said.
The embassy said that beyond its commercial significance, the Tashkent-Islamabad route was poised to enhance people-to-people ties by enabling smoother, more direct travel for students, pilgrims, tourists, academics, and official delegations.
The direct link was also expected to boost tourism in both directions. For Pakistani travelers, Uzbekistan’s famed Silk Road cities - Samarkand, Bukhara, and Khiva - were now more accessible than ever. Likewise, Uzbek visitors could now more easily explore Pakistan’s rich landscapes.
The statement said that tourist flows between the two nations had seen steady growth in recent years, driven by shared historical ties, cultural affinity, and religious heritage. The new air service offered a convenient and reliable option for a growing number of visitors, students, and pilgrims seeking meaningful cross-border experiences.
“This air route is a cornerstone of the Central and South Asia Connectivity Initiative, first proposed by the President of Uzbekistan in 2021. It is part of a broader strategic push to transform a landlocked region into a land-linked hub. The Tashkent-Islamabad flight complements major regional infrastructure initiatives such as the Trans-Afghan Railway and supports broader cooperation in transport, logistics, infrastructure, energy, and digitalization,” the statement said.
By reducing travel time and improving accessibility, Uzbekistan Airways was playing a pivotal role in translating this vision into tangible results, the embassy said adding, “More than just a transport link, this route is a gateway to deeper economic integration, cultural exchange, and strategic partnership – a symbol of the growing synergy between Uzbekistan and Pakistan, two nations united by shared values, complementary interests, and a long history of collaboration.”

Maryam, one-year-old girl, while playing outside her house in Mohalla Qazian Ratta Amral with other children, went missing.
After the disappearance, Maryam’s parents started a search for her, but failing to find clues, her grandmother, Ms Musarat Bibi, sought police help and registered a case under the relevant section of the law.
During the search, the missing girl’s body was found in the main sewerage line of Dhoke Ratta on Thursday. The local police reached the spot and shifted the body to the District Headquarters Hospital for post-mortem. An investigation launched to ascertain the facts behind the tragic death of the little girl.
Later on, police arrested the accused, who was identified as Azan Sultan, 10 and a half years old, and lived in the same house. The accused boy was shifted to the protection bureau by the local court.
During the initial investigation, the accused revealed that he had picked up the girl and put her head in the sewerage line water, which claimed her life. The police investigating officer said while quoting the accused as: “I didn’t like her.”
Police said that the CCTV footage helped the police to trace the accused as he could be seen picking up the girl from the street and taking her away. The girl’s body was handed over to her parents after the postmortem.
The girl’s father was an employee in the cantonment board. The father of the accused is an addict, as his mother had left his house and resided with her parents.

“Look, Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office after Musk slammed his tax and spending mega-bill as an “abomination”.
The world’s richest man responded by live-posting on his X social media platform as Trump spoke on television, saying that the Republican would not have won the 2024 election without him and slamming him for “ingratitude.”
In an extraordinary rant as visiting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz sat mutely beside him, 78-year-old Trump unloaded on SpaceX and Tesla boss Musk in his first comments on the issue.
“I’m very disappointed, because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here … all of a sudden, he had a problem,” Trump said when asked about Musk.

The clash comes less than a week since Trump held a grand Oval Office farewell for Musk as he wrapped up his time leading the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
South African-born Musk, 53, hit back minutes later, saying Trump’s claims he had advance sight of the bill were “false”.
 






“Whatever,” he added above a video of Trump saying Musk was upset about the loss of subsidies for electric vehicles.
 






Musk then ratcheted up the public spat even further, saying the Republican would have lost the election without his support. He was the biggest donor to Trump’s campaign, to the tune of nearly $300 million.
“Without me, Trump would have lost the election,” Musk said on X. “Such ingratitude.”
 






Tesla shares fell sharply on Wall Street, down eight percent, after his comments, in a sign of the huge stakes for a falling out between the world’s richest man and its most powerful.
 






Later, Musk uploaded a poll to his X account asking his followers whether or not it was time to start a new political party that “actually represents the 80 per cent in the middle”.
An overwhelming majority of his followers voted “yes” as of 11:30pm.
 


After his meeting, Trump took to his own platform, Truth Social, and wrote posts stating that he asked “crazy” Musk to leave and that the his administration could save billions of dollars by cutting Musk’s government contracts.
“I took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went crazy!” the US president wrote in one post, adding that he asked Musk to leave because he was “wearing thin”.
 


A while later, Musk responded by calling Trump’s remarks “an obvious lie”.
“So sad,” he wrote on X, reposting a screenshot of Trump’s post.
 






In a separate post, Trump wrote: “The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon’s governmental subsidies and contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”
 


‘A little make-up?’
A wistful-sounding Trump took reporters through the break-up with Musk on live television, in what at times sounded more like a therapy session than a meeting with a foreign leader.
Trump talked about Musk’s farewell appearance in the Oval Office on Friday, when he turned up with a black eye that he said was caused by a punch from his son.
Musk at the time was also facing reports of drug use on the Trump campaign trail.
“You saw a man who was very happy when he stood behind the Oval desk, and even with the black eye. I said, you want a little makeup? We’ll get you a little makeup,” Trump said.
“But he said, ‘No, I don’t think so,’ which is interesting and very nice. He wants to be who he is.”
 


Trump said he could understand why Musk was upset with some steps he had taken, including withdrawing a nominee to lead the Nasa space agency whom the tech tycoon had backed.
Through it all, the visiting German chancellor sat silently.
Merz had prepared to avoid a repeat of the ambushes that Trump unleashed on the Ukrainian and South African presidents in the Oval Office — but in the end it was Musk that the US president ambushed.
At the centre of the bitter row is Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” on tax and spending.
The centrepiece of his domestic agenda, it aims to continue tax cuts from his first term — and could define his second term and make or break Republican prospects in the 2026 midterm elections.
Musk, however, called it a “disgusting abomination” on Tuesday, on the grounds that it will increase the US deficit. A day later, the magnate called for Republicans to “kill the bill”, and for an alternative plan that “doesn’t massively grow the deficit”.</p><small>2025-06-05 19:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051744440ea25c8.jpg?r=175522' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915636/conditions-of-simla-agreement-no-longer-applicable-after-indian-iwt-violation-khawaja-asif-says' target='_blank'><strong>Conditions of Simla Agreement no longer applicable after Indian IWT violation, Khawaja Asif says</strong></a><br><p>Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Thursday said that the Simla Agreement between India and Pakistan was no longer applicable after the former violated the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).
India held the IWT in abeyance after the further deterioration in relations between the two countries following the April 22 Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir. In retaliation, Pakistan decided that it would exercise the right to hold all bilateral agreements with India, including but not limited to the Simla Agreement, in abeyance. It also announced the closure of the Wagah border and suspension of all trade with New Delhi, among other measures.
 
 

The agreement was signed between Pakistan and India in the aftermath of the 1971 war; the signatories being Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Indira Gandhi. The agreement, inter alia, stipulated that neither party would take any action unilaterally, that the disputes between the two countries would be resolved bilaterally, and that the ceasefire line would become the Line of Control.
Talking to Geo News earlier today, Asif said that the IWT had no room for any party to withdraw from it unilaterally. He said all decisions about the agreement could be taken with the joint agreement of both parties.
“If this is the case and India has begun this [attitude] then the Simla Agreement is between two parties and has no interference or patronage from the World Bank or anyone else, so the Line of Control (LoC) will revert to a ceasefire line, which was its original status as per the [UN] resolution passed at the time of the 1948 plebiscite.
“The sanctity of the Simla Agreement has been eliminated due to India’s actions,” the defence minister added, further saying that its conditions, such as for India and Pakistan to resolve issues bilaterally, were no longer applicable.
“The agreement as a whole after this episode of war has now no value.”
 


Later, a senior official from the Foreign Office told Dawn.com: “No formal decision on abrogation of any bilateral agreement with India has so far been made.”
Questioned about the response later in an interview on Geo News show ‘Aaj Shahzeb Khanzada Kay Sath’ about whether such a decision had really been taken or whether it was his opinion, Asif said: “I responded to what India did with the IWT that the same thing will then apply to the Simla Agreement. The same will apply to it as to the IWT.”
He further said: “The Foreign Office has no relation with my comment. I have given my comment in a personal capacity … I think my opinion is correct and that should be our official stated position on this issue.”
In connection with the Kashmir dispute, the Simla Agreement stated that “the basic issues and causes of conflict which have bedevilled the relations between the two countries for the last 25 years shall be resolved by peaceful means”. It also bound both countries to discuss the modalities and arrangements for lasting peace and normalisation.
However, Pakistan argues that India violated the Simla Accord in 2019 when it unilaterally revoked Article 370, altering the status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir. This further enabled outsiders to obtain domicile and purchase property in occupied Kashmir to change the Muslim-majority demography of the valley, again termed as a violation of the agreement.</p><small>2025-06-05 18:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/052201240739a3b.jpg?r=231225' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915652/three-drown-in-canal-in-kps-malakand-rescue-1122' target='_blank'><strong>Three drown in canal in KP’s Malakand: Rescue 1122</strong></a><br><p>Three people drowned in a canal in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand district on Thursday, while a body was discovered in a river in Upper Dir in a separate incident, rescue officials told said.

Rescue 1122 Malakand identified the deceased as 32-year-old Alamzeb, 26-year-old Mohammad Bilal and 6-year-old Arman Khan, while the survivor was identified as 17-year-old Salman Khan.
Meanwhile, in a separate incident, Ibrahim Khan, a spokesperson for Rescue 1122 in Upper Dir, told Dawn.com that rescuers recovered the body of a seminary student who drowned in a river in the district’s Gandigar area.
“The student went missing three days ago,” Ibrahim said. “Rescue teams and civil defence personnel participated in a search operation.”
The student was identified as Mohammad Hilal Khan.
In April, two minor sisters drowned in the Indus River in the Shangla district’s Bisham tehsil, according to officials.
Bisham Station House Officer (SHO) Khurshid Ali told Dawn.com that the children had gone to the river to play at the river bank, where the strong current ended up drowning them.
SHO Ali said the girls’ ages, as told by their relatives, were seven and nine.</p><small>2025-06-05 18:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607952-indian-actions-boost-nuclear-risk-in-future-conflict-with-pakistan-warns-bilawal' target='_blank'><strong>Indian actions boost nuclear risk in future conflict with Pakistan, warns Bilawal</strong></a><br><p>

“The level of demand seems to be sky-high,” said Serkan Toto, founder of the Kantan Games consultancy.
In the Ikebukuro shopping district of Tokyo, dozens of successful applicants to a sales lottery by electronics retailer Bic Camera lined up before the store opened to collect their devices.
“I feel like I’m going to cry,” Yumi Ohi, a 30-year-old delivery contractor, told Reuters.
Ohi had missed out in other lotteries and had come from Saitama prefecture, adjacent to Tokyo, to receive her Switch 2.
Nintendo has sold 152 million Switch home-portable devices since launching in 2017. It became a games juggernaut with titles, including two “The Legend of Zelda” titles and Covid-19 pandemic breakout hit “Animal Crossing: New Horizons”.
The Switch 2 bears many similarities with its predecessor but offers a larger screen and improved graphics, and debuts with titles including “Mario Kart World”.
“The much larger audience of Switch users should translate to stronger adoption in the opening part of its lifecycle,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at Ampere Analysis.
“Nintendo is better prepared this time around” to deal with the high demand, he said.
The launch of the $499.99 Switch 2 is a test of Nintendo’s supply chain management during US President Donald Trump’s trade war.
Nintendo last month forecast sales of 15m Switch 2 units during the current financial year, as well as 4.5m Switch units.
President Shuntaro Furukawa said Nintendo will strengthen production capacity to respond to strong demand and focus on sales promotion in an effort to exceed the forecast.
“Given it’s a special occasion, I wanted to buy [the Switch 2] right away on its release date,” said Shinichi Sekiguchi, a hotel receptionist in his thirties.
Nintendo said it received 2.2m applications for its Switch 2 sales lottery on its My Nintendo Store in Japan. Pre-orders at Target sold out in less than two hours.
“You are looking at weeks or months until you can walk into a store and buy a Switch 2,” said Toto of Kantan Games.
Investor expectations for the new device are similarly lofty. Nintendo’s shares, which closed down two per cent in Tokyo, have gained 28pc this year.
Concerns include whether momentum for the Switch 2 will be sustained after hardcore gamers have upgraded.
“The volume of first-party games on offer at launch isn’t as strong as it could be, so some more casual users may wait and see how the games available build over the next one to two years before making the leap,” said Ampere’s Harding-Rolls.
Ampere forecasts Switch 2 sales to exceed 100m units in 2030.
“Mario Kart World” has a US sticker price of $79.99, generating debate over the price of games. Nintendo is also attracting third-party titles to the system.
“I’ve been around since the era of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and games from [that period] were expensive too so I think it’s somewhat within the acceptable range,” said Akitomo Takahashi, a salesman in his forties.
Takahashi said he was keen to play action role-playing game “Elden Ring” on his Switch 2.</p><small>2025-06-05 16:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05190809bfd0083.jpg?r=191011' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915641/trump-hails-very-good-phone-call-with-chinas-xi' target='_blank'><strong>Trump hails ‘very good phone call’ with China’s Xi</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Thursday called his telephone conversation with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping a “very good phone call” and stated that the countries’ respective teams “will be meeting shortly”.
Earlier, China’s state-run news agency Xinhua reported that the call took place at Trump’s request, as bilateral relations have been strained by trade disputes.
In a post on social media platform Truth Social, Trump wrote that the one and a half hour call discussed the “intricacies of the trade deal” and that it “resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries”.
“There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of rare earth products. Our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined,” the president wrote, adding that the US will be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.
The post added that Xi “graciously invited” both Trump and First Lady Melania to visit China, with the US president reciprocating the offer.
“As [the] presidents of two great nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing,” Trump wrote. “The conversation was focused almost entirely on trade. Nothing was discussed concerning Russia/Ukraine, or Iran.”
The post concluded by stating that the president would “inform the media” as to where and when the two countries’ delegations will meet.
 


Meanwhile, Xi told Trump that both nations need to “correct the course” of bilateral relations, according to Xinhua.
“Correcting the course of the big ship of Sino-US relations requires us to steer well and set the direction, especially to eliminate all kinds of interference and even destruction, which is particularly important,” he was quoted as saying.
Additionally, Xi warned Trump that the US “should handle the Taiwan question with caution” to avoid “‘Taiwan independence’ separatists dragging China and the United States into the danger of conflict and confrontation”.
The highly anticipated call comes amid accusations between Washington and Beijing in recent weeks over critical minerals in a dispute that threatens to tear up a fragile truce in the trade war between the two biggest economies.
The countries struck a 90-day deal on May 12 to roll back some of the triple-digit, tit-for-tat tariffs they had placed on each other since Trump’s January inauguration.
Though stocks rallied, the temporary deal did not address broader concerns that strain the bilateral relationship, from the illicit fentanyl trade to the status of democratically governed Taiwan and US complaints about China’s state-dominated, export-driven economic model.
Since returning to the White House in January, Trump had repeatedly threatened an array of punitive measures on trading partners, only to revoke some of them at the last minute.
The on-again, off-again approach has baffled world leaders and spooked business executives, who say the uncertainty has made it difficult to forecast market conditions.
China’s decision in April to suspend exports of a wide range of critical minerals and magnets continues to disrupt supplies needed by automakers, computer chip manufacturers and military contractors around the world.
Beijing sees mineral exports as a source of leverage — halting those exports could put domestic political pressure on the US president if economic growth sags because companies cannot produce mineral-powered products. The 90-day deal to roll back tariffs and trade restrictions is tenuous.
Trump has accused China of violating the agreement and has ordered curbs on chip design software and other shipments to China. Beijing rejected the claim and threatened counter-measures.
Despite Trump’s push for a call or a meeting with Xi, China rejected that as not in keeping with its traditional approach of working out agreement details before the leaders talk.
The US president and his aides see leader-to-leader talks as vital to sort through log-jams that have vexed lower-level officials in difficult negotiations.
It’s not known when the two men last spoke.
The talks are being closely watched by investors worried that a chaotic trade war could cut into corporate earnings and disrupt supply chains in the key months before the Christmas holiday shopping season. Trump’s tariffs are also the subject of ongoing litigation in US courts.</p><small>2025-06-05 15:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05203124b0b1a13.png?r=203136' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915646/afghan-women-un-staff-forced-to-work-from-home-after-threats' target='_blank'><strong>Afghan women UN staff forced to work from home after threats</strong></a><br><p>Afghan women working for the United Nations in Kabul have been threatened by unidentified men because of their jobs, the organisation and several women told AFP on Thursday.
Multiple women working for various UN agencies told AFP on condition of anonymity they had been threatened on the street and over the phone by men warning them to “stay home”.
UN staffer Huda — not her real name — said that for weeks she has been bombarded with messages abusing her for “working with foreigners”.
“The messages keep coming and they are always harassing us … saying, ‘Don’t let me see you again, or else’,” the young woman told AFP. She said her office had advised her to work from home until further notice.
The United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) confirmed that UN staff had been threatened.
“Several United Nations female national staff members in the Afghan capital Kabul have been subjected to threats by unidentified individuals related to their work with the UN,” it said in a statement.
Considering the threats “extremely serious”, the UN has taken “interim” measures “to ensure the safety and security of staff members”, it added.
The Taliban government, accused by the UN of imposing a “gender apartheid” against women since returning to power in 2021, has denied any involvement.
Interior ministry spokesman Abdul Mateen Qani said such threats were a “crime” and that police would take action. UNAMA said the authorities had opened an investigation.
Since seizing power in 2021, the Taliban authorities have severely restricted Afghan women from working and it is the only country in the world where women are banned from education beyond primary school.
The government in 2022 banned women from working for domestic and international NGOs, which was extended to include the UN’s offices in the country the following year.
The policy has some exceptions, including for women working in healthcare and education, and has not been consistently enforced.
The UN has previously called the policy “deeply discriminatory”.
Selsela, in her 30s, said that while returning from the office last week, she was approached by unknown men who told her she should be “ashamed” and that she must “stay home”.
“They said, ‘We told you nicely this time, but next time you’ll have another thing coming’,” she told AFP.
“I was very scared,” she said, explaining how she struggles to work efficiently from home in a country where electricity and internet are unreliable.
“The situation for women is getting worse every day.”
Another woman, Rahila, said she and two other women colleagues were stopped by men while travelling home in a UN vehicle and told not to go to the office anymore.
“They said, ‘Don’t you know that you are not allowed?’,” Rahila said, adding that she has also received threatening messages from unknown numbers.
“I am very worried, I need my job and my salary,” she said.
Three-quarters of Afghanistan’s population of some 45 million people struggle to meet their daily needs, according to the UN, with the country facing one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises.</p><small>2025-06-05 15:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05190147007613f.jpg?r=190556' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915640/denmark-aims-to-extend-ban-on-full-face-veils-at-schools-universities' target='_blank'><strong>Denmark aims to extend ban on full-face veils at schools, universities</strong></a><br><p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Thursday her government planned to extend the ban on full-face Islamic veils in public places and apply it to schools and universities as well.
She also said she wanted to see an end to prayer rooms at universities but stopped short of calling for an outright ban.
“God has to step aside. You have the right to your faith and to practice your religion but democracy takes precedence,” she told Danish news agency Ritzau.
In August 2018, Denmark banned the wearing of full-face Islamic veils such as the burqa and niqab in public places, with offenders subject to a fine.
Human rights campaigners and religious groups have criticised the ban as discriminatory and as a violation of both freedom of religion and women’s freedom of choice.
Supporters argue it enables Muslims of immigrant backgrounds to better integrate into Danish society.
Frederiksen alleged that prayer rooms at universities could be used for “social control and oppression”.
She said her government would start talks with universities to have them removed.
“It’s not a discussion about whether we want them or not,” Frederiksen said.
“We are actively taking a position that we don’t want them because they are used as a mechanism of oppression against girls and potentially boys as well.”
Frederiksen said she did not know how widespread the phenomenon was.
“For me, it’s not just the scale that matters. I’m the prime minister of Denmark. I’m also a woman. And I can’t tolerate the oppression of women.”</p><small>2025-06-05 15:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051953173c3a64c.jpg?r=195733' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915585/pilgrims-pray-and-avoid-the-sun-as-haj-reaches-peak' target='_blank'><strong>Pilgrims pray and avoid the sun as Haj reaches peak</strong></a><br><p>Worshippers prayed on Mount Arafat during the high point of Haj on Thursday as authorities urged them to avoid the hottest hours of the day after tragedy struck last year.
Thousands of white-robed pilgrims recited verses from the Holy Quran from dawn on the 70-metre rocky rise near Makkah, where the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) gave his last sermon.
But numbers thinned by midday following official warnings for pilgrims to stay inside between 10am and 4pm, a year after 1,301 people died in temperatures that hit 51.8 degree Celsius.
“I came here early to [avoid] the sun and later I will pray inside my tent,” said 54-year-old Adel Ismail, from Syria.
 


Saudi authorities have taken several steps to reduce the risk from heat at Haj, which has drawn more than 1.6 million pilgrims to one of the world’s hottest regions, according to fresh figures published on Thursday.

Shaded areas have been expanded by 50,000 square metres, thousands more medics are on standby and more than 400 cooling units have been deployed, the Haj minister told AFP last week.
The Saudis have also cracked down on unregistered, non-fee paying pilgrims, who lack access to the full amenities and made up more than 80 per cent of last year’s deaths.
On Thursday, icepacks were handed to people walking towards Mount Arafat, with some placing the small bags on their heads. With temperatures reaching 42°C, officials ushered people away if they spent too long in one place near the bouldered hill, which had fans spraying mist and cool air at its foot.
‘I don’t think about the sun’
Late on Thursday afternoon, pilgrims began making their way to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles for Friday’s symbolic “stoning of the devil”.
Despite the heat, they were generally delighted to be performing the Haj.
“I don’t think about the sun or the temperature or anything like that,” said Ahmed, a 44-year-old from Egypt. “Because standing in Arafat is a great thing and a beautiful day, and as you can see, all the pilgrims” are doing it.

Ali, 33, from Pakistan, said he felt “blessed” to take part.
“This is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Haj and I always thought: ‘I wish I could be here’,” he said.
Through tears of joy, Iman Abdel Khaleq said she had wanted to perform the Haj for 10 years and was overwhelmed with emotion as she arrived at Arafat.
“It’s a big dream for me that I had almost given up hope of realising,” the Egyptian woman in her 50s told AFP from the foot of the mountain.
High-tech Haj
Saudi officials said the heat-mitigation measures implemented this Haj had largely been successful in preventing a repeat of last year.
“We are encountering a limited number of heat-related illnesses cases this year and this is evidence of the effectiveness of all the organisation measures as well as preventive measures,” said Mohammed Al-Abd Al-Aali, Saudi Arabia’s assistant minister of health.
Along with the anti-heat measures and thousands of extra personnel, Saudi Arabia is also using an arsenal of high-tech tools to help better manage crowds.
More than 15,000 cameras run through artificial intelligence software are monitoring the holy sites and walkways during an event that has a history of deadly stampedes.
 
 

This year, officials have also clamped down hard on unregistered pilgrims looking to sneak into Makkah, using raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.
Late on Thursday, a Haj ministry source said the moves had helped stave off overcrowding at the holy sites so far.
Haj permits are allocated to countries on a quota basis and distributed to individuals by a lottery. But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.

A day ago, Pakistan was appointed chair of the committee established under Resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of sanctions against the Afghan Taliban. Pakistan was also named vice chair of the Security Council’s Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), which monitors implementation of Resolution 1373 (2001), a core component of the UN’s global counterterrorism architecture.
Additionally, Pakistan will serve as co-chair of two important subsidiary bodies: the Informal Working Group on Documentation and the newly formed Working Group on Sanctions.
In a post on X, the prime minister said the appointments were a “matter of great pride”.
He added: “These key appointments validate the international community’s confidence and trust in Pakistan’s counterterrorism credentials as well as an acknowledgement of our strong and unwavering commitment to eradicate this global menace.
“As one of the biggest victims of terrorism, with over 90,000 casualties and more than $150 billion economic losses, Pakistan’s sacrifices in combatting this scourge have been second to none.”
 






The Pakistan Mission to the UN had called the appointments a “significant diplomatic development”.
“These appointments represent an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s active engagement with the United Nations system, including its constructive role as an elected member of the Security Council,” a press release had said, adding, “They are also an international recognition of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts”.
Pakistan, it said, remained committed to working with the UN and fellow member states in advancing the principles and purposes of the UN Charter as well as playing its part in the global fight against terrorism in collaboration with its international partners.
Pakistan began a two-year term as a non-permanent UNSC member on the first day of the new year. This marks Pakistan’s eighth term on the council, providing an opportunity to shape discussions on pivotal international issues, but also posing significant challenges.
Elected in June to replace Japan, Pakistan occupies one of the two Asia-Pacific seats on the UNSC. It will preside over the council in July, a key opportunity to set the agenda and foster dialogue.
While only permanent members hold veto power in the council, non-permanent members wield significant influence in terrorism-related sanctions committees, as decisions are made by consensus under established norms.
Pakistan’s term coincides with heightened tensions in conflict zones such as Gaza, held Kashmir and Syria.
The committee announcements came days after a high-level Pakistani parliamentary delegation concluded a visit to the UN headquarters in New York. The delegation wrapped up its engagements on Tuesday after a series of meetings with senior UN officials and diplomats from various member states.
During the visit, the delegation briefed UN officials on what they described as India’s escalating rhetoric and actions aimed at pushing the region towards conflict. Pakistani representatives urged the international community to take note of New Delhi’s alleged attempts to provoke a confrontation and stressed Islamabad’s commitment to regional peace and stability.
The delegation also reiterated Pakistan’s willingness to engage in comprehensive dialogue with India, including cooperation on counterterrorism, to defuse tensions and foster long-term peace in South Asia.</p><small>2025-06-05 14:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051841416bc9da5.png?r=184149' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915623/nepra-announces-rs298-per-unit-refund-for-ke-consumers-in-june-bills' target='_blank'><strong>Nepra announces Rs2.98 per unit refund for KE consumers in June bills</strong></a><br><p>The National Elec­t­ric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs2.98 per unit for K-Electric (KE) consumers in June’s bills for power consumed in March.
According to a notification issued by Nepra today,  the authority “decided to allow a negative FCA of Rs2.9898/kWh (negative Rs4.045 billion) for March 2025, to be passed on to the consumers in the billing month of June 2025”.
Nepra said the negative FCA would apply to “all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, domestic protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and prepaid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”.
The adjustment would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the respective month to which the adjustment pertains, it said.
“In case any bills of June 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” the notification said.
It also said that KE shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of March in the billing month of June.
The notification said that the negative FCA of Rs2.98/kWh was being allowed on a “provisional basis subject to adjustment” once Nepra determined KE’s Multi-Year Tariff for FY2024-30. “The difference in cost, if any, based on the MYT FY 2024-30 would be allowed in future adjustments once the same is notified,” it added.
Separately, Nepra also notified a 0.93 per unit additional FCA following an adjustment on account of variation in fuel charges for April in the approved tariff of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos).
According to a separate notification issued today, the authority “has reviewed and assessed a National Average Uniform increase of Rs0.9306/kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variations in the fuel charges for April”.
The notification said that the FCA should apply to all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, EVCS and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for prepaid tariffs.
“Discos shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of April 2025 in the billing month of June 2025,” the notification said, adding that it would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills based on units utilised in April.
“In case any bills of June 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in the subsequent month,” it added.</p><small>2025-06-05 13:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/05174421e81d1ee.jpg?r=175450' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915634/japanese-startup-to-attempt-moon-landing' target='_blank'><strong>Japanese startup to attempt moon landing</strong></a><br><p>A Japanese startup will attempt a tricky lunar touchdown on Friday with an unmanned lander named Resilience, two years after its first try which crashed onto the moon’s surface.
If successful, it will be only the third private mission to the Earth’s rocky natural satellite ever completed, and the first by a company based outside of the United States.
The startup, ispace, says touchdown is expected at 4:17am Japan time on Friday (1917 GMT on Thursday) with the potentially nail-biting attempt streamed on its website.
Resilience is “ready to attempt a historic landing on the moon” and “we are confident in our preparations for success”, ispace CEO Takeshi Hakamada said last week.
“We have leveraged the operational experience gained in Mission 1 and during this current voyage to the moon,” he said in a statement.
Only five nations have soft-landed spacecraft on the moon: the Soviet Union, the US, China, India and Japan.
Companies are vying to offer cheaper and more frequent space exploration opportunities than governments.
Last year, the Houston-based Intuitive Machines became the first private enterprise to touch down on the moon. Although its uncrewed craft landed at the wrong angle, it was still able to complete tests and send photos.
Then in March this year, Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost — launched on the same SpaceX rocket as ispace’s Resilience — aced its lunar landing attempt.
Despite their rocket ride-share, Resilience took longer to reach the moon than Blue Ghost, and ispace is now hoping for its own moment of glory, after its first mission resulted in an unsalvageable “hard landing” in 2023.
Landing on the moon is highly challenging as spacecraft must rely on precisely controlled thruster burning to slow their descent.
Intuitive Machines’ second attempt at a moon landing ended in disappointment in late March.
Its spacecraft Athena, designed to touch down on a spot called the Mons Mouton plateau — closer to the lunar south pole than any previous mission — tipped over and was unable to recharge its solar-powered batteries.
Meanwhile another Japanese startup, Space One, has been trying to become the country’s first private firm to put a satellite into orbit.
Its latest rocket launch attempt in December blasted off but was later seen spiralling downwards in the distance as the company said the launch had to be terminated.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0517394274f0ce4.jpg?r=174338' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915631/trump-orders-inquiry-into-conspiracy-to-hide-bidens-health-decline' target='_blank'><strong>Trump orders inquiry into ‘conspiracy’ to hide Biden’s health decline</strong></a><br><p>US President Donald Trump on Wednesday ordered an investigation into what Republicans claim was a “conspiracy” to cover up Joe Biden’s declining cognitive health during his time in the White House.
The move, which was slammed by Biden, is the latest in a long-running campaign by Trump — with the backing of Republican Party politicians and their cheerleaders in the conservative media — to discredit his predecessor.
But it also comes as a growing chorus of Democrats begin to acknowledge the former president appeared to have been slipping in recent years.
Those concerns were thrown into stark relief by a disastrous debate performance against Trump during last year’s presidential campaign, in which the then-81-year-old stumbled over his words and repeatedly lost his train of thought.
“In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former president Biden’s aides abused the power of presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden’s cognitive decline,” a presidential memorandum issued on Wednesday reads.
“This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history. The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden’s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.”
‘Ridiculous and false’
Biden vehemently denied the allegations.
“Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations,” he said in a statement shared with AFP.
“Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false,” he said, slamming the ordered probe as “nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation”.
Republicans have long claimed that Biden was suffering from intellectual decline even as the White House pressed ahead with major legislation and presidential decrees during his term.
They cite his infrequent public appearances, as well as his apparent unwillingness to sit for interviews as evidence of what they say was a man incapable of doing the demanding job of Commander-in-Chief of the United States.
They insist that those around him covered up his physical and cognitive decline, taking decisions on his behalf and using a device that could reproduce his signature to allow them to continue to run the country in his name.
‘Autopen’
“The Counsel to the President, in consultation with the Attorney General and the head of any other relevant executive department or agency … shall investigate … whether certain individuals conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President,” the memorandum says.
The probe will also look at “the circumstances surrounding Biden’s supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office [including] the policy documents for which the autopen was used [and] who directed that the President’s signature be affixed.”
Biden’s calamitous debate performance ultimately sank his bid for reelection, with key Democratic Party figures soon calling for him to drop out of the race.
But it was only several weeks later, after unsuccessful attempts to quieten his critics, that he withdrew, anointing his vice-president Kamala Harris, who eventually lost to Trump.
The Democratic Party is increasingly riven by squabbles about whether Biden could have been forced to step down earlier to give the party chance to find a more popular presidential candidate.
Biden’s former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday criticised the in-fighting by the Democrats, calling it a “betrayal” of Biden and announcing her departure from the party as a result.
The fight has been given oxygen with the publication of a book by journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that claims the former president’s inner circle connived to keep him from public view because of his decline, which included forgetting familiar faces like Hollywood star and party stalwart George Clooney.
Trump’s claims of a cover-up were also boosted by news that Biden is suffering from an “aggressive” prostate cancer, with some voices on the right insisting — without evidence — the diagnosis must have been known some time ago to those close to the former president.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607912-pakistan-terminates-simla-agreement-with-india-khawaja-asif' target='_blank'><strong>Simla Agreement lost its 'sanctity' due to India's unilateral actions: Asif</strong></a><br><p>

The security situation in Balochistan has deteriorated, with militants escalating attacks as part of a long-running insurgency. Last month, Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” post-Pahalgam to intensify terrorism in Pakistan, citing “irrefutable evidence” of state-sponsored attacks directed by Indian military personnel. He said “credible intelligence” showed India tasked groups such as the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban and other militant cells to ramp up activity.
Addressing a press conference in Islamabad today, Bugti referred to the attacks in his province and said: “This is a completely Raw-funded intelligence-driven war against the state of Pakistan.”
He said India changed its narrative after suffering a crushing blow by Pakistan’s security forces during their recent military escalation.
“Pakistan army gave a befitting reply to Indian aggression. The failure of Operation Sindoor ignited the Indian proxy Fitna ul Hindustan,” he said, adding that the Indian media shared fake news about an attack on Karachi port.
 


Last month, India and Pakistan engaged in a military confrontation over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi launched air strikes killing civilians, prompting Pakistan to down five Indian jets in retaliation. After reciprocal strikes on airbases, American intervention on May 10 secured a ceasefire.
During his press conference, CM Bugti showed a video of what he said was an “Indian proxy” agent talking to an unknown person — that the chief minister claimed was a RAW handler — sharing intelligence about Karachi port as evidence of Indian involvement.
“The government has sufficient evidence against Fitna ul Hindustan which will be shared at appropriate time,” he said. “The enemy wants to destroy Pakistan’s emerging economy.”
The chief minister said these “Indian proxies” had no connection with the Baloch identity, but were terrorists attacking Pakistani citizens and security forces.
“They should not be connected with Baloch identity. The Baloch have their own culture but they [terrorists] have [done away with] all norms. They are terrorists killing innocent Pakistanis and attacking security forces,” the chief minister said.
In reply to a question, he said the government could launch an operation in Balochistan against the terrorists, but security forces were focusing on small kinetic operations.
“There can be an operation in Balochistan like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, but it is not in law enforcement agencies’ capacity,” he said. “The solution is small, kinetic operations which security forces are conducting.”
“If required, we will not hesitate to use the military to conduct an operation.”
Bugti said terrorist capacity had risen due to US gadgets available on the black market and weapons supplied by RAW.
“The solution is small kinetic IBOs (intelligence-based operations).”
Regarding the issue of missing persons, the chief minister said that “a narrative had been built” against the state on a controversial subject.  “There is a missing count. There are people missing in KP. No one speaks about them,” he said.
He said the Balochistan government passed legislation to set up centres where radicalised youth would be trained to reintegrate them into society.
“They will be kept there, their parents will be there, a magistrate will be present. A high-powered board chaired by BHC (Balochistan High Court) chief justice will be giving them extension,” he said.
Bugti also said there was a difference between “self-disappearance” and enforced disappearances.
“Many have self-disappeared. That’s why we passed a law and political dialogue will continue,” he added.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/0517143775999d5.jpg?r=171835' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915624/putin-ready-to-help-resolve-iran-nuclear-stand-off-kremlin' target='_blank'><strong>Putin ready to ‘help resolve’ Iran nuclear stand-off: Kremlin</strong></a><br><p>Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to “help resolve” the standoff between Iran and the United States over Tehran’s nuclear programme, the Kremlin said on Thursday.
“We have a close partnership with Tehran. And President Putin said that he was ready to use this partnership to help resolve the Iranian nuclear issue,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
After a call between the leaders on Wednesday, US President Donald Trump said Putin had offered to “participate” in talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, as Trump accused Iran of “slow-walking” its response to Washington’s offer of a deal.
Washington and Tehran have held five rounds of talks since April to thrash out a new accord to replace the nuclear deal that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.
Trump said on Monday that his administration would not allow “any” enrichment of uranium, despite Tehran’s insistence that it has the right under the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said earlier on Wednesday that Washington’s proposal was against Tehran’s national interest.
Russia and Iran have deepened their military ties amid Moscow’s military offensive on Ukraine. The Kremlin said earlier this week that Tehran had the “right” to a run a peaceful nuclear energy programme.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:18</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/06/051645196ec8982.png?r=164701' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1915610/ptis-omar-ayub-requests-committee-formation-to-appoint-new-chief-election-commissioner' target='_blank'><strong>PTI’s Omar Ayub requests committee formation to appoint new chief election commissioner</strong></a><br><p>Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan on Thursday submitted a request to National Assembly (NA) Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq to constitute a committee to appoint a new chief election commissioner (CEC) and two new members of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).
The constitutional deadline for the appointment of a new chief election commis­sioner and two members of the ECP exp­ired on March 12, with no action from the government.
On Wednesday, it emerged that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif wrote a letter to Ayub inviting him to join consultations to appoint a new CEC. No exact date for a meeting was given, nor were any names released about prospective CECs in the letter, dated May 16.
In today’s letter to the NA speaker — seen by Dawn.com — Ayub recalled a previous letter written on January 15 in which he requested that the parliamentary process to appoint a new CEC be initiated.
“I am writing once again to remind you that a considerable period has passed since the expiry of the Chief Election Commissioner’s tenure,” Ayub wrote.
In accordance with parliamentary procedure, the opposition leader nominated six members of the opposition; two from the National Assembly and two from the Senate.
The nominees from the lower house were PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser, Sunni Ittehad Council Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza and MNA Latif Khosa.
Senators Shibli Faraz and Allama Raja Nasir were Ayub’s nominees from the upper house.
Ayub requested that “the process for the formation of the Parliamentary Committee under Article 213(2B) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (The parliamentary committee to be constituted by the speaker shall comprise fifty per cent members from the treasury benches and fifty per cent from the opposition parties) be initiated at the earliest, to facilitate the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner and two members of the Election Commission of Pakistan from Sindh and Balochistan”.
The 26th Constitutional Amendment allowed the CEC and its members to continue until their successors take the position. As per Article 215(4) of the Constitution (vacancy in the office of the Commissioner or a member
shall be filled within 45 days), the appointment of the CEC and members must be completed within 45 days.</p><small>2025-06-05 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607906-met-office-issues-severe-heatwave-alert-for-eid-holidays' target='_blank'><strong>Met Office issues severe heatwave alert for Eid holidays</strong></a><br><p>

State prosecutors say Mohamed Soliman, 45, faces nearly 400 years in prison on attempted murder charges in state court. He also faces other state charges.
Prosecutors on Wednesday said the number of people injured in the attack rose to 15 ranging in age from 25 to 88. A dog also was injured. Soliman also faces federal hate crimes charges that carry a life sentence. A federal court appearance is scheduled for Friday.
 
 

The Boulder public defenders office, listed in court documents as representing Soliman, did not respond to a request for comment.
Prosecutors say that Soliman, an Egyptian national, on Sunday tossed Molotov cocktails and yelled “Free Palestine” at people taking part in an event organised by Run for Their Lives, an organisation devoted to drawing attention to the hostages seized during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, sparking the devastating onslaught in Gaza.
The incident comes as pressure on Israel rises to cease what has been called a “genocide” in Gaza by the United Nations and Amnesty International among other international human rights organisations.
Soliman entered the US on a tourist visa in 2022 and recently lived in Colorado Springs. Federal officials say he had overstayed that tourist visa and his work permit had expired, and he was in the country illegally.
His family, including his wife, two teenagers and three younger children, were taken into custody on Tuesday and may be deported, though a federal judge on Wednesday blocked their immediate removal.
The attack was the latest act of violence aimed at Jewish Americans amid Israel’s escalating military offensive in Gaza, which has so far killed over 54,000 Palestinians, prompting growing criticism from the international community.
It followed the fatal shooting of two Israeli Embassy aides that took place outside Washington’s Capital Jewish Museum last month.
Walk on
Shira Weiss, the global coordinator for the Run for Their Lives grassroots movement, said the Boulder attack had stunned her organisation, which has 230 chapters around the globe.
 
 

Weiss said it was bewildering why the organisation — which she said is apolitical, aims to stay out of policy arguments and that had never threatened before — was targeted by Soliman.
“This is so sad that we were trying to do something positive and something good, and this horrible thing happened,” she said.
Following the attack, Weiss asked local chapters to pause their short weekly walks, but overwhelmingly heard back that people wanted to carry on.
About 80 per cent of chapters will hold their weekly walks as scheduled this weekend. That includes a Sunday walk in Boulder, which will coincide with the city’s 30th annual Jewish festival, which organisers said would go on with heightened security measures and a focus on the efforts of Run for Their Lives.
Weiss has received 20 enquiries about starting new chapters since the attack in Boulder, and has also seen an increase in the number of people wanting to walk with existing groups.
Maya Bajayo, organiser for the Denver chapter of Run for Their Lives, said the group will join the Boulder chapter on its Sunday walk. Despite anxieties about security, she expects that all 50 regular members of her group would participate.</p><small>2025-06-05 11:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607900-pti-names-lawmakers-for-parliamentary-committee-to-appoint-cec-ecp-members' target='_blank'><strong>PTI names lawmakers for parliamentary committee to appoint CEC, ECP members</strong></a><br><p>

Day temperatures are likely to remain 5 to 7°C above normal from June 7-12 in Peshawar, Swabi, Mardan, Charsadda, Nowshera, Kohat, Hangu, Bannu, Karak, Lakki Marwat, Khyber, Kurram, Orakzai, Waziristan, Tank, Dera Ismail Khan, Chitral, Dir, Swat, Kohistan, Shangla, Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur and Mohmand, according to a PDMA advisory dated June 5, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com.
“Additionally, dust storm/rain-thunderstorm associated with gusty winds are expected over the province,” PDMA said.
It noted that rising temperatures in upper areas may enhance the snowmelt rate during the forecasted period, and advised precautionary measures be taken to avoid any loss of life, damages to crops/ infrastructure and livestock.
The general public, especially senior citizens and children, should avoid direct exposure to sunlight during peak hours between 10am-5pm.
The PDMA said it was necessary to ensure that the general public was “made aware to make judicious use of water for drinking and cooling-off.”
Individuals with underlying health conditions were encouraged to remain especially vigilant and ensure they have necessary medical supplies readily available.
The PDMA advised to promote the use of appropriate protective measures, such as lightweight, loose-fitting and light-coloured clothing, along with SPF and hats.
“Educate the public about the signs and symptoms of heat-related illnesses (ie
dehydration, heat exhaustion, heatstroke) and necessary steps to take when
experiencing these symptoms,” the advisory said.
The KP Health Department, in coordination with local administration, was directed to mobilise resources to establish heatstroke centers, cooling points, and mobile cooling stations at high-traffic areas.
“Ensure the facilities are equipped with adequate cooling equipment (air
conditioners, fans, misting systems) and drinking water [and] have trained personnel available to provide immediate medical assistance if needed.”
Additionally, farmers were advised to manage their wheat harvesting keeping in view the weather conditions, and to take care of their livestock as well.
The advisory requested that emergency services, such as Rescue 1122 and the fire brigade remain alert against possible fires.</p><small>2025-06-05 11:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607835-pm-shehbaz-embarks-on-two-day-official-visit-to-saudi-arabia-today' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reaches Saudi Arabia on two-day official visit</strong></a><br><p>

On Monday, Karachi police arrested a main suspect along with two of his employees over charges of beating a citizen named Dheeraj. The suspect, identified as Salman Farooqi, was arrested from DHA and his vehicle was impounded.
Farooqi, who was travelling in a luxury car, allegedly assaulted a motorcyclist accompanied by a woman on the Khayaban-i-Ittehad Road following a minor accident.
A judicial magistrate on Tuesday remanded Farooqi and his guard, Owais Hashmi in police custody in the case. They were produced in court today by the police following the completion of their two-day remand.
Today, Dheeraj appeared in court and identified the suspect.
“I was not aware that the court had summoned me,” he said. “The lawyer told me today, so I appeared.”
The judicial magistrate asked Dheeraj whether he was facing any sort of pressure.
“It was my fault, my bike hit his car,” Dheeraj told the court.
“I do not want to file a case. I forgive the suspect,” he said, adding  “Whatever the court decides, I will have no objection.”
Public Prosecutor Irfana Qadri told the court that a case had been registered against the suspect for threatening and humiliating a woman, identified as Dheeraj’s sister Kalpana.
“These are non-bailable charges,” Qadri said. The court reserved its verdict after the lawyers’ arguments.
In a separate hearing, however, Additional District and Sessions Judge Abdul Zahoor Chandio rejected the bail application filed by Farooqi and Hashmi.
A case had been registered against the suspects at the Gizri police station on the complaint of an eyewitness citizen.
Dheeraj filed a no objection certificate (NOC). However, the sessions court noted that the affidavit appeared to have been submitted under undue influence or coercion and did not accept the NOC.</p><small>2025-06-05 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/607876-with-us-lawmakers-pakistan-delegation-raises-indias-provocations-stresses-dialogue' target='_blank'><strong>With US lawmakers, Pakistan delegation raises India's provocations, stresses dialogue</strong></a><br><p>

They added that Faisal Sagheer, 45, allegedly killed his wife Sana, 35, and 10-year-old son Mohammed Ali. Later on, he attempted suicide by cutting his throat and got injured.
Surjani Town police SHO Mohammed Ali Shah told Dawn that Faisal owned a hardware shop in the area but on the day of the incident, he did not open it.
His children study the Quran at the home of his sister in the vicinity of the same area, but on that day they did not attend the class as well.
It triggered suspicion among his relatives. Faisal’s sister made calls on the cell phone of her sister-in-law, which was on, but no one responded. Ultimately, she visited the residence of her brother in Yusuf Goth near Karimi Chowrangi, knocked at the door but did not get any response.
Then she saw from a window that both her brother and sister-in-law were struggling for their lives. She raised alarm, alerting neighbours who entered the home with the help of a ladder. They took them to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital where the woman and her son were pronounced dead on arrival while Faisal was admitted in critical condition.
The officer said that Sana sustained cuts while her son’s cause of death is yet to be ascertained. The couple’s two daughters remained safe.
 
 

He said it appeared that Faisal did not want to kill his son. He hinted at the possibility that he might have given tranquiliser to his family, which might have led to the death of the minor son due to the overdose. He said the couple’s daughters did not wake up till afternoon, which indicated the possibility that they might have been given a tranquiliser, but they remained safe.
The officer said the husband killed his wife by putting a piece of cloth on her face and suffocated her.
He said it seemed that the man stabbed his wife to death for some reason and later on tried to kill himself as he did not want to stab and kill his children, but one of his children died due to an overdose of drugs.
However, he said the exact cause of death of the son would be ascertained after a post-mortem examination as there were no injury marks on the body.
In a statement, the officer said when the police arrived at the spot, the house was locked from the inside.
The couple’s two daughters Bareeda and Aimal were present in the house. They told the police that they usually wake up at 10 or 11am but on that day, they woke up at 4pm, indicating a strong possibility that they were given sleeping pills or something.
The police have recovered the knife used in the incident.
“Different aspects of the incident are being probed and after completion of the investigation, an FIR will be registered,” according to the police statement.
“The case has been almost solved as a strong possibility has emerged during investigation so far that the injured man Faisal killed his wife and son and then attempted suicide,” said SSP Mastoi.
Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said the husband is alive but in critical condition with cut injuries while the wife had sustained fatal cuts.
Dr Summaiya added that the minor boy has no visible marks of violence. All samples have been collected and cause of death reserved.

The accused was presented before Judicial Magistrate Ahmed Shehzad Gondal by the federal police. Tensions rose in the courtroom when the magistrate noticed the absence of both the prosecutor and the district public prosecutor.
Expressing his displeasure, Magistrate Gondal said: “Where are the prosecutors of my court? Usually, no one shows up, but today the courtroom is full.”
Upon being informed by the duty prosecutor that the regular prosecutor was on leave, the magistrate ordered the presence of the district prosecutor before the proceedings could continue. The hearing was briefly adjourned, and the accused was taken back into police custody while awaiting the district prosecutor’s arrival.

Identification parade to be conducted once victim’s mother, aunt return from Chitral

Senator Falak Naz was also present in the courtroom during the hearing.
 
 

Later, upon reviewing the investigation officer’s request, the magistrate approved the remand and ordered Omar Hayat to be sent to jail for 14 days for the purpose of conducting an identification parade.
The suspect had allegedly murdered 17-year-old Sana Yousaf at her house in G-13 on Monday. He was arrested from Faisalabad within 20 hours of the incident. Additionally, the victim’s mobile phone and the murder weapon were also recovered from his possession.
“The ruthless killer took the phone with him after the murder to destroy evidence. In order to apprehend the accused, raids were conducted at over 11 locations in three cities. The accused is a 22-year-old unemployed man who repeatedly attempted to contact the victim. Upon her refusal to respond, he committed the murder,” said the police.
Moreover, the mother and aunt of Sana Yousaf are likely to identify the suspect arrested by the police in connection with the teenage girl’s murder, Dawn has learnt.
Police officers said that on Wednesday, the suspect was sent to Adiala jail on a 14-day judicial remand for the identification parade.
 
 

They said that a case had been registered over the murder in response to a complaint lodged by the victim’s mother, Farzana Yousaf. According to the FIR, the victim’s aunt was present in the house, while her father was outside.
However, the FIR does not clearly state whether the victim’s mother was present in the house at the time of the murder, the officers added. They said the family of Sana Yousaf had left for their hometown in Chitral along with the body for burial.
The police will request the mother and aunt to return as soon as possible for the identification parade.
The victim’s aunt, who also resides in Chitral, had come to Islamabad a few days ago to visit her brother (Sana Yousaf’s father) and was present in the house at the time of the murder.
The officers said that, so far, the investigators only have evidence in the form of geo-fencing data, recovery of an iPhone from the suspect, and CCTV footage. The suspect has yet to be interrogated, as no witness has so far recorded a statement regarding the murder.
However, there are two potential witnesses. The aunt who was present at the scene and the mother, on whose complaint the case was registered.
So far, the police have made successful efforts to trace and arrest the suspect and obtained his judicial remand for further legal action, the officers said. The investigation into the murder will gain momentum after the identification parade and recording of witness statements.
The police are also tracing other individuals considered as suspects who may have either assisted the suspect or been used by him intentionally. After committing the murder, the suspect reportedly left the victim’s house in a car driven by another person and reached Chungi No 26, from where he boarded a passenger vehicle.
The police will also investigate the ownership of the weapon used in the murder — whether it was licensed or illegal — and determine who owned or lent it to the suspect.
Bringing the weapon to the victim’s house suggests that he came there with the intent to harm her, the officers added.
