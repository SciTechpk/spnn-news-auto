• Hamas says US pressure essential as Israeli officials to hold ceasefire talks in Washington
• Over 170 charities call for end to Gaza Humanitarian Foundation’s ‘deadly’ aid distribution system
WASHINGTON: The United States is pushing for a truce in Gaza by “sometime next week”, US President Donald Trump said Tuesday.
The Republican leader was asked by reporters if a ceasefire by Israel in its devastating war on Palestinians could be in place before a visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House, set for July 7.
Trump said he is hopeful that a ‘ceasefire-for-prisoners’ agreement can be achieved soon.
“We hope it’s going to happen, and we’re looking for it to happen sometime next week,” Trump responded as he departed Washington for Florida.
In Florida, he told the media that he would be “very firm” with Netanyahu on the need for a speedy Gaza ceasefire while noting that the Israeli PM wants one as well.
A senior Israeli official, Ron Dermer, has been in Washington this week holding talks ahead of the meeting.
Last week, the US president had signalled that an agreement involving Israel and Hamas could come as early as the current week.
“The situation in Gaza is terrible. We think, within the next week, we are going to get a ceasefire,” he told reporters at the White House on Friday.
Hamas has said it is willing to free  remaining prisoners in Gaza under any deal to end the war, while Israel  says it will only back down once Hamas is “disarmed and dismantled”.
Military escalation in Gaza
But even as Netanyahu’s confidant was in talks over a possible ceasefire, Israeli planes and tanks struck heavily in north and south Gaza on Tuesday, destroying clusters of homes.
Thousands of Gaza residents again took flight as Israel issued new orders to evacuate, while its tanks pushed into eastern areas of Gaza City in the north and into Khan Younis and Rafah in the south, residents said.
Local health authorities said Israeli gunfire and military strikes across the enclave had killed at least 112 people and wounded more than 400 in the past 24 hours, with clusters of houses reported destroyed in Gaza City’s Shejaia and Zeitoun districts, east of Khan Younis and in Rafah. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
Israel’s Strategic Affairs Minister Ron Dermer, a confidant of Netanyahu, is in Washington this week to meet with officials at the White House, President Donald Trump’s spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a press briefing on Monday.
Dermer would be exploring possibilities of regional diplomatic deals in the wake of Israel’s 12-day war with Iran last month, as well as ending the Gaza war, according to an Israeli official.
Ceasefire efforts stalled
Senior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri said pressure by Trump on Israel would be key to any breakthrough in stalled ceasefire efforts.
“We call upon the US administration to atone for its sin towards Gaza by declaring an end to the war,” he said.
After a six-week ceasefire at the start of this year, talks on extending the truce in the nearly 21-month war have stalled.
‘Halt GHF scheme’
Meanwhile, 171 charities in Geneva signed on the call for countries to press Israel to halt Gaza Humanitarian Foundation scheme over concerns it is putting civilians at risk of death and injury.
Over 500 people have been killed near aid distribution centres since May. “Palestinians in Gaza face an impossible choice: starve or risk being shot while trying desperately to reach food to feed their families,” the statement said.
Groups signing it included Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders, Save the Children, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Amnesty International. The NGOs accused the GHF of forcing hungry and weak people to trek for hours, sometimes through active conflict zones.

A vital institution, the ECP is responsible for protecting Pakistan’s democracy and upholding democratic principles, mainly through the conduct of free and fair polls. Over the past three years, however, it seems to have done anything but that. It has not only disregarded constitutional edicts — for example, regarding election timelines — and issued illegal decisions — such as denying a major political party its right to contest elections — but has also failed to conduct a free and fair general election or ensure that democratic principles were upheld during the many controversies that followed.
 
 

Of course, it is not that past commissions were free of controversy. Rigging and manipulation disputes followed the two elections preceding 2024 as well, particularly in 2018. But what is complicating matters now is a technical roadblock preventing the ECP from making a fresh start.
The delay in reconstituting the ECP’s membership following the expiry of Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja and the Sindh and Balochistan members’ tenures in January this year has put the institution under the spotlight. Though critics have repeatedly called the ECP’s integrity into question, a provision introduced under the controversial 26th Amendment allows them to stay on till their replacements are appointed.
The government clearly has little interest in seeing them gone, but the opposition, too, seems more interested in playing politics than pushing the process forward. Though the PM has written to the opposition leader in the National Assembly to seek consultations, he has not given a meeting date; the opposition leader wants to skip a tête-à-tête altogether and desires, instead, a parliamentary committee to be appointed pre-emptively to determine the appointments — a demand which the NA Speaker has turned down.
Given that the current commissioners can stay indefinitely, it is unlikely that the effort to reshuffle the ECP will achieve much, unless either the government or the opposition takes up the matter seriously.
The ruling elite must remember that the current formula, of engaging both government and opposition in the appointment process, was done through the 18th Amendment after past experience taught political stakeholders that a neutral, mutually acceptable commissioner appointed after deliberation and consultation would serve everyone’s interests. Abandoning this formula would be another serious blow to Pakistan’s democratic progress since its last dictatorship.
The opposition, too, must approach the matter with seriousness. The opposition leader must keep pushing publicly for a meeting with the PM. Refusing to talk to rivals has not and cannot help the PTI achieve its goals. It must honour the process and move it forward.

• SBP reports credit-to-GDP ratio lowest in region
KARACHI: After three years of sluggish activity, private sector borrowing appears to have rebounded, reaching a three-year high in FY25.
According to the State Bank’s latest data released on Monday, the private sector borrowed Rs710 billion during FY25, compared to Rs513bn in FY24 and a mere Rs45.8bn in FY23 — the latter marking one of Pakistan’s worst economic years, as GDP growth turned negative.
In FY24, most of the borrowing was directed towards working capital requirements for industries such as sugar and rice, with little to no investment in new industrial ventures.
Bankers said this trend largely continued into FY25, with borrowing still skewed towards short-term working capital. However, they highlighted a shift in the final quarter of FY25, when a steep decline in interest rates encouraged greater borrowing activity.
Despite a significant cut in interest rates from 22pc to 11pc during FY25, the private sector response remained cautious. Borrowing levels still fell short of those seen in FY22, when the sector borrowed Rs1.33tr — marking a 17.4pc increase that year.
Analysts point to the political and economic turmoil following the change in government during FY23 as a key factor behind the collapse in private sector activity. That year saw negative GDP growth and minimal borrowing.
The private sector is widely recognised as a critical driver of economic development, fuelling investment, employment and business creation. However, its performance remains closely tied to the broader governance environment, which shapes its competitiveness and capacity for growth.
In a recent report, the State Bank observed that Pakistan’s credit-to-GDP ratio has been declining for decades and is among the lowest in the region. This has hindered growth, job creation and poverty reduction.
The SBP identified both demand and supply side constraints, including high borrowing costs, shallow financial markets, crowding out by government borrowing, and banks’ preference for lending to blue-chip corporates. Structural challenges, such as the energy crisis, also continue to weigh on credit expansion.
The SBP maintained a tight monetary policy through FY24, keeping the policy rate at 22pc to curb inflation, which ended the year at 24pc. Though inflation began ticking up again in May, analysts expect no sharp surge in the near term. However, banks’ continued preference for investing in government securities over private lending may limit the private sector’s ability to return to FY22 borrowing levels.

(LEFT to right) IHC CJ Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, PHC CJ S. M. Attique Shah, BHC CJ Rozi Khan Barrech and SHC CJ Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar.

• Receives nine votes from 16-member JCP; set to take oath in a couple of days
• Justice Rozi Barrech named BHC CJ, Justice Attique Shah becomes top judge at PHC, Justice Junaid Ghaffar appointed to head SHC
• Justice Mansoor suggests postponing JCP meeting until decision on IHC judges’ appeal
• Justice Mandokhail abstains from voting, citing his position on Constitutional Bench
ISLAMABAD: The five Islamabad High Court judges who had petitioned the Supreme Court over a seniority dispute were left with no recourse on Tuesday, as the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — in a highly-anticipated move — nominated Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar as the permanent chief justice of the high court.
The appointment of Justice Sarfraz Dogar as the new IHC chief justice was expected after President Asif Ali Zardari formally declared him the “senior-most judge” last week, following the issuance of a revised seniority list by the Ministry of Law.
Justice Dogar was transferred to the IHC from the Lahore High Court under Article 200(1) of the Constitution on Feb 1 this year.
Headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, the 16-member JCP held four different meetings, also concerning the appointments of chief justices for the Balochistan High Court (BHC), Peshawar High Court (PHC), Sindh High Court (SHC).
But the appointment of the IHC CJ was peculiar, since it had evoked much interest among the legal fraternity in view of the representation by five IHC judges, and a constitutional petition filed before the Supreme Court.
For the IHC, the JCP had three nominees under consideration: Justice Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb. Justice Dogar received a total of nine votes, while Justice Aurangzeb was supported by the CJP, PTI members Barrister Syed Ali Zafar and Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, as well as Islamabad High Court Council member Zulfikar Abbas.
Justice Mohsin Kayani received the votes of SC’s senior puisne judge Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Munib Akhtar.
Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail did not vote for any nominee, stating that since he was a member of the Const­itutional Bench, he preferred to abstain.
Justice Dogar, however, secured the support of the remaining members: Justice Aminuddin Khan, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, Ahsan Bhoon, Sheikh Aftab Ahmed, Rana Tanveer, Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui and Roshan Khursheed Bharucha.
He is now expected to take oath in the next couple of days at the Presidency, as the JCP has already informed the principal secretary to the prime minister about his elevation.
As Tuesday’s session commenced, Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, who was connected via weblink from Tokyo (Japan), suggested postponing the meeting until the pendency of the intra-court appeal (ICA) filed on behalf of the five IHC judges against the Constitutional Bench’s June 19 judgement in the seniority dispute.
In its short order, the CB, by a majority of three to two, had held that the transfer of three judges to the IHC from three different high courts was within the framework of the Constitution.
Subsequently, discussion ensued on the suggestion, with some members stating that since the seniority dispute had already been resolved, the JCP should proceed with the appointment process for the IHC.
Meanwhile, some members suggested that the JCP, as a constitutional body, could decide to put on hold the appointment of Justice Dogar as chief justice. Others were of the view that until the ICA was finally decided, Justice Aurangzeb should be elevated as the acting chief justice of the IHC.
When the JCP commenced its proceedings, Justice Shah reiterated his earlier stance that the commission should wait until the vires of the 26th Constitutional Amendment were decided by the Constitutional Bench before addressing matters that directly flow from it.
Justice Shah also wrote a fresh letter to the JCP to highlight his point.
Earlier, the JCP also considered a letter from Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail of the Balochistan High Court, who drew the commission’s attention to the fact that the participation of retired Justice Nazir Ahmad Lango as its member would violate the mandate of Article 175A(5) of the Constitution.
However, the commission, by majority, reappointed Justice Lango as a member of the commission and, in turn, nominated Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice of the BHC. The names of Justice Mulakhail and Justice Iqbal Ahmed Kazi were also under consideration for the same post.
Justice S.M. Attique Shah was nominated as the chief justice of the Peshawar High Court. The names of Justice Ejaz Anwar and Justice Arshad Ali were also considered. PTI lawmakers and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa law minister opposed Justice Attique’s appointment.
Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Junaid Ghaffar was unanimously appointed chief justice of the Sindh High Court.

Federal tax collection in Karachi rose by 29 per cent year-on-year, while the Sindh Revenue Board (SRB) recorded a 29.5pc increase in sales tax on services. The city retained its status as the largest contributor to national and provincial revenue.
The SRB collects General Sales Tax (GST) on services, while five offices of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) — RTO-1, RTO-2, Medium Tax­payers Office (MTO), Corporate Tax Office (CTO), and Large Taxpayers Office (LTO) — handle income tax, sales tax on goods, and Federal Excise Duty (FED) within Karachi.
 
 

According to estimates, 80pc of SRB’s GST collection originates from Karachi, with the remaining 20pc from interior Sindh. However, even when operations are based outside the city, taxes are still collected at the company headquarters in Karachi.

LTO and SRB report historic highs in income tax and GST on services in FY25

LTO Karachi performance
The Large Taxpayers Office (LTO) Karachi collected Rs3.256 trillion in FY25, up from Rs2.515tr in the previous year — an increase of 29.46pc.
The LTO Karachi also collected record Rs184.7bn in one day with overall collection of Rs449.05bn in June, registering a growth of 48pc year on year.  The LTO chief commissioner attributed this performance to a committed and professional team.
Income tax collection reached Rs1.798tr in the outgoing fiscal year, up 32pc from Rs1.360tr a year ago.
Sales tax grew by 21pc to Rs1.235tr from Rs1.018tr, while FED rose sharply by 63pc to Rs222.2bn from Rs136.3bn.
The figures do not include taxes collected via port operations, further underscoring Karachi’s economic importance.
 
 

SRB collection
The Sindh Revenue Board collected Rs306.6bn in the fiscal year 2024-25, up from Rs236.8bn in FY24. Despite low inflation and modest economic growth, the provincial tax authority maintained double-digit growth. In June alone, SRB collected Rs40.5bn — its highest-ever monthly total — up 44pc from Rs28.1bn in June FY24 and 3pc higher than May FY25.
SRB Chairman Dr Wasif Ali Memon credited the surge to the dedication of the SRB workforce, political backing from the Sindh government, and cooperation from taxpayers.
He noted that SRB is preparing to meet new challenges in FY26, including the collection of Agricultural Income Tax (AIT) and implementation of a Negative List Tariff regime for sales tax on services, set to begin on July 1, 2025.

The verdict, it seems, was foretold given the composition of the bench, which was formed after the passage of the 26th Amendment that has drastically curtailed the judiciary’s independence.
In what has been described as a clear deviation from the rules, the Bench reversed the earlier full-court decision. The controversial judgement has awarded the reserved seats to the ruling coalition parties beyond their proportional strength in the assemblies. This makes a mockery of whatever was left of the so-called democratic process. Not only has the court’s decision validated a dispensation with a questionable mandate, it has also empowered the government to amend the Constitution at will, with the additional reserved seats giving the ruling coalition a two-third majority in parliament.
It is not only about the allocation of 77 reserved seats for women and minorities in the National Assembly; it is also about seat distribution in the provinces. The reallocation of these seats will help consolidate the hold of the ruling parties in the provinces. In KP, where the ruling PTI will not receive any reserved seats, it will improve these parties’ position. (On Tuesday, the Peshawar High Court stopped oath-taking in the KP Assembly over a petition challenging the reserved seats’ allocation.)
 
 

In fact, some parties in KP will get more reserved seats than their number of elected members in the assembly. For instance, a party with one directly elected member is set to get two reserved seats. It defies all logic. The Supreme Court ruling has further distorted an already flawed political structure, and is likely to facilitate arbitrary rule and political anarchy in the country.
There are speculations that the government will soon move a ‘27th Amendment’ with its newfound absolute majority in the National Assembly. The contours of the proposed constitutional change are not clear yet but there are strong indications that the country is moving towards authoritarianism. A tamed judiciary makes it much easier for the present dispensation to further curb democratic and fundamental rights.

A tamed judiciary makes it easier to further curb democratic and fundamental rights.

We already have hybrid rule in the country, with the establishment dominating the power structure. Now, there is reportedly a move to formalise the current power arrangement, giving the military leadership a constitutional political role. There had been such suggestion in the past as well, but it never materialised because of strong political resistance.
However, with the overarching power of the establishment and a civilian political set-up with questionable legitimacy, there seems to be no effective challenge to any move to establish quasi-military rule under constitutional cover. There are also suggestions to strike down parts of the 18th Amendment and make changes to the NFC award.
It is certainly a sensitive political issue that may spark strong opposition especially in the smaller provinces. A centralised set-up dominated by the security establishment will be disastrous for the unity and stability of the federation. Political stability depends on a strong federation and a truly elected government and not on the coercive powers of the state. We have seen direct military rule in this country several times but they only weakened the state and widened the gap between the provinces and the federating units. A constitutional role for the security establishment in the power structure will increase public alienation from the state.
The roots of the current political instability lie in last year’s rigged elections that brought to power a government with a questionable mandate. Despite the ban denying the PTI its electoral symbol, people came out to vote for it. But the people’s mandate was stolen. The full bench of the Supreme Court that awarded the PTI its share in the reserved seats by a majority vote in July 2024 had also acknowledged its status as a parliamentary party and said that being denied of its electoral symbol had no bearing on its right to participate in elections. The allocation of reserved seats would have made the PTI the largest party in the National Assembly.
But the ruling of the country’s highest court was never implemented by the Election Commis­sion. The government also rejected the ruling. There is little precedent for state institutions and the executive in Pakistan defying the apex cou­rt’s orders.
Dissenting judges, including the then chief justice Qazi Faez Isa, also indicated it was not binding on institutions to implement the ruling. This can be seen as a breach of the rules and violation of judicial ethics. There is hardly any precedent in the country of judges being seen as condoning non-implementation of a court order. Ironically, two of the judges were part of the 10-member constitutional bench that last week reversed the previous full court judgement.
 
 

It was apparent that the establishment and the ruling coalition would have never allowed the PTI to emerge as the single largest party in the House to threaten the dispensation. It was then the government decided to clip the powers of the apex court through the 26th Amendment. It also established a separate Constitutional Bench that would hear the review petition on the reserved seats. The government made sure that the bench was packed with pliant judges. So, that’s how a favourable ruling was managed.
Seemingly the establishment-backed coalition government is now in a comfortable position. The two-third majority it will enjoy has given the government greater room for manoeuvre. The ruling has also come as a huge setback to the PTI, which appears to be in a state of complete disarray, with its main leaders behind bars for the past two years. Yet there is no sign that it is losing its mass support base across the country.
The coercive use of state power cannot silence the voices of resistance. The country is now witnessing creeping authoritarianism facilitated by a pliant judiciary.

• Links counterterrorism to resolving root causes of conflicts
• Dar to chair three key UNSC sessions, including debate on Palestine
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has urged the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) not to remain “a bystander” amid the deepening humanitarian crisis in war-ravaged Gaza, where Israeli military operations continue to claim civilian lives and exact a devastating toll on infrastructure.
“The humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza defies comprehension,” said Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, during a briefing to the 15-member Council on the Middle East situation.
The Israeli military has killed more than 56,500 Palestinians — mostly women and children — since Oct 7, 2023.
The briefing came as Pakistan assumed presidency of the Security Council for July 2025, marking a significant moment in its multilateral diplomacy.
The briefing was held in line with Security Council’s Resol­ution 2334 (2016), which requires the UN Secretary-General to report on its implementation every three months. The resolution demands that Israel cease all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.
However, the discussion also covered the risk of famine in Gaza and a new aid mechanism conducted by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a non-UN entity backed by Israel and the United States.
In sharply worded remarks, the Pakistani envoy said the new aid distribution mechanism is not only contrary to international humanitarian law and human dignity, but it also places starving civilians in direct danger, forcing them to cross active combat zones in search of food and water.
“The result is a grotesque cycle of horror: over 500 people have been killed while trying to access humanitarian aid,” Ambassador Ahmad said. “This is a death trap.”
He added, “The failure to enforce the Council’s own decisions carries grave consequences for global peace and security and undermines the Council’s own authority and credibility.”
At the outset, UN Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East Khaled Khiari warned that the level of suffering and brutality in Gaza was unbearable, calling the continued collective punishment of Palestinians unjustifiable.
‘Deep sense of purpose’
Meanwhile, as Pakistan has assumed the UNSC presidency for the current month, the Foreign Office said in a statement that the country “undertakes this responsibility with a deep sense of purpose, humility and conviction. Our approach will continue to remain anchored in the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respect for international law, and a steadfast commitment to multilateralism”.
As a country that has consistently advocated for dialogue and diplomacy, Pakistan brings to the Security Council an objective, principled, and balanced perspective shaped by its foreign policy, past experience at the Council, and its long-standing contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security, including through UN peacekeeping and peace-building efforts, it said.
The presidency will convene two high-level signature events during this month: an open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”, to be held on July 22; and a briefing on “Cooperation between the United Nations and Regional and Sub-Regional Organisations: The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)”, scheduled for July 24.
Both meetings will be chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who will also preside over the quarterly open debate on the Question of Palestine on 23 July 2025. Mr Dar will also preside over the quarterly open debate on Palestine.
“Pakistan looks forward to working closely with all Council members to promote timely and united action, in line with the Council’s Charter responsibilities and the expectations of the international community,” the Foreign Office said.
Mr Dar said Pakistan takes on this responsibility with humility, conviction, and a profound commitment to the UN Charter.
“Our presidency comes at a time of escalating conflicts and humanitarian crises across the world. We will strive to steer the Security Council towards responsive and effective action grounded in dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful dispute resolution”, he said on a post on X.
In a separate address on the future of the UN’s counterterrorism architecture, Ambassador Ahmad called for addressing the root causes of terrorism — particularly unresolved conflicts, foreign occupation and systemic injustice.
“The UN’s counterterrorism discourse must not only address the response factors but also the underlying and preventive factors,” he said.

The announcement was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Maritime Af­­fairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Tuesday. Senior ministry officials also attended the session.

To launch ferry service connecting Pakistan with GCC countries

“The initiative is part of the government’s strategy to enhance regional connectivity, boost maritime trade and position Gwadar as a major hub in the Arabian Sea,” Mr Chaudhry said. “We aim to transform Gwadar into a strategic transhipment and logistics centre, benefiting Pakistan and the wider region.”
He emphasised that with Gwadar Port now fully ope­rational, it is time to accelerate its integration into international maritime networks. He directed relevant dep­artments to pursue all necessary steps to increase the port’s commercial activity and unlock its full potential.
 
 

He said additional shipping lines will be connected to Gwadar to facilitate greater movement of goods, promote transit trade with Central Asia and the Middle East, and support Pakistan’s growing role in the regional logistics landscape.
“The new routes will reduce pressure on existing ports and ensure faster, more efficient cargo handling,” Mr Chaudhry stated.
In addition to enhancing cargo operations, the maritime ministry has also planned to launch a ferry service from Gwadar to GCC countries. The move is expected to provide an affordable, direct maritime link for passengers and cargo, particularly benefiting expatriate communities and cross-border traders.
“The ferry service will strengthen people-to-people ties, boost tourism and provide a new economic lifeline for Balochistan,” the minister said. “It will create local employment, improve supporting infrastructure and attract private sector participation, especially in the areas of ship services, hospitality and transportation.”

A senior official of ECP said the commission’s meeting remained inconclusive as the law wing was unprepared. He added some applications on this matter filed by PML-N, JUI-F and other individuals were still pending.
The official dispelled reports that the meeting could not reach a decision in the absence of the judgement’s copy.
The ECP received the copy on Saturday, a day after the Constitutional Bench dismissed petitions filed by PTI, declaring the party ineligible for reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies.
He said the Commission would meet again on Wednesday (today)and hoped a decision would be taken on the issue.
In a 7-3 majority ruling, the Constitutional Bench, on Friday, overturned the Supreme Court’s July 12, 2024, judgement in the reserved seats case, effectively taking away reserved seats from the PTI and handing them to their rival parties in the national and provincial legislatures.
The decision overturned the majority judgement by eight judges, which had declared the PTI eligible for reserved seats for women and non-Muslims in the assemblies.
The bench restored the March 25, 2024, order of the Peshawar High Court which had deprived the Sunni Ittehad Council, the party joined by PTI-backed independents after the Feb 8, 2024 polls, of reserved seats.
The Constitutional Bench’s decision effectively meant the PTI was no longer a parliamentary party.
Therefore, the 77 reserved seats of the national and provincial assemblies will be allocated among the parliamentary parties present in the respective assemblies, since they cannot be kept vacant.
In light of the decision, the distribution of 22 reserved seats of NA would be: 15 for PML-N, four for PPP and three for JUI-F, according to legal experts.
After this process, the ruling coalition will ach­ieve a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the mag­ic number required to at­­tain a two-thirds majority is 224.
Disqualification case
Separately, the ECP has adjourned the hearing of disqualification reference against PTI leader Omar Ayub till July 15 after a court order to halt the proceedings.
A three-member bench of the ECP, headed by member from Sindh Nisar Ahmed Durrani, heard the reference on Tuesday.
Mr Khan’s lawyers submitted a stay order against the proceedings issued by the Peshawar High Court.
The ECP member from KP, retired Justice Ikram­ul­lah, noted the high court has not specified a new date in the order. The bench directed the commission’s legal team to seek clarification from the PHC. It emphasised the re­­­ference forwarded by the National Assembly spea­­ker against Mr Khan must be decided within 90 days.
Omar Ayub was also asked to submit a response in the assets declaration case filed over alleged discrepancies in his nomination papers and data provided to the RO.
The NA speaker forwar­ded the disqualification case on the plea filed by ex-MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost to Mr Khan in the 2024 election from Haripur’s NA-18 constituency.

The outage had resulted in a significant shortfall of over 360 million gallons of water during the past four days, exacerbating the city’s existing water crisis.
Though the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) started pumping water from the Dhabeji pumping station after the restoration of electricity, the crisis will persist for at least another day as it takes over 18 hours to fully charge the main pipelines of the distribution network.
According to a KWSC spokesman, the power was restored in the morning and the water supply to the city had resumed as usual. Due to the power outage, the city faced a shortage of 360 million gallons of water, he added.
The power breakdown at the pumping station had occurred on June 26 at 10 pm.

• Industrialists demand end to peak, off-peak charges; decry denial of promised ‘sizeable relief’
• No change in rates for first two slabs of domestic consumers; relief ranges between 3pc and 10pc depending on usage
ISLAMABAD: As the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) decided on Tuesday to reduce the national average power tariff by Rs1.14 per unit, the move was criticised by industrialists and businesspersons from Karachi as being “too minuscule”.
The decision to reduce the tariff was taken at a public hearing presided over by Nepra members Maqsood Anwar and Rafique Shaikh.
The government team, led by the Power Division additional secretary, Mehfooz Bhatti, said the regulator had determined national average tariff — excluding all taxes, surcharges and duties — at Rs34 for FY2025-26, down Rs1.50 per unit from Rs35.50 per unit last year.
After subsidies and cross-subsidies, the government has worked out the tariff to be Rs31.59 per unit, as compared to Rs32.73 per unit last year, a reduction of Re1.14 per unit.
The official said the same rate would apply to K-Electric consumers under the government’s uniform tariff policy.
A formal notification of the new tariffs will be issued within this week. The new rates will take effect from July 1.
Rushed process
Karachi-based representatives of the FPCCI, Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Korangi Association of Trade and Industry and Surjani Town businesses criticised the government and the Nepra for rushing through the approval process and not allowing their requests for time to understand and review the government’s petition.
They said the Power Division filed the petition on June 28. It was approved a day later by the federal cabinet and made public on June 30 for a hearing on July 1.
They said the process violated the law that provided at least seven days after the publication of petition to hold a public hearing.
Peak, off-peak billing
The industrialists criticised the government for a nominal reduction of Rs1.14 per unit in the tariff after promising “sizeable relief”.
“Even after the reduction of Rs1.14 per unit, the effective tariff would be about Rs5 per unit higher than last year when the industry paid on average Rs30 per unit”, said one of the businesspersons.
The government team insisted the effective average tariff during the new fiscal year would be around Rs40.43 against Rs47.89 per unit in FY2025 after taking into account all taxes, surcharges, duties and quarterly adjustments and the removal of PTV fee and electricity duty.
They said the government efforts, coupled with improved exchange rate, helped reduce capacity payments by Rs1.27 per unit on average from 30.88 to Rs29.61 per unit when compared to the outgoing year.
The average transmission and distribution losses of Discos, they claimed, had dropped to 11.03pc from 11.43pc.
Industrial consumers also demanded an end to peak and off-peak rates, enabling the industry to operate round-the-clock instead of shutting down during peak hours due to higher rates.
New tariff
The Rs1.15 per unit reduction in tariff would apply to consumers in almost all categories, except lifeline domestic consumers.
There would be no change in electricity rates for first two lifeline slabs of domestic consumers, as they are already over-subsidised.
The per unit rate for lifeline consumers with up to 50 units per month would remain unchanged at Rs3.95, followed by Rs7.74 for those in 50 to 100 unit monthly consumption. They have to maintain their consumption threshold throughout the year.
For all other consumers and categories, the government sought a flat Rs1.15 per unit reduction for FY2025-26.
However, the relief ranges between 3 to 10pc depending on the users’ respective rates at present.
The protected consumers in 1 to 100 units would now be charged at Rs10.54 per unit, instead of Rs11.69 at present, showing a reduction of 9.8pc.
The subsequent slab in the protected category would be charged at Rs13.01 per unit instead of Rs14.16 per unit, down 8pc.
The non-protected consumers in first 100 units would be charged at Rs23.44 per unit instead of Rs23.59 per unit, down by almost 5pc.
The reduction in rates for all other categories including commercial, industrial, agriculture and bulk consumers would  vary from three to four percent but flat Rs1.15 per unit. The cheapest rate, in these categories, have been provided to the industry whose average rate would now be Rs33.48 per unit instead of Rs44.32 per unit.
Commercial consumers would be provided electricity at an average Rs45.43 per unit instead of Rs46.58 per unit. The average rate of general services would be Rs43.17 per unit instead of Rs44.32 while tariff for bulk consumers would come down to Rs41.76 per unit from Rs42.92 per unit.
However, agricultural consumers would get an even cheaper rate of Rs30.75 per unit instead of Rs31.90. The average rate would work out to be around Rs31.60 per unit from about Rs32.75 per unit at present.

This marks the lowest inflation rate since FY16, when it stood at 2.9pc — a nine-year low. 
Pakistan is currently experiencing disinflation, which reflects a slowdown in the rate of inflation, as opposed to deflation, which indicates a general decline in overall price levels. According to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), average cumulative inflation over the past 53 months has risen by 83pc, significantly affecting retail prices of consumer goods. Despite the recent decline in inflation, the cost of living remains elevated. 
The State Bank of Pakistan has revised its inflation target for FY25 to a range of 5-7pc, down from the government’s initial projection of 12pc. The International Mon­etary Fund has also lowered its inflation forecast for the same period to 9.5pc, compared to its earlier estimate of 12.7pc. For FY26, the government has set an inflation target of 7.5pc. 
The inflation rate in June recorded a growth of 3.2pc, slightly eased from 3.5pc recorded in May. This decline was mainly contributed by a slight decrease in the prices of food items during the month under review. 
The headline inflation, measured by Consumer Price Index (CPI), increased by 0.2pc in June on a month-on-month basis, according to data released by the PBS on Tuesday. 
The annual inflation, however, fell short of the projected targets. Analysts attributed the decline to lower global commodity prices, stable exchange rates, higher base effect and better agricultural outputs. 
Over the past 12 months, the average monthly inflation has shown fluctuations.
The inflation rate in June 2025 was the lowest mainly due to the high base effect from the previous year (June 2024 — 12.6pc).
The CPI inflation dropped to 9.6pc in August 2024, marking the first single-digit figure in over three years, and the downward trend continued in the following months. 
Food inflation for June recorded a positive growth of 4.2pc in urban areas and 2.4pc in rural areas, whereas non-food inflation was 2.2pc in urban areas and 4.7pc in rural areas. 
The food prices rebounded to a positive trend after a decline in four consecutive months.
Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, was recorded at 6.9pc in urban areas and 8.6pc in rural areas in May. 
In urban areas, the food items whose prices saw the month-on-month increase in June included tomatoes (57.33pc), potatoes (25.74pc), onions (15.26pc), eggs (8.82pc), gur (2.75pc), rice (1.67pc), wheat flour (1.53pc), sugar (1.52pc), fresh fruits (1.38pc), milk powder (0.78pc), milk fresh (0.40pc) and milk products (0.35pc).

Republican leaders had struggled to corral support during a record 24-hour “vote-a-rama” amendment session on the Senate floor, as Democrats offered dozens of challenges to the most divisive aspects of the package.
But Senate Majority Leader John Thune was able to turn around wavering moderates to deliver a 50-50 vote, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie.
The sprawling text now heads to the House of Representatives, where it faces unified Democratic opposition and multiple Republicans baulking at the budget-busting costs, as well as slashed health care and food aid programmes for poor Americans.
Trump’s bill proposes a $4.5tr extension of his first-term tax cuts, contentiously offset with $1.2tr in savings mainly targeting the Medicaid health insurance programme, as well as federal food aid.
The health care cuts could see an estimated 12 million low-income and disabled Americans lose coverage.
The package also rolls back billions of dollars in green energy tax credits while providing a $350 billion infusion for border security and Trump’s mass migrant deportation program.
The president made clear that the goal remains to get the bill through the House in the coming days and sign it into law by Friday’s July 4 Independence Day holiday.
“It’s going to get in, it’s going to pass, and we’re going to be very happy,” Trump told reporters ahead of the vote.
‘Utter shame’
Polls show the bill is among the most unpopular ever considered, and Democrats hope to leverage public anger ahead of the 2026 midterm elections when they aim to retake the House.
Backed by extensive independent analysis, they say the bill’s tax cuts would disproportionately benefit the wealthy at the expense of social safety net programs for the poorest Americans.
“Today, Senate Republicans betrayed the American people and covered the Senate in utter shame,” said Chuck Schumer, the leader of the Senate Democratic minority.
“In one fell swoop Republicans passed the biggest tax break for billionaires ever seen — paid for by ripping away health care for millions of people and taking food out of the mouths of hungry kids.”
 

US Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer talks to reporters, Washington, DC, July 1. — AFP

A handful of senators in the Republican majority had threatened to upset the apple cart, voicing concerns that the bill would add more than $3.3tr to the nation’s already yawning budget deficits over a decade.
The most high-profile opposition came in the shape of tech billionaire and estranged former Trump aide Elon Musk, who balked at the bill’s debt implications and stripping of clean energy subsidies.
A furious Trump on Tuesday said he would consider deporting Musk — whose electric car company Tesla gives him extensive interests in green energy — and ending federal funds for his companies.
“Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump posted on social media.
Focus on House
Although the House of Representatives has already passed its own version of the bill, it will have to come back to the lower chamber for a final rubber stamp before it reaches Trump’s desk.
House Republicans were watching anxiously from the sidelines to see if their Senate colleagues would adopt changes that would be hard for Speaker Mike Johnson to sell to his lawmakers.
Fiscal hawks in the lower chamber are furious at what they say is $651bn of extra deficit spending in the Senate’s tweaks.
A House vote could come as early as Wednesday but even with full attendance, House Republicans can only afford to lose three votes.
“The House will work quickly to pass the One Big Beautiful Bill that enacts President Trump’s full America First agenda by the Fourth of July,” Johnson said after the vote.
“The American people gave us a clear mandate, and after four years of Democrat failure, we intend to deliver without delay.”</p><small>2025-07-01 18:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611948-pm-announces-to-fast-track-water-storage-projects-to-counter-indias-evil-designs' target='_blank'><strong>PM orders fast-tracking of water storage projects amid Indian threats</strong></a><br><p>

The world’s richest person was Trump’s biggest political donor in the 2024 election, and became his inseparable ally during his first months back in the White House as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
But the Space X and Tesla boss is now threatening to turn his riches against Trump, mulling a rival political party to challenge Republican lawmakers who vote for the president’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”.
Trump, 79, reacted vengefully today as he headed to the opening of a new migrant detention centre in Florida dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz”.
“We’ll have to take a look,” he told reporters when asked if he would consider deporting Musk, who has held US citizenship since 2002.
 
         View this post on Instagram            

Trump also signalled that he could take aim at the huge contracts and subsidies that Musk’s Space X rocket and Starlink satellite internet businesses receive from the US government.
“We might have to put DOGE on Elon. You know what DOGE is? DOGE is the monster that might have to go back and eat Elon,” Trump said.
Trump added later in Florida: “I don’t think he should be playing that game with me.”
‘Head back home’
In reply to a post on his X social network featuring Trump’s deportation comments, Musk said on Tuesday: “So tempting to escalate this. So, so tempting. But I will refrain for now.”
 






Shares of Tesla sank around five per cent after Trump’s threats.
Trump had made similar comments on Monday, saying Musk was attacking the bill because he was annoyed that it had dropped measures to support the electric vehicles (EV) industry.
“Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa,” Trump said on his Truth Social network.
The tycoon and the president shared a brief but intense bromance after Trump’s return to power in January.
Wearing MAGA baseball hats, Musk was an almost constant presence at Trump’s side. Trump returned the favour by promoting Tesla electric vehicles when protesters targeted them for Musk’s cost-cutting drive at DOGE.
But they had a huge public blow-up in May as Musk criticised the spending bill and then left the government.
‘Don’t bankrupt America’
Musk had kept a low profile in recent weeks but returned to the fray as the bill began its difficult path through Congress.
He has since posted a steady stream of posts against the bill on the X social network that he owns.
The billionaire’s criticisms centre on claims that the bill would increase the US deficit. He also accuses Republicans of abandoning efforts to place the US at the front of the EV and clean energy revolution.
“All I’m asking is that we don’t bankrupt America,” he said on social media today, accusing Republicans of supporting “debt slavery”.
 






More worrying perhaps for Trump is the way that Musk is seeking to target vulnerable Republican lawmakers ahead of the 2026 US midterm elections.
Musk has said he will set up his own political movement called the “America Party” if Trump’s bill passes.
And he has pledged to fund challengers against lawmakers who campaigned on reduced federal spending only to vote for the bill.
“Vox Populi, Vox Dei (the voice of the people is the voice of God) 80pc voted for a new party,” he said after launching a poll on the idea on X.

India in April held the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance following the attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam that killed 26 — an incident New Delhi blamed on Islamabad without evidence.  The treaty allocates the Indus Basin’s six rivers between the two countries: India gets the eastern rivers (Ravi, Beas, Sutlej), while Pakistan receives nearly 80 per cent of the water from the western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, Chenab).
Pakistan termed any attempt to suspend its water share an “act of war”, noting the IWT had no provision for unilateral suspension. It later said it was considering court action, citing a violation of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.  The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) in Hague also ruled India cannot unilaterally suspend or hold the IWT in abeyance.
During a visit to the National Emergencies Operations Centre today, the prime minister referred to the PCA’s order, emphasising that India had no authority to suspend the IWT unilaterally.
“But the enemy has certain evil designs against Pakistan and wants to take steps against the waters treaty. For that, the government has decided that we will build our water storage.”
He said the government would build a “non-controversial water storage capacity” by utilising resources such as the Diamer Bhasha dam and others.
PM Shehbaz said there was a clear clause in the 1991 water accord between the provinces to build on water capacity.
“We will build this capacity with our own resources in the next few years. There is a critical role of the National Disaster Management Authority in this.”
 


The prime minister directed that weather warnings and calamity threats should be regularly issued through phone messages in collaboration with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.
The prime minister recounted the disastrous impacts of the catastrophic floods in 2022. He said that Pakistan was unfortunately among the countries on the world map which could be hit by natural disasters such as cloudbursts, even though it had hardly any contribution to the greenhouse effect.
During the year 2022, Pakistan had suffered more than any country in the world, he noted. More than 1,700 lives were lost, vast stretches of farmland were washed away, homes and infrastructure were damaged, and the national exchequer suffered losses of Rs30 billion, according to government estimates.
The prime minister further said that glacial melting due to heat waves also demanded the highest level of preparedness.
“What happened in Swat in which precious lives were lost, engulfed the entire nation in a pall of gloom,” he said and stressed that the stakeholders in the matter should take an honest review of the incident, directing for a formulation of a comprehensive mechanism in collaboration with the provinces to prevent such occurrences in the future.
The prime minister also ordered a report in this regard.
He opined that in the aftermath of the floods of 2022, the relevant ministers negotiated the grants and public-private partnerships for building resilient infrastructure in the country.
The prime minister appreciated the National Emergencies Operations Centre and expressed hope that the relevant authorities would fully utilise the resilient platform for the progress of the country’s economy and social sectors.
He also assured the government’s complete support in strengthening the institute and its capacity building.
The prime minister hoped that the facility would be connected with the provinces and could convey real-time information with interventions such as an early warning system.
During his visit, he was given a briefing by NDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik over the current monsoon season, the flood situation and the precautionary measures taken in this regard.</p><small>2025-07-01 17:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611940-khawaja-asif-hints-at-ppp-joining-federal-govt' target='_blank'><strong>Khawaja Asif hints at PPP joining federal govt</strong></a><br><p>

The court accepted a petition from 36 senators accusing Paetongtarn of dishonesty and breaching ethical standards, based on a leak of a sensitive telephone call with Cambodia’s influential former leader Hun Sen that was intended to de-escalate a territorial row and tense troop buildup at their border.
The leaked June 15 call triggered domestic fury and has left Paetongtarn’s coalition with a razor-thin majority after a big party abandoned the alliance and accused her of undermining sovereignty, as protest groups threaten more demonstrations to demand a new government.
Paetongtarn’s battles after only 10 months in office underline an intractable power struggle between the billionaire Shinawatra dynasty and an influential establishment backed by the army — a two-decade grudge match that has seen two military coups and court rulings that have toppled multiple parties and prime ministers.
She accepted the court’s decision on Tuesday and apologised over the leaked call, during which she kowtowed before Hun Sen and criticised a Thai army commander, a red line in a country where the military has significant clout.
“My true intention in the leaked conversation, my true intention 100 per cent, was to work for the country to maintain our sovereignty and save the lives of all our soldiers,” Paetongtarn told reporters.
Family crisis
It has been a baptism of fire for political novice Paetongtarn, who at 37 was thrust into the spotlight last year as Thailand’s youngest premier after the Constitutional Court dismissed ally Srettha Thavisin for a violation of ethical standards.
Paetongtarn, the fourth member of her family to hold the top post, has been struggling to revive a stuttering economy and arrest a sharp decline in popularity, with an opinion poll released at the weekend showing her approval rating sinking to 9.2pc in June from 30.9pc in March.
Thai shares.SETI jumped 1.8pc after the midday break on expectations that political uncertainty could lead to further cuts in interest rates by the central bank.
Deputy Prime Minister Suriya Juangroongruangkit takes over as caretaker premier while the court decides the case against Paetongtarn, who has 15 days to respond and will stay in the cabinet as the new culture minister following a reshuffle.
Paetongtarn is not alone in her troubles, with influential tycoon father Thaksin Shinawatra, the driving force behind her government, facing legal hurdles of his own in two different courts this month.
Polarising tycoon Thaksin appeared at his first hearing at Bangkok’s Criminal Court on Tuesday on charges he insulted Thailand’s powerful monarchy, a serious offence punishable by up to 15 years in prison if found guilty. Thaksin denies the allegations and has repeatedly pledged allegiance to the crown.
The case stems from a 2015 media interview Thaksin gave while in self-imposed exile, from which he returned in 2023 after 15 years abroad to serve a prison sentence for conflicts of interest and abuse of power.
Thaksin, 75, dodged jail and spent six months in hospital detention on medical grounds before being released on parole in February last year. The Supreme Court will this month scrutinise that hospital stay and could potentially send him back to jail.</p><small>2025-07-01 17:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611919-jailed-pti-leaders-urge-leadership-to-begin-dialogue-process' target='_blank'><strong>Jailed PTI leaders urge leadership to begin 'dialogue process'</strong></a><br><p>

The upper house of India’s parliament has asked airport operators, air traffic controllers and airlines including Air India and IndiGo INGL.NS to take part in a comprehensive review of passenger safety, according to a memo drafted for the meeting and seen by Reuters.
The gathering comes after the June 12 Air India disaster that killed 260 people, including 241 on board, when a Boeing BA.N 787-8 jet crashed within a minute of take-off from India’s Ahmedabad. Investigators are still probing what caused the world’s worst aviation accident in a decade.
Though the memo did not mention the crash, R K Chaudhary, a lawmaker on the panel, told Reuters that it planned to discuss the matter internally and during the meeting.
 
 

“If we will not raise questions on it, they (airlines) will not become vigilant about these issues,” he said.
The Indian government has said data from the front recorder of the crashed plane was accessed by a team led by India’s Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau, with the US National Transportation Safety Board.
Air India has been getting warning notices for compliance lapses in recent days.
India’s aviation watchdog last month warned the airline over “repeated and serious violations” related to pilot duty scheduling. It has also warned Air India for breaching safety rules after three of its Airbus AIR.PA planes flew despite being overdue checks on escape slides.</p><small>2025-07-01 16:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01205650329412c.jpg?r=205926' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921460/kazakhstan-bans-face-coverings-in-public-places' target='_blank'><strong>Kazakhstan bans face coverings in public places</strong></a><br><p>Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed a law on Monday prohibiting individuals from wearing clothing in public places that covers their faces, joining a trend in several Central Asian countries to restrict forms of Islamic dress.
The text of the law says clothing that “interferes with facial recognition” will be banned in public, with exemptions for medical purposes, in adverse weather conditions and at sporting and cultural events.
The legislation, one in a series of wider amendments signed into law on Monday, does not explicitly mention religion or types of religious dress.
Tokayev has previously praised the legislation as an opportunity to celebrate ethnic identity in Kazakhstan, a majority-Muslim country and former Soviet republic.
“Rather than wearing face-concealing black robes, it’s much better to wear clothes in the national style,” he was quoted by Kazakh media as saying earlier this year.
“Our national clothes vividly emphasise our ethnic identity, so we need to popularise them comprehensively.”
Other Central Asian countries have introduced similar laws in recent years.
Police in Kyrgyzstan have conducted street patrols to enforce their ban on the niqab face veil, according to local media reports. In Uzbekistan, violating the niqab statute carries a fine of over $250. Tajik President Emomali Rakhmon signed a ban on wearing clothing in public that is “alien to national culture”.</p><small>2025-07-01 16:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01203847c201aa9.jpg?r=203856' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921459/barbora-krejcikova-gets-title-defence-off-to-stuttering-start' target='_blank'><strong>Barbora Krejcikova gets title defence off to stuttering start</strong></a><br><p>Defending champion Barbora Krejcikova survived a stiff examination from promising 20-year-old Filipina Alexandra Eala before finding her groove to triumph 3-6 6-2 6-1 on her return to Wimbledon’s Centre Court on Tuesday.
Czech Krejcikova, a shock winner as 31st seed last year and seeded 17th this time, came into the tournament short on form after a succession of injuries and initially had no answer to the confident, free-swinging Eala, who is the first woman from the Philippines to play at Wimbledon.
Eala turned 20 in May and was making her first Wimbledon appearance, but she immediately looked at home in the daunting surroundings of the sport’s most iconic court.
Krejcikova forced the first break in the third game; however, Eala hit straight back, swinging her lefty forehand freely and throwing in a beautifully disguised drop shot.
She then upped the ante, holding confidently and breaking again as her two-fisted backhand came to the fore and, from 2-1 down with a break against, Eala reeled off four games in a row.
Krejcikova struggled to find any consistency and was not helped by five first-set double faults and very cautious shot choices.
The champion just about held serve after six deuces, but Eala was not to be denied and served out to take the first set.
Krejcikova looked as if she had had a physical and mental reboot for the second set, where she showed much more energy and found her serving range.
Lightweight serve
With Eala also starting to lose her radar and with her lightweight serve being punished, the champion swept to a 5-0 lead and took the set 6-2.
Krejcikova grabbed an early break in the third with pounding returns, and though Eala had an immediate breakback opportunity, she could not take it and quickly trailed 3-0.
It was relatively straightforward from then, as a tired-looking Eala’s error count rose and Krejcikova raced home in ever-more confident style.
Krejcikova was quick to credit her opponent.
“I mean, what the hell she played in the first set?” she said. “She was smashing the ball and cleaning the lines, so wow, wow. She’s going to be really good in a couple of years.”
Krejcikova said she was “super happy” to even be back to defend her title after a back injury ruled her out of the Australian Open and a thigh problem curtailed her grasscourt build-up.
“Definitely six months ago, I was in a lot of pain with my back, and I didn’t really know how my career was going to go,” she said.
“So I’m super-excited that I can be here and that I can play and that I can play on such a great court.” She said she also took time before the match to inspect the trophy, with her name engraved from last year.
“I was definitely enjoying the moment,” she said. “Having that opportunity, that I can see my name there and that I can see the trophy and that I can just enter such a beautiful court, such a beautiful venue - it’s super, super special.”</p><small>2025-07-01 15:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/011955178f564fa.jpg?r=195555' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921457/saudis-al-hilal-knock-man-city-out-of-club-world-cup-in-huge-shock' target='_blank'><strong>Saudi’s Al Hilal knock Man City out of Club World Cup in huge shock</strong></a><br><p>Saudi Arabian side Al Hilal sent English giants Manchester City crashing out of the Club World Cup on Monday, snatching a shock 4-3 victory in extra time in the biggest upset of the tournament so far.
The match finished 2-2 at full-time but at the end of an eventful extra-time Marcos Leonardo grabbed the winner and pulled off one of the greatest wins in Middle Eastern football history.
The Saudi club advances to the quarter-finals where they will face Brazilian club Fluminense, ensuring a non-European team will reach the last four.
City had taken the lead in the ninth minute in controversial fashion, Bernardo Silva finishing after Rayan Ait-Nouri’s cross.
Al Hilal players protested that Ait-Nouri had controlled with his arm in the build-up but the goal stood.
City had plenty of opportunities to extend their lead before the break but a combination of poor finishing and inspired goalkeeping from Moroccan goalkeeper Yassine Bounou kept the lead at a single goal.
Al Hilal offered several reminders of their threat on the break but City even more chances with Jeremy Doku volleying straight at Bounou, who moments later reacted superbly again to keep out a Bernardo effort.
City punished
The question as to whether City would live to regret not converting those chances was answered within a minute of the resumption.
Former City full-back Joao Cancelo’s low cross was parried out by Ederson, Malcolm pounced but saw his shot blocked by Ruben Dias only for the ball to loop to Marcos Leonardo to head home the equaliser.
Six minutes later and the City’s high defensive line was exposed by a long ball from Cancelo, which Brazilian Malcolm raced on to and he showed power and pace as he broke away before coolly slotting past Ederson.
The Saudi fans in the crowd went wild while Pep Guardiola responded immediately with a triple substitution with midfielder Rodri and defenders Nathan Ake and Manuel Akanji introduced.
That brought some much needed stability to a shaky back line but City needed improvement at the other end too and it came, albeit in its scruffy circumstances.
The Al Hilal defence were unable to deal with a Bernardo corner and Erling Haaland pounced to steer home the lose ball and make it 2-2.
City piled on the pressure as they looked for the winner but yet again Bounou proved their nemesis as he denied Akanji and Ruben Dias and even when he was beaten by Haaland, substitute Ali Lajami produced a magnificent goal-line clearance.
Guardiola took off Haaland and introduced Egyptian forward Omar Marmoush as the game went into extra-time.
But for all City’s depth, Al Hilal had a deep well of spirit to draw upon and just four minutes into the opening period, Al Hilal regained the lead when Kalidou Koulibaly rose superbly to meet a Ruben Neves corner with a brilliantly angled header.
City responded with a goal of real quality when Rayan Cherki’s brilliantly floated ball towards the back post was poked home masterfully by Phil Foden, at full stretch and from the tightest of angles.
But incredibly Al Hilal responded again to restore their lead — Sergej Milinkovic-Savic’s header was saved by Ederson but Marcos Leonardo followed in to bundle the ball over the line.
As the celebrating Al Hilal fans poured out of the stadium, the Brazilian striker let his emotions pour out.
“I’ve had a difficult time in the last two months. My mother spent 70 days in the ICU,” he said.
“Today she’s fine, thank God. When I scored those two goals, I thought of her. She was able to watch the match”.
City skipper Bernardo Silva said his team had paid the price for being unable to deal with Al Hilal’s counter-attacking.
“We scored three and could’ve scored five, six. It was all about controlling when we lost the ball, controlling the transitions, don’t let them run, and they ran way too many times,” he said.
“With one, two passes there was always a feeling of danger coming from them. When we allow teams to run like this we always suffer a lot, and today was the case,” he said.
Inter Milan knocked out by Fluminense
Elsewhere, Inter Milan were eliminated by Fluminense on a day of shock results.
Champions League runners-up Inter were dumped out 2-0 by the Brazilian side in Charlotte.
German Cano headed home early on to give Fluminense the lead against Inter Milan and the Brazilian side survived an onslaught from the Serie A team to progress.
Substitute Hercules netted late on to seal their win, while a frustrated Inter hit the woodwork twice through Lautaro Martinez and Federico Dimarco.
The Rio de Janeiro outfit become the second Brazilian side to make the last eight after Palmeiras had already sealed their quarter-final spot.
“We knew they were not going to be easy opponents. Less than a month ago they were playing the Champions League final, but we played really well,” said 40-year-old ‘Flu’ captain Thiago Silva, once of Paris Saint-Germain and Chelsea.
It is the latest victory for a Brazilian team against prestigious European opposition at the tournament in the United States, after Botafogo defeated PSG and Flamengo got the better of Chelsea in the group stage.
“This is a very important victory for our fans, for all of Brazil, for my country, for South America,” said Jhon Arias, the lively Colombian winger who was named man of the match.
Inter, who were thrashed 5-0 by PSG in the Champions League final, appointed Cristian Chivu to replace the departing Inzaghi ahead of the tournament.
They did not fully convince during the group stage despite topping their section and a furious Martinez criticised some of his teammates after the game.
“I want to fight for the major trophies, [so] anyone who wants to stay at Inter, fine, let’s fight, but anyone who doesn’t want to stay can leave,” said Inter’s captain.
“We need players who want to be here. We’re wearing an important shirt … we need a top-level mentality, or please leave.”</p><small>2025-07-01 14:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611913-pakistans-sweetest-gift-wins-global-hearts-in-abu-dhabi' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's sweetest gift wins global hearts in Abu Dhabi</strong></a><br><p>

The monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.
These attacks injured 189 people, comprising 126 security personnel and 63 civilians — marking an 8 per cent decrease in attacks, a 12pc drop in fatalities, and pc increase in injuries compared to May 2025.
“In response to militant activities, Pakistani security forces intensified counterterrorism operations during the month,” the statement added.
According to Picss, security forces killed 71 militants, while two security personnel and two civilians also lost their lives in operations launched by the state. Additionally, ten militants and five civilians were injured, and 52 suspected militants were arrested during these operations.
The combined death toll from militant violence and security operations in June stood at 175 deaths, including 55 security personnel, 77 militants, 41 civilians, and two peace committee members.
The report noted that over the first half of 2025, Pakistan “experienced a worrying uptick in violence”.
Between January and June, Picss documented 502 militant attacks, which claimed 737 lives — including 284 security personnel, 267 civilians, 180 militants, and six peace committee members — and caused 991 injuries, affecting 492 security personnel, 472 civilians, 26 militants, and one peace committee member.
Compared to the first half of 2024, this represented a 5pc increase in militant attacks, a 121pc surge in fatalities, and an 84pc rise in injuries, it said.
The trend is even more alarming when compared to the last six months of 2024, showing a 17pc increase in attacks, 33pc increase in deaths, and 30pc increase in injuries.
The report noted that during counter-militancy operations conducted in the first six months of 2025, 688 militants were killed and 225 arrested, reflecting the state’s intensified efforts to curb militancy.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01184547d94373a.jpg?r=184706' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921423/jcp-nominates-chief-justices-of-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>JCP nominates chief justices of high courts</strong></a><br><p>The Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) on Tuesday appointed the chief justices to the four high courts, a statement issued by the Supreme Court said.
Per the statement, the JCP held four consecutive meetings to make a decision related to the appointments and, by a majority of its total membership in each meeting, opted to allow the acting chief justices to continue serving the top roles.
Letters were subsequently issued to the prime minister’s principal secretary, informing the government about the nominations and requesting the forwarding of the same to the president for their appointment.
The letters said that Justice Sarfraz Dogar was nominated as the new chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC), Justice Rozi Khan Barrech as the chief justice for the Balochistan High Court (BHC), Justice Syed Muhammad Attique Shah for the Peshawar High Court, and Justice Junaid Ghaffar for the Sindh High Court (SHC).
Pre­sident Asif Ali Zardari on Saturday had already formally decla­red Justice Dogar the “senior-most judge” of the IHC, following the issuance of a revised seniority list by the Ministry of Law and Justice.
The development followed a ruling by the Supreme Court on June 19, upholding the constitutionality of transferring three judges from other provincial high courts and referring the matter of seniority determination to the president.
On Friday, five IHC judges had challenged the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the transfer of three judges — Justice Dogar from the LHC, Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro from the SHC, and Justice Muhammad Asif from the BHC.
President Zardari had also declared that the status of the transfer of all three judges would be permanent.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/0117095040894e3.jpg?r=174101' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921444/pakistan-calls-for-internal-reform-of-uns-counterterrorism-architecture' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan calls for internal reform of UN’s counterterrorism architecture</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan has called for the internal reform of the UN’s counterterrorism architecture with a balanced and rights-based global framework.
The country was appointed as the vice chair of the UN Security Council’s (UNSC) Counter-Terrorism Committee on June 4. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said the appointment reaffirmed the international community’s trust in the country’s counterterrorism credentials.
A press release issued today by the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the UN said that speaking at the UN headquarters a day earlier, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad said that the counterterrorism architecture should be capable of addressing Prolonged conflicts, while eliminating injustice, oppression and violations of international law under the pretext of counterterrorism, and ending conditions conducive to terrorism.
“We must also clearly distinguish between terrorism and the legitimate struggle against foreign occupation and the right to self-determination,” he was quoted as saying.
“The UNOCT must also integrate respect for human rights and [the] rule of law to prevent abuse of counterterrorism actions by member states. The more we shy away from addressing these issues, the more prolonged our counterterrorism efforts will be.”
He further said that successful counterterrorism action requires concerted efforts, which were present in the framework of international law.
“He urged the international community to combat all forms of terrorism and take collective action without double standards or discrimination, prevent its exploitation for politically motivated agendas and shift public opinion away from the real challenges that we face today,” the press release read.
 






Ambassador Asim also called for adequate changes to the sanctions regimes to incorporate new and emerging threats and an end to the stigmatisation of Islam and Muslims, it added.
“While noting a surge in the emergence of right-wing, extremist and fascist movements in several countries, which are leading to terrorist violence, he (Asim) said that we see a strong inclination to see non-Muslim acts of terrorism as just violent crime,” it said.
Pakistan’s UN envoy highlighted that counterterrorism remained “one of the most important pillars to address threats to international peace and security”, saying that Pakistan has remained a principal victim of terrorism, with more than 80,000 lives lost and billions of dollars of losses to its economy in the war on terrorism.
He said that terrorism transcends boundaries and its evolution into new and emerging forms was being facilitated by modern ICTs in an increasingly globalised world, stressing the need for “effective and meaningful” counterterrorism efforts based on “consensually agreed-upon principles driven primarily by member states”.
“Ambassador Asim expressed Pakistan’s concern with the entry of norms, soft laws and ‘non-binding guiding principles’ into the global counterterrorism discourse by either the Security Council through its 1373 CTC and/or expert reports, which do not enjoy consensus of the wider membership,” the press release added.
 
 

He proposed the establishment of a “subsidiary body as an intergovernmental framework” under the General Assembly to oversee its universal consideration.
The UN Ambassador said that integrating the work of global compact entities such as Interpol and UN agencies with national law enforcement agencies can significantly enhance information and intelligence sharing relating to the movement of terrorists and terror financing.
“We must merge some of the UN entities or restrict their mandates to streamline UNOCT’s work. There are far too many agencies doing similar work, leading to duplication, including capacity building initiatives,” he was quoted as saying.
The UNSC Counter-Terrorism Committee was established by UNSC resolution 1373 (2001), adopted unanimously on September 28, 2001, after the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States.
The committee, comprising all 15 UNSC members, is tasked with monitoring implementation of the above resolution, which requested countries to implement several measures intended to enhance their legal and institutional ability to counter terrorist activities at home, in their regions and around the world.
Pakistan was also appointed head of the UNSC committee established pursuant to resolution 1988 (2011), which oversees the implementation of the sanctions measures on the Afghan Taliban.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01184451b6318de.png?r=184507' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921451/pakistani-bowler-sadia-iqbal-once-again-takes-top-spot-in-womens-t20i-rankings' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani bowler Sadia Iqbal once again takes top spot in Women’s T20I rankings</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan women’s left-arm spinner Sadia Iqbal took the top spot in the International Cricket Council Women’s Twenty-20 International (T20I) Bowler Rankings once again, cricket’s governing body announced on Tuesday.

Today’s announcement follows her ranking in May, where she also reclaimed the top position in ICC Women’s T20I Bowler Rankings.

The Punjab government had ordered a crackdown on hateful content on social media alongside stringent security measures, such as army deployment, as the country gears up to observe Ashura (Muharram 10) on July 6.
“All suspects were arrested following the registration of three FIRs (first information reports),” Sahiwal District Police Officer (DPO) Rana Tahir said, referring to the three men booked in the past two days.
“The police are maintaining zero tolerance to such incidents,” DPO Tahir asserted.
 
 

“Our message to the youth is clear: they must exercise caution while using social media, especially in ways that could hurt sectarian beliefs or sacred symbols.”
The police officer stressed the urgent need to educate young people about the responsible use of social media platforms.
The arrests were made under sections 295-A (deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) and 298-A (use of derogatory remarks, etc, in respect of holy personages) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC), as well as section 11 (hate speech) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016.
The three complaints, two of which were filed on June 29 and one on June 30, detailed the content of social media posts in which remarks “inciting sectarian hatred” against the Shia community were made.
A FIR  filed at the City Sahiwal police station by Sub-Inspector (SI) Mohammad Azhar mentioned two Facebook posts shared by an account.
 
 

A second FIR filed at City Chichawatni Station on SI Mohammad Jaffar’s complaint mentioned a video posted on a Facebook page shared by a user.
The third FIR registered at the Ghala Mandi Station by SI Aakash Rohail was based on a WhatsApp status, a screenshot of which was printed and kept in police custody.
Days ago, Sahiwal’s Okanwala Bangla police booked two individuals in separate cases for allegedly spreading sectarian hatred and sharing blasphemous content on social media under sections 295-A and 298-C (person of Ahmadi community calling himself a Muslim or propagating his faith) of the PPC and section 11 of Peca.</p><small>2025-07-01 14:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01164423c4c4c78.jpg?r=164447' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921440/over-14-million-people-could-die-from-us-foreign-aid-cuts-study' target='_blank'><strong>Over 14 million people could die from US foreign aid cuts: study</strong></a><br><p>More than 14 million of the world’s most vulnerable people, a third of them small children, could die by 2030 because of the Trump administration’s dismantling of US foreign aid, research projected on Tuesday.
The study in the prestigious Lancet journal was published as world and business leaders gather for a United Nations conference in Spain this week, hoping to bolster the reeling aid sector.
The US Agency for International Development (USAID) had provided over 40 per cent of global humanitarian funding until US President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January.
Two weeks later, Trump’s then-close advisor — and the world’s richest man — Elon Musk boasted of having put the agency “through the woodchipper”.
The funding cuts “risk abruptly halting — and even reversing — two decades of progress in health among vulnerable populations”, warned study co-author Davide Rasella, a researcher at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health (ISGlobal).
 
 

“For many low- and middle-income countries, the resulting shock would be comparable in scale to a global pandemic or a major armed conflict,” he said in a statement.
Looking back over data from 133 nations, the international team of researchers estimated that USAID funding had prevented 91.8m deaths in developing countries between 2001 and 2021.
That is more than the estimated number of deaths during World War II, history’s deadliest conflict.
HIV, malaria to rise
The researchers also used modelling to project how funding being slashed by 83pc — the figure announced by the US government earlier this year — could affect death rates.
The cuts could lead to more than 14m avoidable deaths by 2030, the projections found.
That number included over 4.5m children under the age of five — or around 700,000 child deaths a year.
For comparison, around 10m soldiers are estimated to have been killed during World War I.
Programmes supported by USAID were linked to a 15pc decrease in deaths from all causes, the researchers determined. For children under five, the drop in deaths was twice as steep, at 32pc.
 
 

USAID funding was found to be particularly effective at staving off preventable deaths from disease.
There were 65pc fewer deaths from HIV/AIDS in countries receiving a high level of support compared to those with little or no USAID funding, the study found.
Deaths from malaria and neglected tropical diseases were similarly cut in half.
Study co-author Francisco Saute of Mozambique’s Manhica Health Research Centre said he had seen on the ground how USAID helped fight diseases such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis.
“Cutting this funding now not only puts lives at risk — it also undermines critical infrastructure that has taken decades to build,” he stressed.
A recently updated tracker run by disease modeller Brooke Nichols at Boston University estimates that nearly 108,000 adults and more than 224,000 children have already died as a result of the US aid cuts.
That works out to 88 deaths every hour, according to the tracker.
‘Time to scale up’
After USAID was gutted, several other major donors, including France, Germany and the UK, followed suit in announcing plans to slash their foreign aid budgets.
These aid reductions, particularly in the European Union, could lead to “even more additional deaths in the coming years”, study co-author Caterina Monti of ISGlobal said.
But the grim projections are based on the current amount of pledged aid, so they could rapidly come down if the situation changes, the researchers emphasised.
 
 

Dozens of world leaders are meeting in the Spanish city of Seville this week for the biggest aid conference in a decade.
The United States, however, will not attend.
“Now is the time to scale up, not scale back,” Rasella said. Before its funding was slashed, USAID represented 0.3pc of all US federal spending.
“US citizens contribute about 17 cents per day to USAID, around $64 per year,” said study co-author James Macinko of the University of California, Los Angeles.
“I think most people would support continued USAID funding if they knew just how effective such a small contribution can be to saving millions of lives.”</p><small>2025-07-01 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611890-jcp-approves-new-chief-justices-for-high-courts' target='_blank'><strong>JCP names new chief justices for high courts</strong></a><br><p>

Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently intensified their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a key perpetrator of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.
“Two terrorists were killed while another three were injured in an intense fire exchange between the security forces and the terrorists,” Balochistan spokesperson Shahid Rind said in a statement.
 






“Fitna al Hindustan attacked the tehsil office, government offices and a bank. A 16-year-old boy died while seven individuals were injured by the terrorists’ firing,” the statement read.
The term “Fitna al Hindu­stan” is a new phrase coined by Pakistan’s military, aimed at framing India’s alleged role in terrorism as a deliberate destabilisation strategy, potentially to galvanise domestic support.
“The Frontier Constabulary, Counter-Terrorism Department and Levies immediately cordoned off the area, crushing the terrorists,” Rind asserted. An intense fire exchange occurred after the security forces “encircled” the terrorists, he added.
Mastung Deputy Commissioner Athar Abbas Raja also confirmed the attack to Dawn.com, adding, “Heavy firing and blasts [were] heard in the small town at around 11am.”
 
 

Action against the perpetrators was ongoing while an “organised” clearance operation was also underway at the site of the incident, according to the government statement.
It added that search efforts to trace the facilitators of the attackers had also been initiated. The operation to “protect citizens and arrest terrorists” was based on intelligence input, Rind said.
“The immediate response by the security forces was effective in preventing further loss of lives,” the government official highlighted.
Uptick in terrorism
Militant groups were unable to significantly escalate their activities in the country last month, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies, which recorded 85 attacks in May compared to 81 in April.
In one of the recent major attacks, a school bus in Balochistan’s Khuzdar was targeted on May 21, leaving eight children among 10 dead.
In April, three policemen were martyred and at least 16 others were injured as a blast targeted a vehicle of the Balochistan Constabulary on Mastung’s Dasht Road.
Last month, security forces killed two “Indian sponsored terrorists” in Balochistan’s Duki district and another two in Kachhi.
 
 

On June 18, a man and a woman were shot dead when unknown gunmen opened fire at them in the Surgaz area, a locality on the outskirts of Mastung town. Another woman and a child sitting in the car were injured in the firing.
Pakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
The country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.

On a month-on-month basis, prices increased 0.2pc in June, reversing a 0.2pc decline in May.
The data comes after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept its key interest rate unchanged at 11pc in June.
The SBP said in its latest monetary policy statement that inflation was expected to show some near-term volatility but gradually stabilise within the 5-7pc target range.
The figures also come weeks after the unveiling of the annual budget, which included new revenue measures and subsidy cuts as part of efforts to secure a long-term loan programme from the International Monetary Fund.
Analysts have warned that higher energy and tax costs could stoke inflation in the second half of the year.
The stock exchange rose 2.3pc to close at an all-time high of 128,475.7 points today, the first day of the new fiscal year.</p><small>2025-07-01 12:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/01134528ebc088b.jpg?r=134925' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1921417/govt-to-deploy-fc-troops-at-fazls-residence-in-di-khan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt to deploy FC troops at Fazl’s residence in DI Khan</strong></a><br><p>The federal government has decided to deploy Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel outside the residence of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan city due to security concerns, it emerged on Tuesday.
In a letter dated June 29 to the FC commandant in Peshawar, the interior ministry issued orders to deploy “one platoon” of FC personnel at the residence of the JUI-F chief “to avoid any untoward situation”.
The decision has been taken on the prime minister’s directives for security purposes and recent incidents involving the JUI-F’s chief son, Asjad Mahmood.
Earlier last month, Mahmood’s vehicle was intercepted on the main highway by armed men when he was on his way from DI Khan to Lakki Marwat.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently visited Fazl’s residence in Islamabad and expressed concern over the alleged attack and attempted kidnapping of the JUI-F chief’s son, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
The prime minister expressed deep concern over the assault and foiled kidnapping attempt on Mahmood and inquired about his health, according to a statement from the PM’s Media Office.
PM Shehbaz issued immediate directives to arrest those involved in the attack and ensure swift legal action.
JUI-F leaders have come under attack in recent years in Balochistan and KP. On May 15, a powerful explosion targeted the vehicle of local JUI-F leader Maulana Noorullah near a seminary in South Waziristan.
Police said the bomb attack was carried out to target Maulana Noorullah, who remained unharmed. The JU-F leader was accompanied by local party leaders Maulana Ishaq and Maulana Amanullah when the blast occurred.
On April 25, a local leader of the JUI-F and two women were killed and five others were injured in a roadside explosion near the Kalat district.
The incident occurred in the Kapootu area when a pickup vehicle carrying eight people was hit by an improvised explosive device planted on the roadside near Killi Kapootu, according to Levies officials.
The vehicle was coming from Kalat when the blast took place. The pickup was driven by JUI-F local leader and union council member Maulana Abdullah Nachari.
On March 14, a bomb exploded at a mosque in South Waziristan district during Friday prayers, injuring JUI district chief Abdullah Nadeem and three others. Nadeem was seriously wounded, while three others, also belonging to the JUI, sustained minor injuries.
In another incident on March 2, two leaders of JUI-F Balochistan were killed in Zehri area of Khuzdar district.</p><small>2025-07-01 11:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/611868-pakistan-india-exchange-lists-of-prisoners' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, India share lists of prisoners in biannual exchange</strong></a><br><p>
