Zia, the first woman to serve as prime minister in the South Asian nation of 170 million people, died on Tuesday aged 80.
Flags were flown at half-mast, and thousands of security officers lined the streets as her body was carried through the streets of the capital Dhaka in a vehicle in the colours of the national flag.
Retired government official Minhaz Uddin, 70, said he had never voted for her, but came to honour the three-time prime minister.
“I came here with my grandson, just to say goodbye to a veteran politician whose contributions will always be remembered,” he said, watching from behind a barbed wire barricade as her body passed by.
“Khaleda Zia has been an inspiration,” mourner Sharmina Siraj told AFP, adding that “it is difficult to imagine women in leadership positions anytime soon”.
The 40-year-old mother of two said stipends introduced by Zia to support girls’ education “had a huge impact on the lives of our girls”.
‘Legacy lives on’
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia had vowed to campaign in elections set for 12 February — the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.
Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is widely seen as a frontrunner, and her son Tarique Rahman, 60, who returned only last week after 17 years in exile, is seen as a potential prime minister if they win a majority.
“She is no more, but her legacy lives on — and so does the BNP,” said Jenny Parvez, 37, who travelled for several hours with her family to watch the funeral cortege pass her on the street.
The interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, declared three days of national mourning and an elaborate state funeral.
Large crowds gathered outside parliament — many waving national or BNP flags — where her coffin is expected around 2:00pm (0800 GMT), and when prayers will begin.
Yunus said Bangladesh had “lost a great guardian”.
Zia’s body will be interred alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981 during his time as president.
Ayaz Sadiq meets family, expresses condolences
Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who is in Bangladesh for the funeral, visited the residence of the former Bangladeshi prime minister, where he met her son and daughter.
According to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat, in the interaction, Sadiq expressed condolences at the passing of their mother.
“In this hour of grief and sorrow, the government and the people of Pakistan stand with you,” he was quoted as saying.
The family of the late premier thanked Sadiq for his condolences.
The NA speaker also met the National Security Advisor of Bangladesh, Khalilur Rehman, the statement said.
It said that Sadiq “conveyed a message of sympathy and condolences on behalf of the [resident and prime minister of Pakistan”.
The speaker also met the Adviser for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs of Bangladesh, Asif Nazrul, where the two discussed matters of mutual interest







Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said on Tuesday that National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq will represent Pakistan at Zia’s funeral.







‘Unbreakable’
Tarique Rahman said in a statement that “the country mourns the loss of a guiding presence that shaped its democratic aspirations”.
His mother, he added, “endured repeated arrests, denial of medical care, and relentless persecution”, but that “her resilience … was unbreakable.”
Suffering from a raft of health issues, Zia was rushed to hospital in late November, where her condition had gradually deteriorated despite treatment.
Nevertheless, hours before her death, party workers had on Monday submitted nomination papers on her behalf for three constituencies for next year’s polls.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Zia’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.
Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar is due to attend the funeral, New Delhi said, the most senior visit by an Indian official since the overthrow of Hasina.
Senior officials from Pakistan are also expected to attend.</p><small>2025-12-31 08:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31123205e8ea303.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964276/double-decker-buses-introduced-in-karachi-to-be-available-to-the-public-from-tomorrow' target='_blank'><strong>Double-decker buses introduced in Karachi, to be available to the public from tomorrow</strong></a><br><p>Double-decker buses were introduced in Karachi on Wednesday, with Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon saying that they would be available to the public from January 1 (Thursday).
“Today marks the beginning of double-decker bus [services] in the city. They will be available to the public from tomorrow, and today, they will be tested [on the city’s road],” Memon, who also has the transport portfolio, said while speaking to the media at the inauguration of the bus service in Karachi.
Memon inaugurated the bus service along with Sindh Local Government Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah.

The development comes more than a year after the Sindh government announced the initiative in October 2024 for the city of over 23 million that has faced mobility issues for long.
Memon recalled that the Sindh government had promised to introduce double-decker buses in Karachi by December 2025, pointing out that today was December 31.
He further said the Sindh government aimed to provide transport facilities across the province in 2026, adding that Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah had also instructed to introduce “double-decker buses on every road in Karachi” in the coming year.
Yesterday, while announcing the launch of double-decker buses in the city, Memon said the buses would operate from Malir to Sharea Faisal. He had added that more double-decker buses would be brought to Karachi as these would help solve traffic problems.
His spokesperson, Hussain Mansoor, separately told Dawn that the buses would run between Zainab Market in Saddar and Model Colony.
Meanwhile, a handout issued by Memon’s office said the double-decker bus service was “being introduced again for Karachiites after 65 years”.
Speaking to the media on Wednesday, he said new routes for electronic buses would also be designated in Sindh, including Karachi, from next week, the minister said.
Acknowledging that public transport was a necessity, he expressed the Sindh government’s intention to facilitate the public in this regard. Without specifically mentioning any of the bus services launched by the government, he said these transport facilities were being provided at a subsidised rate.







“The Sindh government pays that subsidy to facilitate passengers,” the minister said, further claiming that over 125,000 commuters were using transport services being provided under the People’s Bus Service project in Karachi daily.
In response to a question about criticism of the poor condition of roads, Memon said the Sindh cabinet had allocated more than Rs9 billion out of the budget just for roads in industrial areas to address complaints. He said work on several other projects was also under way, particularly mentioning the Shahrah-i-Bhutto Expressway in Karachi.







When asked whether double-decker buses’ routes would also cover tourist spots in Sindh to present a “positive image” of the province, the minister replied, “Yes, definitely. We aim to cover not just tourist spots but every road.”
‘A gift from CM’
A handout from the Sindh CM’s office termed double-decker buses “a gift” from the provincial chief executive.
The statement quoted CM Murad as saying that Karachiites had the right to better transport facilities and that the new bus service would make commuting easier for them.







“The city is now not just running, it’s progressing. Today, a bus has started running, and tomorrow, the city will transform.
“Better transport facilities for Karachi is not a mere promise, it is now becoming a reality,” the CM was quoted as saying.
He further said that better facilities strengthen cities, expressing the ambition to make Karachi join the ranks of modern cities.

On Tuesday, it emerged that a case was registered against more than a dozen lawyers after Butt was physically assaulted during a court appearance in Karachi on Monday. The FIR nominated Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah Chandio and “another 15-20 lawyers”.
Subsequently, lawyers stormed the City Courts police station demanding a case against the YouTuber and others. They also staged a protest on M.A. Jinnah Road outside the City Courts against the SHO of the City Courts police station for allegedly failing to register their FIR.
The fresh FIR, a copy of which is available with Dawn and which emerged on Wednesday, was registered on the complaint of City Court SHO Jahangir Bhutto.
The FIR was registered under sections 337-A (punishment of shajjah), Section 504 (intentional insult), 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 147 (punishment for rioting), and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of their duty) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
The complainant said that on December 30 (Tuesday), he received a call while out patrolling that “around 40-50 lawyers“ led by Abdul Fatah Chandio, Advocate Abdul Wahab Rajper, and Advocate Riaz Ali Solangi had forced their way into the Risala police station, which had been temporarily set up at the City Courts police station.
He alleged that they were creating a ruckus and demanding that a FIR be registered against Butt and his lawyer.
“When I reached the police station around 2pm, the lawyers demanded to know why I had allowed a FIR to be registered against them,“ Bhutto said.
“They asked me to register a FIR against Butt and his lawyer,” he added.
“I tried to make them understand that a case had already been registered [..] upon hearing this, they started verbally abusing me and then proceeded to kick and punch me,“ he recalled.
He said that the lawyers left after the police staff came to his rescue. “However, they started chanting slogans and gave me death threats as they marched out of the station,” he said.
The FIR nominated three people — Chandio, Rajper, and Solangi, along with 40-50 others, who were unnamed.
It should be mentioned that Solangi was named in the case registered on the complaint of Butt’s lawyer. He is also the complainant in the case registered against Butt for allegedly hurting religious sentiments, for which the YouTuber had appeared in court on Monday.
Bhutto said that the accused had “stopped me from performing my duty, gave me death threats, assaulted me and verbally abused me“.
Butt’s lawyer, Mian Ali Ashfaq, had registered a case against Solangi, Advocate Abdul Fatah and “another 15-20 lawyers” under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 337-A (Punishment of shajjah) of the PPC.
Ashfaq stated in the FIR that his client had arrived at City Courts at 9am to seek bail, but when he reached the inner premises near the West building, lawyers Solangi and Fatah, along with 15-20 other lawyers, attacked and started beating the YouTuber, causing him injuries. “The attackers assaulted me as well and other lawyers from my office,” he added.
He alleged that during the attack, Butt was holding a bag containing Rs300,000, which was snatched from him. He said that Solangi later returned the bag, but the cash was missing.
Advocate Solangi told Dawn on Monday that after obtaining pre-arrest bail on December 20, the YouTuber had uploaded a vlog in which he allegedly used inappropriate language against lawyers in Karachi as well as against him. He claimed Butt was later taken to the Karachi Bar Association committee room after the scuffle, where the YouTuber apologised to the lawyers.</p><small>2025-12-31 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3112584021ffa68.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964277/sincaraz-set-to-dominate-as-2026-tennis-season-kicks-off' target='_blank'><strong>‘Sincaraz’ set to dominate as 2026 tennis season kicks off</strong></a><br><p>Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner are set for more world domination in 2026, starting at the Australian Open, while Aryna Sabalenka is bubbling with confidence as she chases further Grand Slam success.
The new season gets under way on Friday with the mixed-teams United Cup in Perth and Sydney, headlined by women’s world number two Iga Swiatek and men’s world number three Alexander Zverev.
Top-ranked Sabalenka, who is pursuing a third Melbourne Park trophy, starts at the Brisbane International from January 4-11 in a stellar field also boasting Australian Open champion Madison Keys and fourth-ranked Amanda Anisimova.
Alcaraz and Sinner, or “Sincaraz” as they have been dubbed, play an exhibition in South Korea on January 10 in their only warm-up before the Australian Open eight days later.
While Spanish sensation Alcaraz bumped his Italian rival from the season-ending world number one spot, Sinner had the last laugh by edging him to retain his ATP Finals title in Turin.
It capped a stellar year in which Sinner retained his Australian Open crown and added a landmark triumph at Wimbledon among six titles, despite missing three months over a doping ban.
“I feel like a better player than last year,” said Sinner after completing his 2025 campaign with 58 wins and just six defeats.

“A lot of wins and not many losses. And in the losses I had, I tried to see the positive thing and tried to use it to evolve me as a player.”

Alcaraz was similarly dominant, clocking a 71-9 win-loss record with eight titles including the French Open and US Open.
But he is yet to go beyond the quarter-finals at the Australian Open, losing to Novak Djokovic in the last eight in 2025.
It is the only Slam missing from his resume and the 22-year-old will start afresh with a new coach after his shock split from Juan Carlos Ferrero, who mentored him since he was 15.
Djokovic last hurrah?
Djokovic begins what could be his last year on tour at the Adelaide International starting on January 12, still chasing an elusive record 25th major crown and 11th Australian Open title.
Now 38, he has had to settle for a secondary role since Sinner and Alcaraz took control of the men’s tour, making the semis at all four majors in 2025 but not going further.
“I can do only as much as I can do,” he admitted after defeat at the US Open.
“It will be very difficult for me in the future to overcome the hurdle of Sinner or Alcaraz in a best-of-five in a Grand Slam.”
Since his last Slam title, in 2023 at the US Open, Alcaraz or Sinner have shared all eight majors.
A resurgent Felix Auger-Aliassime, Taylor Fritz and Alex de Minaur, ranked five, six and seven respectively, all feature at the United Cup, while Daniil Medvedev and a returning Nick Kyrgios play in Brisbane.

Sabalenka heads into the new season as undoubted world number one, having collected a second US Open title while also winning events at Brisbane, Madrid and Miami.
The Belarusian is favourite for a third Australian Open crown and fifth Slam title, although the likes of Swiatek, Coco Gauff and Elena Rybakina will have something to say.
“The Australian Open is very special to me,” said Sabalenka, who lost a three-set thriller to Keys in the 2025 decider and heads to Australia after losing the controversial “Battle of the Sexes” clash to Kyrgios in Dubai.

“Winning it twice gives me confidence, but every year brings a new challenge. I’m excited to return and see what I can achieve.”

Challenging her on Pat Rafter Arena in Brisbane will be Keys, along with fellow top-10 stars Rybakina, Anisimova, Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva.
Swiatek leads Poland in Sydney at the United Cup, again teaming up with Hubert Hurkacz in their quest for revenge after being beaten by Team USA in the final in 2025 and Germany a year earlier.
The United States are spearheaded by Gauff and Fritz, while four-time major winner Naomi Osaka plays the event for the first time, representing Japan.</p><small>2025-12-31 08:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/310826141a37715.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964266/first-winter-rain-drenches-parts-of-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>First winter rain drenches parts of Karachi</strong></a><br><p>Winter’s first spell of rain drenched parts of Karachi late on Tuesday night and into Wednesday morning, bringing a dip in temperature.
Light to moderate rain was reported in Old City area, Lyari, Keamari, Mauripur, DHA, Clifton, Saddar, North Nazimabad, Malir, Mehmoodabad and Akhtar Colony.
According to data released by the Pakistan Meteorological Department at 8am on Wednesday, Keamari received the highest level (6mm) of rain.
Masroor Base received 5mm while Orangi Town, DHA and Saddar received 3mm of rainfall. Korangi and Faisal Base received 2mm, and 1mm was recorded across Old Area Airport, Jinnah Terminal, University Road, Gulshan-i-Hadeed and Surjani Town.
Rainfall was also reported in parts of Sindh. PMD data showed that Rohri recorded the highest rainfall at 32mm, followed by Sukkur at 24mm. A total of 19mm was recorded in Hyderabad (13mm in the city and 6mm in the airport area), 11mm in Tando Jam, 10mm in Mohenjo Daro, 8mm in Khairpur, 6mm in Larkana, 5mm in Jacobabad, 4mm in Mirpur Khas and 3mm in Dadu and Padidan. Trace amounts of rainfall were also recorded in Sakrand and Thatta.
Asked if more cool weather and rain were forecast for Karachi, PMD spokesperson Anjum Nazir Zaighum said on Wednesday that westerly winds had been affecting the country since Dec 29, “the effect of which we saw last night in Karachi”.
“There has been light rain in almost all areas of Karachi,” he said, but added that this situation was almost over.
He said that clouds were still present and that some light rain might be seen in some areas, which would be over by this evening.
The spokesperson also said that a drop in temperature would be felt in Karachi from Jan 4 or 5, when this weather event left Pakistan and moved eastward.
He added that when the northern winds, known as Siberian winds, began to impact the country, Karachi would experience increased cold weather.
“In the coming days, Karachi’s temperature could go into the single digits,” he said.
Separately, K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana, in a post on X, urged people to “exercise caution when using electrical appliances“ in light of the rain.
“A brief spell of rain was recorded in various areas across Karachi; K-Electric’s power system has remained stable,” he said.
He further advised people to “maintain safe distance from power transmission installation.”
“Obtaining electricity through illegal means and using hooked connections can cause fatal accidents,” he said.







On Sunday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) had forecast rain and thunderstorms, with snowfall over the hills, in most parts of the country during this week.
In Sindh, it predicted isolated light rain or drizzle in Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Jacobabad, Kashmore, Larkana, Thatta, Badin and adjoining areas on Dec 30 (Tuesday).</p><small>2025-12-31 07:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642165-how-pakistans-foreign-policy-found-its-footing-in-2025' target='_blank'><strong>How Pakistan's foreign policy found its footing in 2025</strong></a><br><p>

One, and most pivotal of them, is water, and not because of a single catastrophic event, but because multiple hydrological, political, and climatic crises converged simultaneously, dismantling the long-held assumption that water management is merely a technical or seasonal concern.
Throughout the year, water moved decisively into the realm of national security, federal cohesion, public health, and regional diplomacy.
Pakistan entered 2025 with a drier-than-average winter, slid rapidly into one of the most severe heatwave seasons on record, endured compound monsoon disasters, and concluded the year facing unprecedented transboundary water hostility on both its eastern and western borders.
The challenges, however, were not just external. Internally, long-standing inter-provincial distrust over water allocation erupted into mass protests, as Sindh confronted an existential crisis spanning agriculture, access to drinking water, coastal survival, and deteriorating infrastructure.
Below, we take a closer look at all that unfolded this year to make 2025 a turning point in Pakistan’s water history.
Transboundary hydropolitics
The Indus Waters Treaty shock
Historically, the Indus Water Treaty, forged by an unlikely alliance of world powers in 1960, withstood over six decades, survived wars, and braved diplomatic crises, serving as a stunning example of international cooperation.
All of that, however, collapsed in 2025, when on April 23, India formally placed the treaty in abeyance following the Pahalgam attack. The immediate consequence was not the physical diversion of river flows, but the suspension of hydrological data sharing, which is an essential pillar for flood forecasting, reservoir operations, and irrigation planning in downstream Pakistan.

 

The loss of advanced flow information during an exceptionally volatile monsoon season sharply increased downstream flood risk and operational uncertainty. Although Pakistan managed information through alternative national and international sources, India’s posture in water diplomacy appeared increasingly irresponsible, signalling an attempt to weaponise water.
This weaponisation of water and consistent threats were met with an appropriate and timely response from Pakistan, which involved declaring any unilateral diversion of western rivers an act of war and marking an unprecedented securitisation of water. Although international arbitration processes continued and interpretative rulings were issued later in the year, the treaty’s normative authority was thoroughly weakened.
The western frontier: Afghanistan and the Kunar River
While attention remained fixed on India, a quieter but equally destabilising hydrological threat emerged on Pakistan’s western frontier. In October 2025, the Taliban administration ordered the immediate construction of a major dam on the Kunar River, a tributary that provides the bulk of the flow to the Kabul River system, sustaining large parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In the absence of a formal water-sharing treaty between Pakistan and Afghanistan, bilateral water relations rely on customary practices that are now under visible strain. Few voices in Pakistan called for the counter-diversion of the Chitral River, signalling how water infrastructure has begun to function as a strategic instrument in an increasingly volatile regional landscape.
Inter-provincial water governance
Domestically, 2025 exposed the fragility of Pakistan’s federal water compact. The launch of the Green Pakistan Initiative, aimed at converting millions of acres of land into corporate farmland through new irrigation canals, triggered the most intense inter-provincial water conflict in decades. The proposed Cholistan Canal became the central flashpoint.
Sindh’s opposition was grounded in hydrological reality: there is no demonstrable surplus water in the Indus system capable of sustaining new large-scale irrigation without reducing downstream flows. Political leaders, farmers, lawyers, and civil society framed the project as a violation of the 1991 Water Apportionment Accord and a direct threat to Sindh’s agriculture and the already collapsing Indus Delta.

 

Mass protests, highway blockades, and resolutions passed in the Sindh Assembly reflected a rare province-wide consensus that upstream water diversion had become an existential issue.
Faced with escalating unrest, the federal government halted canal construction in late April, a decision later formalised by the Council of Common Interests (CCI). The body returned provisional approvals and directed that no new canal could proceed without full provincial consensus.
While this intervention reaffirmed constitutional federalism, it did not eliminate underlying structural tensions. Corporate agriculture remains a federal priority, while inter-provincial trust remains deeply eroded. Even technically successful reservoir management later in the year could not fully restore confidence in allocation mechanisms.
From climatic extremes to systemic failures
And then came the floods, one of the most consequential hydrological events since 2022, not because of the physical damage they caused but because they exposed systematic failures in water governance, infrastructure planning, and disaster preparedness.
Unlike a single flood pulse, 2025 witnessed a sequence of high-intensity rainfall events, sudden upstream releases, massive landslides and urban drainage collapse, producing cascading flood risks.
The monsoon began earlier than average in late June and extended deep into September, marked by intense cloudburst events. On July 17, Rawalpindi received approximately 230 millimetres of rainfall within 24 hours, overwhelming drainage systems and inundating urban settlements. Similar flash flooding occurred across KP and northern Punjab, where steep catchments rapidly converted rainfall into destructive flows.
Riverine flooding followed as exceptional rainfall in the upper Indus Basin coincided with reduced predictability in upstream releases. In late August, sudden discharges — particularly on the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers — combined with local rainfall to inundate large tracts of Punjab. Satellite analysis later confirmed that more than 1.3 million hectares of farmland were submerged, severely damaging rice, cotton, and sugarcane crops.

Sindh, on the other hand, experienced a different flood dynamic. After entering the year under drought conditions, the province faced rapid river swelling at Guddu and Sukkur barrages. Emergency discharges forced evacuations of around 150,000 people from vulnerable riverine areas, illustrating the absence of adaptive operational management under extreme variability.
Nationwide, the floods claimed over 1,000 lives, displaced more than six million people, and damaged critical infrastructure. The economic impact was severe, with flood-related disruptions shaving an estimated 0.5 per cent off national GDP. Beyond immediate destruction, floodwaters mobilised sewage, industrial effluents, and agro-chemicals, contaminating drinking water sources and triggering post-flood disease outbreaks.
The overarching lesson was stark: floods in Pakistan are no longer episodic natural disasters but systemic stress tests, exposing the same governance failures with increasing intensity.
Droughts to floods
Sindh embodied the contradictions of 2025 more acutely than any other province. Early Kharif water shortages, now a recurring feature, once again reduced cotton sowing and devastated mango orchards at critical growth stages.
As the year progressed, the irrigation crisis morphed into a public health emergency. In rural areas, women and children travelled long distances to collect saline and contaminated water. In cities, reliance on water tankers surged beyond affordability. Only about a quarter of Sindh’s population had access to safely managed drinking water, while water-borne diseases increased silently.

Meanwhile, the Indus Delta continued its slow collapse. Insufficient freshwater flows below Kotri accelerated seawater intrusion, rendering fertile land unproductive and displacing more than 1.2 million people over the past two decades. Mangrove loss, collapse of fisheries, and salinisation transformed large areas into ecological dead zones, fuelling migration toward already overstressed cities.
It increasingly appears that the delta no longer belongs to anyone. Even in 2025, when relatively improved flows reached the delta, voices emerged claiming that water had been “wasted” by flowing to the sea — an outlook that is anti-river, anti-resilience, anti-sustainability, and ultimately anti-people.

 

At the same time, investigations into Sukkur Barrage gate failures exposed years of deferred maintenance. Fortunately, a major rehabilitation and modernisation project was already underway. Even with the progress in 2025, the system remains under significant stress.
In Karachi, the K-IV project reached only 64pc completion despite massive expenditure, while demand continued to exceed supply by nearly 550 MGD. Moreover, serious questions remain about whether the project’s design and execution will translate into the intended outcomes.
The question of water governance
Earlier this month, the Asian Water Development Outlook (AWDO), released by the Asian Development Bank, brought yet another water reality to the fore.
The report placed Pakistan near the bottom of regional water security rankings, underscoring that the country’s water crisis stems less from absolute scarcity and more from persistent governance failure. Assessing 50 economies across rural, urban, economic, environmental, and disaster dimensions, the document showed that Pakistan’s National Water Security Index improved by only 6.4 points between 2013 and 2025 — below the regional average and far behind neighbours such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.
Rural water security remains in the second-lowest tier, marked by poor water quality, limited piped supply, sanitation deficits, and a high burden of water-borne disease, reflecting weak integration of WASH into climate adaptation.

 

Urban water security is even more alarming: despite marginal gains, Pakistan’s urban drainage score fell to zero, highlighting chronic flooding, unplanned expansion, and infrastructural decay, exemplified by Karachi’s persistent supply deficits and informal tanker economy. Economic water security stagnated, while environmental water security deteriorated most visibly in the shrinking Indus Delta.
Taken together, these findings reinforce the central lesson of 2025: Pakistan’s water crisis is no longer defined by scarcity alone, but by the growing unsafety of its water and the inequitable, opaque systems through which it is governed.
10 imperatives for 2026
The lived experience of 2025 leaves little room for ambiguity and yields ten unavoidable priorities for 2026.
First, water must be recognised and governed explicitly as a national security issue that have country level consensus, not merely as a sectoral or engineering concern.
Second, Pakistan must urgently develop a defensive and adaptive approach to transboundary water challenges, one that not just prepares for uncertainty, but also internationally works for basin-level thinking to save the lives, especially those of people belonging to less privileged backgrounds.
Third, inter-provincial water governance must be rebuilt on transparent, publicly accessible data and genuine constitutional consensus, without which technical decisions will continue to provoke political resistance.
Fourth, water quality must be elevated from a neglected environmental concern to a full-fledged public health emergency, integrated into health planning, nutrition outcomes, and productivity assessments. This leads us towards the fifth priority: groundwater — now Pakistan’s primary source of water for households and agriculture — must be governed as a shared public resource instead of an unregulated private commodity.
Sixth, urban water governance, particularly in Karachi, must shift decisively from emergency coping mechanisms toward durable institutional reform, equitable distribution, and accountability.
Seventh, environmental flows to the Indus Delta must be legally guaranteed and treated as essential for human survival, ecological stability, and coastal security, rather than as surplus water.
Eighth, women must be integrated as active decision-makers in water planning and management, recognising their central role beyond the invisible labour of water collection.

And finally, two things that require immediate attention: climate adaptation must be fully mainstreamed into all water planning, replacing reliance on historical averages with scenario-based, flexible, and risk-informed approaches.
And finally, water policy must be anchored in social justice, ensuring that access to safe water is upheld as a fundamental right rather than reduced to a market commodity determined by income and power.
The hydrological turbulence of 2025 was not an anomaly; it was a preview. It revealed what happens when fractured water diplomacy, internal mistrust, decaying infrastructure, and climate volatility collide. Water is no longer a sector to be managed; it is a constraint on Pakistan’s survival. Whether 2026 becomes a year of reform or repetition depends on whether the lessons of 2025 are heeded or willfully ignored.

Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.
“During the year, six polio vaccination campaigns were conducted, including five nationwide drives. As a result, reported polio cases dropped sharply from 74 in 2024 to 30 in 2025, with no new cases reported anywhere in the country since September,” the statement said.
However a polio expert, wishing to remain anonymous, said that it was the tendency of the virus to remain recessive for some years and then bounce back.
“It is correct that Pakistan reported 74 cases in 2024 and the number of cases declined to 30 during the ongoing year,” he said. “However, only six cases were reported in 2023 while as many as 20 cases were reported in 2022.“
Additionally, he added that although the year was almost complete, there was a possibility that the number of cases may further increase, as it took almost three weeks to confirm that a child was paralysed due to polio or for some other reason.
“In the lab, we get almost 4,000 samples from paralysed children every year for testing. So by the end of January, we will be in a position to confirm the number of cases for 2025,” the expert said.
It is worth mentioning that the target for the last nationwide polio campaign was to vaccinate 45.4 million children under the age of five. However, a total of 44.6m children were vaccinated as refusals were reported from across the country.
The statement issued by the polio programme said that although the number of polio cases continued to decline, Pakistan’s unwavering fight against the disease would persist until complete eradication was achieved. The virus, however, continues to circulate in certain high-risk areas, making sustained vigilance crucial.
Targeted interventions, robust community engagement, and ongoing vaccination efforts remained essential to reach every missed child and prevent any resurgence. Frontline health workers, security personnel, and local authorities continue to work in close coordination to maintain high immunity levels and ensure that Pakistan remains on course toward becoming polio-free, it said.
These gains were further reinforced during the most recent national polio vaccination campaign, conducted from December 15-21. The campaign achieved over 98 per cent coverage at the national level, with strong provincial-level performance across all four provinces, as well as in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), and Islamabad.
Compared to the previous round, an 18pc reduction in missed children was recorded, alongside notable improvements in access and operational performance, particularly in southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
“Nevertheless, efforts will continue until every unreached child is protected,” the statement added. While these efforts have led to significant gains, the fight against polio will continue, it said.
“Ongoing engagement with communities, religious leaders, civil society, and the media remains crucial to strengthen trust, counter misinformation, and ensure that every child is protected from polio,” the statement said.
It added that while localised access challenges persisted, especially in parts of southern KP, these gaps had been clearly identified and were being addressed through “targeted, district-specific interventions”.
Enhanced microplanning, improved team deployment, strengthened community engagement, and close security coordination remains central to these focused efforts, it said.
“Building on the progress achieved in 2025, Pakistan’s polio eradication programme is intensifying targeted efforts in 2026 to interrupt remaining virus transmission and move decisively toward eradication.
“With transmission now limited, population immunity rising, and performance improving in historically challenging areas, the programme remains firmly on track to secure a polio-free future for every child in Pakistan,” the statement said.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic.</p><small>2025-12-31 06:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642402-ppp-not-consulted-on-potential-govt-pti-talks-says-kp-governor' target='_blank'><strong>PPP not consulted on potential govt-PTI talks, says KP governor</strong></a><br><p>

A father of five children who are currently on winter vacation, he is constantly being asked when they will travel to Peshawar.
Before annual examinations, the children were planning to spend their winter vacations with cousins in Peshawar. Ahmed has also been invited to the wedding of a close relative, scheduled in Peshawar for the first week of January.
In his words, his wife and children look at him expectantly every day when he returns from work, hoping that their tickets to Peshawar have been booked and the date for their journey has been fixed.
“I wanted to take my family to Peshawar on the Jaffar Express … It is the only train available for travel to Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, as all others have been discontinued,” Ahmed tells Dawn.
But how can he think of putting his family aboard the train that comes under attack near the Bolan Pass on a weekly basis?

 

Rocket attacks, railway tracks and bridges being blown up, and attempted terrorist attacks on the train have become a commonplace occurrence now, with most people too scared to take the Jaffar Express.
This is not a new phenomenon: those old enough to remember would recall that attacks on railway tracks and gas pipelines have been a standard occurrence since the insurgency started in Balochistan in the year 2000.
However, passenger trains running between Quetta and the rest of the country have not faced such a volley of attacks since the 1970s, when the province experienced its first major insurgency, during the regime of then-prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.
The trigger was the first, and deadliest, attack of the year — the hijacking of the Peshawar-bound passenger train by Baloch separatist terrorists on March 11. At the time, the train was carrying around 500 passengers, including women, children and security personnel.

It was stopped and held hostage — along with its passengers — between the Hirk and Mushkaf areas, close to a tunnel. The hostage situation lasted for two days, resulting in several casualties among passengers and security personnel.
However, a subsequent operation by security forces prevented any further loss of life, with the train and the remaining passengers being successfully rescued.
“The hijacking of the Jaffar Express was the biggest and worst terrorist incident to have taken place in Balochistan during 2025,” a senior security official tells Dawn, adding that since then, the Jaffar Express had become a primary target for the separatist elements.

Deadly alternative
One might think that if the train is no longer a safe bet, one can always travel by road.
But there is a catch: passenger coaches that run between Quetta and every major city of Pakistan have also been in terrorists’ crosshairs, with several tragic incidents occurring over the past 18 months in which armed men allegedly intercepted coaches and, after checking identity papers, dragged out passengers who did not belong to Balochistan and executed them.

The situation worsened when bomb and suicide attacks and firing incidents started taking place on the national highways that link Balochistan with other provinces.
The takeover of highways by armed groups further created fear among the people, prompting the Balochistan government to impose a ban on night travel by coaches, buses and other forms of transport.
‘Business as usual’
But railway authorities have a different perspective on travel via the Jaffar Express. While acknowledging the frequent attacks on railway tracks and bridges, they insist that passenger numbers on the train are still quite encouraging.
“We have bookings for the Jaffar Express up to Jan 10,” Muhammad Kashif, the railway chief controller in Quetta, tells Dawn.
While that may be true, it is also a fact that during the past year, the line used by the Jaffar Express witnessed at least 10 incidents of track blasting, which sometimes led to the suspension of train services.
Similarly, at least one railway bridge was blown up, while four derailment incidents also took place at different areas along the route this year.

The train also faced sabotage twice, in the Shikarpur and Jacobabad areas of Sindh, while in a separate incident, five bogies were derailed and some passengers were injured in Jacobabad.
When asked why militants were only targeting the Jaffar Express, Quetta Divisional Superintendent (DS) Imran Hayat said that while its final destination was Peshawar, the train travels through Punjab.
“This is not something new; such attacks have been taking place here since 1877,” he says, referring to the time when the British Raj first built a railway through the Bolan Pass, connecting Sibi and Quetta.
At the time, the tribes living in the area considered it an occupation of their lands and resisted the only way they knew how — by attacking the train, which was the main physical manifestation of the colonisers that passed through their territory.
In view of such attacks, the colonial rulers established a levies force, recruiting people from local tribes to protect the railway lines and tunnels built through the Bolan Pass.

According to Hayat, this route was actually built by the British Empire for strategic, rather than commercial, purposes.
The line passes through difficult mountainous terrain, but with towering mountains on both sides of the track, it is tough going. Security forces are positioned in Aab-i-Gum, Mach and Kolpur, from where they monitor the line and provide security.
The March 11 hijacking occurred in just such an area, near a tunnel surrounded by mountains and difficult terrain. Officials Dawn spoke to attributed the casualties incurred in the incident to the remote location of the terrorist attack, which was eventually put down by SSG commandos.
According to Hayat, there has been no major attack on the Jaffar Express since the hijacking attempt in March. However, track blasting, damage to railway bridges and other disruptions have occurred, but these, he claims, were not fatal.
The only exception was a derailment following a blast on the railway track in Dasht area of Mastung district, in which eight passengers were slightly injured.

“Many other attacks were staged on the track and train in Nasirabad, Jaffarabad and Kachhi districts, but no significant losses took place. Sometimes, the train service between Quetta and the rest of the country had to be suspended as a result of the track being blown up,” a railway official says.
Presently, three trains run from Quetta: the Jaffar Express to Peshawar, the Bolan Mail to Karachi and the Chaman Passenger to the border with Afghanistan.
All other trains, including the Akbar Bugti, Chiltan Express, Awami Express, Sindh Express, Quetta Passenger and Harnai Passenger, were cancelled by Pakistan Railways over the past five years or so.
‘Symbolic, strategic importance’
Security experts believe that the Jaffar Express is targeted due to its strategic role: security personnel, including army troops, use it to travel to Punjab and KP. People living in Balochistan also use the Jaffar Express for travel.
Muhammad Amir Rana, a security analyst and director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies (PIPS) in Islamabad, is of the opinion that the train passes through a critical railway route, which connects Balochistan with the rest of the country.
It is widely used by Baloch students studying in Punjab, Punjab-based families and lower-ranking public sector employees, including personnel from various security services. This civilian-heavy passenger profile gives the route both symbolic and strategic importance, making it a prime target for insurgent groups.

“An attack on the Jaffar Express carries repercussions far beyond Balochistan. Its impact is felt strongly in Punjab, which is precisely what insurgents seek: to widen the psychological and political footprint of violence and draw national attention,” Rana said, explaining why the train remains a preferred target for miscreants.
The most dangerous stretch of the route passes through areas where multiple insurgent groups, including the proscribed Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), Baloch Republican Army (BRA) and their allied factions, have a significant presence.

Securing this corridor is particularly challenging due to the rugged terrain, limited access points and the vast expanse of difficult geography.
But, he says, “despite these risks, the state cannot afford to suspend or abandon the service. Doing so would amount to conceding space and narrative to the insurgents, granting them a symbolic victory and reinforcing their ability to disrupt vital civilian connectivity.”
Best-laid plans
For Bashir Ahmed — the father of five — all of these are risks he can’t afford.
“I cannot take the risk of travelling with my family on the Jaffar Express or by coach, nor can I afford to travel by air, as all airlines, even PIA, have increased the prices of air tickets,” he said.
Even ministers and MPAs have taken this issue to the assembly, saying they cannot purchase such exorbitantly priced air tickets.
“How can a government employee travel with his family by air?” Ahmed asks, before revealing that he has cancelled his plans to visit Peshawar and will spend the winter vacations in Quetta instead.</p><small>2025-12-31 06:00</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/3110193466b7588.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964270/doctors-without-borders-expects-to-be-barred-from-gaza-after-missing-israels-deadline-for-relief-agencies' target='_blank'><strong>Doctors Without Borders expects to be barred from Gaza after missing Israel’s deadline for relief agencies</strong></a><br><p>Medical charity Doctors Without Borders, known by its French acronym MSF, expects to be barred from operating in Gaza once it misses Wednesday’s deadline to comply with new registration rules for relief agencies that Israel claims are meant to prevent Hamas from exploiting international aid.
The organisation, which provided care to nearly half a million people during a two-year Gaza Strip war, says deregistration would cut off life-saving medical assistance for hundreds of thousands in the Palestinian enclave.
COGAT, the Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, said MSF had refused to provide Israel’s Diaspora Affairs Ministry with a list of its employees as required.
The Diaspora Affairs Ministry claims individuals affiliated with MSF have links to Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. MSF rejects the accusations as unsubstantiated.
When asked, MSF did not state if it had provided names.
In May, aid agency Oxfam said the requirement to share staff details raised protection concerns, following attacks on humanitarian workers in Gaza.
MSF told Reuters that the impact would be devastating if it is barred from operating, as the humanitarian crisis deepens.
“If MSF is prevented from working in Gaza, it will deprive hundreds of thousands of people from accessing medical care,” the group said, highlighting the stakes for civilians already struggling to access health services.
Dozens of other international aid groups are at risk of deregistration, potentially forcing closures or restrictions on operating in Gaza and the occupied West Bank, within 60 days, if they did not comply by December 31 with new criteria set by Israeli authorities.
While some international aid groups have been registered under the system that was introduced in March, the Norwegian Refugee Council and Oxfam told Reuters they too are preparing for possible deregistration.
If that happened, the NRC said it would likely be forced to shutter its East Jerusalem office and will not be able to bring foreign aid workers into Gaza. It has around 200 local staff as well as 35 international staff across Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
“At a time when needs in Gaza far exceed the available aid and services, Israel has and will continue to block life-saving aid from entering,” Shaina Low, spokesperson for the NRC, said.

 

Oxfam’s Policy Lead in the Occupied Palestinian Territory Bushra Khalidi told Reuters that its Palestinian staff and partners would continue supporting communities but said forcing aid agencies to rely on obtaining supplies locally — as they will not be permitted to bring in goods from outside — was part of a wider dismantling of the humanitarian aid system.
On Tuesday, the British Foreign Office published a statement alongside France, Canada and others saying Israel should allow NGOs to work in Israel in a sustained and predictable way, and shared concern about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.
COGAT said 4,200 aid trucks will continue to enter every week via the UN, donor countries, the private sector, and more than 20 international organisations that have been reregistered.</p><small>2025-12-31 05:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642381-majority-of-pakistanis-optimistic-about-economic-improvement-in-2026' target='_blank'><strong>Majority of Pakistanis optimistic about economic improvement in 2026</strong></a><br><p>

On one quiet stretch of Northwest DC, Pakistan’s embassy sits just steps away from the Israeli mission — neighbours by accident of location, but poles apart by history, narrative and ideology.
A few miles away across the Potomac, in Langley, Virginia, the CIA’s headquarters is a reminder of the machinations of a superpower’s deep state. An hour’s drive from the capital on hilly terrain, the timeless rigours of nature around the Shen­andoah valley, got me thinking about the world’s most influential constitutional democracy, and how its new security document “looks like the Janus face of a fraying domestic constitutional order, providing geopolitical cover for domestic authoritarian rule and corporate aggrandizement”, in the words of two former US officials.
The lesson, in fact, is simple: no society is immune when trust collapses and politics turns into a fight not over policy, but legitimacy. Pakistan has lived this saga for decades. Our tragedy is that we often debate democracy as if it were a trophy to be won, not a discipline to be practised. We speak of ‘rule of law’ while rewarding selective accountability.
We invoke constitutionalism while resorting to distorting it. We offer dialogue without first restoring dignity, then wonder why no one trusts the offer. At the heart of this dysfunction is this question: are we governed by law or by rulers who use the law as an instrument? Under the rule of law, the state restrains itself; under the law of the ruler, the state restrains the citizen.

 

Pakistan does not require yet another rhetorical recommitment to democracy. It needs a practical covenant — minimum commitments that bind winners and protect losers; that restrain state institutions and restore consent as the only durable foundation of governance. I therefore propose the following charter of democracy and good governance:


Sovereignty of the people. All authority flows from citizens. Government legitimacy depends on credible elections, not sham outcomes. A state cannot be stable if large segments believe the ballot has been managed rather than respected.


The Constitution is a covenant, not a weapon. Constitutional reform must be rooted in broad consent and transparent reasoning. When constitutions are altered as exercises in partisan engineering, the federation becomes a permanent battleground.



No society is immune when politics turns into a fight not over policy, but legitimacy.



A code of restraint for political actors. In polarised societies, leaders either cool the temperature or burn the house down. Political parties must renounce violence, discipline inflammatory rhetoric, accept peaceful alternation, and stop treating opponents as enemies.


Parliament must reclaim its role. Democracy cannot survive as a series of arbitrary executive orders. Parliamentary committees must scrutinise budgets of all institutions, including the establishment and intelligence agencies.


Dialogue must be real, not political theatre. It must lead to the genuine de-escalation of conflict, an agreed agenda, time-bound deliverables, and public clarity on what has been agreed. Dialogue offered under duress merely becomes propaganda, not reconciliation.


Due process has the state’s moral signature. A state is judged by how independently and fairly it administers justice. Investigation, arrest, prosecution and trial must be lawful, reviewable and reasoned. The appearance of justice matters because it produces the one thing the state cannot manufacture: trust.


The breach of civil liberties must be avoided. Speech, association, assembly and free press are not luxuries; they are feedback mechanisms. When the state narrows these spaces, it loses reality testing and begins to mistake silence for consent. Global democratic backsliding shows how easily ‘stability’ becomes an excuse for repression.


Depoliticise the police. A politicised police force becomes the sharp edge of an authoritarian drift. Merit-based postings, independent complaints mechanisms, lawful crowd management, and insulation from partisan instruction should be non-negotiable in a constitutional state.


Accountability must be even-handed. Selec­tive accountability is a political weapon; genuine accountability reflects a sound governance system. Anti-corruption must have clear thresholds, transparent prosecutorial processes, and protections against vendetta — otherwise it becomes a cycle of retaliation.


Follow the money. Organised crime, illicit finance and elite capture hollow out democracies from within. A serious state builds financial intelligence, asset tracing, inter-agency coordination, and visible disruption of high-value criminal networks.


The economy must be improved. Public procurement, tax fairness, regulation, and SOE refo­­rm must be transparent and competence-driven.


Local government is democracy’s foundation. When citizens cannot solve problems locally — water, sanitation, schooling, health, policing — they lose faith in the system. Empowered, elected LGs with fiscal authority are not administrative decorations; they are the bedrock of legitimacy.


Maintaining the civil-military balance. In stable democracies, national security institutions operate under constitutional direction and civilian oversight. When lines blur, politics becomes securitised and security becomes politicised — and citizens pay the price.


Measure what you promise and deliver. A charter without an implementation mechanism is hollow. An independent parliamentary commission should publish an annual state of democracy and governance scorecard — tracking election integrity markers, case backlogs, police complaints and outcomes, press freedom infringements, LG performance, and financial crimes disruption — and debate it in parliament.


The above charter contains the minimum rules necessary to prevent the strong from rewriting the system whenever power changes hands. The choice is stark. We can continue to treat the law as a tool to discipline rivals and reward allies or ad­­o­pt the rule of law as a means of restraining errant governments, institutions, and political actors.
A state is strongest when citizens trust it, and do not fear it. Trust is created when the law applies equally, when institutions behave predictably, and when power accepts limits. This is the difference between the rule of law and the law of the ruler.

All our development partners have been telling us that, without addressing Karachi’s infrastructure issues, Pakistan cannot achieve its growth targets.
On Aug 29, 2025, this newspaper published my article on how Karachi has been deprived of its rightful share of more than Rs3 trillion since 2010. Had that amount been spent on Karachi, we would not have reached this chaotic situation.
With Karachi’s consistent neglect, Pakistan has been suffering from a low average growth syndrome since 2010. The Prime Minister’s Economic Transformation Agenda and Implementation Plan (2024-29) sets a growth target of six per cent. In the first year of the plan, we achieved only 2.7pc. Pakistan will continue to remain in a low-growth quagmire unless it improves the infrastructure of its growth engine, Karachi, which contributes 50pc of the country’s exports and handles 76pc of its trade. Let’s check one issue that has become critical to its population and industry: water.
Most of us, including our most vocal political leadership, are under the impression that the completion of the Greater Karachi Water Supply Scheme (K-IV) will resolve the city’s water crisis. They are overlooking the fact that the Sindh government has turned K-IV, a water supply project, into a highly complex and insoluble inter-provincial issue. Given the Sindh government’s reluctance to provide funds for K-IV since 2007, the federal government took up the matter in December 2014, and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif directed that K-IV be completed within three years.

 

In January 2015, the media reported that Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari directed the provincial government to resolve Karachi’s water shortage “on an emergency basis” and complete K-IV at the earliest. But even after 11 years, there is no sign of K-IV’s completion. The Sindh government is also moving at a snail’s pace on the augmentation project for water distribution pipelines, which has been pending since 2016. Even if by any chance K-IV is completed and the augmentation of pipelines carried out, Karachi’s water issue won’t be resolved. Why?
Karachi needs 1,200-1,300 MGD (million gallons per day) of water. However, it gets roughly 550 MGD from Keenjhar Lake and 100 MGD from Hub Dam. The fact that most of this water reaches consumers through water tankers is another issue. The shortage is estimated to be 650 MGD or roughly 50pc of Karachi’s needs.
Ironically, the provincial government has also been refusing to provide additional water for Karachi out of Sindh’s share in the Indus Water Accord and has approached the Indus River System Authority for a separate allocation to increase the supply to Karachi from 1,200 cusecs (roughly 775 MGD) to 2,400 cusecs (roughly 1,550 MGD). Irsa reminded Sindh that the IWA signed by the four provinces specifically mentions that Sindh’s allocation includes water for Karachi’s urban and industrial use and that such supplies for the metropolitan city will be given priority. The Sindh government was supposed to abide by the accord’s specific provisions and develop infrastructure to provide water for Karachi from its own allocation rather than seeking it from the share of the other provinces. Has any other province ever asked Irsa for separate water allocation for its cities or the federal government to provide funds?
After failing to convince Irsa on the issue (in 2004, 2011 and 2015), the Sindh government decided to reduce the planned capacity of K-IV by 390 MGD — from 650 MGD to 260 MGD — till such time Irsa separately allocates water for Karachi. For this curtailed project of 260 MGD, the Sindh government will line the K.B. Feeder Canal (a project which has yet to begin), and the water saved from seepage will be provided for K-IV (Phase I). So, the present K-IV project is a curtailed version; even if it is completed, it will only solve one-third of the problem.
Let’s check how much 390 MGD or 600 cusecs being denied to Karachi comes to: just 0.9pc of Sindh’s water resources of 67,000 cusecs. When I served as project director for the National Programme for Improvement of Watercourses, we lined around 13,000 watercourses in Sindh within three years (2004-2007), saving an estimated 13,000 cusecs of water seepage. Such is the negligible volume of 600 cusecs required for Karachi. The city of 25m people (almost 40pc of Sindh) has been made to beg the federal government for funds for K-IV (amounting to only 4pc of Sindh’s annual development programme) and ask other provinces for water (for only 0.9pc of Sindh’s resources).
For 1,000 gallons of water, the agricultural landowners (using 95pc of the water resources of Sindh) pay only 20 paisas compared to a tanker in Karachi which costs Rs1,000 for the same quantity.
In short, whenever the curtailed K-IV and pipeline augmentation are completed (an eternity, it seems), these won’t be sufficient to cater for even one-third of the city’s needs. There seems to be no intention on the part of the Sindh government to even start designing the remaining part of K-IV as it is not ready to give 0.9pc of its water share, and is, instead, waiting for Irsa to allocate water for Karachi. Meanwhile, Irsa says that it deals with provincial shares, not cities’ shares.
Karachi pays 90pc of Sindh’s taxes and 60pc of federal taxes, yet it has not received its rightful share of more than Rs3tr since 2010 from the Sindh government, the NFC beneficiary. The IWA provides for preferential treatment for Karachi’s water needs, but the Sindh government won’t abide by it even if it means only a tiny fraction of the province’s water resources. Then what is the logical solution to these issues that are impeding national growth, while also contributing to the unending misery of Karachi’s residents?

The move is less about New Delhi’s energy ambitions and more about its ulterior motives to deploy a shared water system as an instrument of coercion against Pakistan. The recent approval of the Dulhasti Stage-II hydropower project on the Chenab, following the revival of environmental clearances for the much larger, decades-old Sawalkote scheme, is a clear signal of a deliberate acceleration of dam-building on the river allocated to Pakistan under the Indus Waters Treaty.
That this push comes in the aftermath of India’s unilateral suspension of the water treaty following this year’s attack in Pahalgam in occupied Kashmir lends credence to reports that New Delhi is planning to build water storage on Pakistan’s rivers to control their flows downstream.
The recent disruptions in the Chenab flow show a clear pattern in which India has repeatedly manipulated its upstream position to exert pressure on Pakistan ever since its illegal suspension of the IWT. Before that, India’s failure to share data on water levels and discharge in a timely manner aggravated flood devastation in Punjab.

 

The threat of water weaponisation is why Pakistan has consistently opposed Indian plans to undertake projects on its rivers. Most such schemes violate IWT project designs that allow for more water storage than required for power generation, which can be used to disrupt river flows downstream.
Likewise, Pakistan has raised objections against their gated spillways to prevent the sudden stoppage or release of large volumes of water. Concerns that India can create water shortages by stopping flows in the sowing season and flood land by releasing water during the monsoons have already been confirmed.

 

However, India’s anti-Pakistan agenda is not the only reason why constructing hydropower and storage on Chenab is a bad idea. Experts have warned of the adverse environmental impact of these schemes. The Chenab basin is among the most climate-vulnerable in the region.
Studies show that the glaciers have lost roughly a third of their volume in just a few decades. For a river whose flows are heavily dependent on glacial melt, this foretells a long-term water security crisis in the making for both Pakistan and India. The Narendra Modi government is evidently not concerned by the fact that its actions threaten the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. By destabilising the headwaters through dam construction, India is only accelerating ecological collapse, which will not spare it either.
Former climate minister Sherry Rehman aptly summed up the potential consequences of Indian actions when she tweeted that “this weaponisation of water is neither sane nor acceptable in a region on the front line of climate change and environmental stress”. It will only worsen bilateral tensions.

The Orange Line runs from Orangi Town to North Nazimabad while Green Line connects Surjani Town with Numaish via North Nazimabad.
“Citizens used to complain that they had to pay fare twice by accessing the Green Line. However, now the entire journey will be possible on a single ticket, which will provide travel convenience to 100,000 people daily,” he said while speaking at the inauguration ceremony held at the Orange Line depot.
Talking to the media, Mr Memon said it will now be possible to travel on the Orange Line and the Green Line at the same fare.

Sharjeel says commuters can now travel from Orangi to Numaish in one fare; double-deckers to hit Karachi roads today

During the tenure of the federal government, the ridership of the Green Line was up to 55,000 per day, whereas it has now increased to around 80,000, he said, adding that thousands of citizens benefit from this service every day, and the fares have also been kept very low.
He said that security cameras and other facilities are also available in the buses. Separate buses for women will also be operated on the Green Line and Orange Line.
Double-decker buses from tomorrow
The minister announced that double-decker buses are going to be launched in the city on Wednesday (today).
He said that double-decker buses will operate from Malir to Sharea Faisal, he said, adding that more double-decker buses will be brought to Karachi as these will help solve traffic problems.
The public will be given a New Year gift, and new EV buses have also arrived, he added.
To a question, he said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced 150 buses for Karachi. He requested the PM to fulfil this promise. In response to another question, he said that no one will be allowed to occupy government land.
He said that the Sindh Police and intelligence agencies carried out a major and very important operation in which those operating on foreign funding lured an innocent girl and prepared her to take the lives of ordinary citizens.
People were used on the orders of enemy countries, and parents were instructed to monitor the activities of their children, he said and warned that the nation’s children are being exploited and are being given a false narrative through social media. No objective was achieved by any explosion; rather, the target was the country and its own people.
Transport Secretary Asad Zamin, Sindh Mass Transit Authority Managing Director Kanwal Nizam Bhutto and other officials were also present at the inauguration ceremony.

The returnees from Iran were less likely to have income-generating employment, and more often reported barriers to girls’ education. Those returning from Pakistan after April found more casual income opportunities but struggled to afford rent and maintain sufficient food.
According to the survey, across all groups, returnees continue to settle in areas with fragile conditions marked by deepening poverty and limited access to essential services. Many cannot return to their areas of origin due to lack of shelter, land, or livelihoods. Over half of households surveyed reported missing essential civil documentation, restricting access to education, healthcare, and housing.
Education remains sharply constrained for all women and girls in Afghanistan: returnees from Iran most often cited policies and laws as the key barrier, while returnees from Pakistan pointed to economic obstacles. Access to healthcare is limited by cost, distance, and medicine short ages, with women disproportionately affected due to movement restrictions, survey results show.

UNHCR says Afghans coming from Iran more educated, have better food security than those returning from Pakistan

Most returnees (88 per cent) reported living in debt, representing a slight decline from the 2024 survey. Indebted households were typically large, averaging six members. Debt was particularly widespread in Nangarhar province, where 96 per cent of returnees reported financial distress.
Returnees from Iran were slightly less likely to hold debt than those from Pakistan, while differences between female-headed (90 per cent) and male-headed (87 per cent) households were minimal. Almost all indebted households stated that their debt exceeded their monthly income, under scoring widespread, unsustainable debt cycles and the financial pressures that undermine economic reintegration.

 

In August 2025, the monitoring expanded to include returnees from Iran for the first time, alongside those from Pakistan.
This round draws on interviews with 1,658 returnee households from Pakistan and Iran. Two new data sets were introduced for returnees from Pakistan: one for those who returned before April 2025 and one for those who returned after when cash assistance was reduced due to funding shortfalls.
The survey also includes undocumented returnees, allowing analysis of possible differences between returnees with refugee documentation in countries of asylum and those without.
The UN refugee agency says these findings highlight the urgency of sustained, multisectoral support to protect returnees and assist their reintegration. Interventions must be tailored to the differing profiles and needs of returnees from Iran and Pakistan, taking into account their distinct vulnerabilities and circumstances behind their return. Continued post-return monitoring remains critical to track evolving challenges, adapt programming, and advance long-term stability and protection.
The changes in data sets reflect the need to understand evolving returnee experiences. In 2025, Afghanistan saw massive return movements, with an estimated 2.7 million returns between January and November. These returns reflect changes in the profiles of those coming back.
Many returns occurred under duress and adverse conditions, driven by policies in neighbouring countries and deteriorating conditions for Afghans abroad, particularly in Pakistan and Iran. These mass returns often resulted in abrupt departures and difficult journeys back to Afghanistan.
Food insecurity remains critical despite modest improvements, with returnees from Pakistan disproportionately affected. Shelter, water, and education access further highlight disparities. Returnees from Pakistan, particularly recent arrivals, are more likely to rent housing and struggle to afford rent, whereas returnees from Iran more often own or inherit their homes. Access to safe water and sanitation is also more limited for returnees from Pakistan.
These findings highlight the urgency of sustained, multisectoral support that addresses both immediate and long-term needs. Assistance must combine short and medium-term cash support with livelihood opportunities, durable housing solutions, water and health infrastructure, and access to civil documentation, among other key needs and challenges faced by returnees.
Targeted interventions are essential for the most vulnerable groups, including female-headed households and people with disabilities. Continued monitoring, disaggregated by country and period of return, is critical to adapting programming based on evidence and ensuring that reintegration translates into lasting improvements in stability and protection.

MUZAFFARABAD: The federal government has notified a nine-member committee to deliberate on a contentious clause of an agreement signed nearly three months ago among the Centre, the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government and the Jammu Kashmir Joint Awami Action Committee (JKJAAC).
A notification to this effect, is­­sued by the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan and dated Dec 29, surfaced on social media on Tuesday. According to it, the committee comprises Mian Abdul Waheed, the senior-most AJK minister, and advocates Sardar Tahir Anwar and Raja Ejaz Ahmad Khan as nominees of the AJK government, while advocates Raja Amjad Ali Khan, Sardar Arbab and Saad Ansari represent the JKJAAC.
The federal government is represented by Muhammad Khashihur Rehman, draftsman/additional secretary; Hassan Mahmood, legislative adviser; and Taim­oor Zareen Khan, consultant research — all from the Ministry of Law and Justice.
Under its terms of reference, the committee will deliberate on the issue of “members of the AJK Legislative Assembly other than the AJK constituencies (sic),” a reference to the 12 legislators ele­cted from constituencies reser­­ved for Pakistan-based refugees from India-held Jammu and Kashmir.
The committee has been auth­orised to meet as frequently as required and submit its recommendations to the Monitoring and Implementation (M&I) Commit­tee constituted under the Muzaf­farabad Agreement. The agreement was signed in the small hours of Oct 4 following prolonged negotiations between an eight-member federal team and the JKJAAC leadership, after a week-long shutdown across AJK which left at least 10 people, including activists and policemen, dead and dozens injured.
At the time of the agreement, an M&I Committee was also constituted, comprising federal ministers Amir Muqam and Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, along with two nominees each from the AJK government and the JKJAAC, “to oversee and implement the accord”.
The committee was also mandated to review and rationalise the perks and privileges of the judiciary, ministers and government officials in view of financial constraints. While the main agreement ad­­d­­ressed several political, econo­mic and administrative demands, it separately provided for the formation of a high-powered legal committee to deliberate on the controversial issue of the 12 refugee seats.
The first meeting of the M&I Committee was held in Islamabad on Oct 21, after which it was decided to convene the next session in Muzaffarabad on Nov 15. However, the meeting eventually took place on Nov 21, a day after the JKJAAC addressed an open letter to AJK Prime Minister Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, alleging that the agreement had remained largely unimplemented beyond agreed timelines.
When contacted on Tuesday, the JKJAAC expressed regret over what it termed an inordinate delay in the formation of the committee, particularly at a time when public warnings of renewed protest had begun to surface.
“This step should have been taken within 15 days of the signing of the Muzaffarabad agreement, but it took almost 90 days,” said Raja Amjad Ali Khan, one of the notified committee members.

The city-state has doubled down on syndicates following record-high scam losses, with the Ministry of Home Affairs saying that “fighting scams is a top national priority”.
Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy lost more than $2.8 billion through scams from 2020 up to the first half of 2025, Sim Ann, Singapore’s senior minister of state for home affairs, told parliament last month as she pushed for the bill to pass.
Around 190,000 cases of scamming had been reported over that time period, she said.
Caning scammers was part of amendments to the penal code passed in parliament in November, and will be imposed on top of other punishments like imprisonment and fines.
“Yes, it comes into effect today, 30 Dec 2025,” the home ministry said.
Scammers and members of scam syndicates or recruiters “will face mandatory caning of at least six strokes, up to a maximum of 24 strokes”, the ministry said in an earlier statement.
Those helping scammers, including so-called “money mules” who offer bank accounts or SIM cards, face “discretionary caning” of up to 12 lashes, it added.
In recent years, Singaporean authorities have intensified public education efforts against scamming, including setting up a national hotline.
In 2020, the government introduced the ScamShield app, which allows users to check suspicious calls, websites, and messages.
Last year, then-premier Lee Hsien Loong told local media he had been scammed as an item he ordered online never arrived, highlighting how the issue affected all sectors of society.

The launch ceremony, which also featured the signing of financing documents including investor and issuer agreements, was attended by senior government officials, development partners, private sector leaders and representatives of international organisations.







The PSIB represents a fundamental restructuring of how Pakistan finances skill development, shifting decisively from input-based public spending to outcome-driven, private-sector-enabled social investment. It was designed to deliver measurable outcomes such as certification, job placement, and at least six-month retention for every trainee.
The model will gradually evolve so that subsequent tranches link repayment to a nominal portion of trainee salaries, embedding long-term sustainability while monetizing Pakistan’s demographic dividend both domestically and through the export of certified talent.
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb underscored the transformational importance of the PSIB in Pakistan’s broader economic reform agenda and human capital strategy.
He described the day as “an important moment focused on education and training,” reiterating that Pakistan’s demographic dividend can only be realised if the country succeeds in upskilling and reskilling its youth at scale.
He stressed that NAVTTC’s work sits at the heart of this vision, noting that the global shift toward high-value digital skills such as blockchain offers unprecedented earning potential for Pakistani youth, who already constitute the world’s third-largest freelancer community.
The minister emphasised that the PSIB is part of a wider, government-led strategic shift away from traditional budget-based social spending toward outcomes, evidence and accountability, reflecting a deliberate departure from input-driven systems that rely solely on public financing.

The judges under consideration are Justice Mohammad Azam Khan, Justice Mohammad Asif, and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas. The IHC administration has alre­ady forwarded the service records of the three judges to the JCP along with recommendations of Chief Justice Sardar Moha­mmad Sarfraz Dogar, who will participate in the meeting as a member of the JCP.
Justice Azam and Just­ice Minhas were appoi­nted as additional judges to the IHC, whereas Jus­tice Asif was appointed as a judge in the Balochistan High Court before he was transferred to Islamabad through a presidential order that also brought incumbent CJ Dogar to the IHC.
These transfers and the subsequent elevation of Justice Dogar as chief justice witnessed unprecedented internal discord within the IHC. Several judges appeared as litigants before the Supreme Court, while two judges attended proceedings before the Sindh High Court as private petitioners in the case relating to Justice Tariq Mehmood Jahangiri’s degree.
In 2025, the IHC decided at least 16,000 cases. Official data shows that Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas recorded the highest number of disposals, deciding 2,039 cases in his single bench and more than 500 cases in division benches. Justice Mohammad Azam Khan decided 1,841 cases in single benches and around 600 in division benches, while Justice Mohammad Asif disposed of 1,338 cases.
It may be noted that Justice Asif is also facing a complaint before the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), in which it was alleged that he misused his authority to influence proceedings in a hit-and-run case involving his son.
According to the complaint, dated December 25 and submitted by Advocate Inamul Rahim, the incident occurred on December 2 near the Pakistan National Council of Arts, where a speeding SUV allegedly driven by Justice Asif’s son struck a scooter, killing two girls on the spot. A judicial magistrate later granted bail to the accused on December 6 after the victims’ families pardoned him in court.
JCP meetings
In a series of meetings expected in January, the JCP is also expected to confirm the appointment of additional judges, who were appointed to the Lahore High Court and the Balochistan High Court.
Following the 27th Amendment, the commission comprises Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Yahya Afridi as its head, Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Munib Akhtar, Justice Syed Hassan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Aamer Farooq, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, Pakistan Bar Council representative Ahsan Bhoon, two members each from the National Assembly and the Senate, a woman or non-Muslim nominee of the National Assembly speaker, a member of the Islamabad Bar Council, and a federal minister.

These realities underscore the need to view population not as a burden but as a strategic driver of sustainable and inclusive development, UNFPA Pakistan said in a statement on Tuesday.

 

Looking ahead to 2026, UNFPA called for a shift in how population is reflected in national planning and financing, particularly in the NFC formula.
Moving beyond population size as the primary det­e­rminant, a forward-loo­k­ing appro­ach should rew­ard provinces for measurable progress in gender equ­ality, climate resilience, bal­anced population outco­mes, and improvements in the quality of health and education services.

 

Such reform would align fiscal incentives with human development res­ults, encourage innovation and accountability, and help translate population policy into tangible gains for people and communities, the statement said.
UNFPA also urged the implementation of the recommendations of the Council of Common Interests with clear accountability mechanisms, defined timelines, and sustained domestic financing, supported by strong population data and evidence-based planning.
Despite gains, challenges remain, the agency said. High maternal mortality, unmet need for family planning, early marriages, gender-based violence, and unequal access to quality reproductive health services, particularly in remote communities, continue to demand attent­ion. These challenges are also closely lin­ked to stalled fertility decline and uneven development outcomes, UNFPA said.

POS machines digitally record transactions, through touchscreen/terminal, barcode scanners, card readers, etc., and includes receipt printers. Due to POS machines all business transactions can be recorded and taxable income is easily traced by the FBR.
The announcement was made during a rally held from Aabpara Chowk to old Embassy Road against mandatory installation of POS. They tried to enter the Red Zone, but they were not allowed.
The traders had announced to hold a protest demonstration in front of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) office at Constitution Avenue, but the authorities stopped them from entering the Red Zone.

Hold rally from Aabpara Chowk to old Embassy Road against mandatory installation of POS

The rally was stopped by a heavy police contingent near Serena Hotel, following which traders staged a strong protest at the same spot and held a protest gathering.
The protest was organised by the All Pakistan Anjuman-i-Tajran and Traders Action gathering (TAC). A large number of trader representatives and shopkeepers from Islamabad and Rawalpindi participated in the rally.
Leaders of various traders’ associations from Islamabad and Rawalpindi addressed the gathering, including representatives of market associations and chambers of small traders.
Addressing the rally, President TAC, Islamabad, Ajmal Baloch said that the government should immediately withdraw what he termed the “black law” of installing POS devices. In a fiery speech he called for the passage of legislation awarding the death penalty for corruption.
Citing an International Monetary Fund (IMF) report, he claimed that corruption worth Rs53 trillion occurs annually across the country, and FBR had the largest share. “These corrupt elements had now turned towards traders, and that the installation of POS machines at small shops will only create new options to fleece the traders for bribery,” Mr Baloch added.
He informed about some incidents involving FBR, that legally imported tyres worth millions of rupees were seized, with only half returned while the remainder were allegedly distributed among corrupt officials.
Ajmal Baloch also alleged that children of thousands of FBR employees were studying abroad.
“We have  a simple demand why there should not be any inquiry into their assets, claiming that even low-ranking staff own luxury vehicles worth millions of rupees,” he said. He further alleged that customs authorities had seized 26,000 non-custom-paid vehicles that were being used by bureaucrats and their relatives.
He warned that if the FBR attempted to install POS machines by force or seal any small shop in Islamabad, traders would resist strongly. The leaders of the protest announced that in the next phase of protests they plan to block Kashmir Highway and stage a sit-in at Zero Point on Jan 16.
The speakers said that if FBR continued its oppressive policies, traders would call a nationwide shutter-down strike and stage a protest at D-Chowk. They demanded the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to protect traders from corruption and high-handedness by the tax authorities.

“In light of recent developments and their potential implications for the safety and effectiveness of counterterrorism missions, the Ministry of Defence announces the termination of the remaining counterterrorism personnel in Yemen of its own volition, in a manner that ensures the safety of its personnel and in coordination with the concerned partners,” said the UAE’s Ministry of Defence on X.
The statement added that UAE’s presence in Yemen was limited to specialised personnel “as part of counterterrorism efforts, in coordination with relevant international partners”.







The Gulf monarchy also rejected Saudi Arabia’s accusations that it supplied weapons to a Yemeni separatist faction amid rising tensions between the two Gulf monarchies.
“The shipment in question did not contain any weapons, and the vehicles unloaded were not intended for any Yemeni party,” said the UAE.







Saudi Arabia declared a UAE-backed separatist advance in Yemen a threat to the kingdom’s national security and called Abu Dhabi’s actions “highly dangerous”, as the rivalry between the Gulf monarchies boiled over into an open dispute.
The strongly worded foreign ministry statement came hours after the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it had struck a United Arab Emirates weapons shipment destined for separatist forces.

“The steps taken by the UAE are considered highly dangerous,” it said, adding “the Kingdom stresses that any threat to its national security is a red line, and the Kingdom will not hesitate to take all necessary steps and measures to confront and neutralise any such threat”.
In recent weeks, separatists seeking to revive the formerly independent state of South Yemen, have made sweeping territorial gains in a lightning offensive.
“Given the danger and escalation posed by these weapons… the coalition air forces carried out a limited military operation this morning targeting weapons and combat vehicles that had been unloaded from the two ships at the port of Al-Mukalla,” the alliance said, according to the Saudi state news agency.
AFP footage of the port showed dozens of parked military vehicles and pick-ups, several of which were burnt out and smouldering as workers hosed them down.
After the strikes, the leader of Yemen’s presidential council, which sits atop the Aden-based government, declared a state of emergency and cancelled a security pact with Abu Dhabi after the forces of the Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized swaths of territory.
The STC is also a key member of the government - a fractious patchwork of groups held together by its opposition to the Houthi rebels who control swaths of northern and western Yemen including the capital Sanaa.
Oil prices steady amid rising tensions in Gulf
Despite growing tensions between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, oil prices saw little change as investors took stock of the situation in the Middle East.
Brent crude futures for February delivery, which expire on Tuesday, were up by 24 cents, or 0.39 per cent, at $62.18 a barrel at 1315 GMT (6:15pm PKT). The more active March contract was up by 26 cents, or 0.42pc, at $61.75.
US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude gained 26 cents, or 0.45pc, to $58.34.
The Brent and WTI benchmarks settled more than 2pc higher in the previous session as Saudi Arabia launched today’s airstrikes.

Despite renewed fears of potential supply disruptions, perceptions of an oversupplied global market remain and could cap prices, analysts say.
Prices are likely to trend downwards in the first quarter of 2026 because of a “growing oil glut”, said Marex analyst Ed Meir.
Meanwhile, Gulf equity indexes mostly ended lower on Tuesday as tension flared between regional oil powers and neighbours Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Dubai’s main share index retreated 2pc, LSEG data showed, while Abu Dhabi’s main index and Saudi Arabia both dropped 1pc each.
The Dubai index saw its biggest daily decline since June. Blue-chip developer Emaar Properties fell 2.8pc and Sharia-compliant lender Dubai Islamic Bank lost 2.3pc.
Among Saudi shares, Saudi Arabian Mining Co slipped 2.6pc and Al Rajhi Bank eased 0.3pc. Oil giant Saudi Aramco was down 0.3pc.
‘A red line’
Saudi Arabia and the UAE - traditionally close allies who joined forces against the Houthis - have increasingly been at odds over the conflict as well as the war in Sudan.
“The Kingdom expresses its disappointment by the actions taken by the brotherly United Arab Emirates, pressuring the Southern Transitional Council’s forces to conduct military operations on the southern border of the Kingdom,” the Saudi foreign ministry statement said.







It called them “a threat to the Kingdom’s national security, as well as to security and stability in the Republic of Yemen and the region,” it said.
Abu Dhabi denied that it was behind the separatist offensive, saying it “condemns the claims made regarding the exertion of pressure or direction on any Yemeni party to carry out military operations that affect the security of the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi Arabia”.
A source close to the Saudi military coalition told AFP on Tuesday after the strikes that a diplomatic solution remained on the table.
“The coalition was forced to do that. All diplomacy efforts met deaf ears,” said the source.
“Diplomacy is still an option to stop any further escalation.”
24-hour deadline
Riyadh also backed a demand from Yemen’s presidential council for Emirati forces to withdraw from the country within 24 hours, and urged Abu Dhabi to cut off military and financial support for Yemeni groups.
Rashad al-Alimi, head of the Presidential Leadership Council, issued decrees on Tuesday announcing a 90-day state of emergency and annulling a security pact with the UAE over the separatists’ advance.
The STC members of the council later rejected the decision, saying the move threatened to “drag Yemen into new confrontations”.
Following the strikes, broadcasters in Saudi Arabia aired segments showing surveillance footage of the alleged Emirati ships delivering the combat equipment to the port of Mukalla in southern Yemen.
The Saudi-led coalition said the ships had arrived from the UAE port of Fujairah, adding that the operation was conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law and without causing collateral damage.An official at the port said they had received an evacuation warning.
‘Unacceptable to God’
Abdullah Bazuhair, whose home overlooks the port, showed AFP the damage to his property, with windows blasted clear out of the walls and glass strewn across the floor.
The strikes were “unacceptable to God” he said, adding “the children were terrified and the women frightened”.
The Saudi-led coalition had warned that it would back Yemen’s government in any military confrontation with separatist forces and urged them to withdraw from recently seized territories in Hadramawt and Mahra governorates.
Tuesday’s strike came days after reported Saudi air raids on separatist positions in resource-rich Hadramawt last week.
A Yemeni military official said on Friday that around 15,000 Saudi-backed fighters were massed near the Saudi border but had not been given orders to advance on separatist-held territory.</p><small>2025-12-30 19:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642332-in-meeting-with-uae-president-pm-stresses-elevating-ties-into-strategic-partnership' target='_blank'><strong>In meeting with UAE president, PM stresses elevating ties into strategic partnership</strong></a><br><p>

Al-Nahyan undertook his first official visit to Pakistan last Friday, where “substantive talks” took place, focused on further strengthening the longstanding fraternal relations between the two countries.
According to the PMO’s statement, PM Shehbaz, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and other officials, met the Emirati president at Sheikh Zayed Palace in Rahim Yar Khan.
It added that the two leaders “carried forward discussions” from Al-Nahyan’s December 26 visit.







PM Shehbaz stressed the need for both sides to actively pursue an enhancement in bilateral trade “through a quantum jump which will bring it to the desired level”, the statement added.
The PM and the Emirati president also discussed ways to enhance cooperation in a wide range of sectors, such as IT, energy, minerals and defence cooperation.
“While expressing his great admiration for the UAE’s remarkable progress under His Highness’s (Al-Nahyan) dynamic and visionary leadership, the prime minister thanked the UAE president for his patronage and commitment to foster stronger ties between the two countries,” the statement read.
“He (PM Shehbaz) also appreciated the UAE for hosting 2.1 million Pakistanis, who were playing an important role in strengthening ties between both countries,” it added. “The meeting capped off a year of extensive leadership-level engagements between Pakistan and the UAE.
Pakistan and the UAE share close diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties, strengthened by historical connections and a large Pakistani expatriate community in the Emirates.
The UAE is one of Pakistan’s largest trading partners and a key source of remittances, with thousands of Pakistanis working in various sectors. Both countries collaborate on defence, energy, and investment projects, with the UAE frequently providing financial aid and humanitarian assistance to Pakistan.
In April this year, Pakistan and the UAE signed and exchanged multiple memoranda of understanding (MoU) to further strengthen bonds between the people of both nations.
Two of the MoUs were for cooperation in the field of culture and the establishment of a joint committee for consular affairs, according to the report.
The third MoU was signed between the Federation of UAE Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry for the establishment of the UAE-Pakistan Joint Business Council.</p><small>2025-12-30 16:51</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642322-open-manhole-issue-should-not-be-viewed-through-political-lens-karachi-mayor' target='_blank'><strong>'Open manhole' issue should not be viewed through ‘political lens': Karachi mayor</strong></a><br><p>

Relations between Washington and New Delhi have become strained over the course of the year, due to US President Donald Trump’s sweeping 50 per cent tariffs on Indian goods and India’s discomfort over US engagement with Pakistan after the May conflict between the two South Asian rivals.
In a post on X, the US Embassy posted a message reading, “If you break US law, you will be punished with significant criminal penalties. The Trump Administration is committed to ending illegal immigration to the United States and protecting our nation’s borders and our citizens.”







Neither the US State Department nor US missions in Pakistan or other nations, including Afghanistan, Syria, Myanmar or China, have issued similar warnings.
Since taking office in January this year, Trump has vowed to crack down on illegal immigration in the US, rolling out policies and enacting mass deportations through 2025.
In February, a US military aircraft carried 104 deported Indians and landed in Amritsar. Although illegal Indian immigrants have been deported home by previous US administrations, it was the first time Washington used a military aircraft for the purpose.
In addition to deportations, Washington has made it harder for immigrants to obtain visas. In September, Trump ordered a $100,000 fee for H-1B skilled worker visas.
H-1B visas allow companies to sponsor foreign workers with specialised skills — such as scientists, engineers, and computer programmers — to work in the United States, initially for three years, but extendable to six years.
India’s foreign ministry said that the Trump administration’s move to increase H1-B visa fees was likely to have humanitarian consequences, warning of potential disruptions for families affected by the policy.
Similarly, India’s leading trade body Nasscom said the timeline for implementing the new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas for high-tech workers in the United States was a “concern”.
Since his inauguration on January 20, Trump’s administration has revoked around 80,000 non-immigrant visas for offences ranging from driving under the influence to assault and theft.
Around 16,000 of the visa revocations were tied to cases of driving under the influence, while about 12,000 were for assault and another 8,000 for theft.
“These three crimes accounted for almost half of revocations this year,” said a senior State Department official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
In August, a State Department spokesperson said Washington had revoked more than 6,000 student visas for overstays and breaking the law, including a small number for “support for terrorism”.</p><small>2025-12-30 13:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/301740189ea799e.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964123/karachi-mayor-urges-people-to-avoid-politicisation-after-child-drowns-in-open-manhole' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi mayor urges people to avoid politicisation after child drowns in open manhole</strong></a><br><p>A day after an eight-year-old boy drowned in an uncovered manhole in Karachi’s Mehran town, Mayor Murtaza Wahab urged people not to politicise the issue, saying that the child fell because the manhole cover “had been removed and put on the side”.
According to the Edhi Foundation, the number of people who died after falling into open manholes and drains across the metropolis rose to 27 in the outgoing year of 2025. Eight of them are children, the data says.
The child, identified as Dilbar, was playing outside his residence with other area children when the tragedy occurred, Korangi Senior Superintendent Police (SSP) Fida Husain Janwari told Dawn.
Speaking to the media today, Mayor Wahab, in response to a fiery question about the issue of missing manhole covers, particularly the death of a child a day earlier and reports of missing covers on II Chundrigar Road, said: “The reports I have so far received from locals, I am in touch with the child’s family, indicate that it was not that there was no cover at all, but that it had been removed and placed on the side.”
Noting the tone of the question, he remarked, “Now that this question has been recorded, it will go viral, and that, unfortunately, is the real issue”.
He maintained that the issue could not be looked at through a “political lens”.
“The first thing I checked was if the Union Council […] was given the additional Rs100,000 I had announced? Yes, the money was disbursed.“
“The point being that we did whatever was in our capacity, but if someone removed the cover and put it on the side, then it is a problem that can not be seen through a political lens,” Mayor Wahab maintained.
He stressed that it was vital to “look at what the real issue is“.
In reference to PTI‘s Alamgir Khan, who is known for his ‘Fix It’ campaign, the mayor said, “Yesterday, a person from a certain party went to II Chundrigar and said that his team had installed missing covers; however, later they went missing”.
“So did I remove the covers?” he asked.
“It means someone stole them,“ he said, urging people to address the issue “based on merits, rather than politicising it”.
Earlier this month, the body of a three-year-old boy, Ibrahim, who fell into an open manhole in Karachi’s Gulshan-i-Iqbal was recovered on December 1, more than 12 hours after the incident was first reported.
Following the tragedy, many political parties held protests against the provincial administration and demanded that the Karachi mayor resign, while pleas were also filed in courts demanding action against city officials.
The incident also prompted the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to increase the budget of 246 union committees (UCs) to exclusively maintain manhole covers and streetlights.</p><small>2025-12-30 13:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642286-yasmin-rashids-plea-against-nawaz-sharifs-na-130-win-dismissed' target='_blank'><strong>Yasmin Rashid's plea against Nawaz Sharif's NA-130 win dismissed</strong></a><br><p>

Both nations have a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia also signed a landmark mutual defence agreement in September this year, which outlined that an attack on one party would be treated as an attack on both.
In a post on social media, the FO said that Dar expressed satisfaction with the positive trajectory of bilateral relations between Islamabad and Riyadh during the exchange, while Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan “reaffirmed his commitment to further strengthening and enhancing bilateral ties”.
Dar also conveyed season’s greetings and best wishes for the New Year, which were “warmly reciprocated” by Prince Faisal, the FO added.







Earlier today, the Saudi-led coalition struck what it described as foreign military support to southern separatists at Yemen’s Mukalla port.
Last Saturday, Pakistan expressed its full support for Saudi Arabia’s efforts to ensure peace and stability in Yemen.
“Pakistan expresses its full support for the diplomatic efforts being undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for ensuring peace and stability in the Republic of Yemen. We also commend the efforts of the United Arab Emirates in this regard,” a statement from the FO read.
In November, the military leadership of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia vowed to enhance bilateral defence cooperation and reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen ties between the two countries.
“During the meeting, both sides discussed the evolving global and regional environment and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence cooperation,” the ISPR said. “The military leadership reaffirmed their resolve to further deepen the strong brotherly ties and enduring defence partnership between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.”

During his three-day visit to Lahore over the weekend, the KP chief minister had given an address at the Punjab Assembly to opposition MPAs last week. However, the visit was marred by altercations between members of his entourage and security officials, while heated exchanges between PTI leaders and journalists were also witnessed.
Speaking during the session today, Bokhari staged a walkout to show solidarity with journalists from the Punjab Assembly’s press gallery, who she said were “beaten and pushed around” by people accompanying the KP CM.
During yesterday’s assembly session, a statement by opposition member Col. (retd) Shoaib Amir about the press gallery, calling them “sellouts”, also sparked outrage.
“The whole world witnessed the spectacle in the assembly on the arrival of the KP CM,” she said, adding that preparations had been made for the chief minister’s arrival.
However, she claimed that the KP CM “brought unauthorised persons with him, who claimed to be journalists”.
She alleged that they beat up journalists from the press gallery and misbehaved with them.
“The footage is available in the assembly’s records,” she added.
She further said that rather than apologising, the opposition doubled down on their conduct.
“I was accused of planting journalists during the KP CM’s visit,” she said, questioning if it was wrong to ask the KP CM “how he was finding his Lahore visit”.
“I was told that I had paid my employees to pose as journalists,” she said, vowing that she intended to send a defamation notice.
“In solidarity with what happened with Punjab‘s journalists and with the members of the press gallery, I’m staging a walkout,” the minister said.
On Monday, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan had announced that an inquiry conducted into the chaos that marred the arrival of KP CM to the provincial legislature’s building would be sent to the law enforcement agencies.
Same day, chief minister Afridi, in a letter to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, expressed “deep concern” at the treatment meted out to him during his Lahore visit, stating it was marked by “discourtesy and unnecessary hostility”.</p><small>2025-12-30 11:54</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/30160743fc5d5e0.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1964114/election-tribunal-dismisses-yasmin-rashids-challenge-to-nawazs-na-130-win-in-2024-polls' target='_blank'><strong>Election tribunal dismisses Yasmin Rashid’s challenge to Nawaz’s NA-130 win in 2024 polls</strong></a><br><p>LAHORE: An election tribunal dismissed on Tuesday incarcerated PTI leader Yasmin Rashid’s petition that challenged PML-N supremo Nawaz Sharif’s victory from Lahore’s NA-130 in the 2024 general elections.
The tribunal, comprising retired Justice Rana Zahid Mahmood, dismissed Rashid’s plea on technical grounds.
It said in its decision that the petitioner had failed to comply with the requirements under the Election Act, 2017 for filing an election petition.
A written order of the tribunal is yet to be issued.
Rashid had filed the petition challenging Nawaz’s victory notification on April 16, 2024.
The petition argued that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had issued Sharif’s victory notification in violation of the law. Rashid requested in her plea to set aside the victory of the former prime minister and to declare her a returned candidate. She alleged that the ECP manipulated the election results to ensure her defeat.
The ECP had issued the notification of Nawaz’s victory from NA-130 on February 13 last year.
According to the ECP, Nawaz won the general election in the NA-130 constituency with 179,310 votes, while Rashid came second with 104,485 votes.</p><small>2025-12-30 11:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/642258-peshawar-police-issue-performance-report-of-k9-units-sniffer-dogs' target='_blank'><strong>Peshawar Police issue performance report of K9 Unit's sniffer dogs</strong></a><br><p>
