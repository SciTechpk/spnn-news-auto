They reportedly used the lawmaker’s Vigo, besides their own car, in their escape. The Vigo was, however, found abandoned away from the residence.
Initial information collected by police suggested that the outlaws drove into Dheran village, near Moro town of Naushahro Feroze district by a car, climbed the outer wall of Behan’s residence to jump into it and held all those present inside hostage.
They comfortably collected cash, jewellery and other valuables worth millions of rupees and boarded their car and the MNA’s 4x4 vehicle to escape to their hideout.
Police found the 4x4 vehicle abandoned near the Dars police station, a few kilometres away from the village.
The MNA was not present at his residence when the robbery took place, and there was no mention of any official or private security guards in the initial inquiry report.
Soon after the robbers’ escape, all officers and personnel of the police station concerned, along with a forensic team, IT and geo-fencing staff, footprint tracker unit, as well as some private footprint trackers, rushed to the MNA’s residence and started doing their respective jobs. They were personally supervised by Naushahro Feroze SSP Mir Rohal Khan Khoso.
In his immediate reaction, MNA Behan told journalists that it might have been a conspiracy involving some influential figures of the area.
The SSP expressed his confidence that the police investigators would reach the culprits very soon with the help of footprint trackers.
A formal FIR of the incident was yet to be registered.
National Peoples Party (NPP) Chairman and a senior Grand Democratic Alliance (GDA) leaderGhulam Murtaza Jatoi — one of the main political rivals of MNA Behan — visited the shocked lawmaker to express his sympathies over the incident.

• Senator Zehri defends amendment, citing need for clarity in post-divorce child support cases
ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Religious Affairs has sought a review of certain clauses in the Muslim Family Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, particularly the provision stating that the father shall remain responsible for the child until the child attains adulthood.
The ministry made the observation during a detailed discussion on the bill — introduced by Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri — at a meeting of the Senate Standing Commit­tee on Religious Affairs and Inter­faith Harmony.
The ministry pointed out that the proposed clause needed reconsideration, as under the existing laws, the father is already responsible in cases where the child is a minor or disabled.
Explaining the rationale behind the amendment, Senator Zehri said that in cases where a husband divo­rces his wife and the child is not fi­­n­ancially stable, there must be clear legal guidance on who will bear the child’s financial responsibility and where such a child would go.
After extensive deliberations, Senator Zehri requested the ministry to provide a detailed written response outlining the context and objections raised regarding the bill. The committee chairman directed that a separate meeting be convened to further examine the matter in consultation with all relevant stakeholders.
 
 

It was also noted that the Law Division had raised certain objections to the bill. Senator Zehri requested that copies of the relevant documents and objections be shared with her, on the basis of which the bill was being opposed.
The committee was also given a detailed briefing on the quota and tender awarding process under the government Haj scheme for 2026, as well as the procurement of goods and services for Haj operations. The ministry informed the meeting that the Procurement Commit­tee comprises seven members and that the process is currently underway. Once completed, all relevant details will be shared with the committee.
The chairman also inquired about the exclusion of a catering company from the tender process on the grounds of lack of experience.
The ministry clarified that such matters are reviewed by the Procurement Committee, which examines all relevant aspects before submitting the process to PEPRA for final evaluation and decision.
It was further informed that companies lacking prior experience are generally awarded smaller tenders initially to help them gain practical experience, as awarding large tenders directly to inexperienced firms may cause operational challenges.

The premier, visiting Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the crown prince, is leading a high-level Pakistani delegation during the trip.
The delegation includes Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and PM’s aides Tariq Fatemi and Bilal Bin Saqib, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO).
A statement issued on social media platform X by state broadcaster PTV News said the meeting with the Saudi crown prince was held in a “cordial atmosphere”.
“Matters of mutual interest were discussed in the meeting. The joint statement of the meeting regarding discussions on promoting trade, investment, and cooperation in various sectors between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will be issued shortly,” the statement said, adding that the meeting was attended by FM Dar, COAS Munir and senior cabinet members from both sides.
 






PM Shehbaz earlier arrived at the King Khalid International Airport where he was received by Riyadh Deputy Governor Muhammad bin Abdulrahman bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia’s Ambassador to Pakistan Nawaf bin Saeed Al-Malki and Pakistan’s Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Ahmad Farooq.
 






The prime minister left for Riyadh earlier today from Lahore.
 






The invitation for the conference, signed by the crown prince, was given to PM Shehbaz in August by Ambassador of the King­dom of Saudi Arabia Naw­af bin Said Al-Malky.
The FII9 will convene global leaders, investors, policymakers, and innovators to explore the theme, “The Key to Prosperity: Unlocking New Frontiers of Growth”. Thematic discussions will address global challenges and opportunities, focusing on key topics such as innovation, sustainability, economic inclusion, and geopolitical shifts.
The Foreign Office (FO) said in a statement yesterday that during his visit, the PM would engage with the Saudi leadership to explore avenues for enhanced cooperation in the trade, investment, energy, and human resource sectors.
“The discussions will also cover regional and global issues of mutual interest and concern,” it added.
On the sidelines of the summit, the PM will also interact with leaders from other participating countries and heads of international organisations.
The FO said these exchanges would highlight Pakistan’s investment potential and its readiness to pursue collaborations in sustainable development, in line with the “Think, Exchange, and Act” model.

The 1781 battle of Yorktown and the vicious stand-off between Chinese and Indian troops in Galwan in 2020 are thus linked to the state assembly elections currently underway in Bihar. This is the rare north Indian state where the Hindu right is struggling to take power on its own.
Other Hindi-belt states like Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh have seen BJP taking power on its own steam, but in Bihar it continues to lean on allies, that too playing second fiddle. This, even though the BJP won more seats than the chief minister Nitish Kumar’s party in the 2020 polls. There is lingering apprehension today that the BJP, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s watch, could do with Kumar what it did with allies in Maharashtra — pare them down by splitting their ranks and usurp direct power. Bihar though has been a different kettle of fish.
 
 

The state is among the most fractured regions in caste terms, far more intractable than other BJP-ruled states. In Uttar Pradesh, for example, the Bahujan Samaj Party of Dalits could take power with or without allies. Likewise, the Samajwadi Party of lower caste peasants was able to rule on its own. Unlike Uttar Pradesh where it runs its own government, the BJP has so far failed to gain power in Bihar by itself.
Two historical events have influenced the state’s hugely politicised and intellectually raw earthiness. This was the region after all where Buddha attained enlightenment 2,500 years ago. Buddhism spread from Bihar and marked the most entrenched and durable rebellion in history against Brahminical hegemony over much of ancient India. There was thus already something about Bihar — it derives its name from Buddhist vihars or monasteries — which spurred anti-caste revolt to spread via Buddhism and Jainism.

Bihar is the rare north Indian state where the Hindu right is struggling to take power on its own.

The other significant event in Bihar, which continues to stalk its fragmented social relations, was the land revenue arrangement installed by British governor-general Lord Cornwallis. The Permanent Settlement created a violent system of zamindars with hereditary rights. They extracted from the peasants all that could fill the coffers of the East India Company and enough for themselves to buy muscle power to ply the ruthless system.
Think about it. Had Cornwallis not been routed by George Washington in Yorktown, Bihar might have been spared the pain of his socially disruptive extortion. Who knows, perhaps Tipu Sultan would have carved a different role for India, not unlike what George Washington did for America, as an ally of the French and tormentor of British rule. Cornwallis vented his spleen at the French for supporting Tipu who he defeated in Srirangapatnam in 1792. The unabated exploitation of Dalits and tribespeople Cornwallis created in Bihar would erupt in political movements — now dressed as Naxalites or again as the middle caste-led advocate of ‘total revolution’.
Political earthiness apart, acid verse too abounds about elections in India. One such by Ashok Chakradhar describes a famished tiger that far from eating up a lamb and its mother, wishes them health and longevity, instead. The lines end tartly: “Itna keh kar sher kar gaya prasthaan. Bakri hairaan. Beta taajjub hai. Bhala ye sher kisi per rahem khanewala hai. Lagta hai jangal mein chunaav aane wala hai.” (The goat shared its bewilderment with the baby. Hungry tigers don’t usually bungle. It must be election time in the jungle.)
Likewise, the late Raahat Indori conflated military tensions on the border with elections. “Sarhad par bahot tanaav hai kya? Kuchh pata karo, chunaav hai kya?” (There’s tension on the borders, but why? Go find out if an election is nigh.) Cynicism apart, the state assembly polls underway in Bihar, the second most populous of the so-called Hindi-belt states, where the BJP derives much of its strength from, do have a military connection.
Two days after the horrific attack in Pahalgam on April 20, a livid Narendra Modi showed up at a public rally in Bihar, not at the site of the communal carnage in Kashmir as might be expected of him. From the rally in Bihar, Modi declared his fight to the finish against terrorism. Significantly, he made the most critical point about the prospects of war in English. Bihar was the platform not the audience. About 20 days later, Operation Sindoor was unleashed only to be quickly suspended with a tentative and, by many accounts, puzzling ceasefire. In Bihar’s election campaign though, the short sharp exchange with Pakistan appears to be offering little purchase in the two-stage Nov 6 and 11 elections for the 243 assembly seats.
Curiously, in the October 2020 Bihar elections too, the prime minister tried to stoke the memory of the killings of Indian soldiers by Chinese troops along the disputed Sino-Indian border at Galwan. At three brief halts in Sasaram, Gaya and Bhagalpur, Modi spoke of the clash with China, in which soldiers — notably of 16 Bihar regiment — had been killed. Modi accused the opposition of supporting those “conspiring” against India.
Bihar happens to be where L.K. Advani’s communally divisive 1990 ‘rath yatra’ to Ayodhya was brought to heel by Lalu Prasad Yadav, the state’s chief minister at the time. Yadav’s much-applauded courage, however, triggered the fall of the BJP-supported V.P. Singh government. The BJP gained traction from the event. By December 1992, the Babri Masjid was destroyed in the presence of Advani. By 1996, Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the BJP’s first prime minister. Bihar’s chief minister Nitish Kumar crucially supports Modi as he did Vajpayee. Should he flap his wings post elections, it might usher a tornado in Delhi. Rahul Gandhi is watching.

• Retired Gen Ehsanul Haq says Zaeef insisted on remaining in Islamabad, despite warnings from Pakistani officials
ISLAMABAD: Over 20 years after his now-infamous handover to American forces following their invasion of Afghan­istan, a former Pakistani spymaster has claimed that it was his own countrymen, and not Pakistan, that handed over former Taliban ambassador Abdus Salam Zaeef to the US.
The claim, which comes in the midst of an escalating fracas with a resurgent Taliban in Kabul, was made by retired Gen Ehsanul Haq, who took over the reins of Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) following the September 11, 2001 attacks.
For years, it was believed that Zaeef — who was the Afghan Taliban regime’s envoy to Islam­abad at the time of the 9/11 atta­cks — was handed over to the Americans in violation of international law.
In his book, My Life With The Taliban, the former envoy had asserted that he was given into US custody in Peshawar, and this account has never been publicly challenged by any Pakistani official.
However, when asked about Zaeef’s claims during a recent seminar, the former four-star general recounted how the previous Taliban regime came to be ‘de-recognised’, and how Pakistani officials tried for months to convince the envoy to leave Islamabad to avoid the situation he later faced.
Zaeef spent just under four years as a captive in the infamous US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay, and was eventually released in 2005.
 
 

When approached for comment, Zaeef said he rejected the former general’s statement.
In his remarks at a recent seminar on Pakistan and Afgha­n­istan relations — organised by the Khyber Margalla Founda­tion, an Islamabad-based organisation of government servants, retired officials and professionals from Khyber Pakht­unkhwa — Gen Haq recalled that Zaeef was told that he should leave Islamabad. If he did not accept, he would be taken to Torkham and deported, the former general said.
“When he was being flown in a helicopter, our people again told him that if you agree, we will drop you somewhere else rather than taking you to the border for deportation.”
“Ultimately, he was taken to the Torkham border and asked to cross over. No one in Pakistan handed him over to the US. When he crossed… Afghan aut­h­orities arrested and han­d­ed him over to American forces. Then he was transferred to Guant­anamo. Pakistan has not done it,” the ex-ISI chief said.
 
 

Although Pakistan had recognised the Taliban regime and accepted Zaeef as Kabul’s amb­a­ssador, the recognition was withdrawn in the wake of 9/11.
The former spy chief — who has also served as the head of Military Intelligence and ret­ired as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee — recalled that despite the breakdown of ties, Zaeef continued to reside in the ambassador’s official residence, where the foreign media would remain camped out.
He also recounted how Tali­ban leaders started leaving Afgh­anistan after the US began bombing Kabul in October 2001. They had plans to form a government-in-exile in Pakis­tan, with Zaeef as its head, he said.
“A decision was made to ask Mullah Zaeef to leave Pakistan. There were five million Afghans living in Pakistan that time and we did not hand over any Afghan to the US,” he said.
Gen Haq said Pakistani officials had advised Zaeef to move to a refugee camp, or any other place, to live as a common Afg­han and stop what he was doing. “This message was conveyed to him through the foreign ministry and other relevant govt functionaries.” However, the former ISI chief said, the erstwhile env­oy refused to leave Islamabad.
“Our people would keep on ask­ing him for months to shift from Islamabad. Other countr­ies would also lodge protests that there are UN resolutions and Pa­­k­­istan had de-recognised the Af­g­han govt [but he is still] he is sitting in Islamabad,” he recalled.

In a separate incident, dozens of armed men invaded a town in Kacchi district and set the police station on fire, before escaping after a heavy gun battle with the police.
Speaking about the roa­d­side explosion, officials said the improvised explosive device, which was pla­n­ted in a motorbike, went off next to a security vehicle when the DC’s convoy reac­h­ed Thana road in Turbat.
“At least nine Levies personnel present in the security vehicle, as well as a passerby, were injured in the powerful blast,” Nazeer Ahmed, Turbat deputy superintendent of police, told Dawn.
The deputy commissi­oner, who was travelling in a bulletproof vehicle, rem­ained safe in the explosion.
 
 

Soon after the blast, the security forces and the police rushed to the site, and the injured Levies personnel and the sole civilian were rushed to the district hospital in Turbat. “The condition of two personnel is serious,” the police said, quoting hospital officials.
The explosion destr­oyed the security vehicle, while the bulletproof vehicle of the DC also received damage. At least a dozen buildings and five vehicles parked in the vicinity also sustained damage.
Police station torched
Separately, dozens of militants attacked Bhag, a town in Kacchi district, and set the Levies station and other government buildings on fire.
Officials said two assailants were also gunned down — one body was tak­en into custody by the Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment and the other was tak­en away by the fleeing militants.
In the attack, a police official was also killed, while another sustained injuries and moved to Sibi for treatment. Officials said up to 50 armed men arrived in Bhag at 4:15pm on motorbikes, attacking a pickup truck and police and Levies stations. They took the Levies personnel hostage and started firing at the police station. However, the police deployed in the area immediately retaliated, leading to a heavy exchange of fire.
In the shootout, Bhag SHO Lutaf Khosa received multiple injuries and lost his life. “Our police officer was martyred and a police constable [Muhammad Afzal Khosa] was injured in the heavy exchange of fire,” Maazur Rehman, Ka­c­chi SSP, told Dawn. He said two militants were also killed.
According to the SSP, armed men broke into the judicial lockup and took away six undertrial prisoners. He said the tehsil office was also attacked by the militants who ransacked the record of ‘Patwarkhana’ and its furniture. They tried to enter a National Bank branch but the police foiled their attempt, said the SSP.
He said the police station was completely gutted. The building of the National Bank was also damaged as heavy weapons were used in the attack.

• Province cites slow, inadequate response from federal cybercrime agency
LAHORE: Unhappy with the performance of the National Cybercrime Inve­stigation Agency (NCCIA), the Punjab government has decided in pri­nciple to set up its own wing to deal with the rising incidents of cybercrime in the province.
The decision was taken at a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Mar­yam Naw­az here on Monday. “The Cybercrime Wing will be establis­hed in Pun­j­ab to curb the misuse of digital platforms,” the meeting decided.
A senior official told Dawn that Punjab had been facing difficulties as its complaints were not properly addressed by the NCCIA and often took too long to be disposed of.
“Keeping in view the sharp rise in cybercrime in the most-populated province of the country, Punjab feels the need to have a separate wing to deal with the menace,” he said.
After the NCCIA was established in May this year — replacing the Fede­ral Investigation Agency’s (FIA) Cybercrime Wing — the Pun­jab government tried to develop a “working relationship” with the federal authority, but it did not yield results.
The Punjab government has been facing increasing challenges on social media, particularly the targeting of the Sharif family by pol­itical opponents. Even provincial ministers, including Information Minister Azma Bokhari, have filed compl­aints with the NCCIA agai­nst individuals invol­ved in online character assassination.
Ms Bokhari recently ann­o­unced plans to move the NCCIA against TV anchor Mubasher Lucman under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) for alleged defamation.
Questions, however, are being raised about whether the proposed provincial cyb­­e­rcrime wing is inten­d­ed to target political rivals.
Meanwhile, the NCCIA itself has been struggling with severe manpower shor­t­ages as thousands of complaints pour in each month. With a large backlog and limited resources, the authority has been unable to process cases efficiently.
 
 

“In the NCCIA, compla­ints arrive in thousands eve­ry month. Most are related to account hacking, harassment, and financial fraud,” an official told Dawn.
“In harassment cases, many inv­olve the uploading of objectionable photos or videos — often by ex-husbands, ex-fiancés, or boyfriends — to blackmail victims. But the NCCIA lacks the staff and resources needed to handle such a massive volume.”
He said evidence collection also remains a major challenge due to non-cooperation from some social media platforms, including Faceb­ook, WhatsApp, Google, and Gmail.
“There is no treaty betw­een the government and these companies, so they are not legally bound to share data with the NCCIA. Only in cases involving life threats or ransom do they respond promptly. Besides, the authority is not equipped with the latest software required to trace and verify digital evidence,” he added.
Over the past few years, the number of cybercrime complaints has increased manifold, but the government has not taken steps to strengthen the capacity of the investigating agency, including training officers in countries that have advanced cybercrime systems.
“The government should build the cybercrime setup on the pattern of the FBI,” the official suggested.

Back in 2022, he was killed under mysterious circumstances in Kenya, far away from Pakistan. That year was a chaotic one in Pakistan, chaos which is easier to ascribe to politics than to point out more uncomfortable truths; and it also claimed Arshad Sharif’s life.
Once the grief and horror over his death passed, the conversation returned to prosaic matters such as inquiries, commissions and justice. I call them prosaic because when journalists die in Pakistan, everyone pushes earnestly for answers, despite knowing that justice will never be done and no one will be held accountable. The same storyline was faithfully adhered to this time around. In the three years since, we have seen journalist organisations promising — politician-like — to push for investigations, as well as politicians and also other powerful people. Some promises were made publicly and some in secret but none were fulfilled. Three years on, very few questions have been answered.
 
 

But such tragedies are the norm in Pakistan. Here popular leaders are given the death penalty, others are targeted by militant groups and those from the smaller provinces are even disappeared. It is no wonder then that journalists are not treated more kindly. Just in the past couple of decades, Hayatullah was disappeared and killed in what was then Fata; Saleem Shahzad was disappeared and found dead near Islamabad and Wali Khan Babar was targeted in Karachi — just to name a few. Three years ago, it was Arshad Sharif.
But his death seemed to and continues to feel like a turning point. Partly because it came in a year that was a turning point in so many ways, but also because of the manner in which it happened. Before Arshad Sharif, many of us were always bystanders to the violence which affected one of our own. The threats that came before, the harassment that Babar or Shahzad faced was usually limited to a close circle but with Arshad Sharif it played out like a film. The FIRs, the letters he wrote, his exit from the country, his resignation from his job and then his vlogs, we all had a ringside seat to the events.

What journalist colleagues in smaller towns and cities go through is hard to even imagine.

Equally, what made it a turning point was that his death told us journalists that borders now no longer keep us safe. To be accurate, the message had been sent earlier with the death of Sajid Husain in Sweden in 2020 — but Arshad Sharif’s demise in Kenya emphasised it more. It is no longer necessary that once the borders of Pakistan are crossed, threatened journalists will be able to breathe freely. Once this was a guarantee of safety but not anymore. Despite this, many others from the community have left the country and settled abroad.
And for multiple reasons, journalism and the ability of journalists to do their job has been in a free fall since 2022; it was not much better before it either but the speed at which the environment has become worse is increasing. So much has been written about this already that little can be added to it. But as our job is sometimes to state the obvious, let me point out that this past week, as Arshad Sharif’s death anniversary was being commemorated, Matiullah Jan, another colleague from Islamabad, was in the news because the ludicrous case against him for ‘attacking policemen’ while ‘under the influence’ and for ‘possession’ of heroin was also proceeding. News reports say he will be indicted on Oct 31. The allegations are so ridiculous that even those in the government cannot defend them but the case goes ahead, for we now live in times better suited for magical realism than the real world.
So even as the case will progress, we will complain and yet be grateful that Matiullah Jan was thus accused and is out on bail. At least, he was produced in court after being formally charged, even as he has every right to be angry about the indignity of this case and also hear the inanities uttered by those who claim to lead and represent us.
The harassment of journalists has indeed taken on new hues, in recent years. Just in the past year, Matiullah and Asad Toor both lost access to their bank accounts as did others around them. Friends, relatives and even ordinary vendors they interacted with, everyone paid the price for having pesky journalists in their lives. There are others also in a similar predicament. What colleagues in the smaller towns and cities go through is hard to even imagine, as most of us in Islamabad worry about the next red line we are told not to cross; the next big event that is not to be covered; or express horror at the next colleague to be banned from the airwaves.
And if there is any outrage or protest, the reply comes in the shape of a lecture on good or bad journalism and the difference between a good journalist and a propagandist. As if somehow, the label of a bad journalist justifies kidnapping, criminal cases, disappearances and death.
In the midst of all this, some journalists last week did remember Arshad Sharif’s death and the justice he and his family continue to be denied. As occasionally a voice is raised for Saleem Shahzad or Nazim Jokhio. The list was long before Arshad Sharif’s name was added to it and it will keep growing. But whether those in power ignore the issue or speak of it only to deflect the matter, what they don’t realise is that in the people’s imagination the culprits were identified long ago. When the truth is withheld and the facts obscured, the people’s court doesn’t wait forever to make its own judgement. These judgements have little need for an order from the Supreme Court or an inquiry commission. For ordinary people, they have already reached their decision in Arshad Sharif’s case. And it will not be easy to change their minds.

The meeting comes a day after a senior JUI-F leader said his party would march on Islamabad and organise a series of nationwide gatherings against flawed government policies.
In the meeting, the PPP leaders also emphasised joint action on national issues, such as security and stability, the economy, and electoral reforms. Both sides discussed the role of parliamentary parties regarding the Afghanistan crisis.
It may be noted that Pakis­tan and Afghanistan enga­ged in brief but intense skirmishes over the issue of cross-border terrorism. Cur­r­e­ntly, talks between the two are underway in Turkiye.
The PPP delegation included Syed Nayyar Hussain Bukhari, Humayun Khan and Jamil Soomro, while the JUI-F delegation included Maulana Asad Mahmood and Mufti Abrar.
‘No interest in JUI-F’
PTI leader Salman Akram Raja, separately, said the PTI did not see a possibility of the JUI-F supporting it for the NA opposition leader slot.
In response to a question regarding chatter of a new NA opposition leader and whether the JUI-F will support the PTI, Mr Raja said, “Cons­idering the past, I don’t think they will go with us at the end, and whether they form an alliance with the PPP or the PML-N, I cannot say anything about it, but we (PTI) don’t really have any interest in it.”

Perhaps the biggest stumbling block is the fact that the Afghan Taliban are unwilling to give ironclad guarantees that their soil will not be used by banned groups such as the TTP and the BLA to carry out acts of terrorism against this country.
Complicating matters was the fact — as related by sources — that Kabul’s rulers were “following someone else’s agenda”, an allusion to the recent bonhomie between India and the Taliban. Reportedly, the Taliban have refused to provide written assurances stating that terrorist activity from Afghanistan will stop.
 
 

Pakistan must proceed carefully. During the talks, the Afghan side has reportedly urged Pakistan to negotiate with the TTP. This should be a red line for this country as past attempts to reason with the terrorist group have given Pakistan nothing but martyred security men and civilians. Even as the talks in Turkiye were underway, TTP fighters tried to cross the border. At least five troops were martyred in these engagements. Therefore, the Taliban’s offer of arranging a dialogue with the TTP is a non-starter, as the outfit wants to impose its writ through the barrel of the gun.
It is also a fact that terrorist groups in Afghanistan have been given a veritable treasure trove in the form of billions of dollars of American arms and military hardware that the US left behind as it exited Afghanistan in 2021. Large volumes of this deadly ware have ended up in the hands of Al Qaeda and the TTP, and are being used against Pakistan.
 
 

The negotiations should continue, and it is hoped this impasse can be resolved peacefully. US President Donald Trump has offered his good offices, saying he could “get that [Pak-Afghan dispute] solved very quickly”. The US leader, who says he has prevented “eight wars”, is welcome to try his hand at Pak-Afghan diplomacy.
But on a more critical note, there can be no permanent peace until terrorist groups based in Afghanistan stop their violent anti-Pakistan campaigns. If Kabul can rein in these outfits, there would be nothing like it. But if the dialogue process goes nowhere, Pakistan must be prepared to defend its frontiers. Intelligence-based operations must be conducted to prevent militants from crossing the border, and targeting innocent Pakistanis.
If the Taliban remain unwilling to stop cross-border terrorism, then, along with using its kinetic options, Pakistan must launch a diplomatic offensive, involving regional allies such as China, the Gulf states, Iran, etc, to freeze the normalisation process with Kabul until it takes verifiable action against terrorist groups.

• Maintain Islamabad would prefer deployment to be under UN mandate; cite country’s strong track record in peacekeeping missions
• Indonesia, UAE, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Azerbaijan among nations being asked to send troops; Tel Aviv opposes deployment of Turkish forces
ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is expected to soon announce whether it will contribute troops to the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) being assembled for Gaza, officials said, amid indications that the government is leaning toward participation.
Officials familiar with the deliberations, who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter, said discussions within the government and military establishment were at an “advanced stage”.
According to them, the tone of internal consultations suggests that Islamabad is inclined to take part in the mission.
A cornerstone of the US-brokered Gaza Peace Agreement is the establishment of the ISF, composed mainly of troops from Muslim-majority countries.
 
 

The force’s mandate would include maintaining internal security, disarming Hamas, securing border crossings, and assisting with humanitarian relief and reconstruction under the supervision of a transitional Palestinian authority.
While the Trump administration has ruled out sending US soldiers into the Gaza Strip, it has been speaking to Indonesia, the UAE, Egypt, Qatar, Turkiye and Azerbaijan to contribute to the multinational force.
However, on Monday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar openly opposed Turkiye’s inclusion in the ISF, over Turk­ish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s “hostile approach against Israel”.
On Sunday, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu had said his country would decide which foreign forces to allow in Gaza, and hinted that he would be strongly opposed to any role for Turkish security forces.
According to a report in the Israeli press, members of the Israeli parliament’s Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee were told during a closed-door briefing last week that the ISF — comprising soldiers from Indonesia, Azerbaijan and Pakistan — would “be tasked with maintaining internal security and policing in Gaza, as well as assisting Israel in securing the borders and preventing weapons smuggling into the territory”.
These reports come as Army Chief Field Marshal Asim Munir visits Egypt and Jordan, two countries deeply involved in post-ceasefire developments related to Gaza.
While the military has described his visits as focused on promoting defence ties, sources said the fragile implementation of US President Donald Trump’s 20-point Gaza peace plan featured prominently in his discussions with regional leaders.
During his meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi, Field Marshal Munir praised Egypt’s pivotal role in calming tensions and achieving stability in the Middle East, according to a statement by the Egyptian presidency. He also lauded Egypt’s “tireless efforts” to end the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.
Egypt, a primary mediator alongside Qatar and the United States, hosted the pivotal Sharm el-Sheikh summit on Oct 13, where the plan’s first phase was signed.
According to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), President Sisi expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s “positive and proactive contributions” to matters of importance for the world and the Muslim ummah.
Analysts believe the army chief’s discussions in Cairo point to Pakistan’s potential involvement in the stabilisation force and the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Centre being set up to oversee the peace plan’s implementation.
In Jordan, during Field Marshal Munir’s meetings with King Abdullah II and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Maj Gen Yousef Ahmed Al-Huneiti, the Jordanian leadership acknowledged Pakistan’s “contributions toward peace and regional security,” according to ISPR.
Officials in Islamabad argue that Pakistan’s potential participation stems from both moral responsibility and diplomatic necessity. They noted that Pakistan was part of the original eight-country peace proposal conceived in late 2024, and backed by several Muslim-majority states, that formed the basis of the US-brokered Gaza peace plan finalised earlier this month.
Since the stabilisation force was a key pillar of that plan, officials said, Pakistan’s participation would signal consistency and credibility.
“We were among the ori­ginal backers of the peace architecture for Gaza. To step aside now would mean abandoning an initiative we helped shape,” said one senior official. “There’s a moral obligation, not just a political one.”
Another argument giv­en by the government circles supporting Pakistan’s inclusion in the ISF is its strong track record in int­ernational peacekeeping.
Pakistan is one of the largest troop contributors to United Nations peace missions, having deployed more than 200,000 personnel to over 40 operations across Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
Officials contend that this experience not only equips Pakistani forces to manage volatile post-conflict environments but also lends credibility and legitimacy to the ISF.
Beyond moral and operational grounds, foreign policy imperatives also underpin the government’s case for participation. Officials argue that joining the Gaza stabilisation force could strengthen Pakistan’s relations with the United States.
Islamabad’s ties with Washington have been on a gradual mend since Trump’s return to the White House, following years of friction over Afghanistan and counterterrorism. Participating in a US-supported multilateral initiative, they said, could further this thaw and open avenues for economic cooperation, defence support and regional influence.
However, officials cautioned that there is still no clarity on the legal framework for the deployment.
“Ideally, we would like this deployment to take place under a UN mandate,” an official said.
Still, such a deployment would not be without risk. Gaza remains highly volatile, and domestic opinion in Pakistan presents an additional challenge.
Many Pakistanis, deeply sympathetic to the Pales­tinian cause, may perceive participation in a US-desi­gned stabilisation mission as serving Israeli interests or even as a betrayal of Palestinian resistance. “It’s a difficult but defining choice,” said another official.

• Insiders say Haq likely to resign seeking ‘honourable exit’, sit on opposition benches
ISLAMABAD: Azad Jammu Kashmir Prime Minister Anwarul Haq’s days seem to be numbered, as the coalition partners in the federal government — the PPP and the PML-N — ratchet up pressure on the embattled premier to step down from the post, or face a no-confidence motion in the assembly.
The coalition partners met at the Presidency on Monday to discuss possible options for the formation of the AJK government to be led by the PPP. The PML-N panel, led by Ahsan Iqbal and comprising Rana Sanaullah and Amir Muqam, called on President Zardari to discuss the AJK affairs with the PPP in light of the current situation.
Talking to reporters after the meeting, PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal said his party would support the no-trust motion against the AJK PM but would not become part of the government. He said the PPP will form the government after the success of the no-confidence motion, while they would sit on the opposition benches.
PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah said the PML-N’s parliamentary party has expressed distrust over the incumbent AJK government. He said the current AJK government failed to perform its duties, adding that free and fair elections would be held in the region after completion of the AJK assembly’s term next year.
 
 

“The incumbent government has become a problem itself instead of a problem-solver,” PPP’s Qamar Zaman Kaira said. Mr Kaira slammed PM Haq’s administration and said political stability in AJK was the need of the hour.
He also welcomed the PML-N’s decision, which further strengthened the PPP’s position to oust the sitting premier. Mr Kaira said that both sides respected each other’s decisions as they aimed to bring political stability to the region.
Numbers game
The PPP has 27 members in the AJK Legislative Assembly after 10 lawmakers joined the party on Sunday, and with the PML-N’s backing, it has garnered the support of at least 36 lawmakers to oust the incumbent premier. The PPP also claims Sardar Atiq of the Muslim Conference and Sardar Hasan Ibrahim of the Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party will also support it.
The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members. In light of this situation, sources said the incumbent PM was advised to opt for an “honourable exit” as he had lost the support of the majority.
With the PPP having 27 members in the house, he has three options: dissolve the assembly to prevent the party from coming to power, step down, or face a no-trust vote.
The final decision, however, will be taken today (Tuesday), but the premier is likely to step down, the source added. He also dispelled the impression that the PM was waiting for the announcement of a nominee for the coveted slot in the hope that such a decision would polarise the alliance against him.
The source further said that PM Haq and his six associates would sit on the opposition benches after he quits.

By late evening, officials said a final agreement still remained elusive.
Sources familiar with the closed-door discussions said that while “most of the points had been mutually agreed between the two sides”, the mechanism for verifiable action against terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory continued to be the main sticking point.
“We kept hoping that we would be able to sign a mutual document with Afgha­nistan soon, followed by a joint statement, but it still remains out of our reach,” one source said, sounding dejected, yet unwilling to abandon hope.

Mechanism for verifiable action against terrorists operating from Afghan soil remains main issue between Islamabad and Kabul

The atmosphere early in the day had been markedly positive. Participants des­c­­ribed “encouraging progress” and “serious engagement” from both delegations.
As the day wore on and talks stretched into the evening, optimism began to fade. “It is a difficult phase,” a source admitted, reflecting the growing sense of frustration within the room.
By nightfall, it appeared that the process had once again hit a roadblock. According to the participants, the Afghan Taliban delegation continued to resist putting anything in writing, particularly on the issue of providing verifiable guarantees to end support for the outlawed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
“The hosts understand Pakistan’s concerns,” one Pakistani official said, “but people in Kabul and Kandahar are not willing to commit.”
This hesitation has left the Pakistani side increasingly frustrated. “Pakistan’s principled stance has been clear from the outset,” a security source said. “The Taliban must end their patronage of the TTP and prevent Afghan territory from being used for terrorism against Pakistan.”
The source added that despite “some negative and external influences” — a reference to India, Pakistan and the mediating countries remained “sincere and serious” in their efforts to move the dialogue toward a positive outcome.
The tone at the start of Monday’s proceedings contrasted sharply with the pessimism that followed Sunday’s session, when Pakistani officials told reporters that Islamabad had presented its final position to the Taliban delegation — a statement widely interpreted in local media as signalling the possible collapse of the talks.
In contrast to those reports, members of the Afghan negotiating team had on Sunday night and Monday morning continued to express optimism.
They maintained that the dialogue in Istanbul could still yield results, describing the remaining disagreements as “few” and “resolvable”.
“The Afghan side has made it clear that tensions benefit no one,” one member of the delegation said. “We are hopeful that these talks will produce a positive outcome.”
Mediators from Turkiye and Qatar were said to share this sentiment, stressing the importance of maintaining engagement and preventing the process from unraveling.
Despite the lingering stalemate, diplomatic sources described Monday’s session as “not without significance”.
“Even if the talks didn’t produce a breakthrough, the fact that both sides stayed engaged for three straight days is important,” one mediator said. “It shows that neither wants the process to collapse.”
By late evening, negotiators in Istanbul were weighing whether to extend discussions into a fourth day.

“Flood-related supply disruptions and temporary border closures have put upward pressure on prices of a few essential commodities”, said the Ministry of Finance (MoF) in its Monthly Economic Update & Outlook – October 2025. However, it claimed inflation would remain in the target range of 5-6pc this month, which had already reached 5.6pc in September, against the MoF’s forecast of 3.5-4.5pc made on Sept 30.
The MoF said net federal revenues surged by 231.4pc to Rs3.27 trillion in the first two months (July-August) of FY26, compared to Rs986.7 billion in the same period last year. This was driven by a 721.1pc jump in non-tax revenues and a 14.1pc rise in FBR tax collections.
“The surge in non-tax revenues was mainly led by higher State Bank of Pakistan profits, supplemented by increased receipts from dividends, defence receipts, Windfall Levy against crude oil, the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess, and the petroleum levy. During July-Sep FY26, FBR’s tax collection rose to Rs2.884tr, up 12.5pc.

Finance ministry warns of inflation from supply disruptions, trade hurdles

On the expenditure side, total outlays increased modestly by 7.6pc to Rs1.76tr. “Consequently, the federal fiscal balance recorded a surplus of Rs1.509tr, compared to a deficit of Rs648.8bn last year. The primary balance also improved sharply, posting a surplus of Rs2.939tr, up from Rs49.4bn in the corresponding period”, it said.
It said the climate shocks weighed on agriculture, but the sector showed early signs of resilience. According to a preliminary assessment, the recent flood has caused Rs430bn losses to the agriculture sector, damaging crops like rice, cotton, sugarcane, maise, fodder and vegetables. “Nevertheless, recent indicators suggest that recovery efforts are underway, supported by increased agricultural credit, higher machinery imports, and improved fertiliser off-take”, it said.
On the other hand, the MoF hoped for improved export prospects, driven by stronger economic momentum in Pakistan’s export destinations. “The Composite Leading Indicator position of the US, UK, China and the euro area has further strengthened compared to the last month, with all moving above or near their long-term potential levels, signalling improved export prospects for Pakistan”, it said.
The monthly report said Pakistan’s economy maintained its recovery path despite flood-related disruptions. “Industrial activity remains resilient, supported by a rebound in Large-Scale Manufacturing, particularly in cement, automobiles, and allied sectors, while exports and remittances are showing steady improvement”, it said, adding the external sector remained stable, with a current account surplus recorded in September, amid robust remittance inflows.
It highlighted the successful IMF review under the Extended Fund Facility and the Resilience and Sustainability Facility, noting that it reaffirmed confidence in Pakistan’s reform trajectory and prudent macroeconomic management. “Continued progress in privatisation, digital governance, and CPEC Phase 2.0 joint ventures underscores the government’s commitment to fiscal consolidation, structural transformation, and sustainable, inclusive growth”, the report added.
The MoF said the government would remain firmly committed to maintaining fiscal discipline and providing targeted social protection within a sound and forward-looking macroeconomic policy framework.

Barrister Mian Ali Ashfaq told Dawn.com the six were “taken into FIA custody and arrested on charges of misuse of authority and bribery”.
He said they would be produced in a district court on Tuesday and he would represent them.
Ashfaq said the six were Additional Director Chaudhry Sarfraz, In-charge Zawar, Sub-Inspector Ali Raza, Assistant Director Shoaib Riaz, Yasir Gujjar and Mujtaba Kamran.
Chaudhry was reportedly removed over different controversies last month and asked to report to the NCCIA headquarters, Islamabad. He said he was transferred to the headquarters and he had sought a six-month leave.
The three controversies were about laying hands on a number of YouTubers/social media influencers, including Saadur Rehman, popularly known as Ducky Bhai and Rajab Butt, for their alleged involvement in unregulated online trading and online gambling apps.
The other was the registration of a case against some lawyers who allegedly tried to get a suspect released from the NCCIA. The third controversy related to a tiff between a group of Lahore’s journalists and a serving deputy inspector general of police and some other police officials, as the former moved the NCCIA to act against the latter. According to an official, Chaudhry was transferred in light of different complaints against him.
On Friday, the Islamabad High Court had granted the police one more week to trace missing NCCIA Deputy Director Muhammad Usman, who has been missing for several days. The development came during the hearing of a petition filed by Rozina Usman for the recovery of her husband. She alleged that four armed individuals abducted her husband on October 14.
The court was also informed that the petitioner had herself gone missing after initiating the case. The development had prompted the court to seek an updated report from the police on both disappearances.</p><small>2025-10-27 19:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630802-govt-mulls-reviewing-18th-amendment-to-address-governance-challenges-minister' target='_blank'><strong>Govt mulls reviewing 18th Amendment to address governance challenges: minister</strong></a><br><p>

The meeting was co-chaired by Federal Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik and Bangladesh Finance Adviser Dr Salehuddin Ahmed.
At the conclusion of the session, both sides signed the Agreed Minutes of the 9th JEC, reflecting “significant progress” in multiple areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment and industries, agriculture, transport and communications, education, information technology, banking, health, tourism, energy, climate change, information and broadcasting, and the textile sector.
The two sides emphasised the importance of enhancing cooperation between the national shipping corporations, with Pakistan offering the use of Karachi Port Trust as a gateway for Bangladeshs’s trade with regional countries, including China and the Central Asian States.
The two countries also agreed to work actively toward establishing direct air connectivity, recognising its vital role in promoting tourism and business exchanges.
A significant development during the session was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation in Halal Trade between the Pakistan Halal Authority and the Bangladesh Standards and Testing Institute, paving the way for enhanced collaboration in standardisation and certification of Halal products.
Pakistan also highlighted the establishment of the Pakistan-Bangladesh Knowledge Corridor, which includes an offer of 500 new and fully funded scholarships for Bangladeshi students.
Furthermore, the delegation said Pakistan has increased the number of training slots under the Pakistan Technical Assistance Programme from five to 25.
Both sides agreed to cooperate in the areas of medical and religious tourism, and to promote greater cultural exchanges between the two countries.
It was decided to organise the inaugural meeting of the Joint Working Group on Trade. It was also discussed to establish joint working groups in key sectors such as maritime affairs, and information technology, which will hold regular meetings to ensure sustained progress.
The two sides agreed to explore a concessionary trade arrangement and reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening trade, agricultural and industrial cooperation to promote sustainable and inclusive growth in both countries.
The 9th JEC concluded in a “spirit of friendship and mutual respect, reaffirming the shared commitment of Pakistan and Bangladesh to further deepen bilateral relations and regional economic integration”.
Malik thanked the government of Bangladesh and the finance adviser for the hospitality extended to him and his delegation during the visit.</p><small>2025-10-27 18:31</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/27223838e1b64c9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951590/can-donald-trump-serve-a-third-term-as-us-president' target='_blank'><strong>Can Donald Trump serve a third term as US president?</strong></a><br><p>President Donald Trump on Monday declined to dismiss speculation that he would seek a third term and said he hadn’t considered whether he would go to court to contest the US constitution’s two-term limit for presidents.
Here is a look at the legal barriers Trump faces.
What does the US constitution say?
The 22nd Amendment states in part: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.”
The amendment was ratified in 1951 after President Franklin D. Roosevelt broke with a self-imposed two-term limit set by presidents since George Washington, the nation’s first.
Roosevelt, a Democrat who was president during the Great Depression and World War Two, served a third term and then died months into his fourth term in 1945.
Wayne Unger, a law professor at Quinnipiac University, said the Constitution was clear that presidents are limited to two terms of four years each. He said that while that had not been tested in court, any challenge by Trump would likely be unsuccessful.
“I would predict the Supreme Court to say nope, it’s clear, two terms of four years each, Donald Trump, you cannot run for a third,” said Unger, who teaches constitutional law.
Can Trump’s allies change the constitution?
Yes, but that is highly unlikely in an era of intense political polarisation between Democrats and Trump’s Republican Party.
Any constitutional amendment would require two-thirds support in the House and Senate or a convention called by two-thirds of the states, and then ratification by 38 of the 50 state legislatures.
Republicans hold a razor-thin 219-213 majority in the House and a 53-47 majority in the Senate. Republicans control 28 state legislatures.
Andy Ogles, a Republican US representative from Tennessee and a strong Trump supporter, in January proposed amending the 22nd Amendment to allow people to serve three non-consecutive terms as president.
Since Trump’s terms beginning in 2017 and in 2025 were non-consecutive, the amendment, if passed, would allow him to serve a third term starting in 2029.
Could Trump run as vice president?
Trump dismissed on Monday the idea that he could run as vice president and then have the candidate for president resign after taking office, which would return Trump to the presidency.
“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew to Tokyo from Malaysia.
But he added: “I think the people wouldn’t like that. It’s too cute.”
However, Trump is barred from running for vice president because he is not eligible to be president.
The 12th Amendment to the US Constitution reads, “No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice-President of the United States.”</p><small>2025-10-27 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/271655107432e9f.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951573/trump-dismisses-2028-vp-run-as-too-cute-leaves-door-open-to-third-term' target='_blank'><strong>Trump dismisses 2028 VP run as ‘too cute,’ leaves door open to third term</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Monday ruled out running for vice president in the 2028 election but declined to definitively say he would not seek a third term, keeping alive speculation about how he might seek to extend his time in office.
Trump has repeatedly flirted with the idea of serving beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms, joking about it at rallies and teasing supporters with “Trump 2028” hats. Some allies have taken those signals seriously, suggesting that they are exploring legal or political pathways to make it happen — a possibility dismissed by most constitutional scholars.
The 22nd amendment to the US constitution bars anyone from being elected to the presidency a third time.
Some supporters have suggested that one way around the prohibition would be for Trump to run as vice president, while another candidate stood for election as president and resigned, letting Trump again assume the presidency.
“I’d be allowed to do that,” Trump said today in an exchange with reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew from Malaysia to Tokyo.
But he added: “I wouldn’t do that. I think it’s too cute. Yeah, I would rule that out because it’s too cute. I think the people wouldn’t like that. It’s too cute. It’s not — it wouldn’t be right.”
 


Scholars say Trump is barred from running for vice president because he is not eligible to be president.
The 12th amendment to the US constitution reads, “No person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice-president of the United States.”
‘I have my best numbers ever’
Referring to the possibility of a third term, Trump said: “I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever.”
When pressed by a reporter whether he was not ruling out a third term, he said, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean you’ll have to tell me.”
Asked about whether he would be willing to fight in court over the legality of another presidential bid, Trump responded, “I haven’t really thought about it.”
Trump, 79, would be 82 in 2028 if he sought another term, which would make him the oldest US president in history. Despite his age, he has maintained a rigorous public schedule, frequently engaging with reporters even during long international trips, underscoring his stamina and active involvement in daily presidential duties.
Throughout the 2024 campaign, Trump made former president Joe Biden’s advanced age a focal point, often highlighting verbal and physical missteps as evidence that his Democratic rival was too old to effectively lead the country.
Trump also said Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio were “great people” who could seek the presidency in 2028.
“I think if they ever formed a group, it’d be unstoppable,” he said. “I really do. I believe that.”
Rubio, standing behind Trump in the plane cabin, chuckled and bowed his head sheepishly as Trump predicted a bright political future for him and nodded when Trump brought up Vance.
Trump’s statements about a third term have muddied the Republican Party’s future, with jockeying already under way among potential Republican successors even as some Trump allies back the idea of him remaining in office.
In an interview last week with The Economist, Steve Bannon, the pro-Trump podcaster who briefly served as Trump’s White House chief strategist in his first term, said there was a plan to circumvent the 22nd amendment and suggested he was involved in developing it.
“Trump is going to be president in ’28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,” Bannon said. “At the appropriate time, we’ll lay out what the plan is. But there is a plan.”
He added that Trump was an “instrument of divine will”, echoing language Trump himself has occasionally used.</p><small>2025-10-27 17:33</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/272213400aa23fc.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951589/pakistan-look-to-bounce-back-from-asia-cup-hurt-in-south-africa-t20is' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan look to bounce back from Asia Cup hurt in South Africa T20Is</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan’s build-up towards next year’s T20 World Cup will continue on Tuesday when they take on South Africa in the opener of the three-match series at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.
The national side goes into the series after faring decently in their biggest test at the Asia Cup last month — beating all sides they came up against except world number one and archrivals India, who handed them defeats in all three encounters including the final.
South Africa, in contrast, arrive as a depleted outfit on paper — the presence of star batter Quinton de Kock, featuring in a Twenty20 International for the first time since June 2024, standing out in a largely second-string squad led by Donovan Ferreira, who has just nine T20Is to his name.
Hence, Pakistan can be safely called favourites to take the series trophy, which would help restore their damaged confidence following the triple-drubbing from India.
 






The hosts too haven’t shied away from striking a balance between experimentation and experience. Former skipper Babar Azam has returned to the T20I ranks following a four-month absence, while Fakhar Zaman waits in the reserves.
“He’s a world-class player,” Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha said of Babar in the pre-series press conference on the eve of the match. “His presence always benefits the team. He’s played over a hundred T20s, led Pakistan many times, and scored heavily. His experience will strengthen our batting line-up.”
Pacer Naseem Shah, who missed both the tri-nation series and the Asia Cup, is also set to make his comeback. Uncapped spinner Usman Tariq and exciting middle-order batter Abdul Samad have been drafted in as part of Pakistan’s search for depth and flexibility ahead of the global showpiece next year.
Pakistan have also axed Mohammad Haris, despite the team management previously backing the wicket-keeper batter before he fell out of favour to make way for Usman Khan. The decision has raised concerns of inconsistent selection.
 






“We were looking for a wicket-keeper-batter who can play in the middle order, especially against spin,” Salman said, defending Usman’s inclusion. “Even though his international record isn’t great yet, you must’ve seen in the PSL that he bats well against spin in middle overs. We needed that kind of player who can both keep wickets and handle spin in that phase.”
Pakistan have undergone a T20I revamp since the appointment of Mike Hesson as the side’s white-ball head coach in June, with an increased emphasis on strike-rates under the New Zealander. Hard-hitting has been a central theme of their approach in the 21 matches under Hesson so far.
But with the strategy largely failing to yield consistent results, there is a growing realisation that a more adaptable approach is needed.
“Given the kind of conditions we’ve been playing in, we need batters who can build innings and rotate strike, and then accelerate when required,” Salman said. “Middle-overs batting against spin is another key area. We need to improve strike rotation there, and we’ve worked on that during our recent camp.”
 






The pitch at Rawalpindi is expected to be a batting paradise, which could also allow South Africa to challenge Pakistan with big totals and put the hosts under pressure.
For the visitors, too, the series offers an opportunity to fine-tune their combination ahead of the T20 World Cup.
“It is important to build up toward the World Cup,” Ferreira said. “I think this is the big stepping stone for us toward the World Cup.”
Ferreira was named skipper after veteran batter David Miller was ruled out due to injury. Gerald Coetzee and Kwena Maphaka have also missed out through fitness issues, while the Proteas have rested regular T20I captain Aiden Markram, batters Tristan Stubbs and Ryan Rickelton, and spearhead Kagiso Rabada.

Mir, who was associated with Metro News television, was heading home in a car driven by his elder brother last month when six assailants riding two motorcycles fired a volley of bullets on his vehicle on the National Highway. The anchorperson sustained multiple bullet wounds and was taken to a private hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries.
Journalists had strongly condemned the inaction by the police for failing to arrest the attackers and demanded their immediate arrest. Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, many members of his cabinet and leaders of political parties had expressed their sorrow, with CM Shah directing the inspector general of police (IG) to immediately arrest the killers.
Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hassan Lanjar, IG Ghulam Nabi Memon and Additional IG Javed Alam Odho held a press conference today on updates regarding the case.
“Four people have been arrested in the murder of journalist Imtiaz Mir,” Lanjar said, adding that a joint operation was carried out by the Karachi police and a federal intelligence agency.
“The culprits belong to a banned organisation that used to take instructions from abroad,” he added.
Lanjar termed it a breakthrough in the murder case, adding that the bike used in the attack was also recovered.
The home minister said that Mir had given an interview in which he talked in “favour of Israel”, adding that it appeared to be “an exact motive” of the murder.
He said a sub-organisation of the proscribed Zainabiyoun Brigade was involved in the case.
Lanjar added that the primary suspect lived in a neighboring country, without specifying who he was referring to. The home minister alleged that the neighboring country was “providing funding and spreading chaos” in Pakistan.
Mir’s brother Riaz Ali had registered a case under Sections 34 (common intention) and 324 (attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code at the Saudabad police station, nominating a man and his sons for the attack.
The complainant said that the attack was carried out at the behest of Umer Daraz and his two sons — Ahmed Bux and Aftab — with whom they had a land dispute in their native town in Jacobabad.
Saudabad Station House Officer Ateequr Rehman had told Dawn that both parties belonged to the same tribe. He recalled that the late anchorperson had also lodged an FIR against the same suspects at the Shah Latif Town police in 2023.
According to a report published last month by the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (CHRI), 87 journalists were killed in Pakistan between 2006 and 2023, with only two of those cases “resolved”.</p><small>2025-10-27 17:16</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630797-pml-n-ppp-join-hands-in-bid-to-oust-ajk-pm-anwarul-haq' target='_blank'><strong>PML-N, PPP join hands in bid to oust AJK PM Anwarul Haq</strong></a><br><p>

A new study involving DNA extracted from the teeth of 13 French soldiers who were buried in a mass grave in Lithuania’s capital Vilnius along the route of the retreat is offering a deeper understanding of the misery the Grande Armée experienced, detecting two pathogens not previously documented in this event.
The discovery of the bacteria that cause paratyphoid fever and louse-borne relapsing fever showed, alongside previous work, that several infections had circulated among soldiers already enfeebled by cold, hunger and exhaustion.
The Vilnius site, discovered in 2001, contains the remains of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers from Napoleon’s army.
“Vilnius was a key waypoint on the 1812 retreat route. Many soldiers arrived exhausted, starving and ill. A substantial number died there and were interred rapidly in mass graves,” said molecular biologist and geneticist Nicolás Rascovan, head of the microbial paleogenomics unit at the Institut Pasteur in Paris and senior author of the study published in the journal Current Biology.
“While cold, starvation and typhus have long been emphasised, our results show that paratyphoid fever and louse-borne relapsing fever were also present and may have contributed to debilitation and mortality,” Rascovan added.
Paratyphoid fever typically is food- or water-borne, with symptoms including fever, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhoea or constipation, weakness and sometimes a rash. The form of relapsing fever detected is transmitted by body lice and causes episodes of recurring high fever, with headache, muscle pain and weakness.
In the study, four of the 13 soldiers tested positive for the paratyphoid fever bacterium and two for the relapsing fever bacterium. The symptoms of the two ailments match those described in historical accounts of the retreat.
A 2006 study involving DNA from 35 other soldiers from the same cemetery detected the pathogens behind typhus and trench fever, diseases that cause symptoms similar to those of paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever. The new study did not detect typhus and trench fever.
Napoleon led the Grande Armée on an invasion of Russia in 1812 and marched into Moscow, but the campaign unravelled and he was forced to retreat thanks to factors including dwindling supplies, counter-attacks and the onset of the brutal Russian winter.
The new findings add nuance to the story of the plight of the French emperor’s soldiers, pointing to a scenario not of a single or a couple of ailments in circulation but rather a high prevalence of various infectious diseases. The study does not quantify the overall impact of the newly identified pathogens or establish them as widespread across the entire army, but it helps explain the medical complexity of the retreat.
“Ancient DNA lets us put names to infections that symptom-based accounts alone cannot resolve. The co-occurrence of pathogens with different transmission routes underscores how dire sanitary conditions were,” Rascovan said. “Future work across more sites and individuals will refine the disease landscape of 1812.”
The study illustrates how the steadily improving science of ancient DNA analysis can provide new insight into historical events.
“Ancient DNA allows us to test historical hypotheses directly, adding evidence that can confirm or complicate narratives built from chronicles and symptoms,” Rascovan said.
“With careful authentication, genomics reveals which pathogens were present, how they evolved and persisted, and how they spread — helping historians and scientists reconstruct complex crises with greater resolution.”

“We came here to study, not to fight for basic justice,” read a yellow placard, the only one visible in the sea of protesters, all of whom were students. The demonstration, touted as one of its kind in the university’s three-decade-long history, created a storm on social media, with some terming it the ‘power of Gen Z’.
The phrase, which echoed across the world a couple of times this year, soon manifested: days after the protest, the university reinstated the female student, who had been expelled after she attempted to file a harassment complaint against a staff member.
The reinstatement was announced minutes before a larger protest was scheduled to take place outside the varsity today, in anticipation of which the institution had been shut for a week — something students say has never happened before, come rain, floods or even war.
“The Institute of Business Management has decided to reinstate the concerned student with immediate effect. This decision has been taken in the best interest of all stakeholders and to uphold the principles and values that IoBM has built and maintained over the past three decades,” the statement read.
“The decision was taken to prevent the situation from being aggravated any further,” the varsity’s spokesperson told Dawn.com.
Coming together
It all began on the night of October 22, with a Facebook post. A female student, enrolled in the Bachelor’s of Business Administration (BBA) programme, wrote in an unofficial IOBM students group on Facebook how she was harassed by a staff member from the transport department inside the university premises when she visited his office to collect her student card.
According to the student, when the matter was brought up with the administration, they blamed her, claiming that she and her family misbehaved with the university management, and used it as grounds to expel her from the institution.
When in reality, the student claimed in the post, it was her family that was misbehaved with.
For his part, the spokesperson of the university said that the student was expelled over the family’s misconduct after a disciplinary meeting was called. “But she did have a right to appeal.”
Meanwhile, the victim’s Facebook post spread quickly, reaching students across semesters and programmes. “Students voluntarily began demanding protests,” A*, a student at the varsity, told Dawn.com. The next day, at 12:30pm, the demonstration took place.
“And so many people showed up, it almost felt surreal,” she said.
Among the sea of people who were in attendance was also B*, a final year student, who was a stranger to the complainant. “I didn’t even know her name until then, but what I did know was that what had happened to her was wrong,” she said.
 






B* recalled how she was among the crowd of students who walked to the CBM building that day. There was an energy in the air, but also fear. “When we got to the entrance, members of the administration stood there, warning us of consequences.” Some students gave in and left, others held their ground.
In due course, the crowd swelled. Soon, B* found herself in the front row. “I remember when I looked back, I could see a whole raft of students; it looked like the entire university had come out.”
C*, another student from the BBA programme, expressed similar sentiments. “We all stood together peacefully, our voice unified and one,” he said.
The protest continued for an hour, until prominent members of the varsity — faculty members and even the university’s president — were forced to step out and promise the students that the matter would be looked into, A* told Dawn.com.
They were further reassured that the staff member who was accused of harassment had been fired. The same was also confirmed by the varsity in its Oct 26 statement: “[…] a transport personnel, who worked for the external transport contractor and not employed by IoBM, was immediately removed from duty and will no longer be assigned to IoBM by the transport contractor.”
‘We won’
“At the time, we were genuinely hopeful that the right decision would be taken,” A* recounted.
However, later the same day, students received an email from the management, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, stating that it had been decided to reinstate the student in the Spring 2026 semester, “subject to adherence to institutional policies and expected standards of conduct by the student”.
It further said that during the reporting of the incident, the “student and her family members engaged in aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members of the administration, including harassment of two senior female employees”.
“Their conduct resulted in disruption on campus. After a thorough review conducted under IoBM’s code of conduct and institutional policies, disciplinary action was taken based solely on her behaviour and not on the student’s original complaint,” it added.
The complainant denied these allegations.
The email, on the other hand, incensed the students, said B*. Other students Dawn.com spoke to agreed.
“Why was she forced to waste her semester? She had already paid the fee? Why was she being punished for being harassed?” C* questioned. Thus, a second protest was announced outside the administration building, set to be held at 12:30pm today.
But the students received an email on Oct 26 that the management had decided to move classes online for a week to “avoid disruption to academic activities due to the upcoming midterm examinations”.
“In all my years here, this has rarely ever happened,” said A*. She recalled that the varsity had never closed this way before, not even when former prime minister “Imran Khan was arrested” or during the rains. Meanwhile, the IoBM spokesperson told Dawn.com that moving classes online was not a new decision; instead, it dated back to the Covid-19 days.
While this shocked the students, it didn’t faze them, and they decided to continue with their plan. “If not inside the university, we would hold a protest outside it,” B* said. Right when she was leaving her house today, though, the students got yet another email.
This one read that a decision had been taken to reinstate the student with immediate effect.
“We got the email at 11:45pm,” C* said. “We won, finally.”
Need for reforms
While for Gen Z, this is yet another victory, for the rest, the incident reflects yet another instance of the absence of proper mechanisms to address harassment complaints.
“What ensued was a standoff between the university’s management and its students — ending only when sustained student protests forced the administration to withdraw its unreasonable demands,” said Jibran Nasir, human rights activist and lawyer, who had been following the case closely.
“This, however, is not a lasting solution,” he told Dawn.com. “Not every victim will have the strength to endure intimidation and coercion without justice.”
Therefore, the real issue remains the harassment itself, which the university failed to investigate and address, he said, adding that reinstating the student, though necessary, does not resolve the larger question of campus safety.
“From threats and conditional reinstatement to campus shutdowns and now unconditional reversal, this episode demonstrates the power of collective student action. It proves that reform cannot rely solely on policies or laws — institutions often remain apathetic until confronted by unified student resistance.
“IoBM must learn from this and strengthen its internal procedures for the safety of students on campus. More broadly, this case underscores the urgent need for functional and independent student unions to protect student rights,” Nasir added.
For his part, the IoBM spokesperson said that the varsity had decided to work on SOPs to enhance its harassment policies so that no such incident would take place ever again.
He insisted that the university has a policy on “Protection Against Sexual Harassment”. It remains unclear, however, how aware the student body is of the existence of the said policy.
“All we know of is a harassment complaint box that is kept at the entrance of the CBM building,” said A*. “It is almost always empty.”

A statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said the army chief is currently on an official visit to Jordan and called on the Jordanian king for a meeting, with Crown Prince Hussein bin Abdullah II also present.
The ISPR said both dignitaries discussed matters of mutual interest, with a particular focus on enhancing bilateral cooperation in defence and security, and exchanging perspectives on regional developments.
“His majesty appreciated the professionalism and contributions of the Pakistan Armed Forces towards regional peace and stability and expressed his desire to further strengthen defence collaboration between the two brotherly countries,” the ISPR said, adding that the army chief conveyed warm regards from Pakistan’s people, government and military.
He also reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to deepening fraternal ties with with the Hashemite kingdom.
 






During the visit, COAS Munir also called on Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Jordan Armed Forces Major General Yousef Ahmed Al-Huneiti at the General Headquarters, Amman, where he was welcomed and presented with a guard of honour on his arrival.
“During the visit, both dignitaries reaffirmed the deep-rooted and historic ties between the Armed Forces of Pakistan and Jordan. Major General Yousef Ahmed Al-Huneiti also acknowledged Pakistan Armed Forces’ remarkable contributions towards peace and regional security,” the ISPR said.
The army chief visited Jordan after touring Egypt. He and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Saturday stressed the need for stronger strategic coordination and broader cooperation in security, technology and the economy.
The meeting came amid a broader push by both countries to upgrade ties.
Field Marshal Munir had also met senior defence officials on Fri­d­­ay, where he reaffirmed Pakis­tan’s commitment to closer defe­nce and military cooperation.</p><small>2025-10-27 13:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/271548481ba4ee1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951570/govt-hails-nepras-move-to-slash-kes-tariff-says-it-will-reduce-additional-burden-on-taxpayers' target='_blank'><strong>Govt hails Nepra’s move to slash KE’s tariff, says it will ‘reduce additional burden on taxpayers’</strong></a><br><p>The government on Monday hailed the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority’s (Nepra) recent decision to slash K-Electric’s multi-year tariff, saying it will reduce the “additional burden on taxpayers” and that the move was not against the interests of Karachi’s power consumers.
Last week, Nepra reduced KE’s multi-year tariff for the fiscal year 2023-24 by Rs7.6 per unit, from Rs39.97 to Rs32.37. KE warned that the move will have “far-reaching consequences for its stakeholders, including consumers”.
Shares of KE, Pakistan’s only privatised and foreign-owned electricity utility, plunged on the stock exchange following the tariff cut, as investors sold heavily. According to a Dawn report, KE’s foreign owners are threatening to take the government to an international litigation forum. Analysts have warned that the tariff revision and regulatory uncertainty could hurt the company’s finances.
In a subsequent statement today, the Ministry of Energy’s Power Division termed those opinions a “malicious campaign”.
 
 

It said certain elements were unfortunately presenting the Nepra decision in a “distorted and misleading manner, attempting to create the false impression that the decision is against the interests of electricity consumers in Karachi”.
“The reality is exactly the opposite,” the Power Division asserted.
The Power Division spokesperson clarified that Nepra’s review in this matter was primarily related to KE’s administrative and operational affairs.
The statement read: “As a result of Nepra’s decision, the additional burden on taxpayers will be reduced, and K-Electric will be incentivised to cut losses instead of passing them on.
“Previously, due to inefficiencies, K-Electric was effectively compensated with billions of rupees in subsidies, financed through the national budget. This revised determination will help reduce that unnecessary annual fiscal burden.”
 






The Power Division highlighted that the regulator’s review “removes the unfair disparity” that existed between KE and public-sector distribution companies (Discos). “K-Electric must now undertake administrative reforms and demonstrate operational improvement to control its inefficiencies.”
The statement assured citizens: “There is no risk of load-shedding in Karachi arising from the retirement of loss-making or idle generation plants, because cheaper and sufficient electricity is already available in the national grid, and the infrastructure to deliver this power to Karachi consumers is in place.”
In its statement, the Power Division highlighted that before the Nepra review decision, KE had the ability to pass on “non-recovered dues to the public, effectively converting its inefficiencies into an additional burden on taxpayers”.
 
 

“Under the new framework, this will no longer be permissible. Only those receivables which K-Electric can prove — with evidence — to be genuinely unrecoverable despite all reasonable efforts will be considered by Nepra.
“K-Electric will no longer be able to unilaterally include arbitrary amounts in the per-unit cost of electricity for Karachi consumers without proof. Is this not a protective measure in favour of consumers?” the Power Division said.
Today, K-Electric Limited’s share value rose by 3.38 per cent compared to yesterday to stand at Rs5.81, Pakistan Stock Exchange’s data portal showed, marking the first increase since October 16 when it was Rs7.70.
KE consumers will continue to benefit from subsidies
The Power Division spokesperson explained that KE was currently drawing approximately 2,000 megawatts of electricity from the national grid, and “may draw even more in the future”. “This power sourced from the national grid is cheaper than the electricity generated by K-Electric’s own plants.”
The spokesperson noted that KE consumers were already being charged the same per-unit tariff that applies to consumers in other parts of the country. “Now, if K-Electric’s own internal costs are rationalised and reduced, will that become a reason to increase the per-unit tariff for consumers — or will it help maintain uniform national rates for Karachi consumers as well?
“Is that not a positive outcome for the people of Karachi?” the spokesperson rhetorically asked.
According to the Power Division, KE consumers — “like all other electricity consumers in Pakistan — will continue to benefit from subsidies, because uniform national tariffs remain in place”.
 
 

“However, this subsidy will no longer be allowed to turn into profit for K-Electric merely due to inefficiency or failure to reduce its losses. Preventing public-sector subsidy from being converted into private gain is a national responsibility.”
The Power Division noted that KE was a private-sector entity and therefore was expected to “demonstrate performance superior” to that of public-sector Discos.
However, compared to KE, the Discos of Islamabad (Iesco), Faisalabad (Fesco) and Gujranwala (Gepco) were “ahead in critical areas, including recovery of dues, reduction of line losses, and quality of service to consumers”, the statement added.
‘No entity will be able to extract unjustified profits from public’
The Power Division spokesperson asserted that the Nepra review was “critically important in terms of keeping K-Electric’s profit within a reasonable and justified limit”.
Terming the Nepra review a “landmark for the country’s regulatory framework”, the Power Division said it will also have “long-term positive effects”.
“Going forward, no entity will be able to extract unverified or unjustified profits from the public, and regulators will continue to uphold the law and protect the interests of citizens,” it declared.
The statement noted that KE had “increased its draw of electricity from the national grid, which should lead to a reduction in its monthly fuel costs”. “At the same time, Nepra has also decided to exclude those K-Electric generation plants that are currently non-operational, so that capacity-related charges from idle plants are not unfairly passed on to consumers through the per-unit tariff.”
 
 

The Power Division recalled that the government had begun a similar exercise with its own generation plants, which “helped lower the per-unit cost to consumers and eliminate unnecessary expenditure”. “If Nepra now directs that idle plants be removed from the system and their costs not be recovered from the public, is that not in the direct interest of the citizens of Karachi?” it asked.
The statement highlighted that KE’s allowed return on its invested capital ranged between 24pc and 30pc, adding that this return was linked to the US dollar.
“Under the revised framework, the dollar indexation has been terminated, as K-Electric’s assets exist in Pakistan, are denominated in Pakistani rupees, and are associated with the domestic capital market. In addition, it has now been made possible to further reduce the rate of return on K-Electric’s own plants in the same manner as in the case of re-negotiation of power purchase agreements with other independent power producers (IPPs) in the country.”
 
 

The Power Division noted that an independent consultant appointed by KE’s own Board conducted a study and allowed up to 6.5pc in losses to be built into consumer bills. The same consultant also disclosed that KE’s management “failed to sufficiently reduce losses despite incurring heavy expenditure”, according to the statement.
“In light of these disclosures, Nepra has moved to reduce the recognised loss levels. Has Nepra not acted in the public interest by doing so? The public can judge for itself,” the Power Division said.
The multi-year tariff cut
On May 27, Nepra had approved KE’s request to incorporate unrecovered bills into its consumer tariff. It set KE’s base tariff at Rs39.97 per unit for FY2023-24, which was almost 40pc higher than even the national average tariff of about Rs28 per unit in 2025-26 for the 10 public sector Discos in the country.
The next day, the Power Division announced its decision to challenge the Nepra determinations for being against the interests of the government, consumers and taxpayers.
 
 

Last week, on a set of review motions filed by the Ministry of Energy and others concerning KE’s multi-year tariff (MYT) determinations for the control period of FY2024-30, Nepra reduced the utility’s tariff by Rs7.6 per unit, effectively overturning its own May determination made after more than two years of public hearings.
KE criticised the Nepra move, saying it was “not sustainable for the company and will have far-reaching consequences for its stakeholders, including consumers”.
However, the utility clarified that the Nepra announcement by the regulator did not apply to customers and, therefore, there would be no change or reduction in monthly bills for power consumers.</p><small>2025-10-27 13:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/10/27134919e917503.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1951561/central-bank-keeps-policy-rate-unchanged-at-11pc' target='_blank'><strong>Central bank keeps policy rate unchanged at 11pc</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Monday decided to keep the key interest rate unchanged at 11 per cent as policymakers weighed the impact of recent floods and higher food prices on inflation.
“The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 11 per cent in its meeting held on October 27, 2025,” the SBP announced in a post on social media platform X.
 






A monetary policy statement, issued shortly after the announcement on X, said the MPC noted during the meeting that headline inflation “rose significantly” to 5.6pc in September, whereas core inflation remained unchanged at 7.3pc.
Regarding the rise in headline inflation, the statement said, “This largely reflected the expected flood-induced increase in food prices; an uptick in energy prices; and sticky core inflation”.
The MPC observed that, unlike previous flood episodes, the recent surge in food prices appeared to be milder than anticipated earlier, the statement said, adding that this was reflected by the “recent slowdown in price increases of major food items in high frequency SPI (sensitive price index) data, such as wheat and allied products, sugar, and perishable items”.
“Nonetheless, the Committee expects inflation to exceed the upper bound of the target range for a few months in H2-FY26, before reverting to the target range in FY27. This outlook is subject to risks from volatile global commodity
prices; magnitude and timing of future energy price adjustments; and uncertainty around prices of wheat and allied products and perishable food items.”
Moreover, “the MPC assessed that the impact of the recent floods on the broader economy appears to be somewhat lower than anticipated at the time of its previous meeting. The crop losses are likely to be contained, whereas supply disruptions turned out to be minimal”, the statement added.
It said that economic activity had gained further momentum, as depicted by “robust growth in high-frequency economic indicators”.
Based on these developments, the overall macroeconomic outlook had improved from the previous assessment, the statement said, adding that at the same time, the MPC noted “uncertainties around this outlook arising from volatile global commodity prices; challenging export prospects amidst the evolving tariff dynamics; and potential domestic food supply frictions”.
“In this backdrop, and given the still-unfolding impact of the earlier reduction in the policy rate, the MPC viewed today’s decision as appropriate to maintain the ongoing price stability.”
Moreover, the MPC noted some “key developments” since its last meeting. Outlining these developments, the statement firstly highlighted that real GDP growth in FY25 had been revised by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics to 3pc from the previous estimate of 2.7pc.
“Second, initial estimates of major kharif crops by the Federal Committee on Agriculture remained close to last year’s production, despite the recent floods.
“Third, despite the repayment of a $500 million Eurobond, SBP’s foreign exchange reserves continued to increase.
“Fourth, Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF (International Monetary Fund) on the EFF (Extended Fund Facility) and the RSF (Resilience and  Sustainable Facility) reviews.
“Fifth, inflation expectations of both consumers and businesses eased in the latest SBP-IBA sentiment surveys.
“Lastly, global commodity price movements depicted mixed trends, with oil prices displaying heightened volatility.”
In light of these developments, the MPC viewed the real policy rate to be “adequately positive to stabilise inflation within the target range of 5–7pc” over the medium term, the statement said.
It added that the MPC also reiterated the “important role of the continued build-up in external and fiscal buffers to absorb future shocks and in facilitating the ongoing pickup in economic activity, without adding excessive pressures on inflation and the external account”.
Moreover, the MPC also emphasised the importance of continuing the “coordinated and prudent monetary and fiscal policies”, and undertaking the required structural reforms to ensure ongoing progress towards sustainable economic growth.
The policy rate has remained unchanged at 11 per cent since May, even as trade and industry continue to press for a substantial reduction to support economic activity.
Most analysts and researchers had expected the central bank to keep the policy rate unchanged. Bankers and market experts cited two major reasons for maintaining the status quo — the recent floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab that damaged crops and infrastructure, and rising inflationary pressures.
Fears of higher inflation have discouraged the central bank from considering a rate cut despite weak growth and a wide gap between inflation and the real interest rate.
SBP data shows that private-sector credit demand remains subdued, with businesses largely avoiding new borrowing even after the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Economic growth has remained sluggish over the past three years, deepening social and fiscal challenges. Nearly 97 million people are estimated to be living below the poverty line.
The government continues to struggle to revive growth and attract both domestic and foreign investment, particularly in manufacturing and agriculture. Industry leaders argue that high borrowing costs and an onerous tax regime have hurt competitiveness more than market pressures at home or abroad.

However, the video is old and was previously shared in May 2025 during the Pakistan–India standoff.
Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. Pakistan later launched the retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a United States-led push helped broker a ceasefire.
On Monday night, Indian forces apparently violated the cea­sefire in the Leepa Sector of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. While there was no official word on losses, locals reported an intense exchange of fire on Sunday evening.
Today, an Indian propaganda account shared a video on X with the following caption: “At least seven Pakistani soldiers killed in overnight clashes in Leepa Valley (PoK) after Pakistan Army initiated unprovoked firing at Indian posts in Tangdhar sector. Indian Army retaliated with 15× intensity, destroying two enemy posts and a supply vehicle. (Sources).”
The post gained over 97,000 views.
Another Indian propaganda account shared the same video with the following caption: “Pakistani accounts have accidentally exposed their own embarrassment sharing videos showing the Indian Army pounding Pak Army posts in Leepa Valley (PoK) after Pakistan violated the ceasefire near Tangdhar. Artillery fire. Precision strikes.”
The post garnered over 20,000 views.
Journalist Sumair Jamil also shared the video with the following caption: “Pak India LoC firing update. Indian army intermittently firing in the Leepa Valley sector of Azad Kashmir. Pakistan army is responding with full force.”
His post received 1,000 views.
The video was also shared by a pro-military account with the following caption: “Five Indian posts that were firing on the Leepa Valley sector in Kashmir have been blown away. The enemy has raised white flags. Our losses are zero, the enemy will report its own losses. Silence has also prevailed in the Tatta Pani and Haji Pir sectors .”
Several other pro-Indian and pro-Afghan accounts reshared the same footage as can be seen here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here, gaining over 19,000 views collectively.
A fact-check was initiated to determine the veracity of the claim due to its virality and to dispel any confusion about the incident, about which very few details have been released so far.
A keyword search to corroborate whether the footage was from the fresh hostilities did not yield any video report featuring the same footage from Pakistani or Indian media outlets.
A reverse image search of the video’s keyframes showed that the same clip was shared previously on May 9, 2025, by multiple users. No older shares of the video were found from before the May conflict.
Those sharing the video at the time, including Geo News correspondent Murtaza Ali Shah, also said that it was from live firing between Pakistan and India.
 






While the exact location of the older video along the LoC could not be conclusively determined due to a lack of details, it is clear that it is not from the current outbreak of shelling in Leepa Valley.
On May 9, 2025, heavy fighting erupted along the Pakistan-India border and LoC, with both sides accusing each other of major ceasefire violations. Pakistani media reported civilian casualties in Hajira and Neelum Valley, while India claimed to have intercepted multiple drone incursions from across the border.
Shelling had forced residents to flee border villages, and emergency shelters were opened amid fears of further escalation. International observers warned that the clashes marked the most serious escalation in years between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.
Therefore, the fact-check determined that the claim that a viral video shows cross-border shelling from a recent flare-up in violence between India and Pakistan in the Leepa Valley is false. The footage is old and was shared previously in the May 2025 conflict between the two countries.

The announcement was made during an event titled “Future in Focus: AI and Innovation”, held in collaboration with the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication (MoITT), the release said. Meta also announced the start of an experimental programme for AI education and government digital transformation in Pakistan.
“These initiatives aim to accelerate the process of digital transformation in the country,” the release said. “Pakistani users will now be able to interact with Meta AI not only in English but also in Urdu.”
Speaking at the event, Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said, “Under the Prime Minister’s Digital Nation Vision, Pakistan is moving toward a future where technology empowers every citizen.
“Our partnership with Meta reflects this commitment, promoting AI education, digital transformation, and innovation within government and educational institutions. The inclusion of Urdu in Meta AI marks a milestone that makes technology more inclusive and accessible, ensuring no one is left behind in this digital transformation journey,” she said.
Meta’s Director of Public Policy for South and Central Asia, Sarim Aziz, added:
“We aim to support public sector and educational institutions in driving digital transformation through effective use of AI. We are also delighted that Meta AI is now available in Urdu, giving the local community new opportunities to connect with technology in their own language.”
According to the release, Meta has also introduced a localised edition of the guide “Transforming Public Sector Innovation in Asia Pacific with Llama”, developed in collaboration with Deloitte.
Prepared with the support of the ministry, the guide explains how Meta’s open-source AI model, Llama, can enhance government operations, improve public services, and strengthen data sovereignty. The document highlights best practices and successful examples from various Asia-Pacific countries, including Pakistan.
Similarly, Meta said it has launched the AI Literacy Programme in partnership with the Higher Education Commission (HEC), National Computing Education Accreditation Council (NCEAC), MoITT, and atomcamp.
“Under this programme, 350 non-computer science university teachers across Pakistan will be trained in basic AI skills so they can prepare students to meet the demands of the modern digital era,” the release added.
Meta also announced the Government Digital Transformation Xperience (GDTX) 2025 program, which aims to provide Pakistan’s public institutions with Meta’s technologies, solutions, and best practices. The programme, according to Meta, will bring together experts from the public and private sectors to exchange strategies and experiences for effective digital transformation.</p><small>2025-10-27 11:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630737-pakistan-afghanistan-hold-third-round-of-talks-in-istanbul' target='_blank'><strong>At Istanbul talks, Pakistan urges Afghan Taliban to halt backing of terrorists</strong></a><br><p>

The development comes as the Punjab government has faced criticism by the KP and Sindh governments for choking wheat flow to the two provinces. However, a day earlier, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari insisted that there was no ban on the inter-provincial movement of wheat, terming the “ongoing propaganda in this regard baseless and contrary to facts”.
In a post on social media platform X today, the KP governor said he had written to the premier, urging his “immediate intervention to lift the unconstitutional restrictions” on the inter-provincial movement of wheat to the province.
“Such limitations not only affect the province’s food security but also go against the spirit of cooperative federalism enshrined in our Constitution,” he said.
He expressed his confidence that the matter would be resolved promptly “under the prime minister’s leadership”.
 






The letter, which Kundi also posted on X, termed the restrictions a “serious concern”, pointing out that KP was a “wheat-deficient province and depends substantially on inter-provincial inflows to meet its essential food requirements”.
It said that the restrictions were against Article 151 of the Constitution, which guaranteed freedom of trade, commerce and intercourse among the provinces.
“Any disruption in supply risks creating artificial shortages, price escalation and public hardship,” he said.
“It has further been observed that these limitations are unintentionally encouraging illegal and informal transportation of wheat through alternate means and routes, which is resulting in uncontrollable supply distortions in the open market. This diversion is causing [a] rapid escalation in wheat and flour prices, directly burdening the general public and potentially triggering unwarranted public resentment,” he said.
Kundi requested PM Shehbaz’s “kind and immediate intervention in this matter and direction to the concerned authorities” to withdraw the restrictions in order to ensure the “uninterrupted and legally protected movement of wheat” into KP.
“I remain confident that, under your leadership, the constitutional rights of the people of KP will be safeguarded effectively and without delay,” he said.
Kundi seeks restoration of daily int’l flights from Peshawar
Separately, the KP governor wrote to Defence Minister Khawaja Asif requesting him to restore daily flights between Peshawar and Karachi, as well as international ones, “particularly to the Gulf and Middle Eastern countries”.
“The suspension of these (international) flights has caused considerable hardship for overseas Pakistanis, entrepreneurs and their families,” Kundi said in a later post on X, noting that a “large expatriate population” from KP was employed in the Middle East.
Kundi further said a “single private airline is operating with absolute monopoly” on the route between Peshawar and Karachi, inconveniencing people and traders due to exorbitant fares and limited seat availability.
The governor requested Asif to issue directions to restore the flight services, adding, “I also earnestly hope and pray that our National Flag Bearer airline will once again ascend to command the skies of the world as it gloriously did during the golden decades of the 1960s and 1970s.”
 






KP’s grievances
In the aftermath of the recent floods, the Punjab government had begun tightening controls on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour through a permit regime to curb price hikes within the province — a move that has particularly been denounced by KP amid soaring prices and wheat shortage.
The restrictions have also drawn sharp criticism from flour millers who argue that it violates constitutional rights and a recent deregulation agreement.
While Punjab officials have de­n­ied a formal ban, they acknowledged establishing checkpoints to curb what they termed “unusual” whe­at movement.
On Sept 7, Kundi had regretted the reports that Punjab had banned the movement of wheat to other provinces. He had issued another condemnation of the reported ban the very next day in a post on social media platform X.
“The arbitrary ban imposed on August 31, 2025, by the Government of Punjab on the supply of wheat and flour to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a blatant violation of Article 151 of the Constitution and a serious breach of national unity,” Kundi had said on X.
The Constitution’s Article 151 states that “trade, commerce and intercourse throughout Pakistan shall be free”, but empowers the parliament to “impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade, commerce or intercourse between one province and another or within any part of Pakistan as may be required in the public interest”.
The KP governor had further said: “As a result, the price of a 20kg bag of flour has soared to approximately Rs 1,200 in Punjab and up to Rs 2,800 in KP — an unbearable burden on families already struggling with inflation.
“On behalf of the people of KP, I strongly condemn this discriminatory act and urge Chief Minister Punjab [Maryam Nawaz] to not only condemn but also immediately withdraw this verbal ban.”
Meanwhile, on Sept 7, the KP Assembly had unanimously passed a resolution, denouncing the Punjab government’s “restrictions” on wheat supply amid claims about a 68 per cent hike in flour prices across the province.
Subsequently, the government had approved a national wheat policy earlier this month. According to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office, stakeholders were told during a briefing about the policy that there would be no restriction on the inter-provincial movement of wheat.
Then, in a letter dated October 23, the KP government had asked Punjab to withdraw restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat and flour, warning that the curbs were disrupting supply chains, increasing prices and threatening food security in the province.
KP’s food secretary, in a letter to his Punjab counterpart, said that lifting the ban was critical to res­t­oring a smooth supply chain, stabilising market prices, and safeguarding his province’s food security.
The letter said KP, a wheat-deficient province, depended on inter-provincial supplies from Punjab to meet its requirements — roughly 14,500 tonnes per day.
“The prevailing restrictions have severely disrupted the flow of wheat and flour into the province, thereby threatening food availability and destabilising market prices,” it read.
While KP acknowledged Punjab’s recent permit-based allocation of 2,000 tonnes of flour for transport to KP, it termed the quota “insufficient” relative to actual requirements.
KP lamented that despite repeated communications from its chief secretary, food secretary and director of food to Punjab, the ban continued to remain in force.
“This situation is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 151(1) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, which guarantees freedom of inter-provincial trade and movement of goods across the country,” the letter said.
The letter added that the issue was raised at a high-level meeting, chaired by PM Shehbaz, on October 17 regarding the Interim Wheat Policy 2025.
“The KP Flour Mills Association has repeatedly conveyed grave concerns over the rapidly depleting wheat stocks, cautioning that the non-availability of wheat and flour may arise in the coming days if the restrictions persist,” it said.
Meanwhile, the PPP leadership in Sindh also lashed out at the Punjab government, accusing it of restricting the supply of wheat seed.
 
 

Last week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi had again condemned Punjab’s “ban” on wheat and flour transport to the province, calling it a violation of the Constitution and “an attack on the rights” of the people of the province.
Chairing a meeting, he directed the food department’s high-ups to write a letter to the Punjab government demanding immediate removal of all restrictions to ensure free movement of wheat and its flour across the provincial borders, according to a statement from the chief minister’s secretariat. Afridi said that hiding behind political differences to deprive citizens of necessities was unacceptable.
Officials told the meeting that KP consumes about 5.3 million tonnes of wheat and flour annually, of which only 1.5m tonnes are produced locally, while the remainder is sourced from Punjab and other provinces.</p><small>2025-10-27 09:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/630725-pakistan-bangladesh-vow-to-expand-military-to-military-engagements' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan, Bangladesh vow to expand military-to-military engagements</strong></a><br><p>
