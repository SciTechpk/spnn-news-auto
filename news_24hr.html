The transfer comes weeks after Justice Ejaz Ishaq issued sweeping contempt of court notices to the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and his entire cabinet for alleged non-compliance with orders in the case.
On July 22, the judge issued the notices; however, that particular proceeding became questionable, as Justice Ejaz Ishaq was not inc­l­u­ded in the Roster of Sitting appr­o­v­­ed by Chief Justice Sardar Moha­m­mad Sarfraz Dogar, since he was on a five-week leave effective from July 20.
Consequently, on July 24, the high court’s registrar put the processing of the contempt notices on hold while staff sought to determine whether they had been issued within jurisdiction.

Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had previously tried to hold PM, his cabinet ‘in contempt’

Meanwhile, under the new roster, Justice Ejaz Ishaq has been placed on a special division bench with Justice Babar Sattar to hear tax references and related commercial matters, a posting that prevents members from sitting as single-judge courts.
 
 

As a result, petitions previously before him, including Dr Fowzia Siddiqui’s, have been transferred to other available judges.
The transfer may come as a sigh of relief for Prime Minister Sheh­baz Sharif and his cabinet, who might have faced contempt proceedings under the previous judge.
 
 

The judicial reshuffle is part of a broader effort to create specialised benches.
On Aug 13, the IHC administration constituted four such benches for financial and commercial matters and a bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan has been assigned to decide the “Commercial Litigation Corridor” related cases only.
A notification said their bench will adjudicate references filed under the Income Tax Ordinance, Sales Tax Act, Federal Excise Tax Act and Customs Act.
A specialised company bench comprising Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani, and Jus­tice Saman Rafat Imtiaz will take up matters under Section 5(4) of the Companies Act, 2017, as well as cases under Section 8(B) of the Corporate Restructuring Compa­nies (Amendment) Act, 2021 and the SECP Act, 1997.
Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir has been designated as a single-judge bench to hear cases relating to educational institutions, including medical colleges.
In addition, Justice Tariq Meh­m­ood Jehangiri and Justice Saman Rafat Imtiaz will hear cases under the Financial Institution (Recovery of Finances) Ordinance, 2001, exercising the court’s original civil jurisdiction, as well as civil suits under the Privatisation Commis­sion (Amendment) Act, 2020.
Dr Fowzia’s petition, which has been pending in the IHC since 2015, seeks to compel the government of Pakistan to formally support her sister Dr Aafia, who has been imprisoned in the US since 2008 on terrorism charges.

They are forced to spend nights in the open with their animals and cattle.
A man who was trying to move his family to a safer place drowned in the flood. Muhammad Ramzan, a resident of Hajiwala, was taking his family out of the floodwater when he drowned in the fast-moving floodwater. Locals pulled out the dead body from the floodwater. Rescue 1122 confirmed his death.
The flood of rainwater drain Dek entered Narowal city and it submerged houses with two to three foot floodwater. The areas which have seen flooding include Abbas Nagar, Kakar Colony, Satellite Town, Railway Colony, Siddiqui Colony, Kache Kothi, Ganj Hussainabad, Girls College Road, Makki Masjid Road, Eidgah Road. Villages in the path of the floodwater are also flooded. Teams from other districts have also reached Narowal to carry out rescue operations.
 
 

According to the irrigation department, the flow of water in the Ravi River and some other rainwater drains is decreasing. The water level in the Ravi has reduced from 250,000 cusecs to 113,200 cusecs. Despite the increase in water level in the river, the floodwater flowing from the Ravi is moving rapidly towards the village of Baddomalhi.

Man drowns evacuating family; Ravi recedes but Dek causing more flood in Narowal city

There is low-level flooding in the rainwater Dek, Bryan and Basantar. Two days ago, the dam of Dek broke from the village Lahri and Skroor in tehsil Zafarwal. The floodwater flowing from the Dek entered Narowal city. While the water is receding in the river and drains, the floodwater entering Narowal city is increasing. The railway track has been submerged as well. A three-foot floodwater is passing through the Narowal-Sialkot railway crossing. The track of the Narowal Railway Station is flooded.
 
 

The Shakargarh Road from Kakeki Mor to Manzoorpura is 12 feet above the ground. Dozens of flood victims have set up their own temporary camps on the road with their families and animals.
Flood victims, Muhammad Amin and Abdul Razaq, told Dawn that they had been spending nights in the open for the past three days. They complained that their families and animals were trapped in the flood but the administration did not help them. They had no information about the flood relief camps set up by the district government.
“The administration officers pass by Narowal-Shakargarh Road every day in their heavy vehicles but they never stop by or tell us to go to the flood relief camp.”
The flood victims said that there was no fodder for their animals and their cows, buffaloes and goats were hungry for the last three days.
Muhammad Aslam and Kashif Mahmood Siddiqui said they had gone to the flood relief camp established by the district administration Narowal as well. “Though there was medicine for humans and animals, there were no arrangements for food, clean drinking water and accommodation,” they said.
The flood victims demanded Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz take strict notice of the situation.
The district administration claims to have set up 38 relief camps across the district for flood victims. District Emergency Officer Muhammad Aurangzeb told Dawn that 2,311 people, including children, women and men, have been rescued from flood so far. He said 16 teams of rescuers were continuously conducting rescue operations in different areas.
Deputy Commissioner Syed Hassan Raza told Dawn that 50 to 75pc of the population of Narowal district had been affected due to the flood. He said 35 water boats were rescuing the flood victims and shifting them to safer places.
“The food packages received from the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) are being distributed. The district administration is ensuring the provision of basic facilities to the flood victims at the flood relief camps, claimed the DC.

But while party MNAs are quitting parliamentary panels, none of their senators or MPAs in Punjab have done so.
The party’s chief whip Malik Aamir Dogar told Dawn resignations had been submitted to the NA Secretariat by 5pm on Thursday.
Since not all their legislators were in town at the moment, he said the remaining lawmakers would tender their resignations when they returned to the capital.
When asked whether senators or members of the Punjab Assembly would follow suit, Mr Dogar said the party had not taken any decision with regard to those two legislative bodies.
In a post on X, Mr Dogar shared his own resignation letter, saying that he was quitting the NA standing committees on Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Energy (Power Division), Rules of Procedure and Privileges, as well as the Public Accounts Committee.
 






However, when approached for confirmation, the NA Secretariat said that it had received resignations from 20 lawmakers in all.
On Thursday, those who submitted their resignations included interim party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Amjad Ali Khan, Sahibzada Sibghatullah, Mahboob Shah, Junaid Akbar Khan, Shahzada Gustasap, Ali Jadoon, Mujahid Ali, Malik Anwar Taj, Fazal Muhammad Khan, Sajid Khan, Arbab Amir Ayub, Asif Khan, Sheikh Waqqas Akram, Arshad Sahi, Shabir Ali Qureshi, Awais Jhakkar and Malik Aamir Dogar.
A day earlier, NA DG (Media) Zafar Sultan had told Dawn.com that Ali Asghar Khan and Faisal Amin had sent their resignations as standing committee members to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.
“I resigned from the committees based on the instructions of the PTI founder and the political committee,” Barrister Gohar told Dawn.com on Thursday. “I submitted my resignation to the speaker’s office and resigned |from the committees on law and justice, human rights, IT and the House Business Advisory Committee.”

In light of these reservations, Chief Justice Yayha Afridi had also constituted a committee under Rule 1(4) of the new rules to make recommendations for addressing any difficulty that may arise in giving effect to the provisions of these guidelines. The committee comprised Justice Shahid Waheed, Justice Irfan Saadat Khan, Justice Naeem Akhter Afghan, and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi.
The CJP had also visited the bar room inside the Supreme Court building a few days ago, a source told Dawn. Justice Afridi had assured the bar leaders that their concerns would be allayed soon.
The new rules were formulated to enhance modernisation, ensure procedural clarity, and integrate technology into the justice system. While constituting the committee, the apex court had invited suggestions and feedback from judges, the bar, litigants, and the general public. The written suggestions had been furnished before the committee by the bar leaders.

CJP assures of allaying concerns after raising of court fees, other proposed measures drew flak from lawyers’ bodies

The Supreme Court believed that the new rules were conceived as a living document responsive to the needs of the bench, the bar, and the litigants in light of the emerging legal and technological developments.
The rules, which also raised the court fee, had invited criticism from the Supreme Court Bar Association President Mian M Rauf Atta, who had urged the apex court to withdraw the recent increase in the court filing fee to restore public confidence and uphold the constitutional promise of speedy, inexpensive, and unobstructed justice. According to him, the new rules were introduced without prior and meaningful consultation with the premier legal body.
Likewise, the Executive Committee of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) in its meeting of Aug 23 had disapproved the recent amendments, replacing the Supreme Court Rules 1980 with the Supreme Court Rules 2025.
Presided over by its chairman Yasin Azad, the executive committee had also regretted that the Supreme Court did not consult or take on board the council regarding the increase in court fees and demanded immediate withdrawal of the said amendment.
Framed under Article 191 of the Constitution, the new rules replaced the outdated provisions and consist of seven parts, 38 orders, and six schedules, with approximately 280 provisions amended (including 160 from the Schedules), 60 new provisions added, and five outdated provisions deleted.
The key highlights of the rules included digital transition and technological criteria suggesting all petitions and paper books be filed electronically; digital issuance of notices, orders, and certified copies while permitting pleadings and hearings through video-link; affidavits may be authenticated by apostille; parties and advocates must provide updated phone numbers, email addresses, and digital app details; and that judicial documents sent via post will not be entertained.

The court ruling paved the way for smooth selling of the national flag carrier.
The petition, filed by Advocate Sardar Amber Maqsood, alleged that the Privatisation Commission had failed to issue proper notices of intent under Section 23 and did not conduct a lawful valuation of PIACL’s assets under Sec­tion 24 of the Ordinance.
The petitioner also sought suspension of the process until the establishment of a Privatisation Appellate Tribunal.
Justice Jawad Hassan, who authored the detailed judgement, observed that the Privatisation Comm­ission had advertised its intent to privatise PIACL in leading international and national newspapers, including Financial Times, China Daily, The Wall Street Journal, Dawn, and Daily Jang.
The LHC also noted that Ernst & Young Consulting LLC, Dubai, was appointed as the financial adviser to conduct independent valuation of PIA’s local and international assets in accordance with law.
The court dismissed the petition, holding that the process of privatisation met the requirements of Sections 23 and 24 of the Ordinance; the petitioner failed to provide credible material or documents to substantiate allegations of illegality; judicial review cannot be invoked to obstruct economic policy decisions of the executive, unless clear violations of law or fundamental rights are established.
On the broader question of judicial intervention in economic policy, the court stressed the need for judicial restraint, citing Supreme Court precedents which caution against interference in matters of privatisation and foreign investment.
 
 

Justice Hassan warned that frivolous petitions could derail sensitive economic reforms and undermine investor confidence.
The judgement also recorded that the bidding process for PIACL had already been cancelled, rendering the petition infructuous. Nonetheless, the court clarified that even if proceedings had continued, the Privatisation Commission’s process was legally sound and transparent.
On the petitioner’s application to summon evaluation records, the court declined, citing the Privatisation Commission (Confidentiality and Secrecy of Documents) Regulations, 2003, which classify valuation reports and due diligence documents as confidential.
Concluding the 37-page judgment, the court reaffirmed that privatisation is part of the federal government’s constitutional mandate under Article 173, aimed at reducing the fiscal burden of loss-making state-owned enterprises.
The court cautioned litigants against misusing public interest litigation to create hurdles in economic policy matters.

The Met Office said strong monsoon currents from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal were likely to enter the upper parts of the country from August 29, while a westerly wave was also expected to approach the upper and central parts from August 30.
These conditions will bring widespread rain, “at times very heavy” with thunder and lightning in Kashmir’s Neelum Valley, Muzaffarabad, Rawa­lakot, Poonch, Hattian, Bagh, Haveli, Sudhanoti, Kotli, Bhimber, and Mirpur areas from August 29 to September 2. The Diamer, Astore, Ghizer, Skardu, Hunza, Gilgit, Ghanche, and Shigar districts will witness rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) from August 30 to September 1 with occasional gaps.
In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls, at times very heavy) is expected in Dir, Chitral, Swat, Koh­istan, Shangla, Battagram, Mans­ehra, Abbottabad, Haripur, Buner, Malakand, Bajaur, Mohmand, Kohat, Peshawar, Charsadda, Nowshera, Mardan, Swabi, Khyber, Orakzai, Kurram, Hangu, Karak, Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Waziristan, Tank, and Dera Ismail Khan from August 29 to September 1.
Punjab, which is already reeling under the intensity of exceptionally high floods, is also expecting “heavy falls, at times very heavy” in almost all districts.
Rain is expected in Islamabad/Rawa­lpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Att­ock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bah­a­­uddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Haf­izabad, Wazirabad, Lahore, Kasur, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Mianwali, Khushab, Sargodha, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad, and Sahiwal from August 29 to Sep­t­ember 2 with occasional gaps.
 
 

“Rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is also likely in D.G. Khan, Bhakkar, Lay­yah, Multan, Bahawalpur, Baha­w­a­lnagar, Rajanpur and Rahimyar Khan from August 29 (night) to Se­­­p­­t­ember 2,” the statement added.
In Sindh, rain is expected in Mithi, Tharparkar, Sukkur, Lar­kana, Jacobabad, Dadu, and Umer Kot on August 30-31 with occasio­nal gaps.
In Balochistan, rain-wind/thunder­shower (with isolated hea­­­­­v­­y fa­­lls) is expected in Barkhan, Mus­­­akhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Ka­­­lat, and Khuzdar from August 30 to September 1 with occasional gaps.
The Meteorological Office war­ned that the downpour may generate flash floods in Kashmir and hilly areas of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa during the spell. Landslides/mudslides may cause road closures in the vulnerable hilly areas of Khyber Pakh­tunk­hwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Murree, Ga­­li­­yat, and Kashmir during the forecast period, it warned.
The Meteorological Office also issued an urban flooding warning in Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Peshawar, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Nowshera, and Mardan from August 29 (night) to September 1.

• Federation pushes for provincial govts to share expenses on natural calamities, health programmes, infrastructure projects
• Attempts to constitute 9th and 10th NFCs failed to yield new award
ISLAMABAD: The Centre on Thursday postponed the inaugural session of the newly constituted National Finance Commission (NFC) on the request of the Sindh government “due to the impending flood situation”.
A notification issued to all official and private members, as well as provincial and federal finance secretaries, said the date and time of the rescheduled meeting would be communicated later.
The 11th NFC was constituted on August 22 to prepare a new award for sharing federal divisible resources between the Centre and the provinces. Its first meeting had initially been called for August 27 but was deferred to August 29 without explanation.
This time, the Sindh government requested a postponement, citing precautionary measures required as heavy floods were expected to enter the province over the next two days from Punjab.
 
 

Chaired by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, the NFC includes four provincial finance ministers and four non-statutory members, one from each province.
The terms of reference set under clause 2 of Article 160 require the 11th NFC to distribute between the federation and provinces the net proceeds of five major tax categories as explained in clause 3 of Article 160.
These include: taxes on income (including corporation tax but excluding salaries paid out of the Federal Consolidated Fund); taxes on the sale and purchase of imported, exported, produced, manufactured, or consumed goods; export duties on cotton and other duties as specified by the president; excise duties; and any other taxes specified by the president.
The notification also mandates recommendations on grants-in-aid by the federal government to the provinces, and on the exercise of borrowing powers by both tiers of government.
The new NFC is further tasked with considering sharing of expenditures incurred, or to be incurred, by the federation in respect of matters falling within the provinces’ domain; expenditures on trans-national issues; and financial responsibility for national projects to be shared by both the Centre and provinces.
This apparently indicates the Centre’s intention to push for provincial contributions toward natural calamities, horizontal health programmes, major dams, highways, and motorways. The federal government has also been advocating for an end to population-based incentives, replacing them with social sector performance, along with activation of local governments.
The NFC will also determine grants-in-aid from the Centre to the provinces, set borrowing powers and conditions for both, and assess resources required to meet expenditures of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan, and the newly merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (erstwhile Fata).
The 7th NFC award, announced in 2009, remained effective for 15 years instead of the constitutional five years. It raised the provincial share from about 47 per cent to 57.5pc, which further increased to nearly 59pc through special allocations to Balochistan, KP and Sindh, reducing the federal share to 42.5pc. In later years, however, the Centre offset this balance by imposing a petroleum levy of about Rs1.5 trillion and appropriating a similar amount from provincial cash balances. For their part, the provinces failed to honour the 7th NFC commitment to raise their revenue contribution by 0.5pc of GDP annually.
 
 

The 10th NFC, constituted in May 2020 and reconstituted in July the same year, remained inactive. The 9th NFC, set up in April 2015 and reconstituted in 2016, 2018 and 2019 following government changes and replacement of non-statutory members, also failed to reach a new award due to the absence of sustained dialogue.
As a result, repeated calls from the finance ministry, the armed forces and the IMF to rebalance the resource transfer under the 7th NFC award remain unaddressed. The award of 2009 continues through annual extensions, despite its constitutional term ending on June 30, 2015. The Constitution stipulates that provincial shares under each NFC award cannot be reduced, and that any new award requires consensus among all five parties — the Centre and the four provinces.
Under the 7th NFC award, the provinces collectively received 57.5pc of divisible pool taxes, in addition to revenues from income tax, wealth tax, capital value tax, general sales tax, customs duties, and federal excise. Their horizontal shares are based on population, poverty, revenue collection and inverse population density, giving Punjab 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, KP 14.62pc and Balochistan 9.09pc.

There was no official word from Islamabad, and Afghan authorities did not provide any evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the incident, either.
Islamabad has repeatedly warned Kabul to prevent its soil from being used to stage attacks in Pakistan, and that it is fully capable of targeting terrorists who carry out such attacks.
Quoting Afghan authorities, the Reuters news agency reported on Thursday that three children were killed and several others wounded when ‘drones’ hit the home of one Haji Naeem Khan in Khost’s Spera district, near the border with North Waziristan.
AFP photographs from Spera showed people standing outside a badly damaged home in the Lahori Village.
Meanwhile, Afghan officials claimed that four sons and two wives of a man named Shahsawar were among those injured when his house was destroyed in Nangarhar’s Shinwar district.
The Taliban foreign ministry said in a statement that it strongly condemns the violation of Afghanistan’s airspace, and that the bombing of civilians such irresponsible actions will inevitably have consequences.
It said that a protest note was formally handed to Pakistan’s ambassador, Ubaid-ur-Rehman Nizam­ani, during a meeting in Kabul on Thursday.
Pakistan has targeted terrorist camps in Afghan territory in the past: most recently in December last year, when Pakistan jets bombed positions in Pak­tika province, targeting members of the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­is­tan (TTP).
At the time, the Foreign Office had avoided di­r­ectly commenting on the claim, but admitted that Pa­k­­i­stani forces conducted “operations in border areas to protect the people of Pakistan from terr­­­orist groups”.
A number of cross-border infiltration bids have also been foiled. In April of this year, ISPR claimed killing at least 54 terrorists who were trying to cross into North Waziristan.
 
 

Then, earlier this month, at least 50 attackers were killed trying to cross from Afghanistan into Balo­chistan’s Zhob district.
Recent negotiations bet­ween the TTP and tribesmen in border districts have also laid bare the reality of their chain of comm­and, as the militants rep­e­a­tedly sought time to consu­lt their leaders in Afgha­n­istan.

MANDI BAHAUDDIN: Residents wade through a flooded road in Qadirabad village near the River Chenab.—Reuters

LAHORE: The Punjab government has launched one of its largest evacuation operations in recent years, as floodwaters affected over 1.46 million people across the province, with the Chenab River expected to swell to dangerous levels at Head Trimmu.
Extremely high floods in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers have also resulted in the loss of 17 lives.
The province is battling its worst flooding in four decades, which has caused havoc in hundreds of villages and submerged vital grain crops.
Torrential monsoon rain and India’s release of excess water from its dams swelled the three rivers that flow into the province, forcing authorities to breach riverbanks in some places and causing flooding in more than 1,400 villages.
Authorities warned that between 700,000 and 800,000 cusecs of water could pass through the Chenab River system in the next 48 hours, threatening widespread devastation.
The relocation effort covers several districts and hundreds of towns, including Jhang, Shorkot, Khanewal, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Shujaabad, Jalalpur Pirwala and Alipur.
Water levels
As of 12am on Friday, Trimmu near Jhang was in normal flow at 117,534 cubic feet per second (cusecs), but was showing a rising trend, according to the Flood Forecasting Division.
The division reported falling trends upstream. At Marala Headworks near Sialkot, the flow has dropped to 106,496 cusecs (low flood), while both Khanki and Qadirabad headworks stand at 305,436 cusecs.
While the Ravi River has stabilised at Jassar near Narowal (95,580 cusecs), Shahdara was in “exceptionally high flood” with a water outflow of 219,770 cusecs, though the trend was steady. The next stop, Head Balloki near Pattoki, was in the “high flood” category at 114,110 cusecs and showing a rising trend.
Further downstream, Head Sidhnai near Abdul Hakeem showed a rising trend, with an inflow of 25,443 cusecs and outflow of 10,093 cusecs.
 
 

On the Sutlej River, Ganda Singh Wala near Kasur was in “exceptionally high flood” at 261,053 cusecs, Sulemanki near Bahawalnagar was in “medium flood” at 113,124 cusecs, and Head Islam was in “low flood” at 52,706 cusecs.
Meanwhile on the Indus River, Tarbela Dam showed a normal flow with an outflow of 155,400 cusecs.
Scale of damage
According to PDMA data, over 1.46 million people in 1,692 mouzas have been affected due to extremely high floods in the Sutlej, Ravi and Chenab rivers, with a total of 17 lives lost.
The government has evacuated over 265,000 people, of whom 1,372 were living in 355 relief camps and 6,656 were provided with medical help, whereas 90,348 people and 154,980 cattle were transported to safety.
A total of 991 villages were submerged due to flooding in the Chenab River. Some 395 villages were affected by the floods in Sialkot, 127 in Jhang, 124 in Multan, 48 in Chiniot, 66 in Gujrat, 51 in Khanewal, 45 in Hafizabad, 41 in Sargodha, 35 in Mandi Bahauddin, and 19 villages in Wazirabad.
Due to flooding in the Chenab, more than one million people have been evacuated and relocated to safe locations so far. Some 73,000 animals have been moved to safe locations, and 72 veterinary camps have been set up in affected districts.
In the Ravi, around 80 villages were submerged, including 75 in Narowal, four in Sheikhupura, and one in Nankana Sahib. Around 11,000 people have been evacuated and relocated to safe locations so far. Nearly 4,500 animals have been moved to safe locations. A total of 52 veterinary camps have been set up in affected districts.
As for the Sutlej River, a total of 361 villages were submerged, including 72 in Kasur, 86 in Okara, 24 in Pakpattan, 27 in Multan, 23 in Vehari, 104 in Bahawalnagar and 25 villages in Bahawalpur. Nearly 127,000 people have been evacuated and relocated to safe locations so far. A total of 70,000 animals have been moved to safe locations, whereas 90 veterinary camps have been set up.
‘No compensation’
Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Thursday lauded the exemplary coordination among all stakeholders for averting a major flood disaster in Gujranwala and Wazirabad.
Speaking to the media in Wazirabad, he assured that arrangements were in place for the provision of relief items, including tents, food and medical supplies.
A survey is currently underway to estimate livestock losses, and compensation will be provided to affected individuals. However, he stressed that no compensation would be given for structures built illegally in these high-risk areas.
Meanwhile, flooding also disrupted flight operations at Sialkot International Airport, where services were suspended for 24 hours on Thursday.

The airport spokesperson confirmed that the runway and terminal were safe, with drainage work underway.
An official told Dawn that the last flight from Sialkot airport — a Dubai-bound Flydubai — departed on Thursday morning.
PM, CM visit affected areas
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, accompanied by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif, conducted an aerial survey of affected areas on Thursday. NDMA Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider briefed the premier on the overall situation.
During her visit to the Ravi, CM Maryam expressed regret that the crisis had been aggravated by the opening of spillways by India but noted that the province’s early warning system was functioning effectively, allowing the timely evacuation of residents.
International support
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkiye phoned PM Shehbaz to express solidarity and offer assistance in rescue and relief efforts.
“Turkiye stands ready to help in any way possible, including during the rescue and relief efforts,” President Erdogan said, according to the PM Office.
PM Shehbaz thanked him for the support, calling it reflective of the “deep-rooted fraternal ties” between the two nations.

The second seed has looked like a top contender after picking up her sixth major at Wimbledon and clinching the Cincinnati tune-up tournament and she cleaned up some mid-match errors to keep her campaign on track.
She will play 29th seed Anna Kalinskaya in the third round.
Swiatek was in control as she broke in the second game when her opponent hit the ball long and she saved a break point in the third game with an unreturnable serve.
The Pole broke her opponent from the baseline again in the sixth game, as Lamens was unable to fire off a single winner in the first set.
It looked as though it would be a similar story when Lamens went down an early break in the second set, but the Dutchwoman showed signs of life when she hit a backhand winner that just hit the baseline to level it in the fourth game.
Swiatek retaliated in the seventh game, sending over a lethal backhand to take the advantage back, only to see her lead evaporate again with a double fault in the eighth and she sent a backhand into the net on set point.
Down four games to one in the third set, Lamens narrowed the lead when she survived a 12-shot rally on break point in the sixth game, but it was too little too late as Swiatek cruised through her final two service games.</p><small>2025-08-28 18:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/2823054539038e9.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937957/iran-vows-response-to-unjustified-and-illegal-sanctions-snapback-by-european-powers' target='_blank'><strong>Iran vows response to ‘unjustified and illegal’ sanctions snapback by European powers</strong></a><br><p>Iran’s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on Thursday that Tehran would respond to a decision by France, Britain and Germany to trigger a mechanism reimposing UN sanctions under a moribund 2015 nuclear deal.
“The Islamic Republic of Iran will respond appropriately to this illegal and unjustified action by the three European countries, in order to protect and guarantee its national rights and interests,” Araghchi told his French, British and German counterparts in a phone call, according to a statement from his ministry.
He called on the three countries to “appropriately correct this wrong decision in the coming days”.
While Araghchi did not specify what retaliatory measures Iran might take, Tehran has previously warned that such a move could lead to the exclusion of the European powers from any future negotiations on Iran’s nuclear
programme.
In a statement, the Iranian foreign ministry said: “This decision by the three European countries will seriously undermine the ongoing process of interaction and cooperation between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),” the foreign ministry said in a statement, calling the move a “provocative and unnecessary escalation”.
The move by the European trio — known as the E3 — took place just days after Iranian and European diplomats held talks in Geneva, the second since Israel’s attack on Iran that started a 12-day war in June.
The E3 had been threatening in recent weeks to activate the so-called “snapback” mechanism, citing Iran’s continued non-compliance with its commitments under the 2015 nuclear agreement.
The three powers launched a 30-day process to reimpose sanctions, fearing they would otherwise lose the prerogative in mid-October to restore them.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said the decision did not signal the end of diplomacy, while his German counterpart, Johann Wadephul, urged Iran to now fully cooperate with the UN nuclear watchdog agency and commit to direct talks with the United States over the next month.
That deal was torpedoed in 2018 when Donald Trump, during his first term as president, unilaterally withdrew the United States and slapped crippling sanctions on Iran.
Tehran and Washington had begun nuclear talks in April with the aim of reaching another deal, but these negotiations were derailed by the war with Israel, during which the United States also struck Iranian nuclear sites.</p><small>2025-08-28 18:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620823-karachi-warned-of-possible-urban-flooding-after-fresh-rain-alert' target='_blank'><strong>Karachi warned of possible urban flooding after fresh rain alert</strong></a><br><p>

The Lahore Police arrested Shershah, son of Imran’s sister Aleema Khan, from outside his home on August 22. His brother Shahrez Khan, who was picked up the day before, was also handed over to police custody for eight days over the same allegations.
Lahore police presented Shershah before the court of ATC Judge Manzer Ali Gill today upon the completion of his five-day physical remand.
Advocate Rana Mudassar Umer, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, and Barrister Taimur Malik appeared as Shershah’s counsel, while Imtiaz Ahmad Sipra was the prosecutor.
Aleema, along with her sisters Uzma Khan and Noreen, appeared in the court, while Shershah was presented amid tight security.
 
 

The prosecution sought a 30-day physical remand, while the defence counsel requested that the suspect be discharged from the case. Judge Gill, rejecting the police request, sent Shershah on judicial remand.
Meanwhile, Aleema filed a bail plea before the ATC for Shershah through Advocate Umer.
“The suspect has been arrested on political motives,” the plea said, contending there was no evidence against Shershah. It requested the court to order the suspect’s release on bail.
According to today’s court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, Shershah’s photogrammetry test was conducted, and a “wooden danda (baton)” was recovered from his possession. “Sufficient investigation stands concluded,” it said.
Judge Gill noted: “So far as investigation into the extent of social media accounts is concerned, in the present era of technology as well as digital devices, social media accounts of each and every person could be easily traced and recovered without the support of the accused.
“This court is of the further view that there is no sufficient ground available for further physical remand,” he added.
The judge ordered that Shershah be produced before the court on September 11 and directed the investigation officer to submit the charge sheet by then.
At the outset of the hearing, state prosecutor Sipra informed the judge that a baton was recovered from Shershah. However, he added, Shershah’s mobile, tear gas mask and social media accounts were yet to be recovered.
At this point, Advocate Umer asserted that his client was falsely accused and “his arrest in the case was illegal”. “The court may reject the police’s request for physical remand,” he said.
“After 27 months, Shershah was not served even a single notice to record his statement,” Umer added. He noted that a court had previously discharged PTI senior leader Dr Yasmin Rashid from a case of a similar nature.
“We provided a copy of the same court in which, on similar facts, Dr Yasmin Rashid was discharged from this case,” Barrister Malik said on X.
 






Amnesty International and the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan have expressed their concerns over the arrests of Shahrez and Shershah, with the former terming them a “political witch-hunt”.
Shahrez’s wife has said her husband was in Chitral with her family on May 9, 2023, sharing purported pictures from the trip. At the same time, the PTI has challenged a video being shared of Shahrez, stating it was from the party’s public meeting in Kahna held on Sept 21, 2024, not from the 2023 riots.
Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry had defended the arrests last week, saying they could not be chalked off as “fake, fabricated [or] politically motivated”.
On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting Imran’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence.
Following the riots, the state launched a crackdown on the PTI, with thousands of protesters and top party leadership arrested. Scores of PTI leaders have recently been convicted in cases over the riots and disqualified from their parliamentary roles.</p><small>2025-08-28 16:48</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/28204902782bf11.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937945/canada-india-appoint-new-envoys-to-each-others-countries-in-sign-of-improving-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Canada, India appoint new envoys to each other’s countries in sign of improving ties</strong></a><br><p>Canada and India announced new high commissioners to each other’s countries on Thursday, in the latest sign of improving ties frayed by former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegation that India was linked to the killing of a Sikh separatist leader on Canadian soil.
India’s previous high commissioner left Canada in October. Ottawa said he was among six diplomats who were expelled after they were linked to the murder of separatist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, while India said it had withdrawn the envoy.
India also said that same day that it had ordered the expulsion of six high-ranking Canadian diplomats, including the then-acting high commissioner.
Trudeau’s successor, Mark Carney, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi agreed to reinstate senior diplomats when they held their first bilateral meeting in Canada in June.
Canada’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday that veteran diplomat Christopher Cooter would take up the post, which had been vacant since the previous incumbent left last year.
“The appointment of a new high commissioner reflects Canada’s step-by-step approach to deepening diplomatic engagement and advancing bilateral cooperation with India,” Foreign Minister Anita Anand said in a statement.
 






India’s foreign ministry said its new high commissioner, Dinesh K Patnaik, was “expected to take up the assignment shortly”.
Nijjar, who was designated a terrorist by India in 2020, was shot dead outside a Sikh temple in June 2023.
Trudeau in September of that year said Canada was pursuing “credible allegations” linking Indian government agents to his murder, but India dismissed the claims and accused Canada of providing a safe haven for Sikh separatists.
Canada has the largest population of Sikhs outside India’s Punjab.
India is Canada’s top source of temporary foreign workers and international students, as well as an important market for pulses such as lentils and yellow peas.
Canadian Prime Minister Carney has stressed the importance of diversifying trade away from the United States.
The appointment of a new high commissioner came a day after United States President Donald Trump’s doubling of tariffs on imports from India to as much as 50 per cent took effect, delivering a serious blow to ties.</p><small>2025-08-28 15:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620810-watch-families-await-evacuation-as-sutlej-flood-submerges-villages-in-bahawalnagar' target='_blank'><strong>WATCH: Stranded families eye aid as Sutlej flood submerges villages in Bahawalnagar</strong></a><br><p>

Super featherweight Shigetoshi Kotari and lightweight Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, fought separate bouts on the same card at Tokyo’s Korakuen Hall on August 2 and died days later following brain surgery.
 
 

Another Japanese boxer died after a bout in Tokyo in December 2023 and one more has been in a coma since May this year.
The twin tragedies this month sent shockwaves through Japanese boxing, with authorities scrambling to investigate and under pressure to tighten safety.
Although no clear causes for the deaths have been identified, several factors have emerged that paint a high-risk picture of Japan’s boxing scene.
“I believe it is safe but the results are everything,” Hideyuki Ohashi, manager and promoter of Japan’s undisputed super bantamweight world champion Naoya Inoue, told AFP.
“Three people have died (since December 2023) and that’s nothing to be proud of.”
Following the latest deaths, governing body the Japan Boxing Commission (JBC) held emergency meetings with the Japan Pro Boxing Association (JPBA), which represents boxing gym owners.
One issue under the microscope is the practice of boxers dehydrating to rapidly lose weight before a weigh-in, then putting it back on before a fight.
The practice is regarded as a factor in making the brain more susceptible to bleeding, the World Boxing Association says.
JBC secretary-general Tsuyoshi Yasukochi says the practice — which is also common in other countries — has only become widespread in Japan in recent years and its “safety is not fully understood”.
“We held classes on dehydration last year where the figure we presented was two to four per cent (of a boxer’s body weight) at the very most,” he told AFP.
“Japanese boxers nowadays lose 10 to 12pc in just a few days. I think that’s very dangerous.”

All-out attack
Unlike in Britain, where authorities can ban fighters who use saunas to dehydrate, Japanese boxing officials can only warn fighters whose weight drastically changes between a weigh-in and a fight.
Officials in Japan are proposing a rule forcing those who regain more than 10pc of their body weight to move up a weight class for their next bout.
There is no uniform rule in world boxing about how much weight a fighter can lose and then pile back on.
The JPBA says more data needs to be analysed before a conclusion can be reached about the best way to tackle it.
“What happens if we enforce a rule where a fighter isn’t allowed to gain more than 10pc of their weight and then they go into a world title fight where they’re facing someone who that rule doesn’t apply to?” said JPBA official and gym owner Kazuhiro Ryuko.
“It makes it pointless to aim for the top and in fact it only increases the risks.”
Other safety measures under consideration include restrictions on sparring, which JBC chief Yasukochi says is “much more intense” in Japan than other countries.
He says it typifies the attitude of Japanese boxers, who “never give up, no matter what”.
He also believes that more Japanese fighters are focusing on attack at the expense of building defensive skills.
“Japanese boxers attack from the first round, it’s not about strategising and taking your time,” said Yasukochi.
“As soon as the bell rings, they go straight in and attack.
“That’s become the mainstream approach and I think it’s one reason why they take damage.”

Lost trust
Boxing in Japan has a history of more than 100 years and has developed in different ways from other countries in some respects.
Everyone involved in the sport in the country, from fighters to trainers and managers, must belong to a boxing club, of which there are over 150 in Tokyo alone.
Clubs must apply to the JBC for members’ licences and Yasukochi says requests have historically been rubber-stamped with little scrutiny because of a “long-standing relationship of trust”.
After the latest deaths, he says stricter oversight must be introduced.
“I feel that this trust is gradually being lost,” said Yasukochi.
The JBC and JPBA hope to announce concrete safety measures in September, with issues including ambulance availability and the use of MRI scans also under discussion.
All parties have stressed the need to act quickly and admit that the future of Japanese boxing is at stake.
“I think it’s really difficult to reduce the number of accidents to zero,” said the JPBA official and gym owner Ryuko.
“But the JPBA, the JBC and everyone involved in boxing needs to think about how to make it as close to zero as possible. “</p><small>2025-08-28 13:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/28175715c7d4d39.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937925/pti-chairman-barrister-gohar-resigns-from-4-na-standing-committees' target='_blank'><strong>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar resigns from 4 NA standing committees</strong></a><br><p>PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan on Thursday resigned from four standing committees in the National Assembly (NA), he confirmed in comments to Dawn.com.
PTI lawmakers have begun resigning from membership and chairmanship of all standing committees in the NA after instructions from party founder Imran Khan, after the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in July and August disqualified a large number of PTI members and leaders in relation to their involvement in the May 9, 2023 riots against Imran’s arrest.
“I resigned from the committees based on the instructions of the PTI founder and the political committee,” Gohar said over the phone. “I submitted my resignation to the speaker’s office and resigned from the committees on law and justice, human rights, IT and the House Business Advisory Committee.”
PTI Chief Whip Aamir Dogar also announced his resignation from NA standing committees in a post on X, where he wrote that he submitted the resignations upon the instructions of the party founder and ex-premier.
“I am a true soldier of Imran Khan, and no position holds more meaning than my leader,” he wrote. “The sole purpose of my politics is Imran Khan’s mission, Pakistan’s true independence and service to the people.”
He enclosed a photo of his resignation letter with the X post, which outlined that he resigned from the NA standing committees on religious affairs and interfaith harmony, the Public Accounts Committee, energy (Power Division) and the committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges.
 






Meanwhile, NA Director General (Media) Zafar Sultan Khan confirmed to Dawn.com that 18 PTI members, including Gohar, resigned from standing committees.
“Barrister Gohar submitted the resignations of 18 PTI members, including himself, from standing committees,” he said in a voice note, adding that PTI members are part of 34 standing committees in the House.
The list of resigning PTI members, provided by DG Sultan, is as follows:

Amjad Ali Khan
Sahibzada Sibghatullah
Mahboob Shah
Junaid Akbar
Gohar Ali Khan
Shahzada Muhammad Gustasap Khan
Ali Jadoon
Mujahid Ali
Malik Anwar Taj
Fazal Muhammad Khan
Sajid Khan
Arbab Amir Ayub
Asif Khan
Sheikh Waqas Akram
Arshad Sahi
Malik Aamir Dogar
Shabir Ali Qureshi
Awais Jhakkar

Yesterday, DG Sultan told Dawn.com that Ali Asghar Khan and Faisal Amin had sent their resignations as standing committee members to NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq.
A statement from Dogar also said: “PTI members of the National Assembly have started acting on the instructions of founding chairman Imran Khan. PTI members of standing committees have started sending their resignations. Many members have submitted their resignations to the National Assembly Secretariat.”
However, a senior official in the secretariat, on condition of anonymity, said that the speaker had yet to receive any of the resignation letters.
The resignation announcement took place following a meeting of PTI’s political committee that ended at 3:30am on Wednesday, according to PTI MNA Sanaullah Khan Mastikhel.</p><small>2025-08-28 13:30</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/281803249713171.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937923/detained-norwegian-teenager-planned-mosque-attack-in-oslo-police' target='_blank'><strong>Detained Norwegian teenager planned mosque attack in Oslo: police</strong></a><br><p>A Norwegian teenager detained after the killing of an Ethiopian-origin worker at an Oslo hostel also planned an attack on a mosque, police said on Thursday.
The 18-year-old was arrested after the killing on Saturday night of Tamima Nibras Juhar, a 34-year-old social worker, at the Oslo hostel where she was a staff member and the suspect was a resident.
The youth is now the subject of a murder and terrorism enquiry after police said he had expressed “opinions hostile to Muslim people”.
The suspect “declared that he had the intention of committing an attack against a mosque at Hoenefoss”, a town about 60 kilometres (40 miles) north of the Norwegian capital, police said in a statement.
“It is important to stress that there are still many indications that the suspect’s capacity to carry out further attacks was limited,” police added.
The youth was said to have acted alone.
He has been identified by media as German national Djordje Wilms, who moved to Norway from Serbia as a child, although police have not confirmed these elements.
Norway has been marked by extreme-right-wing attacks in recent years.
In 2011, neo-Nazi Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people by setting off a bomb in Oslo and then opening fire at a youth festival on the island of Utoya.

Established in 1971, USC was a state-owned enterprise tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households, and operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide. It formally ceased operations at the end of July.
A press release by the government’s finance division today said that the grant represented a “major step in responsibly addressing the longstanding financial burden of USC on the national exchequer”, adding that it also safeguarded the interests of employees affected by the closure.
“By approving severance, compensation and payment of outstanding dues, the government is ensuring that workers receive their entitlements, thereby cushioning the social and economic impact of USC’s winding up,” the press release said.
The committee was chaired by the finance minister, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb.
Also in attendance were Food Security Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari in virtual attendance, and the special assistant to the Prime Minister for industries and production, Haroon Akhtar Khan, as well as federal secretaries and senior officials from concerned ministries, departments and regulatory institutions.
According to the release, the ECC decided that the Ministry of Industries and Production would further rationalise the financial requirements for the closure of USC.
 
 

“It was further decided that the assets of USC, including properties, shall be disposed of within the current financial year so that the costs of closure are partially met through sale proceeds,” it added.
The cabinet body also underlined the importance of carrying out the closure in an “orderly and transparent manner”, including partially meeting liabilities via the disposal of USC properties.
“The approved financial package underscores the government’s commitment to protecting employees’ welfare while ensuring fiscal discipline in the winding down of USC’s operations,” it said.
Earlier this week, the National Assembly Standing Committee on Privatisation was informed that the government would ensure the payment of Rs27 billion in dues to USC’s employees and vendors in two phases following its closure, which put 11,000 jobs on the line.
Last week, the Public Accounts Committee urged the government to strengthen the management and controls of USC instead of shutting it down, warning that such a move would render thousands jobless.</p><small>2025-08-28 12:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620791-pm-stresses-urgent-need-for-new-water-storage-infrastructure-to-keep-floods-at-bay' target='_blank'><strong>PM stresses urgent need for water storage infrastructure to keep floods at bay</strong></a><br><p>

The 2026 final will be played at the Puskas Arena on Saturday, May 30.
“An earlier kick-off makes day trips more feasible, reduces travel stress, and allows fans to enjoy the occasion without worrying about late-night logistics,” said Ronan Evain, executive director for Football Supporters Europe, which worked on the subject with UEFA.
 






Unlike the Europa League and Conference League finals, which are played in midweek, the Champions League showpiece has been held on Saturdays since 2010.
“While a 21:00 CET kick-off is well suited for midweek matches, an earlier kick-off on a Saturday for the final means an earlier finish — regardless of extra time or penalties,” said UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin.

Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. Challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed the progress of eradication efforts. The vaccinators, who go door-to-door to inoculate children, are frequently targeted by militants, esp­e­cially in KP and Balochistan. In 2024 alone, 20 people were killed and 53 were injured during anti-polio campaigns in the KP.
On August 26, two new cases were reported in the south of the province, taking KP’s total polio cases for this year to 15, while the nationwide tally stands at 23.
The immunisation campaign was formally launched today at Peshawar Police Services Hospital, where the KP Adviser on Health Ehtesham Ali, while speaking to the media, said, “We have developed a more organised and strategic approach this time, especially in areas where cases have recently been reported.”
 
 

He noted that out of 15 polio cases in KP, 13 were reported in the south of the province. Detailing the campaign, Ali shared that it will be conducted in two phases.
The first phase of the immunisation campaign will run for four days, starting from September 1, and is set to fully cover Peshawar, Mardan, Swabi, Nowshera, and Charsadda, including 16  other districts, while another three districts will be covered partially, according to data provided by the KP health department.
The second phase will run for three days and is set to begin from Sept 15, aiming to target Bannu, Bajaur, and seven districts of the Dera Ismail Khan division.
The seven-day campaign — which aims to immunise 5.7m children — will engage 27,000 polio teams, while 40,000 security personnel are to be deployed for their protection.
Ali highlighted that, “While the world has largely eradicated polio, we are still facing challenges in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.“
“Committees have been formed to engage and convince reluctant parents, and efforts are underway to address local resistance,“ he added.
The health adviser cited misinformation, refusal by parents to vaccinate their children, and particularly security risks as reasons for the slow progress of eradication efforts.
“Insecurity in certain districts has made it difficult to consistently run successful campaigns,” the advisor said, adding that while teams may be facing security issues, the government has planned strategies accordingly.
On that note, he said that the KP government had launched a polio campaign in South Waziristan after two years, adding that the merged districts and the south were regions where polio teams faced the most resistance.
Echoing similar concerns, KP Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah, who was also present at the event, noted that merged districts and the south of the province are where polio teams face the most resistance.
“Our teams are facing real challenges, but the government and the Pakistan Army are actively helping to maintain law and order in these sensitive areas,” he said.
Stressing the importance of routine immunisations, Shah said, “Strengthening overall healthcare services is essential to controlling not just polio, but other preventable diseases as well.”
“When one child contracts polio, the entire family suffers — both emotionally and economically,” he remarked.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-08-28 10:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/68af841e24e51.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937734/evacuation-planned-as-sindh-braces-for-high-flood-in-indus-river' target='_blank'><strong>Evacuation planned as Sindh braces for high flood in Indus River</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: As Punjab was severely hit by flooding after heavy rains and excess water released by India from its dams, the Sindh government on Wednesday braced for high flood risk and established ministerial committees comprising elected representatives to deal with the developing situation.
Official sources told Dawn that the Pakistan Peoples Party government mobilised its elected representatives in Sindh, appointing provincial ministers as focal persons to oversee the right and left banks of the Indus River within their respective jurisdictions.
Fearing mass evacuation, the government also instructed the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) to arrange necessary logistics such as boats, tents, ration bags, medicines and machinery, the officials said.
The health department has been asked to mobilise medical teams to counter potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases.

KMC asked to arrange safe shelters in Karachi; Guddu and Sukkur barrages face ‘very high flood’ threat from Sept 4 to 5

Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah convened a meeting and directed all relevant authorities to remain alert and ensure full implementation of the Provincial Monsoon Contingency Plan 2025, the officials added.
 
 

The chief minister said that the warning of exceptionally high flood levels in the Indus could not be taken lightly. “Our first priority is saving lives and livelihoods, and we must remain in constant coordination with the NDMA and federal agencies,” he added.
The CM also asked all MPAs from districts along the Indus River to remain in their constituencies over the next week and maintain close coordination with the designated focal persons.
The chief minister told the meeting participants that the Flood Forecasting Division of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, in its Weekly Significant Weather Outlook for Rivers’ Catchments (28th Aug–3rd Sep 2025), had warned of very high to exceptionally high flood levels in eastern rivers due to heavy rainfall over the upper catchments and water releases from Indian dams.
He said that the Indus River at Guddu and Sukkur was expected to attain very high flood levels from Sept 4 to Sept 5, which could pose a significant threat to the province.
The chief minister instructed divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), and relevant departments to remain on 24-hour alert and take immediate measures to protect embankments and vulnerable communities.
The health department has been instructed to immediately deploy medical teams and carry out preventive vaccination campaigns against waterborne diseases.
The Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), local bodies, and rescue officials have been directed to ensure emergency evacuations, provide heavy machinery, and arrange safe shelters for those affected by the floodwaters.
The chief minister emphasised that all institutions must maintain full coordination with the National Disaster Management Authority and federal authorities.
Focal persons
The focal persons will be responsible for directly monitoring the situation, coordinating relief efforts, and ensuring the implementation of flood mitigation measures in their designated areas.
For the area from Guddu to Sukkur, Excise and Taxation Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla has been appointed as the focal person for the right bank, while Agriculture, Sports and Youth Affairs Minister Sardar Muhammad Bakhsh Mehar will oversee the left bank.
For the area from Sukkur to Kotri, Industries and Commerce Minister Jam Ikramullah Khan Dharejo will oversee the right bank, while Energy and Planning Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah will oversee the left bank.
Below Kotri, Religious Affairs, Zakat and Ushr Minister Riaz Hussain Shah Shirazi has been appointed as the focal person for the right bank, while Livestock and Fisheries Minister Muhammad Ali Malkani will oversee the left bank.
Governor
Governor of Sindh Kamran Khan Tessori termed India’s release of water into Pakistan’s rivers as “water terrorism” against the country.
Speaking to the media at Governor House, Governor of Sindh Kamran Khan Tessori, accompanied by senior MQM Pakistan leader Anees Qaimkhani and others, said that India’s “water terrorism” had caused flooding in the Chenab and Ravi Rivers, and its impact will soon be felt at Kotri Barrage in Sindh and other downstream areas.
He appealed to philanthropists and wealthy individuals to reach out to flood-hit areas and extend assistance to the affected families.

In a court order dated Aug 26, seen by Dawn.com, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi said that the prosecution’s evidence was discarded, noting it was “deficient of trustworthiness”.
“The sentence and conviction of the appellant is set aside. He be released forthwith if not required in any other case,” the order read.
In 2010, the suspect’s minor daughter informed her mother and maternal uncle that “her own father had committed rape with her”, according to the order.
It stated that on October 2, 2010, the victim, aged six or seven, went to her mother in tears and disclosed that her father, the appellant, had committed a “wrong act” with her, after which she felt severe pain.
Subsequently, the father was arrested and sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 376(1) of the Pakistan Penal Code and a fine of Rs35,000. The sentence was upheld by the Lahore High Court in 2013.
The suspect had approached the SC against the LHC’s decision. The case was heard by a three-member bench today.
The order noted that the mother’s case was that the daughter was “subjected to rape by the appellant at 2:00pm”, but the victim’s statement “creates doubt about her credibility and, therefore, requires strong corroboration”.
It further read, “According to the complainant (mother), the victim was brought to the hospital where she was examined in her presence.
“However, the doctor’s opinion is self-contradictory as in her examination in chief she stated that the victim was subjected to rape but in the cross-examination she categorically stated that on the basis of chemical examiner’s report, no rape was found to have been committed with her.”
Justice Najafi stated, “This leaves the court to a serious question on the credibility of the statement of the victim and the possibility of false implication of the appellant. Why such serious allegations were levelled against the appellant, may be due to the fact came on record that there was a dispute between the complainant and the appellant …”
The judge also mentioned that the trial court did not put the Rationality Test to the victim before recording her statement, stating, “… a child is a competent witness if he/she passes a standard of sufficient maturity of understanding about the facts which were to be narrated by her”.
“A note/observation by the court, based on the relevant questions and their answers would make such statement credible,” the order read, noting that the victim’s statement “needs strong corroboration”.
Despite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.
Last year, data gathered by Sahil, an NGO working on cases of child sexual abuse, revealed that the overwhelming majority of abusers are acquaintances or neighbours in communities or family members.
In March, four suspects who raped and killed an 11-year-old girl in Bahawalpur were traced as the victim’s relatives, with two of them being maternal uncles.</p><small>2025-08-28 09:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/28131523623636c.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1937863/2-suspects-allegedly-involved-in-raiwind-brothers-murder-case-killed-in-ccd-encounter-lawyer' target='_blank'><strong>2 suspects allegedly involved in Raiwind brothers’ murder case killed in CCD ‘encounter’: lawyer</strong></a><br><p>Two men arrested for torturing two brothers in a Rs30 dispute with street vendors in Raiwind were killed in an “encounter” with the Crimes Control Department (CCD), the victims’ lawyer said on Thursday.
The incident came to light after a video clip showing street vendors subjecting both brothers to torture went viral on social media. The suspected attackers were spotted holding clubs in their hands and beating the victims at a public place in Raiwind. One brother died of severe torture marks at the spot, while the other succumbed to his injuries on Sunday.
Ali Ahmed Awan, the lawyer representing the victims’ father, told Dawn.com a day prior that a total of six suspects were named in the case, out of which three — including the main suspect — had been arrested.
“Two of the suspects, Owais and Shahzad, were killed in a police encounter after their accomplices attempted to attack the police,” Awan said today. “The CCD is still searching for the rest of the suspects.”
No case has been registered regarding the police encounter yet, he said.
On August 22, a first information report (FIR) was filed on the complaint of the victims’ father at the Raiwind City Police Station under Sections 147 (punishment for rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 302 (murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.
According to the FIR, the incident occurred on August 21 at 5:45pm when the brothers were returning home and stopped to buy some fruit.
“Due to a dispute over money, the owner of the fruit cart … and his brother … began beating my sons and called some other people,” the complainant said.</p><small>2025-08-28 08:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620759-imran-khans-nephew-sent-on-14-day-judicial-remand-in-may-9-case' target='_blank'><strong>Imran Khan's nephew sent on 14-day judicial remand in May 9 case</strong></a><br><p>

Under a proposed change, foreigners would not be allowed to stay for more than four years on student visas in the US.
Foreign journalists would be limited to stays of just 240 days, although they could apply to extend by additional 240-day periods — except for Chinese journalists who would get just 90 days.
The US, until now, has generally issued visas for the duration of a student’s educational programme or a journalist’s assignment, although no non-immigrant visas are valid for more than 10 years.
 
 

The proposed changes were published in the Federal Register, initiating a short period for public comment before they can go into effect.
Trump’s Department of Homeland Security alleged that an unspecified number of foreigners were indefinitely extending their studies so they could remain in the country as “‘forever’ students.”
“For too long, past administrations have allowed foreign students and other visa holders to remain in the US virtually indefinitely, posing safety risks, costing untold amount of taxpayer dollars and disadvantaging US citizens,” the department said in a press statement Wednesday.
The department did not explain how US citizens and taxpayers were hurt by international students, who according to Commerce Department statistics contributed more than $50 billion to the US economy in 2023.
The United States welcomed more than 1.1 million international students in the 2023-24 academic year, more than any other country, providing a crucial source of revenue as foreigners generally pay full tuition.
A group representing leaders of US colleges and universities denounced the latest move as a needless bureaucratic hurdle that intrudes on academic decision-making and could further deter potential students who would otherwise contribute to research and job creation.
“This proposed rule sends a message to talented individuals from around the world that their contributions are not valued in the United States,” said Miriam Feldblum, president and CEO of the Presidents’ Alliance on Higher Education and Immigration.
“This is not only detrimental to international students — it also weakens the ability of US colleges and universities to attract top talent, diminishing our global competitiveness.”
Backlash
The announcement came as universities were starting their academic years with many reporting lower enrollments of international students after earlier actions by the Trump administration.
But Trump also heard rare criticism within his base when he mused Monday that he would like to double the number of Chinese students in the United States to 600,000 as he hailed warm relations with counterpart Xi Jinping.
His remarks marked a sharp departure from Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s earlier vow to “aggressively” rescind visas of Chinese students.
The State Department said last week it had overall revoked 6,000 student visas since Trump took office, in part due to Rubio’s targeting of campus activists who led demonstrations against Israel.
 
 

Trump has also suspended billions of dollars in federal research funds to universities, with his administration contending they have not acted against antisemitism, and Congress has sharply raised taxes on private universities’ endowments.
In a speech before he was elected, Vice President JD Vance said conservatives must attack universities, which he described as “the enemy.”
Trump, at the end of his first term, had proposed curbing the duration of journalist visas, but his successor Joe Biden scrapped the idea.</p><small>2025-08-28 07:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/620760-saeed-ghanis-brother-remand-extended-by-three-days-in-govt-employee-assault-case' target='_blank'><strong>Saeed Ghani's brother remand extended by three days in govt employee assault case</strong></a><br><p>

• Irsa director says flood of about 650,000 cusecs likely at Guddu if current situation persists
HYDERABAD: As Sindh anticipates a very high flood between Sept 1 and 3 at Guddu Barrage — its first barrage on the Indus River — due to the swollen eastern rivers currently wreaking havoc in Punjab, the downstream province has asked the authorities to reduce outflows from Tarbela Dam to help it manage the deluge.
As multiple rivers submerge Punjab, Sindh has reached out to the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) to reduce outflows from Tarbela and retain water at Chashma Barrage — a request accepted by the authority.
The provincial irrigation authorities are keeping an eye on flows generated in the Chenab, Sutlej, and Ravi rivers, as all these rivers converge in the Indus at Mithankot after passing the Panjnad Barrage built over the Jhelum River. At Panjnad, all tributaries of the Indus meet on their way to the sea through Sindh.
“As of today, I foresee a flow of between 650,000 and 700,000 cusecs at Guddu Barrage once the flows start reaching here from the eastern rivers,” Jam Khan, Sindh’s irrigation minister, told Dawn on the phone from Karachi. “Right now it is a guessing game because nobody knows how the rainfall pattern behaves but we are making full preparations and accordingly managing staff at the dykes,” he added.
Zarif Kharif, the Sindh irrigation secretary, said a similar situation was witnessed in 2014 when Khanki Barrage on Chenab reported 947,000 cusecs flow on Sept 7, 2014 and Sindh had received about 475,000 cusecs.
“This time, the situation is a bit different because Guddu passed a high flood of 510,798 cusecs on Aug 24. As of Wednesday, Guddu was still showing an upstream discharge of 335,196 cusecs, he said, adding that the flows would increase once water from Punjab reached the barrage.
 
 

In order to manage the surge, the secretary confirmed that they reached out to Irsa Director Operations Khalid Idrees Rana for controlling outflows at Tarbela. An outflow of 154,500 cusecs was recorded at Tarbela at 6am on Wednesday, which notably increased to 256,200 cusecs at 6pm. This, coupled with the Kabul River, will reach Sindh’s barrages within a few days.
Tarbela Dam had attained the maximum storage level of 1,550 feet on Aug 21. After Irsa started discharging flows, the dam’s level stood at 1549.66ft on Wednesday at 6pm. Against this backdrop, the irrigation secretary asked Irsa to retain water at Chashma so that Sindh could manage its flows from the swollen eastern rivers.
“Yes, we have reduced flows from Tarbela (at Sindh’s request), where 155,000 cusecs outflow was recorded at 8pm Wednesday,” the Irsa operations director told Dawn. He also confirmed that “storage can be taken slightly higher than maximum storage of 1,550 feet. We can take it to 1550.2 or 1550.3 feet for now,” he argued.
He said that a positive sign was that there were no back-up flows in the Chenab. “We are observing nullahs like Palkhu, Basantpur and Bhimber currently,” he said. He pointed out that in view of the current situation, a flood of 650,000 cusecs or so was likely at Guddu and that too may last five to six hours. “We are struggling to manage flows in a way that Guddu’s discharge should remain below 600,000 cusecs.”
