The van, carrying 12 passengers, was coming from Hajera in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and plunged into the river while navigating a turn near Garari Bridge in the Kahuta area of Rawalpindi on Thursday morning, as per Rescue 1122 sources.
According to Rescue 1122, four people have been confirmed among the drowned.
District Emergency Officer 1122 Rawalpindi Sighbatullah said that four people have been rescued so far and were rushed to the Kahuta Tehsil Hospital in Rawalpindi.
Superintendent THQ hospital, Dr Samina, also confirmed that the rescued persons had been shifted to the medical facility.
The Rescue 1122 official also confirmed that “four bodies of the drowned victims, including a female, had been retrieved and shifted to hospitals, where their identity was being ascertained”.
He added that the van had been pulled out of the water, and a search for the other passengers was underway.

Meanwhile, Commissioner Rawalpindi, Engineer Amir Khattak, directed all relevant authorities, including health, Rescue 1122, traffic police and tehsil administration to launch a coordinated operation for the rescue of the passengers.
The rescue operation continued till dusk, as low-light conditions did not allow divers to search for the missing. Rescue officials said the search will resume at first light on Friday, but expressed fear that the river’s current may have carried away the missing passengers.
Assistant Commissioner Kahuta Ayesha Zafar, speaking to Dawn, said three or four passengers were still missing and the rescue operation will resume tomorrow morning.
On August 24 last year, a fatal accident at the same Garari bridge claimed 24 lives after a bus plunged into the river, while in another accident over 14 passengers were seriously injured in a bus accident in the area on the Kahuta- Hajera AJK road in October 2024.
Following these accidents, the district authorities of police and traffic had launched a drive to inspect the condition of the public service vehicles (PSVs); however, it ended after a few months.
In November last year, 22 people drowned after a bus carrying them plunged into a river in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Diamer district.</p><small>2025-12-11 14:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/111608079ddf897.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960509/pm-shehbaz-reaches-turkmenistan-on-2-day-visit-will-hold-bilateral-meeting-with-president-berdymukhamedov-today' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz reaches Turkmenistan on 2-day visit, will hold bilateral meeting with President Berdymukhamedov today</strong></a><br><p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday arrived in Turkmenistan on a two-day official visit, a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office said.
It added that the premier was undertaking the visit at the invitation of Turkmenistan President Serdar Berdymukhamedov, with whom he would hold a bilateral meeting today.
PM Shehbaz and the delegation accompanying him were welcomed by Mammetkhan Chakyev, Turkmenistan’s deputy chairman of cabinet ministers, the PMO statement added.
It said that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Power Minister Sardar Awais Ahmed Khan Leghari, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, Tariq Fatemi, a key aid to the PM, and Special Assistant to the PM Talha Burki were part of the delegation accompanying the premier.







Moreover, the PM would also attend during his trip a “forum organised in Ashgabat to mark the International Year of Peace and Trust 2025, the International Day of Neutrality, and the 30th anniversary of Turkmenistan’s permanent neutrality”.
United Nations had granted Turkmenistan the status of a neutral country in 1995. UN defines neutrality as “the legal status arising from the abstention of a state from all participation in a war between other states, the maintenance of an attitude of impartiality toward the belligerents, and the recognition by the belligerents of this abstention and impartiality”.
Earlier, state broadcaster PTV News reported that PM Shehbaz would also hold bilateral meetings with other world leaders attending the forum in Ashgabat.</p><small>2025-12-11 13:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/1115124560d4e5a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960507/just-the-beginning-journalists-politicians-react-to-faiz-hameeds-sentencing' target='_blank'><strong>‘Just the beginning’: Journalists, politicians react to Faiz Hameed’s sentencing</strong></a><br><p>In a rare conviction, former spymaster Faiz Hameed was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years rigorous imprisonment under the Army Act.
Hameed, who served as the chief of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency from 2019 to 2021, was under trial since August last year.
The statement released by the military’s media affairs wing stated Hameed was found guilty of charges related to engaging in political activities, violation of the Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority and government resources and causing wrongful loss to persons.
However, his troubles may not be over as the statement added that his “involvement of [the] convict in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”.
Here is what analysts and politicians have to say.
‘Took political engineering to its peak’
Senior journalist Shahzeb Khanzada, while speaking to Geo News, was of the opinion that “Pakistan has always had a problem of political engineering, but Faiz Hameed took it to its peak”.
“He set a precedent for manipulating the judiciary,” Khanzada said, recalling the disqualification of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
The journalist also held Hameed responsible for “harming the country, democracy, media, judiciary, and his own institution”.
Khanzada noted that out of the four charges mentioned in the statement released by the ISPR today, “legal proceedings against him regarding his involvement in politics remain to be seen”.
“Faiz Hameed is a character in Pakistan’s history who left no stone unturned in harming the country, democracy, and in misusing his authority,” Khanzada added.
‘Good beginning’
Journalist Mubashir Zaidi, reacting to the decision, said that Hameed’s conviction was a “good beginning”.
“Life sentencing of former ISI chief Gen Faiz Hameed for involvement in politics is a good beginning. There shouldn’t be any room for the military’s involvement in politics,” he said.







‘Ominous and critical’
Meanwhile, journalist Khurram Husain termed the last paragraph in ISPR’s press release “critical and ominous”.
The paragraph states that the former spymaster’s involvement in “fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”.
According to Husain, “It could point towards using Faiz Hameed’s testimony to convict [former prime minister] Imran Khan on charges of conspiring to incite mutiny within the armed forces.”







‘Historic decision’
PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari termed the sentencing of the ex-spymaster a “historic decision”.
Speaking to the media in Chiniot, he said Hameed was “today being held answerable for his crimes”.
Mentioning Hameed’s alleged “interference [in politics]” and “irresponsible acts”, he said that if today’s decision was implemented, it would be a “clear message that such mistakes will not be committed again”.
‘Just the beginning’
Senator Faisal Vawda hailed the decision, stating that “it was only the beginning” as charges pertaining to May 9 riots still remained to be seen.
Speaking to Geo News, Vawda thanked the Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Asim Munir for “removing the filth” from his own institution, stressing that the move had laid down the “foundation for self-accountability”.
He further said that those responsible for facilitating violent protests in the country on May 9 would also be weeded out.
He cautioned that if the armed forces were “not sparing one of their own, then do you think the others will stay safe?”
“This is just the beginning,” he said, adding that “a lot of charges were still pending”.
“And within the radius of the charges will be the PTI, and their leaders who think they are bigger than Pakistan, the judges from that time, and people who have now distanced themselves.
“It will be a long, winding process of justice,” the senator warned.
‘No one should be a sacred cow’
Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmad Khan also hailed the conviction, questioning if “similar action will be taken against other generals too”.
In a post on X, he said, “It’s a very good thing that a decision has been taken against a general … no one should be a sacred cow, whether it be a judge, a general, a bureaucrat, or a politician.”
He called for “transparent, fair and public” accountability to prevail.







‘Far-reaching impact on politics’
Journalist Mazhar Abbas, in a post on social media platform X, said that today’s decision was likely to have a “far-reaching impact on Pakistani politics”.
“One has to wait and see what follows next. Today’s decision would certainly have a far-reaching impact on Pakistan’s politics. Can’t say but perhaps, he still has a right to appeal to the Supreme Court,” Abbas said.
“We still await to see the details of this important trial and verdict,” he added.







‘How the mighty fall’
Columnist Nadeem Farooq Paracha, in a post on X, said that the former spymaster had “used his position to cultivate a network of politicians, journalists and judges”.
“The expectation of a ‘revolution’ on May 9, 2023, shaped by this network, strengthened the fantasy of IK’s ‘inevitable’ return,” Paracha said.
“The fielding set by him has now been dismantled. How the mighty fall,” he added.







‘A positive development’
Senior lawyer Muhammad Ahsan Bhoon termed the decision a “positive development” while speaking to Geo News.
“It is a positive development that the army is holding even a lieutenant general accountable, as it strengthens the overall accountability system,” he said.
Bhoon added that the “decision was made on the basis of an internal accountability process, and that all provisions of the Army Act and all legal formalities were fully observed”.
“This also sends a message to other institutions that, whether the matter concerns the judiciary or the bureaucracy, the same standards should be followed,” he said.
“If someone is found guilty of corruption or of misusing their authority, it is encouraging to see that they are being punished accordingly.
“If other departments adopt similar procedures, the country will have a much stronger system of accountability and justice,” he added.</p><small>2025-12-11 13:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638779-minister-warns-social-media-platforms-of-enforcing-brazil-style-rules' target='_blank'><strong>Minister warns social media platforms of enforcing 'Brazil-style rules'</strong></a><br><p>

On Monday night, unidentified militants blew up a government primary school in the Khushali area of Ayaz Kot. Unknown attackers had planted explosives in the school and detonated them late on Monday night.
The powerful blast, which was heard miles away, destroyed a significant portion of the school building.
Education department officials confirmed that more than 600 students were enrolled in the institution, which served as the only functional primary school in the area.
Authorities said the remaining sections of the building have been cordoned off, while an emergency plan for alternate learning arrangements is under consideration.
Local elders and parents expressed deep concern, calling attacks on educational institutions “a direct assault on the future of children”.
“This school was the only beacon of hope for our children. Its destruction has shocked the entire community,” an area elder said.
As per the police, evidence had been collected from the site, and the Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU) was assessing the type of explosive used.
Initial findings suggest that the device was detonated either through a remote-controlled or a timed mechanism.
Security officials stated that the area has been cordoned off and a search operation has been launched.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far.
The district administration condemned the incident as an “anti-education act,” saying, “Such attacks hinder peace and development in the region. Those responsible will be brought to justice soon.”
The incident comes weeks after Cadet College Wana came under a terrorist attack in South Waziristan.
In October, an explosion at a girls’ primary school in Lakki Marwat district partially damaged the building.
Last year in May, a private girls’ school was blown up by unidentified militants in Tehsil Shewa of North Waziristan district. Similar attacks also took place in May 2023 when two government schools for girls in Mirali were blown up. No loss of life was reported in the incidents.</p><small>2025-12-11 12:13</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638759-two-children-killed-several-injured-in-north-waziristan-madrassah-blast' target='_blank'><strong>Two children killed, several injured in North Waziristan madrassah blast</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said that the process of Field General Court Martial (FGCM) was initiated against Hameed on August 12, 2024 under provisions of the Pakistan Army Act, spanning over 15 months.
“The accused was tried on four charges related to engaging in political activities, violation of the Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority and government resources and causing wrongful loss to persons.
“After lengthy and laborious legal proceedings, the accused has been found guilty on all charges and sentenced to 14 years rigorous imprisonment,” ISPR said.
It added that the sentence was “promulgated on December 11, 2025”.
During proceedings against the ex-spymaster, the FGCM complied with all legal provisions, and Hameed was “afforded with all legal rights, including [the] rights of [a] defence team of his choice”, it added.
The convict has the right of appeal at a relevant forum, ISPR said.
According to Section 133B of the Army Act, a person to whom a court-martial has handed out a sentence of imprisonment exceeding three months may appeal against their conviction to a court of appeals “consisting of the [chief of the army staff concurrently the chief of the defence forces] or one or more officers designated by him in this behalf”.
It states that the appeal may be filed “within 40 days from the date of announcement of finding or sentence or promulgation thereof, whichever is earlier”.
ISPR also said that the “involvement of convict (Hameed) in fomenting vested political agitation and instability in cohorts with political elements and in certain other matters is separately being dealt with”.
Today’s development comes two months after ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said, in response to a question about Hameed, that legal proceedings were ongoing and would come to a “logical conclusion”.
“The Pakistan Army’s system of internal accountability does not work off allegations but facts and evidence. There is a process to it and anybody who is charged is given the complete right to defend themselves and that time will be given and is being given, so we are not worried about any delay because we have to fulfil all the requirements of justice and process,” he had said at a press conference in Peshawar on October 10.
Hameed, a former lieutenant general, was taken into custody in August 2024, as the military announced the initiation of FGCM proceedings against him.

 

The move was prompted by allegations of misconduct levelled by the owner of a private housing society and had shattered the long-standing perception that spy chiefs were untouchable in the country where generals have long wielded unparalleled influence.
In Dec 2024, a military court indicted Hameed on three accounts — engaging in political activities, violating anti-espionage laws, and abusing his authority. The indictment marked the start of the trial of the former intelligence chief before a FGCM.
At the time, the ISPR had said that “events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading to multiple incidents including, but not limited to May 9, 2023, for fomenting instability at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests” were also being investigated.
On May 9, 2023, violent protests were witnessed across the country following the arrest of former prime minister and PTI founder Imran Khan, during which military installations were also vandalised.
‘Hameed given full opportunity to defend himself’
After Hameed’s sentencing was announced, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said the former spy chief had also been penalised in the Top City case, in which Hameed was accused of misusing his position to extort money from a private housing society.
In a statement, Tarar said in a statement that the conviction of the ex-ISI chief was based on “evidence”.
“Today, the person who crossed the red line has been punished,” he added. The minister said Hameed was given “full opportunity” to defend himself during the trial and produce witnesses.
“After the statements of all witnesses were recorded and evidence was presented, a just verdict has been issued.”
Tarar further asserted that no one was above the law and legal action would be taken against anyone “who crosses the red line”.
He said Hameed had “misused his authority, and there will be further investigations into political matters”.
The minister also alleged that Hameed had been the PTI’s “political adviser”.
Tarar further stated: “The process of self-accountability within the army is very strong, and everyone has now seen a clear example of it. […] Today’s decision is a victory of truth and justice.”
Separately, speaking to Geo News, Tarar said today’s decision was “historic”.
He further stated that proceedings against Hameed spanned 15 months.
“It is a long duration. [During this time,] evidence and proofs were presented. And after the due process of law, this is a historical decision was made,” he added.
The minister said that after Hameed’s retirement from the army, he was prohibited from getting involved in politics. “But, he became PTI’s political adviser. He gave the party [his] full support,” Tarar repeated his allegation.
Asked whether any further action would be taken against Hameed, Tarar emphatically replied: “Yes, definitely.”
He went on to allege that “as a political adviser to PTI, he (Hameed) conspired against the country and spread anarchy to a great extent”.
“So much so that even beyond events like May 9, there are serious issues that will be investigated further against him. Another probe is underway into the extent and nature of Hameed’s involvement in politics.
“It’s not hidden that he was advising PTI and trying to weaken the state’s writ,” Tarar said.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif reacted to Hameed’s sentencing in a post on social media platform X. The minister commented in the post that the “nation will reap the harvest of seeds sown by Faiz Hameed sahib and [former army chief] Bajwa for years”.

The court issued the directives as a three-judge SC bench, headed by Justice Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar and comprising Justice Salahuddin Panwhar and Justice Ishtiaq Ibrahim, heard Imaan’s appeal seeking to set aside the IHC’s Dec 1 order refusing to grant interim relief by staying the trial in the case.
Imaan and her husband Abdul Hadi Mohammad Ali — who are facing a trial under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act 2016 (Peca) — had moved an application in the SC requesting the urgent hearing of their appeal against the IHC’s refusal to grant interim relief.
The petitioners have already filed a criminal revision before the IHC challenging the trial proceedings on grounds of due process violations under the CrPC, particularly the recording of evidence in their absence.
During today’s SC proceedings, Justice Kakar, while dictating the order, said, “We expect the IHC to decide on the fate of the petition after providing a full opportunity of hearing to both parties.”
The order stayed the trial court proceedings, which were scheduled to resume on Dec 15 by Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSI) Muhammad Afzal Majoka.
Imaan and her husband were represented by senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi whereas Additional Attorney General (AAG) Rana Asadur Rehman opposed the maintainability of the appeal.
During the hearing, Justice Kakar observed that it was common practice for the plaintiff to devise their own strategies to fight the case, but the court would neither belittle nor undermine the trial court judge.
Meanwhile, Norwegian Ambassador Per Albert Ilsas also attended the proceedings, which caused a lot of chatter on social media.
Responding to a journalist who termed the presence of the ambassador as a “breach of diplomatic norms”, Imaan said, “Who is going to explain to this genius that diplomats routinely observe court proceedings — that is not equivalent to them taking a position on any case.
“This is a standard practice but it’s very clear where the pressure is coming from to malign the ambassador,” she said.







The controversy stems from a complaint filed on Aug 12, 2025 by the assistant director (investigating officer) at the National Cybercrime Investigation Agency (NCCIA), Islamabad, before the Cybercrime Reporting Centre, FIA, under Peca.
The complaint accused Imaan of disseminating and “propagating narratives that align with hostile terrorist groups and proscribed organisations,” while her husband was implicated for reposting some of her posts.</p><small>2025-12-11 09:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638706-supreme-court-stays-imaan-mazari-husbands-trial-in-controversial-tweets-case' target='_blank'><strong>Supreme Court stays Imaan Mazari, husband's trial in controversial tweets case</strong></a><br><p>

Former intelligence chief retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed has been formally indicted on “charges of engaging in political activities”, the military’s media affairs wing announced on Tuesday, making him the first ex-spymaster to be indicted for violating the Pakistan Army Act.
The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement that Gen Hameed has “been formally arraigned on charges of engaging in political activities, violations of Official Secret Act detrimental to safety and interest of the state, misuse of authority & government resources and causing wrongful loss to a person(s).”
“During the process, involvement of Lt Gen Faiz Hamid (retd), in events related to creating agitation and unrest, leading upto multiple incidents including but not limited to 9th May 2023 incident for fomenting instability; at the behest of and in collusion with vested political interests, is also being separately investigated,” the statement noted.
While this is the first time that a former spy-master will face court martial, the army has previously held its officers accountable for misconduct.
Here is a list of some high-profile army officials whose accountability caught public attention.
Wrongful use of Authority — Lt Gen Faiz Hameed
The case against Gen Faiz is based on a petition filed by Cheif Executive Officer (CEO) of Top City housing society, Kanwar Moeez Khan, before the Supreme Court (SC).
The petition stated that ISI officials and Pakistan Rangers raided his office of the housing project and the residence of Mr Moeez in connection with a purported terrorism case and took away gold and diamond ornaments, money and other valuables.
It further claimed that after a Rawalpindi-based Anti Terrorism Court (ATC), acquitted him in the terrorism case, Gen Hameed tried to contact him through his cousin — a brigadier in the army — to arrange a meeting.
The petitioner claimed that in that meeting Gen Hameed told him that he would return all the items taken away during the raid except for 400 tola gold and cash.
The petition alleged that retired brigadiers Naeem Fakhar and Ghaffar of the ISI “forced” the petitioner to “pay 4 crores [rupees] in cash” and “sponsor a private TV network for a few months”.
The SC, however, only asked the petitioner to approach the relevant forums, including the defence ministry, for redressal of his grievances.
But in the written order issued on November 8, 2023 the Supreme Court stated that allegations of an “extremely serious nature” against ex-spymaster retired Lt-Gen Faiz Hameed “cannot be left unattended” as they would undermine the reputation of the country’s institutions if they were proven to be true.
Nine months later, Gen Hameed was taken into military’s custody and in December he was formally indicted.
NLC scam — Lt Gen (retired) Khalid Munir Khan, Lt Gen (retired) M. Afzal Muzaffar
In 2009, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) initiated an inquiry after the National Logistics Cell (NLC) reported that it suffered a loss of Rs1.8 billion between 2004 and 2008. The loss was incurred as a result of loans from commercial banks being given at high interest rates and investing Rs.4bn of pensioners’ money in stock markets. Additionally, kickbacks were received from companies through which the money was invested.
The inquiry by the Planning Commission carried out under orders from PAC revealed that there were financial irregularities, lack of transparency, and failure to observe rules and regulations caused by reckless decisions of the chain of command at NLC.
The inquiry pointed to the involvement of former quartermasters Lt Gen (retd) Khalid Munir Khan and Lt Gen (retd) M. Afzal Muzaffar, former NLC director general (retd) Maj Gen Khalid Zaheer Akhtar, and two civilians — Najibur Rehman and Saeedur Rehman. A quartermaster general, by virtue of the office, is the officer in charge of the NLC.
In light of the findings of the investigation committee, the then army chief, Gen Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, decided to proceed against the accused under the Pakistan Army Act’s Section 94 instead of referring the matter to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). An Army Court of Inquiry was convened in November 2010, and preliminary findings were reported to the army chief in February 2011. Subsequently, a formal investigation was ordered by Kayani to allow a fair trial.
In 2015, the investigation concluded, revealing that two retired general officers and one civilian officer were responsible for making improper investment decisions in violation of NLC rules and regulations.
The two generals were punished under the Army Act. Khalid Zaheer was “dismissed from service” while Afzal Muzaffar was penalised with “severe displeasure (recordable)”.
Espionage — Lt Gen (retired) Javed Iqbal
Lt Gen (retd) Javed Iqbal was convicted by the Field General Court Martial (FGCM), on May 30, 2019, of “espionage/leakage of sensitive information to foreign agencies prejudicial to the national security”.
In May 2021, the 14-year sentence was commuted by the appellate authority for seven years. Later, former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa further reduced the sentence by another two and a half years just before his departure from the GHQ.
The jailed general was, therefore, scheduled to be freed on May 29 last year, but the new Army Chief Gen Asim Munir finished the sentence completely, paving the way for his early release.
Attempted coup — Maj Gen Zaheerul Islam Abbasi and others
Maj Gen Zaheerul Islam Abbasi, Brig Mustansir Billah, Col Mohammad Azad Minhas, Col Inayat Ullah Khan, and 38 other military officers were arrested on September 26, 1995, on charges of plotting to storm a corps commanders’ meeting, to be held on Sept 30 at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi.
The alleged plan included the assassination of then-prime minister Benazir Bhutto and the then-army chief Gen Waheed Kakar, senior cabinet ministers, and military chiefs, to be followed by the proclamation of the Islamic system of Khilafat with Maj Gen Abbasi as Ameerul Momineen.
The details of the conspiracy were revealed after Qari Saifullah Akhtar, one of the conspirators and chief of his breakaway faction called Harkat-ul-Jihad al Islami, turned an approver.
On his witness, the FGCM awarded seven years of imprisonment to retired Maj Gen Abbasi, when a large cache of arms and military uniforms were confiscated. The FGCM also awarded a 14-year jail term to Brig Mustansir Billa for his alleged involvement in the attempted coup.
Col Minhas and Col Khan were court-martialled in Sept 1996 for their alleged role in the conspiracy by the FGCM and sentenced to four years each in prison by a military court.
Mutiny and terror links — Brigadier (retired) Ali Khan
In 2011, Brig Ali Khan was arrested on charges of having links with banned outfit Hizb ut-Tahrir. Along with Maj Inayat Aziz, Maj Iftikhar, Maj Sohail Akbar, and Maj Jawad Baseer, the four accused were convicted in the case.
The FGCM awarded a sentence of five years of Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) to Brig Ali Khan.
Maj Sohail Akbar was awarded three years RI while Maj Jawad Baseer was sentenced to two years RI, whereas Maj Inayat Aziz and Maj Iftikhar were awarded one year and six months of RI each.
Brig Khan was also accused of being involved in conspiring to topple the government, trying to instigate a mutiny within the army, and planning an attack on the GHQ. He was released in 2016, after serving his five-year term.
During the seven-month-long proceedings, five military officers recorded their testimonies from the prosecutor’s side.
The officers had claimed that the accused, Brig Khan, provoked them to mutiny against the civil leadership.
Removed from service
There have also been instances when general officers instead of being brought in for a court-martial were removed administratively after disciplinary proceedings.
Gen (retd) Ziauddin Butt, made army chief in October 1999 by the then-prime minister Nawaz Sharif, was kept in custody for two years. In a conversation with Dawn, Butt said that he was given a hand-written order that he was removed under Section 16 of the Pakistan Military Law and Manual of Pakistan Military Law but was never court-martialled.
In 2016, in one of the biggest corruption purges in the military, six army officers including two serving generals — Lt Gen Obaidullah Khattak, inspector-general arms, and Maj Gen Ejaz Shahid — were sacked during the tenure of Gen Raheel Sharif.
In 2015, the general officers involved in the NLC scam were also removed from service after disciplinary proceedings.
Not court-martialled despite SC orders
While there are great examples of how the army has held its officials responsible for wrongdoing and taken action against them, there have been instances when the institution failed to do so despite receiving orders from the apex court.
In 1996, Asghar Khan had filed a human rights petition in the SC, accusing the ISI of doling out Rs140m to a group of politicians in the 1990s. Among the accused were former army chief Aslam Beg and former director general of the ISI Lt Gen (retd) Asad Durrani. Durrani confirmed the allegations in an affidavit to the apex court. In it, he admitted his role in the affair, named the other players, and elaborated on how the scheme unfolded.
Following that, in a landmark judgement on Oct 19, 2012, the SC asked the defence ministry to initiate necessary action against the officials for their role in dishing out the money.
By 2019, according to a report submitted by the defence ministry to the SC during the hearing of a plea by Asghar Khan’s family for implementation of the judgement, the defence ministry had constituted a court of inquiry, which had recorded the statements of six witnesses and was looking for more witnesses.
Another ‘court of inquiry’ to investigate Durrani was set up in 2018. The court of inquiry was made to look into the book ‘The Spy Chronicles: RAW, ISI, and the Illusion of Peace’ and determine if its content and Durrani’s involvement with the book was culpable.
Three years later, while opposing Durrani’s request for the removal of his name from the no-fly list, the Ministry of Defence accused him of being involved in anti-state activities, alleging that he was either “affiliated or interacting with hostile elements, especially Indian RAW [Research and Analysis Wing], since 2008”, in a report submitted before the Islamabad High Court (IHC).
However the IHC removed Durrani’s name off the Exit Control List (ECL), with the judge remarking that “according to the record, there was no inquiry underway at the time.”</p><small>2025-12-11 08:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11132804f217735.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1851970/faiz-first-ex-spymaster-to-face-court-martial' target='_blank'><strong>Faiz first ex-spymaster to face court martial</strong></a><br><p>This piece was originally published in Dawn on August 13th, 2024.

• ‘Appropriate’ disciplinary action started against retired ISI chief following inquiry in Top City case on SC-referred complaint• Faiz Hameed in custody, ISPR announces; says multiple instances of Army Act violation after his retirement have been ‘established’
ISLAMABAD: In an unprecedented step, the army on Monday announ­ced the arrest of retired Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the previous head of the premier Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency, on allegations of violating the Army Act.
“The process of Field General Court Martial has been initiated and Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd) has been taken into military custody,” Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.
The move, prompted by allegations of misconduct levelled by the owner of a private housing society, shatters the long-standing perception that spy chiefs are untouchable in the country where generals have long wielded unparalleled influence.
The army cited a Nove­m­ber 2023 directive from the Supreme Court of Pak­i­s­tan, which instructed Ka­n­­war Moeez Khan, own­er of Islamabad’s Top City housing society, to seek redressal of grievances against Gen Hameed thro­ugh relevant channels, including the Ministry of Defence, as the basis for initiating action against the former spymaster.
Moeez Khan had appr­o­ached the Supreme Court over a raid conducted by Pakistan Rangers and ISI officials on his property and residence on May 12, 2017 during which valuables, including gold and diamond ornaments along with money, were allegedly taken away on the pretext of a terrorism investigation.
According to the petitioner, the raid was orchestrated by Gen Hameed. Moeez Khan had further accused two retired ISI brigadiers of coercing him into paying a substantial cash sum and sponsoring a private TV network.
The ISPR said, “Com­p­l­ying with the orders of Sup­reme Court of Pakis­tan, a detailed court of inquiry, was undertaken by Pakistan Army, to ascertain correctness of complaints in Top City Case made against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd). Consequently, appropriate disciplinary action has been initiated against Lt Gen Faiz Hameed (Retd), under provisions of Pakistan Army Act.”
It further alleged that “multiple instances of violation of Pakistan Army Act post retirement have also been established.”
No details of those violations were given leading to speculations about what the charges could be.
According to a source, Gen Hameed was taken into custody a few days back from Rawalpindi when he was summoned for a meeting by a senior military official.
Experts’ views
Military lawyer Omer Farouk Adam, while talking to Dawn, pointed out that the army can take act­ion against retired servicemen for violations of the Army Act within six months of retirement as per Section 92 of the Act.
However, for actions taken beyond this period, charges must first be framed in a civilian court before court martial proceedings can commence.
Col Inamur Rahim, another expert in military law, argues that offences falling under sections 31 and 40 of the Army Act have been given exception to this six-month rule, allowing for court martial proceedings to be initiated regardless of the timeframe.
Section 31 pertains to “mutiny and insubordination”, while Section 40 covers “fraudulent offence in respect of property”. However, it is not certain whether these sections have applied against Gen Hameed or not.
Gen Hameed chose to retire in November 2022 when Gen Asim Munir took the reins as the new army chief.
Gen Hameed’s background is equally significant in the political landscape of Pakistan. He served as the director general of the ISI from 2019 to 2021 and was known for his close ties to former prime minister Imran Khan.
His removal from the ISI chief position in 2021 is believed to have resulted in the rift between Mr Khan and the military establishment, which culminated in the ex-prime minister’s ousting in 2022 through a vote of no-confidence.
Gen Hameed’s tenure as ISI chief also brought him into the international spotlight, especially following his visible presence in Kabul during the Afghan Taliban’s takeover in 2021 — a critical moment after the withdrawal of US and other Western forces.
As the court martial proceedings commence, the focus will be on the implications for military discipline and the broader political repercussions in Pakistan.

In a statement on social media platform X, the central bank said that the Fund’s Executive Board had completed the second review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the first of the Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) in a meeting held in Washington earlier this week.
“Accordingly, the SBP has received SDR 914 million (equivalent to about $ 1.2 billion) under the EFF and RSF in value [on] Dec 10, 2025 from the IMF,” the central bank said.
“The amount would be reflected in SBP’s foreign exchange reserves for the week ending on Dec 12,” it added.







Earlier this week, the Fund had approved the fresh disbursement of $1.2bn to Pakistan under its dual-track bailout — the 37-month EFF and the climate-focused RSF.
With this tranche, total disbursements to Pakistan under the EFF and RSF now stand at approximately $3.3 billion, supporting both macroeconomic stabilisation and long-term structural reforms for climate resilience.
In a statement released after the meeting of its Executive Board, the IMF highlighted that “Pakistan’s strong programme implementation, despite the recent devastating floods, has maintained stability and improved financing and external conditions”.
It stressed that the country’s policy priorities remain centred on maintaining macroeconomic stability and advancing reforms to strengthen public finances, enhance competition, raise productivity and competitiveness, bolster the social safety net and human capital, reform state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and improve public service provision and energy sector viability.
The board noted that Pakistan’s fiscal performance has been strong, with a primary surplus of 1.3 per cent of GDP achieved in FY25, in line with programme targets. Gross reserves stood at $14.5bn at end-FY25, up from $9.4bn a year earlier, and are projected to continue rebuilding in FY26 and over the medium term. The board also noted that “inflation has increased, reflecting the impact of the floods on food prices, but this is expected to be temporary”.
The statement quoted IMF Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair Nigel Clarke as saying that “in the face of an uncertain global environment, Pakistan needs to maintain prudent policies to further entrench macroeconomic stability, while accelerating reforms necessary to achieve stronger, private-sector-led, and sustainable medium-term growth”.
He highlighted the importance of “advancing reforms to raise revenues via tax policy simplification and base broadening”, describing it as key to achieving fiscal sustainability and building the fiscal space necessary to boost climate resilience, social protection, human capital development, and public investment.
Clarke also stressed that “reforms in the energy sector are critical to safeguarding its viability and improving Pakistan’s competitiveness”. He noted that timely power tariff adjustments had “helped reduce the stock and flow of circular debt”, while emphasising that “subsequent efforts need to focus on sustainably reducing electricity production and distribution costs and addressing inefficiencies in the power and gas sector”.
Meanwhile, the latest IMF projections for Pakistan suggest that the immediate risk of economic free fall has eased but the country remains locked into a narrow stabilisation path marked by weak growth, heavy debt and limited relief for households.</p><small>2025-12-11 07:41</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11095044d870d1b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960488/pakistan-says-terrorism-emanating-from-afghan-soil-poses-gravest-threat-to-national-security-sovereignty' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan says terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses ‘gravest threat’ to national security, sovereignty</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan told the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Wednesday that terrorism emanating from Afghan soil posed the “gravest threat” to the country’s national security and sovereignty.
Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad made the remarks while addressing a debate in New York on the situation in Afghanistan.
In his statement, he highlighted Islamabad’s concerns about security, humanitarian, and socio-economic challenges emerging from neighbouring Afghanistan.
Briefing the UNSC on Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts since the Taliban’s takeover of Kabul in 2021, the ambassador said Pakistan had maintained consistent engagement with the Afghan Taliban, conducting high-level visits, facilitating humanitarian relief, supporting the transportation of goods, and announcing trade and transit concessions.
Despite these efforts, he said, threats persisted, creating mounting security challenges for Pakistan and the wider region.



“Afghanistan is once again a safe sanctuary for terrorist groups and proxies, with devastating consequences and mounting security challenges for its immediate neighbours, particularly Pakistan, and the region and beyond.”
He said Afghan authorities were failing to take concrete measures against terrorist groups, adding that Pakistan had witnessed a surge in militant attacks that were planned, financed and orchestrated using Afghan soil under their watch.
“Just this year alone, we have lost close to 1,200 lives to terrorism emanating from Afghanistan. Since 2022, more than 214 Afghan terrorists, including suicide bombers, have been neutralised in Pakistan during counter-terror operations,” he said.
“Terrorism emanating from Afghan soil poses the gravest threat to Pakistan’s national security and sovereignty,” the envoy said, adding that terrorist groups, including the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Al-Qaeda, the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), and the Majeed Brigade, enjoyed “safe haven” in the neighbouring country.
He said Pakistan had successfully thwarted multiple infiltration attempts by TTP and BLA terrorists from across Afghanistan, confiscating caches of military grade equipment left behind by international forces in Afghanistan.
“These efforts have had a human cost, with huge sacrifices by our valiant security forces and civilians,” he said.
“Elements within the Taliban rank and file are supporting these terrorist groups and allowing them safe passage to operate with impunity and free will. There is also credible evidence of collaboration among these terrorist groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists, and coordinated attacks against Pakistan using the Afghan soil,” he said.
“And not surprisingly, one detractor in the region, opportunist, and spoiler, has moved fast to intensify its sponsorship of terrorist activity through material, technical and financial support, to terrorist groups and proxies active against Pakistan from Afghan soil,” he added, without taking any names.
Ambassador Ahmad also urged the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) to strengthen efforts to prevent illicit arms trade and provide an objective assessment of border security, emphasising that cross-border terrorism was the primary issue behind border clashes between the two countries.
He also highlighted Pakistan’s efforts to engage with the Afghan Taliban, including recent talks held in Doha and Istanbul.
He expressed gratitude to the governments of Qatar and Türkiye for facilitating dialogue with the Afghan Taliban and called for concrete, verifiable action by them against terrorist groups.
He warned that failure to do so would result in Pakistan taking “all necessary defensive measures” to protect its citizens and sovereignty.
Ambassador Ahmad also highlighted Pakistan’s decades-long role in hosting Afghan refugees. He told the UNSC that millions of Afghans had been welcomed over the past four decades despite Pakistan’s own constraints.
“With conflict now ended, we expect that Afghans will now return to their country of origin in a dignified, phased and orderly manner,” he said. The envoy said Pakistan would continue to extend all possible assistance to the Afghans but also called on the international community to “shoulder its responsibility”.
He also noted Pakistan’s visa regime, saying that it allowed Afghans to enter the country legally for purposes such as education, health, business, and family visits. He highlighted that more than 536,000 medical visas have been issued since September 2023.
The envoy stressed that Pakistan sought a peaceful, stable, interconnected, and prosperous Afghanistan — one that was at peace with itself and its neighbours.
He cautioned that bilateral engagements should not be used by countries with negative agendas to destabilise the Pakistan–Afghanistan border or the wider region.
“No country desires peace and stability in Afghanistan more than Pakistan. No country has suffered from the consequences of decades of conflict more than Pakistan,” he said.
Ambassador Ahmad reaffirmed Islamabad’s commitment to work for peace in Afghanistan, emphasising that lasting stability could only be achieved through sincere dialogue with the Afghan Taliban, respect for international obligations, and strengthened regional cooperation.
He called upon the international community to remain engaged, provide humanitarian support, and assist in fostering a security environment conducive to long-term development and prosperity in Afghanistan and the region.
Recent reporting provides a stark backdrop to Pakistan’s warnings at the UNSC.
A report by US watchdog Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has confirmed that billions of dollars’ worth of American-supplied weapons, military equipment, and security infrastructure left behind during the 2021 US withdrawal now form the backbone of the Afghan Taliban’s security apparatus.
Parallel assessments by UN monitoring teams and investigative reporting by the Washington Post indicate that some of these weapons have already reached the TTP, strengthening a group responsible for escalating attacks inside Pakistan.
A UN panel also reported that the Taliban continue to provide logistical and operational support to the TTP, reinforcing Islamabad’s concerns about safe havens for terrorists and cross-border militancy.</p><small>2025-12-11 07:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/11112238e5b313a.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1960492/health-minister-launches-last-nationwide-polio-campaign-of-2025-notes-declines-in-cases-in-pakistan' target='_blank'><strong>Health minister launches last nationwide polio campaign of 2025, notes declines in cases in Pakistan</strong></a><br><p>Health Minister Mustafa Kamal on Thursday launched the last nationwide polio campaign of 2025 aiming to vaccinate over 45 million children against the crippling disease, noting that the number of cases in the country had reduced in comparison to last year.
Pakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanistan, where polio remains endemic. So far, the country has recorded 30 polio cases, with the highest number of cases in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at 19.
Launching the last polio campaign of the year — set to run from December 15 to December 2 — at a ceremony in Islamabad, the minister noted the decline in cases in comparison to 2024, saying, “We have succeeded in reducing polio cases in the country.”
He recalled that Pakistan had recorded 74 cases in 2024; however, this year the country only saw 30 cases.
The minister said that the virus was “present in more than half of the country,” including Peshawar, Karachi, and Lahore.
He stated that the government remained “determined to eliminate the virus in the country by year’s end and called on all parties to “play their part”.
Kamal noted that 19 out of 30 cases reported this year were from KP, out of which 16 were from the south of the province. He said that 200,000 children in south KP had not been immunised against polio due to the “law and order situation”.
The minister further said more than 400,000 polio workers would be involved in the latest campaign, calling on parents to cooperate with polio teams.
Kamal also called on scholars to play their role in polio campaigns. The minister also urged citizens to “not fall for any negative propaganda” against the drive.
He also called on elected representatives to “administer polio drops to people from their families and make a video to further encourage people”.
Anti-polio drive to be held from Dec 15-21
Meanwhile, the National Emergency Operation Centre (NEOC) said that the polio campaign would be held from Dec 15-21, to vaccinate around 45.5m children.
In a statement, the body said, “More than 400,000 frontline polio workers will take part in the campaign”.
It said more than 23m children will be immunised in Punjab, over 16m in Sindh, more than 7.2m in KP and over 2.6m in Balochistan. In Islamabad, the campaign aims to vaccinate over 400,000 children.
The NEOC urged parents to cooperate with polio workers and ensure the vaccination of their children.
On October 21, a case of wild poliovirus was confirmed in KP’s Torghar, taking the tally of cases for this year to 30.
In 2024, the country reported at least 71 polio cases, with the virus detected in around 90 districts.
Polio is a highly infectious and incurable disease that can cause lifelong paralysis. The only effective protection is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for every child under five during each campaign, along with the timely completion of all essential immunisations.</p><small>2025-12-11 07:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638684-sanaullah-hints-at-imrans-transfer-from-adiala-jail' target='_blank'><strong>Sanaullah hints at Imran's transfer from Adiala jail</strong></a><br><p>

At least 15 people, including Thai soldiers and Cambodian civilians, have been killed in the reignited border conflict, officials said.
More than half a million people, mostly in Thailand, have fled border areas near where jets, tanks and drones have waged battle.
The Southeast Asian nations dispute the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre (500-mile) frontier, where both sides claim a smattering of historic temples.
This week’s clashes are the deadliest since five days of fighting in July that killed dozens before a shaky truce was agreed, following intervention by Trump.
The US president said he expected to speak on Thursday with the leaders of Thailand and Cambodia to demand a halt to their renewed clashes.
“I think I’m scheduled to speak to them tomorrow,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday.
Both sides blame the other for reigniting the conflict, which has expanded to five provinces of both Thailand and Cambodia, according to an AFP tally of official accounts.
In Thailand’s northeast on Thursday morning, hundreds of evacuated families woke up inside a university building in Surin city that has been transformed into a shelter.
A few older women pound chilli paste while volunteers stir big pots of food.
Nearby, 61-year-old farmer Rat, who declined to give her last name, said she had to leave her home before she could plant a cassava crop this season, fleeing with her family of eight.
“I just want to go home and farm again,” she told AFP.
“Every time the fighting starts, it feels like life gets paused all over again.”
Cultural heritage
AFP journalists in Cambodia’s northwestern Oddar Meanchey province heard the blasts of incoming artillery from the direction of disputed temples since dawn on Wednesday.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said in a statement that Thai forces initiated an attack early on Thursday morning in the province, “shelling into Khnar Temple area”.
On the other side of the border, the Thai military announced an overnight curfew in parts of Sa Kaeo beginning Wednesday night.
The Thai army said on Wednesday that Cambodian forces fired rockets early that day that landed in the vicinity of the Phanom Dong Rak Hospital in Surin province — to the north of Sa Kaeo, and which was struck in the fighting in July.
Cambodia’s defence ministry said more than 101,000 people have been evacuated, while in Thailand, authorities said more than 400,000 civilians have taken shelter elsewhere.
The United States, China and Malaysia, as chair of the regional bloc ASEAN, brokered a ceasefire back in July.
In October, Trump backed a follow-on joint declaration, touting new trade deals with Thailand and Cambodia after they agreed to prolong their truce.
But Thailand suspended the agreement the following month.
The United Nations cultural agency called on Wednesday for “protection of the region’s cultural heritage in all its forms” amid the ongoing fighting.
“Unesco has communicated to all parties concerned the geographical coordinates of sites on the World Heritage List as well as those of national significance, in order to avoid any potential damage,” it said in a statement.
In 2008, military clashes between Thailand and Cambodia erupted over a patch of land next to the 900-year-old temple, located on the border.
Sporadic violence from 2008 to 2011 led to the deaths of two dozen people and displacement of tens of thousands.</p><small>2025-12-11 06:28</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638670-pti-told-no-more-tolerance-for-anti-army-campaigns' target='_blank'><strong>PTI told 'no more tolerance for anti-army campaigns'</strong></a><br><p>

Machado, who won the Nobel for challenging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro’s grip on power, did not arrive in Norway in time for Wednesday’s prize ceremony.
Her daughter collected the prestigious award on her behalf, and delivered a blistering acceptance speech in her stead.
The Venezuelan democracy campaigner made it to the Norwegian capital hours later, and went straight to see her family, Nobel Prize Committee Chair Jorgen Watne Frydnes said.
From the balcony of the Grand Hotel, Machado later greeted a crowd of jubilant supporters, who sang and shouted “libertad” (freedom), according to AFP journalists.







Machado, who has been living in hiding in Venezuela, was last seen in public on January 9, when she protested Maduro’s inauguration for his third term.
In her Nobel acceptance speech, the democracy campaigner urged her compatriots to keep fighting against Maduro’s “state terrorism”.
“What we Venezuelans can offer the world is the lesson forged through this long and difficult journey: that to have democracy, we must be willing to fight for freedom,” Machado said in a speech delivered by her daughter, Ana Corina Sosa Machado.
It is unclear how Machado managed to leave Venezuela, or how she plans to eventually return.
She was warned by Caracas that she would be labelled a “fugitive” if she left the country.
“She risks being arrested if she returns, even if the authorities have shown more restraint with her than with many others, because arresting her would have a very strong symbolic value,” said Benedicte Bull, a professor specialising in Latin America at the University of Oslo.
Machado’s previous refusal to leave the country had also boosted her political power.
“She is the undisputed leader of the opposition, but if she were to stay away in exile for a long time, I think that would change and she would gradually lose political influence,” Bull added.
‘State terrorism’
Her daughter assured the Nobel prize audience that her mother would return. “She wants to live in a free Venezuela, and she will never give up on that purpose,” Ana Corina Sosa Machado said.
Machado’s mother and three daughters, and some Latin American heads of state, including Argentine President Javier Milei, were at the prize-giving at Oslo’s City Hall.
In her acceptance speech, Machado denounced kidnappings and torture under Maduro’s tenure, calling them “crimes against humanity” and “state terrorism, deployed to bury the will of the people”.
Machado has been hailed for her fight for democracy, but also criticised for aligning herself with US President Donald Trump, to whom she has dedicated her Nobel.
The Oslo ceremony coincides with a large US military build-up in the Caribbean in recent weeks and deadly strikes on what Washington says are drug-smuggling boats.
Maduro, who came to power in 2013, insists the goal of the US operations — which Machado has said are justified — is to topple the government and seize Venezuela’s oil reserves
Nobel prize
Machado has accused Maduro of stealing Venezuela’s July 2024 election, from which she was banned — a claim backed by much of the international community.
The opposition claimed its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, won the election. He now lives in exile and was also in Oslo on Wednesday.
Multiple other Nobel Peace Prize-winners have been unable to collect their awards in person. Family members usually do so on their behalf, Nobel Institute director Kristian Berg Harpviken explained this week.
The Nobel laureates in medicine, physics, chemistry, literature and economics all received their prizes from Sweden’s King Carl XVI Gustaf at a separate ceremony in Stockholm on Wednesday.
The prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and 11 million kronor ($1.2 million) — which is shared when several laureates are honoured in the same category.</p><small>2025-12-11 05:56</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638659-talk-about-us-not-politics-lahore-woman-interjects-during-bilawals-presser-from-rooftop' target='_blank'><strong>'Talk about us, not politics': Lahore woman interjects during Bilawal's presser from rooftop</strong></a><br><p>

During a sitting chaired by Deputy Speaker Suriyya Bibi, the assembly witnessed ruckus and adjournment when the opposition PML-N’s woman lawmaker, Sobia Shahid, displayed a picture of Army Chief and Chief of Defence Forces Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir.
The chair ordered security personnel to remove the picture. She censured Ms Shahid, saying the CDF represents the military and not her party.
“You should talk about your own performance as the lawmaker instead of displaying the CDF’s picture,” she observed before adjourning the sitting due to commotion.
Earlier, members of the ruling PTI complained that the country faced serious challenges like the poor law and order situation, financial stress and political instability. They insisted that that the country’s external issues could only be resolved once the “house is in order.”
Treasury MPA Mohammad Ajmal Khan said the recent presser by ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry against the PTI leadership, especially founder Imran Khan and CM Sohail Afridi, had angered the people of KP.
He said the military’s spokesman should not be speaking on controversial matters would aggravate the current political crisis in the country.
The lawmaker opposed the option of enforcing the Governor’s Rule in the province, warning it is no solution and will be unacceptable to residents. He said that the provincial assembly could help resolve issues among Mr Imran, the federal government and the security establishment.
Mr Khan also said once the “house was in order”, dialogue could be held with Afghanistan for lasting peace in the region.
Treasury MPA Humayun Khan said the legislature, the judiciary and the executive were main pillars of the state but an institution called itself the state that it never was.
He said that the military was raised and paid to protect the country’s borders.
Mr Khan came down hard on the military’s spokesman for making “insulting” remarks against the PTI founder and KP’s chief minister.
He said it was the Pakistan Air Force that did a great job in the May 8 conflict with India, so its chief should have been credited and made the Field Marshal.
The lawmaker said the creation of the CDS post should be reconsidered.
Member of the opposition PML-N Shahjahan Yousaf said the people were proud of the country’s armed forces for defeating a much larger adversary in the May clashes.
He said PTI members in the National Assembly should discuss the matters related to the Centre, while those in the KP Assembly should take up provincial issues.
Mr Yousaf said there was nothing wrong if all defence forces got united to defend the country.
He congratulated Army Chief Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir on becoming the CDF.
Housing minister Dr Amjad Ali condemned the use of water cannons against the sisters of the PTI’s founder during their protest sit-in staged outside Adiala Jail to seek a meeting with their brother.
He said that a law and order situation was being deliberately created in the province. He wondered how an official, being paid by the government, could hold a political presser. The minister said the military’s spokesperson should hold more and more news conferences to increase Mr Imran’s popularity.
Meanwhile, the house was informed that the province lacked the facility to measure uranium levels in the drinking water supplied to Karak district.
“We do not have that testing facility. We recently sent a letter to the Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority in this respect and will follow up and inform the house,” public health engineering minister Fazal Shakoor Khan informed lawmakers.
The minister’s statement came as PML-N member Farah Khan raised serious concerns about the rising number of blood and bone cancer patients as well as the high incidence of kidney failures due to the contaminated drinking water in the area.
In a question, she also asked whether any water filtration plant existed in the district, insisting that high-risk diseases in Karak were on the rise and the situation in the Shnawa Kudikhel area of the district had become alarming.

A two-judge SHC bench headed by Chief Justice Zafar Ahmed Rajput took up the appeal filed by acting PG Muntazir Mehdi and issued notices to Dr Mahrang and others for Dec 24.
The BYC leader, who is currently detained at the Quetta prison in connection with some other cases, had filed an acquittal application under Section 256-K of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) before the ATC-V and the judge had on Dec 3 allowed the application and acquitted her.
In the appeal filed on behalf of the state, the acting PG stated that the trial court misread evidence and allowed the acquittal application at the pre-trial stage.
He contended that the prosecution had apprised the ATC about the availability of sufficient evidence, and the same would be produced in court during the trial.
However, the trial court had exonerated the suspect even before the commencement of the trial, giving no opportunity to the prosecution to examine and produce evidence, he added.
According to the prosecution, a case was registered on the complaint of a local businessman in Landhi who told the police that he had been watching Dr Mahrang and her unidentified colleagues’ “anti-state campaign” on social media.

In its Asian Development Outlook December 2025, the Manila-based lending agency also revised the growth outlook for the South Asian Region upward for the current year.
“In the case of South Asia, growth forecasts for 2026 have been revised upward for Sri Lanka and Pakistan, respectively, due to increased public investment and a less-severe-than-anticipated impact of flooding,” it said in its latest report without actually saying where it expected Pakistan’s growth to settle for the year. In July, the ADB had set a 2026 growth forecast for Pakistan at 3pc and had kept it unchanged in its September update in the middle of flooding across Punjab’s agricultural heartland.

 

“The growth outlooks for Pakistan and Sri Lanka have improved for both 2025 and 2026”, it said, adding that the Government of Pakistan updated its estimate of GDP growth for FY25 to 3pc from a previously reported 2.7pc. “Despite disruptions that resulted from floods in June 2025, the economy grew 5.7pc in Q4FY25, and the country’s large-scale manufacturing expanded robustly in recent months in FY26”, it said.

Sees robust growth for South Asia for 2025 and 2026 despite challenges

Pakistan’s inflation for the first four months (July-October) of FY26 was 4.7pc, down from 8.7pc in the same period a year ago, the bank said, adding “after a sharp increase in the months immediately after the floods, prices of key food items have begun to stabilise”.
It forecast the growth in South Asia to remain robust, with the 2025 forecast revised upward to 6.5pc from 5.9pc, and the 2026 forecast maintained at 6pc. This is driven by upgrades to India’s outlook, based on robust domestic consumption growth. Sri Lanka’s forecasts for 2025 and 2026 are revised upward due to robust credit expansion, buoyant consumption, and improved investor confidence following rating upgrades.
In contrast, Bangladesh’s fiscal year ending June 30, 2026 projection was lowered due to weaker exports amid subdued global demand and supply disruptions, while the forecast for FY2025 remains unchanged. Pakistan’s FY2025 growth outlook was upgraded following a stronger-than-expected Q4, it said.
Growth forecasts for the remaining South Asian economies are retained, although Nepal faces lingering uncertainty in the aftermath of September’s civil unrest and the ongoing political transition.
India’s growth forecast for FY2025 (fiscal year ending March 2026) was revised to 7.2pc from 6.5pc in the September ADO, reflecting stronger third-quarter expansion as tax cuts supported consumption. Indian GDP grew faster than expected at 8.2pc in the second quarter of FY25. The 2026 forecast was kept unchanged at 6.5pc. The bank also raised its growth forecasts for economies in developing Asia and the Pacific for this year and next, amid stronger-than-expected exports and reduced trade uncertainty following the conclusion of several trade agreements with the United States.
Risks to the regional outlook include renewed trade tensions and financial market volatility, as well as geopolitical pressures and a worse-than-expected deterioration in the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) property market. China’s growth forecast for this year has been raised slightly to 4.8pc from 4.7pc, amid resilient exports and continued fiscal stimulus. The outlook for 2026 was kept unchanged at 4.3pc.Southeast Asia’s growth projection for this year was also upgraded by 0.2 percentage points to 4.5pc, reflecting a strong third quarter in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam.

Punjab Inspector General of Police (IGP) Dr Usman Anwar has forwarded two summaries through the Home Department to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for final approval.
He also proposed amendments to the Provincial Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965, for the rationalisation of Section 89-B, which makes it mandatory for drivers of motor cars, cabs, and transport vehicles to wear a fastened seat belt, by omitting the requirement of ‘notified roads’.
The move was taken as a major development in the wake of recent crackdown on the underage drivers, including students, and arrested many of them under criminal offences.

Changes to law proposed to introduce juvenile driving permit, make seat belts mandatory for all roads

The CM had taken notice of some disturbing viral video clips when several hand-cuffed students in school uniform were presented in courts and the reports that the police tarnished the careers of a large number of them by preparing their crime profile.
Giving some justifications for these amendments, the IGP pointed out that the existing regulatory gap resulted in unlicenced juvenile riding and associated safety risks, necessitating a need to introduce a juvenile driving permit for motorcycle riders aged 16 to 18 years.
“The amendment establishes a structured, lawful, and monitored framework enabling juveniles to operate motorcycles under prescribed conditions, thereby promoting responsible mobility, enhancing road safety, strengthening enforcement, and supporting the vision of a safe, modern, and inclusive youth mobility system,” reads one of the summary documents.
Global practices
The respective summaries were drafted and sent to the Punjab police chief by Lahore Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Athar Waheed who referred to some models/practices adopted by many advanced countries to address the serious issue of ‘the youth mobility on the roads’.
Mr Athar was of the opinion that the introduction of a formal juvenile driving permit would provide a structured, lawful and enforceable pathway for regulated youth mobility.
“A comparative review of international licensing standards shows that many jurisdictions, including India, Malaysia, New Zealand, several EU states, and the US, allow supervised or restricted motorcycle or learner permits between 16 and 17 years of age,” states the CTO.
About the background perspective, the police department says that no person is permitted to ride a motorcycle in any public place unless he/she attained the age of 18 years under the existing legal framework, specifically section 4 of the motor vehicle ordinance.
The absence of a clear statutory mechanism for regulating juvenile motorcycle riders aged 16 to 18 years had resulted in persistent enforcement challenges and an incre­asing number of unlicenced young riders on the roads.
The introduction of juvenile driving permit for juvenile motorcycle riders aged 16 to 18 years would address this regulatory gap besides providing a structured, legally recognised, and enforceable framework for youth mobility within this age bracket, as per the documents. Another primary objective of the proposed amendment was to allow individuals aged 16 to 18 years to legally ply motorcycles under regulated and clearly defined conditions.
The department also argued that section 89-B currently restricts mandatory seat belt use to “notified roads”, creating ambiguity and limiting enforcement, despite the fact that road-safety risks are present on all public roads across the province.
“To address this critical safety concern and ensure uniform compliance, it is proposed that the phrase ‘on notified roads’ be removed, making seat belt use compulsory on all public roads and strengthening protection for every road user,” reads the summary.

The proposal, laid out in a notice published on Tuesday in the Federal Register, would apply to visitors from 42 countries, including Britain, France, Australia and Japan, who do not need a visa to enter the United States.
Currently, those travellers only need to apply for a waiver known as the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA), which still requires them to provide certain personal details.
Under the proposed new rules, the collection of social media data would become a “mandatory” part of ESTA applications. Applicants would need to provide their social media histories from the last five years, according to the notice.
They would also have to submit other “high-value data fields” including phone numbers from the last five years, email addresses from the past decade, personal details of family members and biometric information.
The public has 60 days to comment on the proposal.

LONDON: British lawmakers on Wednesday urged their government to support self-determination for the disputed region of Ja­m­­mu and Kashmir, and called on it to press India on human rights.
However, a minister reaffirmed the UK’s long-standing policy on the decades-old dispute during a parliamentary debate by saying “we believe in diplomacy”, with a renewed push for bilateral talks between India and Pakistan.
The debate “Kashmir: Self-determination”, in Westminster Hall, saw several members of parliament calling for a more active British role, citing concerns from their large British-Kashmiri constituencies.

 

The session was led by Labour MP Imran Hussain, who described the situation as an urgent human rights issue.
For the people of [India-held] Kashmir, this is not a distant foreign-policy issue, Mr Hussain said.
“This is about families torn apart, homes bulldozed, voices sile­nced, human rights abused. The right to choose their own destiny has been denied for generations.”
He criticised India’s revocation of the region’s special status in 2019. “Since the removal of Articles 370 and 35A, we have seen communication blackouts, curfews, mass detentions and attempts to alter the demographics of the region,” he said.
He also referenced a 1948 United Nations resolution calling for a vote on the disputed territory’s future.
The promise of a free and fair plebiscite made in 1948 remains unfulfilled, Mr Hussain added.
Decades later, the international community and successive UK governments have failed to ensure that Kashmiris can exercise their right to self-determination, he added.
Other MPs echoed his concerns. Jim Shannon of Strangford highlighted the humanitarian situation in occupied Kashmir, highlighting “repressive policies” including the use of arbitrary detention, extrajudicial killings and other most serious abuses, including sexual abuse.
Gareth Snell of Labour from Stoke-on-Trent Central highlighted the large British-Kashmiri population and the enduring lack of political attention to the issue.
Labour MP Andy McDonald of Middlesbrough and Thornaby East raised concerns over reports of arbitrary detention, suppression of free speech and restrictions on journalists.
Responding for the government, Hamish Falconer, who is the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, emphasised that the UK’s position has not changed.
“It is for India and Pakistan to find a lasting resolut­­­ion to the situation in Kashmir, which must take into ac­­count the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” he said, stressing that both sides are friends. Mr Falconer also said the UK regularly raises human rights with both nations. “The UK takes human rights seriously,” he said. “We continue to raise concerns with both India and Pakistan regarding restrictions, the detention of political leaders, and the protection of minorities. We welcome any steps to lift remaining restrictions and release political detainees,” he added.
He also addressed the UK diaspora, saying the UK recognises the strength of feeling among the British-Kashmiri community and remains open to engagement with community representatives, adding, “I do not wish to take a view about whether a further reference to the United Nations is useful at this time, but it is critical in 2025 and into 2026 that there is dialogue between India and Pakistan. We have seen the extent of the pressure when dialogue breaks down.” While ministers acknowledged the plight of Kashmiris and the UK’s role in raising concerns, they stopped short of committing to any UK-led mediation or a UN-backed plebiscite.
The session marks the latest in a series of parliamentary debates on the disputed Himalayan region, including discussions in March 2025 and January 2021, reflecting the ongoing concern among MPs, constituents, and diaspora communities about human rights and political representation in the region.

RAWALPINDI/ISLAMABAD: Politi­cal temperatures rose further on Wedne­sday, as Rawalpindi police sought a legal opinion on the question of registering an FIR against PTI leaders and supporters over a protest outside Adiala jail, even as the party moved a privilege motion in the National Assembly over alleged use of force against its workers, and voiced alarm at reports of Imran Khan’s possible transfer to another prison.
The PTI also joined other opposition parties in warning that efforts to “minus” the incarcerated former premier and clamp down on peaceful protest would only deepen the stand-off with the government and push the country towards greater political turmoil.

 

After entering a report in its daily police diary (roznamcha) on the PTI sit-in outside Adiala jail on the previous night, Rawalpindi police termed the demonstration a “violent protest by a political party with the intention of attacking Adiala jail” in a statement issued on Wednesday.
It noted that Section 144 was in force in the city and that it was the police’s respo­n­sibility to ensure its implementation.
A police spokesperson said Adiala jail was a sensitive and densely populated area where maintaining security and traffic order was crucial. He added that there was no visiting time at night and no one could be allowed to meet an inmate without a court order.
The spokesperson claimed that the po­lice had “shown extreme patience” du­r­ing the sit-in despite “attempts to vandalise and resist the police” by protesters.

 

“Members of the political party pelted stones and attacked the police, on which the law had to take its course. Water cannon had to be used, with extreme patience and strategy, to prevent malicious activity and an attack,” he said, adding that violation of the law would not be tolerated “under any circumstances” in such a sensitive area.
In a post on X at 3:58am, the party had claimed that authorities used water cannons to disperse Imran Khan’s sisters and peaceful PTI workers outside Adiala jail, despite a court order allowing a meeting with the jailed former PM.
The party said Mr Khan’s sisters Aleema Khan, Uzma Khan and Noreen Niazi, along with party leaders and workers, had spent the entire day peacefully waiting outside the prison to exercise their “constitutional and legal right” to meet their incarcerated leader on a court-mandated visitation day.







“This brutal crackdown on a peaceful sit-in violates basic human rights and freedom of assembly in freezing weather!” the party said. It also shared a video of a water cannon being used as people, bundled up against the cold, fled the scene.
A police source said a report on Tuesday night’s incident had already been recorded and could be converted into a formal FIR, in which the accused would be nominated and booked under the relevant sections of the law.
Privilege motion
On the other hand, PTI MNAs on Wednesday submitted a complaint for a “privilege motion” in the National Assembly against Rawalpindi police.
At a subsequent presser, opposition leaders claimed that PTI parliamentary leader Shahid Khattak’s “leg had been broken” in the melee.
The motion claimed that police had used force against PTI leaders and workers who were present outside the jail to express solidarity with the PTI founder imprisoned there.
The party also expressed grave concern over reports that the former prime minister might be transferred to another jail, calling such a move a blatant display of “fear, political desperation and weakness” on the part of the government.
The party said its founding chairman could neither be “minused” nor removed from the political arena, nor could his voice be sile­nced behind prison walls.
In a statement issued by the PTI Central Media Department, the party condemned remarks by federal ministers suggesting that Mr Khan may be mov­ed to another facility, saying the government “continued to tremble at his very name” despite keeping him incarcerated for over two and a half years.
The party also condemned what it described as a police “assault” on Mr Khan’s sisters, female workers and party leaders outside Adiala Jail.
It said the episode once again exposed the “stark reality” that the incumbent government had abandoned “moral boundaries, constitutional principles and basic human values” in its use of force against political opponents.
War of words
Meanwhile, the war of words between the opposition and the ruling coalition continued on Wed­nesday, with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Affairs Ikhtiar Wali Khan saying that “things have reached a point of no return”, while PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali stressed that “common sense should prevail”.
The tensions have particularly intensified in rec­ent days after the spok­esperson for the armed forces held a hard-hitting press conference on Dec 6, in response to Imran Kha­n’s latest outburst against the military leadership.
Addressing a press conference, Mr Wali assailed the PTI for its recent actions, warning the party, “We have tolerated you with much grace and for the sake of democracy. However, things have now reached a point of no return, no mercy and no tolerance. All doors to talks are now closed.”
He went on to say that anyone supporting the incarcerated PTI founder “stood for the desecration of Pakistan’s sovereignty, honour and development”.
“We do not want to label anyone a traitor or ban a political party,” he continued. However, he stressed that “given the current state of affairs, I ask the people what else can be done”.
‘Common sense’
Later, leaders from opposition alliance Tehreek-i-Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP), which also includes the PTI, addressed a press conference outside Parliament.
Among them, Barrister Gohar reiterated his party’s allegations that their “mandate had been stolen” in the last general elections.
“We did not stage a sit-in back then … We sat in parliament, believing that our voices would be heard, and a solution to our and the people’s difficulties would be found,” he said, adding that there had been multiple confrontations during the last two years. However, “at some point, common sense should prevail”, he said
Without naming anyone, he said: “If you want to create distance between [Imran] Khan and the people, this is not possible.”
He also spoke to the media earlier in the day, objecting to the resolution passed by the Punjab Assembly on Tuesday.
The government, he said, was attempting to “pitch federating units against each other.”
“You are isolating a major political party. Does removing them from due process save democracy?” the PTI chairman asked.
Achakzai on dialogue
Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP) Chairman Mehmood Khan Achakzai also addressed the press conference outside parliament.
Apparently alluding to the prospect of talks between the opposition and the government, he said: “If anyone wants to hold a dialogue, permission must be given to meet PTI founder Imran Khan. How can we negotiate without his permission?”
For his part, PTI leader Asad Qaiser announced that the opposition had decided to convene a “nati­onal conference” on Dec 20 and 21, in which all political parties and bar associations would be invited.
A national agenda would be presented at the conference, he said, adding, “We are peaceful people, and we will move forward in accordance with the Constitution and the law.”
Mr Qaiser also warned against the imposition of governor’s rule in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifting the PTI founder from the Adiala jail, saying that the moves would “push the country towards anarchy”.
‘Dark period’
Later in the evening, PPP’s Sharjeel Memon addressed a press conference, assailing the PTI and its founder, alleging that the party’s time in power was a “dark period” in Pakistan’s history.
“He (Imran) is being portrayed as a hero who speaks against the establishment. However, if you go back in time, listen to how he spoke about the establishment,” the minister said.
“It is the same Khan who was willing to give Gen Bajwa a lifetime extension, and now these people talk about morals and revolution.”
“Why did you not say anything back then?” the PPP leader questioned. “It was not that long ago, so why have we erased it from our memories?” Minister of State for Overseas Pakistanis Aun Chaudhry, in a press conference in Islamabad, called on overseas Pakist­anis to recognise the “venomous rhetoric” being spread by PTI.
“I want the overseas Pakistanis to identify and acknowledge these gro­ups,” Mr Chaudhry said. “I want my nation, my Pakistanis, to acknowledge what is right and what is wrong.”

The state-owned Bang­ladesh Sangbad Sangstha news agency quoted Dha­ka’s Foreign Adviser Md Touhid Hossain as saying: “It is possible for us (Bang­ladesh) strategically … (but) it is not possible for Nepal or Bhutan to form a grouping with Pakistan excluding India”.
His remarks are being interpreted as a response to a statement by Pakis­tan’s Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar at the recent ‘Islamabad Conclave’, where he had said a trilateral initiative involving Bangladesh, China and Pakistan had begun and may expand to include countries within and beyond the region.
According to the Bang­ladeshi outlet, Mr Hossain said Mr Dar “has said something, and perhaps at some point this could see some progress”.
In August, Foreign Minister Dar visited Bangladesh for the first time in 13 years.
PM Shehbaz Sharif and Bangladesh Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus have also held a couple of cordial meetings in recent months.
There has been a thaw in ties between the two nations ever since a popular uprising in Bangladesh saw Sheikh Hasina’s government toppled in August of last year.

The package includes Link–16 systems, cryptographic equipment, avionics updates, training, and comprehensive logistical support.
The DSCA letter makes clear the rationale for the sale, stating that it “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by allowing Pakistan to retain interoperability with US and partner forces in ongoing counterterrorism efforts and in preparation for future contingency operations.”
The proposed sale is also aimed at modernising Pakistan’s F-16 fleet and addressing operational safety concerns. The letter notes that it will “maintain Pakistan’s capability to meet current and future threats by updating and refurbishing its Block–52 and Mid Life Upgrade F–16 fleet.”
These updates will provide more “seamless integration and interoperability between the Pakistan Air Force and the US Air Force in combat operations, exercises, and training, and refurbishment will extend the aircraft life through 2040 while addressing critical flight safety concerns,” the letter adds.
The letter also emphasises Pakistan’s readiness to absorb the technology, stating that the country “has shown a commitment to maintaining its military forces and will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces.” It also addresses regional concerns, asserting that “the proposed sale of this equipment and support will not alter the basic military balance in the region.”

 

Lockheed Martin Company of Fort Worth, Texas, will serve as the principal contractor for the sale. The US defence agency pointed out that “implementation of this proposed sale will not require the assignment of any additional US Government or contractor representatives to Pakistan” and that there will be “no adverse impact on US defence readiness as a result of this proposed sale.”
The total estimated value of the sale is $686 million, with major defence equipment valued at $37 million and other items at $649 million. The major defence equipment (MDE) component includes 92 Link–16 data link systems and six inert Mk–82 500-lb general purpose bomb bodies; the latter will have no explosive payload and will be used for weapons integration testing.
Link-16 is an advanced command, control, communications and intelligence system. It is a secure, real-time communication network that shares tactical data among allied forces and is used by US and allied Nato forces. The system is also resistant to electronic jamming from enemy air and ground assets.
“It provides the warfighter key theatre functions such as surveillance, identification, air control, weapons engagement coordination, and direction for all services and allied forces,” the letter read.
The rest of the deal consists of $649m worth of non-MDE equipment, including the AN/APQ–10C Simple Key Loaders and AN/APX–126 Advanced Identification Friend or Foe system — used to identify hostile and allied aircraft.
It also includes hardware and software modifications to support the Operational Flight Program and mandated avionics updates, as well as KY–58M and KIV–78 cryptographic appliqués, which are National Security Agency (NSA)-certified modules used in military aircraft and other tactical systems for secure communications and identification.
The equipment also covers additional secure communications, precision navigation and cryptographic devices, Joint Mission Planning Systems and support, Common Munitions Built-in-test Reprogramming Equipment, and ADU–981 missile adaptor units.
Other weapons integration, test and support equipment, spare and repair parts, software delivery and support, publications and technical documentation, full motion simulators, personnel training, and training equipment are also included.
The package will also provide Pakistan with US government and contractor engineering, technical, and logistics support services, studies and surveys, and other related elements of logistical and program support.
Pakistan had requested upgrades to its F-16 fleet in 2021 amid strained relations, but Washington delayed its response. The country is now less dependent on the F-16s, having acquired and jointly developed other platforms, which proved their worth during the May 2025 air war by inflicting significant damage on the Indian fleet.
“Pakistan still welcomes the US offer, as it will enhance the shelf life of its F-16s until 2040,” a diplomatic source said.
The DSCA letter, sent to the Speaker of the House and the chairmen of the relevant congressional committees, concludes that the sale “will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States” while ensuring that Pakistan can continue to operate its F-16 fleet safely and effectively.</p><small>2025-12-11 02:29</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/638635-ministry-alerts-public-to-fake-company-offering-jobs-in-saudi-arabia' target='_blank'><strong>Ministry alerts public to 'fake company' offering jobs in Saudi Arabia</strong></a><br><p>
