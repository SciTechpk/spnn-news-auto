The WCL is an international cricket league where retired, non-contracted international players return to competitive T20 cricket, according to the league’s website. The tournament commenced on July 18 and is being held in Birmingham, England.
Earlier in the month, a group match between the two teams was also cancelled after Indian players, including Shikhar Dhawan, refused to play against Pakistan.
In a statement posted on X today, WCL organisers announced: “Taking all factors into consideration, the match between the India Champions and the Pakistan Champions has been called off. As a result, Pakistan Champions will advance to the final.”
 






The WCL said it respected the India Champions’ decision to withdraw from the semi-finals and “we equally respect the Pakistan Champions’ readiness to compete”.
The league organisers added they believed in the power of sport to inspire and bring about positive change in the world; however, “public sentiment must always be respected — after all, everything we do is for our audience.”
The owner of Pakistan Champions, Kamil Khan, said: “We have been given a walkover by the WCL management as their stance was that whoever does not play the semi-final, the opposition will be given a walkover.”
The Edgbaston Stadium management also said that the WCL event organisers had confirmed that tomorrow’s (Thursday’s) match between Pakistan and India was cancelled.
The management said that spectators would receive a 50 per cent refund and that the second semi-final scheduled for later in the day would go ahead as planned.
 






In May, Pakistan and India stepped back from an all-out war after a four-day military confrontation — the worst in decades — in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam attack in India-occupied Kashmir. New Delhi blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, launching Operation Sindoor. Islamabad has strongly denied the accusations.
During the conflict, India’s head coach Gautam Gambhir had called for a complete halt to cricketing engagements with Pakistan at any forum.
The recent tensions also briefly cast a shadow on this year’s Asia Cup, with speculation that India would pull out of the Asia Cup. However, the two teams are due to face each other in the tournament in September this year.
However, Indian parliamentarians have also called for a boycott of that match.</p><small>2025-07-30 18:15</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30223104bf13ffc.jpg?r=225017' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927638/thousands-honour-ozzy-osbourne-at-uk-hometown-funeral-procession' target='_blank'><strong>Thousands honour Ozzy Osbourne at UK hometown funeral procession</strong></a><br><p>Thousands lined the streets of UK city Birmingham on Wednesday to pay an emotional farewell to hometown hero Ozzy Osbourne as the heavy metal hellraiser was laid to rest.
Black Sabbath frontman Osbourne, who earned the nickname the “Prince of Darkness” and once bit a bat while on stage, died on July 22 at the age of 76. He had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2019 and died 17 days after playing a final gig to a sold-out crowd in Birmingham.
Osbourne’s funeral procession set off at around 1200 GMT (5pm PKT) on a route planned with the rocker’s family through the English city.
Chants of “Ozzy! Ozzy! Ozzy!” could be heard, with one fan crying out “we love you Ozzy!” as his coffin — sitting in a stately black Jaguar hearse topped with flower arrangements — and other vehicles crawled by.
The procession, which earlier passed the star’s childhood home in the city’s Aston area, was accompanied by a live brass band performance by local musicians from Bostin’ Brass.
Fan Mhairi Larner said it was “overwhelming” and “very emotional” to be part of the city’s farewell to a star who’d been so “proud of his roots”.
“I’ve been a fan as long as I can remember, and I raised my son to do the same,” said the 31-year-old carer who had travelled from the central city of Nottingham. “He was just nuts, a little bit weird, but it’s nice to have someone like this,” she told AFP.
Another fan, Reece Sargeant, came with friends to say goodbye.
“I think it was important to come and pay our respects … Ozzy and Black Sabbath really put Birmingham on the map,” he said.
The 16-year-old described the band’s last concert as “out of this world”.
Osbourne famously once said he wanted his funeral to be a celebration of his life and not a “mope-fest”.
The procession paused at the Black Sabbath bench — an art installation featuring headshots of each member on a bridge also named after the band.
Visibly emotional family members, including his widow, Sharon Osbourne, laid flowers at the bench and read some of the written tributes that have been left there, along with balloons and flowers.
Thousands of fans have gathered at the bridge in recent days, mourning the death of the musician who was instrumental in pioneering heavy metal.
The cortege, led by police motorbikes, then continued its slow journey towards a private funeral service.
‘Tribute’
“Ozzy was more than a music legend — he was a son of Birmingham,” Zafar Iqbal, the lord mayor of the central English city, said in a statement.
“It was important to the city that we support a fitting, dignified tribute ahead of a private family funeral.
“We’re proud to host it here with his loving family in the place where it all began,” Iqbal, who could be seen hugging family members when the procession stopped in central Birmingham, added.
Black Sabbath enjoyed huge commercial success in the 1970s and 80s after forming in Birmingham in 1968. Their eponymous 1970 debut album made the UK top 10 and paved the way for a string of hit records, including their most famous song, ‘Paranoid’.
The group went on to sell more than 75 million albums worldwide and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006. Osbourne was added for a second time last year as a solo artist.
 
 

Osbourne gained notoriety for his outlandish stunts, many fuelled by his legendary indulgence in drugs and alcohol.
In 1989, he was arrested for drunkenly trying to strangle his wife, Sharon, which he once mentioned in a 2007 interview.
His live performances at the height of his hedonism have gone down in rock folklore, particularly the 1982 gig in the US city of Des Moines when he bit a bat on stage.
Osbourne said he thought a fan had thrown a rubber bat onstage, and it was not until he took a bite that he realised it was real.</p><small>2025-07-30 17:50</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616566-pakistans-win-over-india-stunned-world-says-pm-shehbaz' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan's win over India stunned world, says PM Shehbaz</strong></a><br><p>

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif chaired a meeting of the federal cabinet today, which unanimously approved the National AI Policy 2025, designed to create a complete AI ecosystem in the country. The policy aims to democratise access to artificial intelligence, enhance public services and open up new employment and innovation avenues.
“Our youth are Pakistan’s greatest asset. Providing them with education, skills, and equal opportunities in AI is a top priority,” PM Shehbaz said.
The AI policy outlined training a million AI professionals by 2030, establishing an AI Innovation Fund and AI Venture Fund to boost private sector involvement, creating 50,000 AI-driven civic projects and 1,000 local AI products in the next five years.
It also called for the distribution of 3,000 annual AI scholarships and facilitation of 1,000 research projects, inclusion of women and individuals with disabilities through accessible education and financing, strengthening cybersecurity and national data security protocols, promoting global partnerships and compliance with international AI regulations.
An AI Council and a comprehensive master plan and action matrix will oversee the policy’s implementation.
 






The prime minister applauded the Ministry of IT and allied institutions for their timely efforts, saying, “AI will not only modernise our economy but also enhance productivity across agriculture, public services, and governance.”
 
 

The cabinet also ratified decisions made in earlier sessions of the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and the Committee on Legislative Business held on July 8, 17, and 25, respectively.
Earlier in the month, Pakistani AI platform SOCByte launched the country’s first AI-powered cybersecurity programme designed to provide critical information to professionals.
In May, the Ministry of Finance announced the allocation of 2,000 megawatts of electricity for Bit­coin mining and AI data centres to “transform Pak­is­tan into a global leader in digital innovation”.
In April, in a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court emphasised the potential of AI to streamline the judicial system, reduce delays, improve case management systems and expand legal knowledge — particularly at the district level — but urged a cautious and ethically grounded approach to its integration.
Cabinet approves Haj Policy 2026
The cabinet also approved next year’s Haj policy, with the prime minister also directing complete digitisation of the Haj operation beginning in 2026, ensuring transparency, efficiency and world-class services for pilgrims.
He emphasised that no compromise would be tolerated in providing top-tier facilities to Pakistani pilgrims. “Ensuring comfort, transparency, and timely support for every pilgrim is our foremost duty,” PM Shehbaz said.
The new Haj policy allocates 70 per cent quota to the government and 30pc to private operators. Notably, private companies that failed to fulfil their responsibilities in the previous year would now be required to accommodate affected individuals in 2026.
Moreover, the federal cabinet approved third-party validation for all Hajj operations, real-time monitoring of payments and application processes under private operators, a mandatory minimum of 2,000 pilgrims per private company, 1,000 seats reserved for hardship cases,
It also approved the use of enhanced digital tools, including the Pak Hajj mobile app, digital wristbands and mobile SIMs for better tracking and service delivery, transparent selection of assistants through competitive testing, emergency compensation mechanisms and upgraded lodging and food arrangements.
The prime minister also directed the Ministry of Information Technology to collaborate with the Ministry of Religious Affairs to ensure seamless digital transformation of the entire Hajj process.</p><small>2025-07-30 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616554-cabinet-greenlights-national-ai-policy-to-train-1m-launch-1000-products' target='_blank'><strong>Cabinet greenlights national AI policy to train 1m, launch 1,000 products</strong></a><br><p>

Imran’s sons — Sulaiman Khan, 28, and Kasim, 26 — called attention to their father’s incarceration for the first time publicly in May. Earlier this month, Imran’s sister Aleema Khan said Sulaiman and Kasim will go to the United States before coming to Pakistan as part of a movement calling for the ex-premier’s release. The siblings visited the US and engaged US lawmakers on the issue of their father’s incarceration.
Imran, imprisoned since August 2023, is serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case and also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.
In an interview on US media outlet Real America’s Voice shared today, Kasim said, “Right now he’s in really, really poor conditions and it looks like they’re getting worse and worse by the moment. So we’re looking for any way out possible.”
While emphasising that Imran was “incarcerated in a solitary confinement cell”, he said, “The state of the cell he’s in is awful, quite frankly.”
He continued, “He’s showering in muddy water.  I don’t mean unfiltered water. It’s muddy, dirty water,” alleging that 10 people who were incarcerated had died from filthy conditions.
Kasim expressed worry over not being able to see his father and said, “There were moments … he went 10 days without any light in his cell,” calling it a “torture tactic”.
“He gets only two hours a day in daylight. We’re not able to speak to him at all,” he added.
 






Kasim said that he and his brother were “looking to America at the moment” for support, stating, “A lot of the people here have expressed concern. It seems like it might be the only route out at the moment.”
Speaking about meeting US President Donald Trump’s key aide Richard Grenell, he said, “Grennell was very kind to spend some time with us.”
He continued, “We spoke at length and I don’t want to get into details but I’m very, very hopeful from that.”
He said that Imran from a prison cell won the Feb 2024 elections, which went through “vicious rigging”.
“[Despite] the amount of underhand tactics they used before the election to rig it against his favour, [he] still he managed to win.”
Separately, Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan said today that the sons would “definitely” come to Pakistan as they had a National Identity Card for Overseas Pakistanis (Nicop) and they were “citizens of Pakistan”.
“If anything were to happen to Imran’s sons, it would become an international matter,” she told reporters.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif remarked, “Why would the government stop Imran’s sons from coming to Pakistan?”
He told reporters in Islamabad that the government did not want PTI to “resort to any violence”. “The PTI will not be allowed to pull off another May 9 or Nov 26.”
A day earlier, PTI swiftly rubbished media reports claiming that the incarcerated leader told reporters at Adiala Jail that his sons would not be coming to Pakistan and taking part in or leading any protest.
PTI Central Information Secretary Waqas Akram had stated: “The news circulating in the media regarding Imran Khan Sahib’s children is completely false. Imran Khan sahib has absolutely not stopped his children from coming to Pakistan.
“I would request those media friends who report from Adiala to only broadcast exactly what Khan sahib says. It is inappropriate to take things out of context, selectively, or to present conversations according to their own wishes.”</p><small>2025-07-30 17:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30212830a8326ba.jpg?r=213128' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927632/trump-pushes-for-release-of-epstein-maxwell-grand-jury-testimony' target='_blank'><strong>Trump pushes for release of Epstein, Maxwell grand jury testimony</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump’s administration, seeking to ease an uproar plaguing his presidency, urged two judges to release testimony to a grand jury that indicted Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell on sex trafficking charges.
In late-night court filings on Tuesday, US federal prosecutors said unsealing the materials would be appropriate given the “abundant public interest” in the case of Epstein, the late financier, and Maxwell, an imprisoned British socialite.
The Republican Trump had promised to make public Epstein-related files if reelected and accused Democrats of covering up the truth. But this month, the Department of Justice (DOJ) said a previously touted Epstein client list did not in fact exist, angering Trump’s supporters.
DOJ first sought court permission on July 18 to make public transcripts of the confidential testimony given by witnesses years ago in the two cases, but Manhattan-based US District Judges Richard Berman and Paul Engelmayer asked the government to flesh out the legal bases for the requests.
Trump has faced pressure to make public documents from the federal investigations into Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, and his longtime girlfriend, Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021.
Even if one or both of the judges allow the transcripts to be made public, it is not clear whether the public would learn anything new or noteworthy.
In the filings, prosecutors said the only witness at Epstein’s grand jury was an FBI agent. That same agent and a New York City Police Department detective were the only witnesses at Maxwell’s grand jury, prosecutors said.
Maxwell’s four-week trial in 2021 included public testimony from alleged sex trafficking victims, associates of Epstein and Maxwell, and law enforcement officers. She is now serving a 20-year prison sentence in Florida and is asking the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. She had pleaded not guilty.
Trump supporters angered
The unsealing requests came after Trump earlier this month asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the release of grand jury transcripts. The president did so after the Justice Department said it concluded that Epstein died by suicide and that there was no incriminating list of his clients.
The Justice Department’s announcement angered some of Trump’s conservative supporters who believe the government is covering up Epstein’s ties to the rich and powerful and that the financier was murdered in jail.
Grand juries are convened by prosecutors and meet in secret to hear witness testimony and decide whether to indict people suspected of crimes. Records of their proceedings usually remain sealed. There are only limited circumstances under which such transcripts can be disclosed.
The transcripts would not represent all previously unreleased material in the government’s possession. Investigators and prosecutors may pursue leads that they cannot substantiate or interview potential witnesses whom they do not ultimately call to testify before a grand jury.
US District Judge Robin Rosenberg in Florida last week denied the administration’s request to unseal records from grand jury probes in 2005 and 2007 in that state into Epstein. The judge said the request did not fall into any of the limited exceptions that may allow for the release of such material.
Democrats use obscure law to seek release of Epstein files
Democrats today moved to force Trump to release files from the investigation into Epstein, invoking an obscure law to keep up the pressure on the administration.
The president raised further questions about his past relationship with Epstein on Tuesday when he told reporters he fell out with his former friend after the disgraced financier “stole” employees from the spa at his Mar-a-Lago resort.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Democrats on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee wrote to the Justice Department asking for the materials under a section of federal law known as the “rule of five”.
The measure — introduced a century ago but rarely used — requires government departments to provide relevant information if any five members of the Senate’s chief watchdog panel request it.
It is not clear if it could be enforced in court, but even if the effort fails, it keeps the spotlight on an issue that has upended Trump’s summer, dividing Republicans and leading to the early closure of the House of Representatives.
Trump has urged his supporters to drop demands for the Epstein files, but Democrats in Congress, with limited Republican support, have been seeking a floor vote to force their release.
House Oversight Committee Democrats, backed by some Republicans, approved a subpoena last week for the Justice Department to hand over the documents, although the demand has yet to be sent.
Lawmakers have also been seeking testimony from Maxwell, whose lawyer has said she would speak to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee if granted immunity for her testimony.
“The Oversight Committee will respond to Ms Maxwell’s attorney soon, but it will not consider granting congressional immunity for her testimony,” a spokesman for the panel said.
Democrats have also sought to attach votes on the Epstein files to unrelated bills multiple times, prompting Speaker Mike Johnson to send lawmakers home for the summer a day early last week rather than risk them succeeding.
“Donald Trump promised he would release the Epstein files while he was on the campaign trail. He made that promise, and he has yet to do it,” Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday.</p><small>2025-07-30 17:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30123616acc66ae.png?r=125151' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927587/trump-says-india-to-pay-25pc-tariff-from-aug-1-with-additional-penalty-for-russian-energy-purchases' target='_blank'><strong>Trump says India to pay 25pc tariff from Aug 1 with additional penalty for Russian energy purchases</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump on Wednesday imposed a 25 per cent tariff on goods imported from India starting August 1, along with an unspecified penalty for buying Russian weapons and oil, potentially straining relations with the world’s most populous democracy.
The US decision singles out India more severely than other major trading partners, and threatens to unravel months of talks between the two countries, undermining a key strategic partner of Washington and a counterbalance to China.
In posts on his social platform Truth Social, he said the US had a “massive trade deficit” with India.
In another post, he said: “Remember, while India is our friend, we have, over the years, done relatively little business with them because their tariffs are far too high, among the highest in the world and they have the most strenuous and obnoxious non-monetary trade barriers of any country.
“Also, they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia’s largest buyer of energy, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to stop the killing in Ukraine — all things not good! India will therefore be paying a tariff of 25pc, plus a penalty for the above, starting on August 1st.”
 


White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Trump has been frustrated with how trade talks with India are progressing and believes his 25pc tariff announcement will help the situation.
Trump and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will have more information “shortly” on the additional penalty, Hassett told reporters at the White House.
In response, the Indian government said in a statement that it was studying the implications of Trump’s announcements and remained dedicated to securing a fair trade deal with the US.
“India and the US have been engaged in negotiations on concluding a fair, balanced and mutually beneficial bilateral trade agreement over the last few months. We remain committed to that objective,” it said.
India said it attached the utmost importance to protecting and promoting the welfare of its farmers, entrepreneurs and small businesses.
“The government will take all steps necessary to secure our national interest, as has been the case with other trade agreements,” it said.
The White House has previously warned India about its high average applied tariffs — nearly 39pc on agricultural products — with rates climbing to 45pc on vegetable oils and around 50pc on apples and corn.
Russia continued to be the top oil supplier to India during the first six months of 2025, making up 35pc of overall supplies.
The US currently has a $45.7 billion trade deficit with India.
The news pushed the Indian rupee down 0.4pc to around 87.8 against the US dollar in the non-deliverable forwards market, from its close at 87.42 during market hours. Gift Nifty futures were trading at 24,692 points, down 0.6pc.
Earlier, he said a trade deal with India had yet to be finalised and warned of possible higher tariffs ahead of an August 1 deadline to seal an agreement.
His comments followed a Reuters report that India was preparing to accept higher tariffs of 20-25pc on its exports to the US in the absence of a trade deal, as it holds off on offering fresh concessions ahead of Friday’s deadline.
“India has been a good friend, but India has charged basically more tariffs, almost more than any other country,” Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday, adding that it would come to an end.
Asked about the Reuters report, Trump said a trade deal had not been finalised and India could face steeper tariffs.
 


India plans to resume broader trade talks with the US in mid-August when a US delegation is due to visit, hoping to seal a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement by October, Indian officials said.
“Talks are progressing well,” an official said, adding Trump could issue a tariff order in a “worst-case scenario”. The official declined to be identified without authorisation to speak to the media.
“But, we assume it would be (a) temporary measure, considering the five rounds of trade talks that have taken place. A deal will soon be worked out,” the official said.
Trump also reiterated his claim that he helped broker a ceasefire to the conflict between India and Pakistan earlier this year, saying both sides accepted his request.
“That was great,” he said describing his friendship with India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India disputes Trump’s claims that he brokered the ceasefire.
Analysts say Trump’s remarks on the India-Pakistan conflict have cast a shadow on trade negotiations.
 
 

On Monday, Trump said most partners that do not negotiate separate trade deals would soon face tariffs of 15-20pc on their exports to the US, well above the broad 10pc tariff he imposed in April. His administration will notify some 200 countries soon of their new “world tariff” rate.
US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told CNBC that the India talks require more time, noting Trump wants good deals, not fast ones.
India has shown “strong interest in opening portions of its market” though its trade policy had long focused on protecting domestic interests, Greer said.
 


Piyush Goyal, India’s trade minister, told Reuters last week India was making “fantastic” progress in US trade talks.
Indian officials said New Delhi had offered tariff cuts on a wide range of goods and was working to ease non-tariff barriers.
However, agriculture and dairy remain no-go areas, with India unwilling to allow US imports of genetically modified soybean or corn, or to open its dairy sector.
Total bilateral goods trade reached about $129bn in 2024, with India posting a surplus of nearly $46bn.
Officials said India was calibrating its strategy amid broader US tariff threats targeting Brics nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and others), including India, over issues such as de-dollarisation and Russian oil purchases.
“We remain hopeful of securing a deal that gives Indian exporters preferential access compared to our peers,” a second Indian government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Contentious issues
“Higher tariffs for India compared to countries it competes with, for exports to the US, are going to be challenging,” said Ranen Banerjee, a partner of economic advisory services at PwC India.
India’s commerce ministry, which is leading the trade talks, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
US and Indian negotiators had held multiple rounds of discussions to resolve contentious issues, particularly over market access into India for US agricultural and dairy products.
Despite progress in some areas, Indian officials resisted opening the domestic market to imports of wheat, corn, rice and genetically modified soybeans, citing risks to the livelihood of millions of Indian farmers.
The US had flagged concerns over India’s increasing and burdensome import-quality requirements, among its many barriers to trade, in a report released in March.
The new tariffs are expected to impact India’s goods exports to the US, estimated at around $87bn in 2024, including labour-intensive products such as garments, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, and petrochemicals.
India now joins a growing list of countries facing higher tariffs under Trump’s “Liberation Day” trade policy, aimed at reshaping US trade relations by demanding greater reciprocity.
The setback comes despite earlier commitments by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Trump to conclude the first phase of a trade deal by autumn 2025 and expand bilateral trade to $500bn by 2030, from $191bn in 2024.
Indian officials have previously indicated that they view the US as a key strategic partner, particularly in counterbalancing China. But they have emphasised the need to preserve policy space on agriculture, data governance and state subsidies.
Hopes for a deal
It was not immediately clear whether the announcement was a negotiating tactic. While Trump railed against Japan in a June 30 Truth Social post and said there would likely be no deal with the North Asian nation, a deal was agreed on July 22.
An Indian government official told Reuters that New Delhi continued to remain engaged with the United States to seal an agreement.
Economists, too, remained hopeful.
“While the negotiations seem to have broken down, we don’t think the trade-deal haggling between the two nations is over yet,” said Madhavi Arora, an economist at Emkay Global.</p><small>2025-07-30 17:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616545-kp-govt-police-and-security-forces-to-work-jointly-to-restore-peace-says-cm-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>KP govt, police, security forces to work jointly to restore peace: CM Gandapur</strong></a><br><p>

During interrogation, the suspects confessed that they had gunned down a man identified as Abdul Rehman  in Matli on May 18, 2025, where a case was registered under terror charges.
“The weapon used in the murder has also been recovered from their custody, which has been sent to the police’s forensic science lab for investigation purposes,” the press release added.
The suspects also admitted that they had stayed at a hotel in Hyderabad for five days for the purpose of carrying out a targeted killing of their victim.
“They continued reconnaissance of Abdul Rehman till May 13 and when they got an opportunity on Sunday (May 18), they targeted the man outside a barber shop.”
The suspects were wanted in different cases in Punjab.
As per the statement, the investigation of the murder case was handed over to the CTD Karachi on the application of the complainant.
“The CTD assessed the case, obtained evidence from the crime scene in Matli and with the help of technical evidence and intelligence, traced the suspects and arrested them,” the statement added.
The Sindh police chief has announced a cash and appreciation certificate for the CTD team for arresting the suspects, according to the department’s spokesperson.
On Monday, three terrorists, including the mastermind behind the November 2024 attack on Chinese engineers, were killed during a counterterrorism operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area, CTD officials had said.
In June, the Sindh government made a hefty allocation of Rs179.7 billion for law and order, including security, law enforcement and prisons in Sindh for the financial year 2025-26.
In April, the CTD and an intelligence agency arrested a suspected militant belonging to the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) in a raid in Karachi’s Lee Market.</p><small>2025-07-30 16:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30184602764bd61.png?r=185442' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927619/german-mountaineer-laura-dahlmeier-confirmed-dead-after-attempting-laila-peak-summit' target='_blank'><strong>German mountaineer Laura Dahlmeier confirmed dead after attempting Laila Peak summit</strong></a><br><p>German mountaineer Laura Dahlmeier, who went missing two days ago while attempting to scale Gilgit-Baltistan’s Laila Peak (6,096 metres), was confirmed dead on Wednesday, according to officials.
Mountains in the north of Pakistan are a popular destination for adventure tourism, with many climbers aiming to summit prestigious peaks such as K2 and Nanga Parbat. However, rough terrain and harsh weather conditions create a challenge, frequently causing deaths and injuries.
She was climbing in alpine style with her partner, Marina Eva, also from Germany. Dahlmeier was at an altitude of approximately 5,700m when she was hit by the rock on Monday afternoon, while Eva was below her on the mountain at the time.
Despite being injured, Dahlmeier managed to communicate with her partner, but Eva was unable to reach her. A coordinated rescue operation was launched, involving Pakistan Army Aviation helicopters and local high-altitude porters. However, adverse weather and the difficult terrain prevented helicopters from landing at the accident site.
In a statement issued today, Alpine Club of Pakistan (ACP) Vice President Karrar Haidri said: “German Olympic champion Laura Dahlmeier was confirmed dead on Wednesday after a tragic mountaineering accident in the high mountains of Pakistan.”
He added that “persistent adverse weather conditions had significantly hindered rescue operations in the days leading up to the announcement.”
The statement said ACP President Major General Irfan Arshad extended his condolences to the deceased’s family, friends and global mountaineering community during their time of profound loss.
Haidri said that Laura died “doing what she loved most — pushing her limits in the high mountains”. “Her strength, determination and passion have left an indelible mark on both the sporting and mountaineering communities,” he added.
GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq also confirmed the death in a statement,
The dangerous nature of the site made rescue efforts “impossible”, her agency said in a statement quoted by AFP on Wednesday, which confirmed her death.
“Rescue efforts to recover her failed and the operation was suspended,” the statement continued.
Her representatives told Germany’s Die Welt newspaper that Dahlmeier most likely died instantly, while her mountaineering partner was unharmed and remained at the site.
“It was Laura Dahlmeier’s express and written will that in a case like this, no one should risk their life to recover her,” they said.
“It was her wish to leave her body behind on the mountain in this case. This is also in line with the wishes of her relatives.”

Dahlmeier, an experienced mountaineer, had been in the region since the end of June and had already ascended the Great Trango Tower.
German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier issued a statement today calling Dahlmeier “an ambassador for our country around the world [and] a role model for peaceful, joyful, and fair coexistence across borders.”
The German Olympic Sports Confederation expressed deep sorrow at the news.
“She was more than an Olympic champion — she was someone with heart, attitude and vision,” it said in a statement on X.
 






Dahlmeier, who was born in the Bavarian ski town of Garmisch-Partenkirchen, was also honoured by the premier of her home state, Markus Soeder.
“Laura Dahlmeier epitomised her native Bavaria in the best sense of the word: she was ambitious and successful, yet always remained humble and close to her homeland,” he said in a statement.
“Even after her active career, she shared her love of sport as a winter sports expert, member of the mountain rescue service and ski guide.”
She won seven world championship gold medals, and at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang she became the first female biathlete to win both the sprint and the pursuit at the same Games.
Dahlmeier retired from professional competition in 2019 at the age of 25.
She went on to become a commentator on biathlon events for German broadcaster ZDF, and also took up mountaineering.
She was a certified mountain and ski guide and an active member of the mountain rescue, according to her team.
Earlier this month, a tourist from the Czech Republic, Klára Kolouchová, died after falling into a ravine at the Nanga Parbat base camp in GB.
Kolouchová, 46, was part of a multinational expedition atte­m­pting to summit the mountain. Her health reportedly deteriorated at Camp 4, forcing her to abort the climb and begin her de­­s­­­cent with Nepali Sherpa Tara­man Tamang.</p><small>2025-07-30 16:22</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30204705056ffe9.jpg?r=210111' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927600/jirgas-to-be-held-from-aug-2-to-address-woes-of-kp-residents-cm-gandapur' target='_blank'><strong>Jirgas to be held from Aug 2 to address woes of KP residents: CM Gandapur</strong></a><br><p>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced on Wednesday that a series of jirgas will be convened from August 2 to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.
The provincial government has opposed the newly launched military operation in Bajaur unless it is taken into confidence by the Centre and has vowed to lift a three-day curfew imposed in the district’s 16 areas yesterday.
Security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery launched ‘Operation Sarbakaf’ against terrorists in the Lowi Mamund tehsil on Tuesday. Tribal elders in Bajaur and some other KP districts have long opposed any military operation, citing concerns over displacement.
Although not confirmed officially by security forces, sources said that at least four terrorists were killed, around 12 were wounded, and about 10 were captured alive in different areas of the Lowi Mamund tehsil. Locals also claimed that a child was among two civilians who died, and eight others, including two minors and a woman, were wounded in clashes between security forces and terrorists.
In a video statement issued today, Gandapur emphasised the importance of unity between the government, state institutions and the general public.
“The public and all institutions have to work together to establish peace,” Gandapur said. “We have to achieve peace because our future depends on it.”
According to the chief minister, there was a “conspiracy” in effect to build discord between the government, the public and institutions. He added that those building distrust need to be “exposed” to thwart this conspiracy.
“Unless the people stand with their government and institutions, we will not win this war. Everyone needs to stand with us amid this war,” he stated, adding that the state will target both terrorists and their facilitators.
“Facilitators … of terrorism need to be targeted because it defies our faith, our laws and our traditions,” he warned.
“These terrorists take shelter in populated areas so that when they carry out attacks, a retaliatory strike by our armed forces will cause collateral damage,” Gandapur continued.
“They are doing this to create distrust between the people and the armed forces. This is why we need to expel them from our cities. We will not tolerate their presence in populated areas.”
Gandapur added that government officials, police and military personnel are “guests” of the people of KP, adding that according to tradition, “violence against guests is intolerable and we will give a befitting response”.
Paying tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in the fight against terrorism, the chief minister said that the jirgas will start at the divisional level on August 2, with stakeholders and political figures from multiple areas across KP.
“We will all sit together and have consultations on how to alleviate people’s reservations and concerns,” he said.
“Following these jirgas, there will be a grand jirga, where we will present our policy, a plan and future steps and discuss it with stakeholders and government officials.
“Nobody wants any operation because of the damage it causes. When we receive reports of their [terrorists’] presence, we will launch an investigation. The investigations will remain ongoing until we eradicate the threat of terrorism,” he added. “This will ensure that there is no collateral damage.”
 






The chief minister also chaired a meeting of the provincial apex committee, where authorities delivered a briefing on the security challenges in the province, a statement from the CM’s office read.
According to the statement, a detailed review of the peace situation in KP was carried out, with particular focus on merged districts.
The meeting’s participants “expressed determination to continue joint efforts against terrorism and came to an agreement on measures to gain full public confidence in operations to eliminate terrorism”, the statement reads.
There was an emphasis on improving coordination between civil administration, police, security forces and intelligence agencies for effective operations against terrorists, it added.
“Terrorism has become a scourge that the government, the public and institutions must work together to eradicate on a permanent basis,” the statement reads. “Terrorists are a common enemy and everyone wants to end terrorism.”
 






Chairing a PTI parliamentary party meeting in Peshawar late last night, Gandapur said: “We are not in favour of any military operation without the provincial government being taken into confidence.”
 
 

He lamented that the “relationship of confidence between our army and our public” was eroding due to the “martyred civilians and collateral damage in Bajaur”, adding that the lack of trust was failing the country’s fight against terrorism.
The meeting vowed that the recent curfew in parts of Bajaur would be revoked today. However, an official announcement for that is yet to be made.
It was decided that further course of action regarding an operation would be announced after the matter was debated in the KP Assembly.
“We are standing with our public. We will go to every extent for our public,” CM Gandapur vowed. “We cannot ruin our soil for those decisions that are imposed on us without our consultation.”
The meeting made several decisions regarding the ongoing security situation and its future actions to address the concerns raised by the people.
CM Gandapur ordered all deputy commissioners not to impose any curfew without permission from the KP home department, regardless of “any kind of situation”. He also decided to transfer the powers of imposing Section 144, under which a curfew is put in place, to the department.
 


The PTI meeting further decided to revoke the KP Actions (in aid of civil power) Ordinance 2019, with legislation for that expected to be introduced in Friday’s KP Assembly session.
The ordinance provided legal cover to several detention centres set up during military operations — similar to two 2011 regulations imposed in the tribal areas.
The gathering also approved the decisions taken at a multi-party conference (MPC) held last week, wherein Gandapur opposed a renewed military offensive to eradicate militancy in the region and vowed to take action against all armed outfits.
Further, the KP CM said he would meet with Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir to discuss the province’s law and order situation.
Speaking on a series of jirgas planned in the upcoming week, the chief minister said: “In the next 10 days, we will hold multiple jirgas, each of two districts, after which a grand jirga of all stakeholders in terrorism-ridden areas will be convened.
“In view of the decisions made in the jirgas, policies will be re-evaluated,” he said, adding that the government will convey the reassessment to “those responsible for protecting the borders”.
The KP CM claimed that soldiers who sacrificed their lives were “not rewarded properly due to wrong policies”. “We have repeatedly said to review these policies.”
Protesters gather in Bajaur: PTI MPA
Meanwhile, PTI MPA Anwar Zeb Khan said protesters were gathering at Bajaur’s Umary Chowk to demonstrate against the “unannounced operation”.
Pictures shared by him of the purported protest showed hundreds of men gathered on a street.
The gathering follows yesterday’s protest by residents of War Mamund tehsil against the operation, where they demanded that authorities ensure the safety of civilians during the operation.
Besides Zeb, MPAs Dr Hamidur Rehman and Mohammad Nisar Khan; former MNA Gul Zafar Khan; and MNA Mubarakzeb Khan, the prime minister’s special assistant on tribal districts, have condemned the operation and the curfew in the area.
Former Jamaat-i-Islami senator Mushtaq Ahmed Khan also expressed concerns over the operation’s launch and urged authorities to stop it immediately.
 






The Awami National Party also condemned the military action, with party chief Senator Aimal Wali Khan and provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain questioning its legality. They noted that according to Article 245 of the Constitution, approval of the provincial government was required for military operations.
 






Compensation for slain ‘civilians, soldiers’ in operation
The chief minister also presided over a separate meeting to review the law and order situation in the wake of the Bajaur operation.
CM Gandapur was briefed on the situation by the relevant officials, according to a statement from his office. Expressing his condolences to the bereaved families of “civilians and security personnel martyred in the Bajaur incident”, he announced compensation worth Rs10 million for them.
Compensation of Rs2.5m was also announced for those injured during the “incident”.
The KP chief secretary and Inspector General Zulfiqar Hameed were among various officials present during the meeting.
 






The reported incident comes just days after seven protesters were shot dead and 16 others were injured in Khyber district’s Tirah Valley.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had condemned the “firing on peaceful citizens by khawarij” — a term the state uses to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). However, according to sources and protesters, security personnel guar­ding the installation reportedly had opened fire to control the crowd.
Following the incident, security officials met with a delegation of Tirah elders and announced compensation for the victims on their demand. The KP government also announced separate Rs10m for each deceased and Rs2.5m for the injured.</p><small>2025-07-30 16:12</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/302013244ec9cfd.png?r=203545' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927615/multan-police-arrest-suspect-for-molesting-minor-girl-in-viral-video' target='_blank'><strong>Multan police arrest suspect for molesting minor girl in viral video</strong></a><br><p>The Punjab Police on Wednesday said they arrested a man suspected of molesting a minor girl in Multan district after a video of the incident went viral online.
The video of the incident did the rounds on social media earlier in the week and generated intense criticism with calls for the suspect to be arrested, particularly as it came after the police arrested a man after footage showing him allegedly molesting a minor girl in Kasur district also went viral online.
A statement issued by the Multan Crime Control Department (CCD) today said: “The man who attempted to sexually assault a girl was arrested in an ‘injured’ condition.”
The incident occurred on July 15 in Mustafa Colony, Rashidabad area, with the limits of Bahauddin Zakaria Police Station when “an unknown person tried to sexually assault a girl in the street and fled from the scene”, according to the statement.
A case was registered under Section 377B (unnatural offences with a minor) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) at the BZ Police Station and the investigation of the case was handed over to the CCD.
The statement said the police received a tip-off about the suspect’s whereabouts and conducted a raid at an undisclosed location to arrest him.
“The suspect attempting to evade arrest opened fire on the police team and in a hurry, accidentally fired and injured himself,” the statement said, adding that he was taken to Nishtar Hospital for medical treatment.
“Police identified him through the Criminal Record Office that he was the suspect who molested the minor girl,” the statement added.
It added that the suspect’s criminal record revealed that he was nominated in a case for killing his brother in 2023. The case was registered under Section 302 (punishment for murder) at the BZ Police Station.
As many as 3,364 child abuse cases were reported from across the country last year, according to a civil society report. The report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.
“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.
In January 2018, police recovered the body of six-year-old Zainab Amin from a heap of trash in Kasur, five days after she went missing. A postmortem examination suggested that she may have been raped before she was strangled to death.
The case sparked outrage across the nation and forced the government into action in finding the serial rapist and killer. The culprit, identified as Imran Ali, was convicted of the rape and murder case and sentenced to death. He was hanged to death in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat Central Jail on Oct 17, 2018.
More than two years after the Zainab case, the National Assembly passed the Zainab Alert, Response and Recovery Bill, 2019 that seeks to expedite investigation and punishment for perpetrators of child abuse.</p><small>2025-07-30 15:26</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30172916247f9b0.jpg?r=173231' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927617/russia-faces-tariffs-in-10-days-if-no-progress-on-ending-ukraine-war-trump' target='_blank'><strong>Russia faces tariffs in 10 days if no progress on ending Ukraine war: Trump</strong></a><br><p>United States President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the US would start imposing tariffs and other measures on Russia “10 days from today” if Moscow showed no progress toward ending its more than three-year-long war in Ukraine.
Trump first announced on Monday that he was shortening the initial 50-day deadline he set a month ago for action from Moscow, and mentioned a new deadline of 10 to 12 days. On Tuesday, he told reporters he had not heard a response from Russia.
Speaking aboard Air Force One, Trump said he was not worried about the potential impact of Russian sanctions on the oil market or prices, vowing to boost domestic oil production to offset any impact.
“I don’t know if it’s going to affect Russia, because [Russian President Vladimir Putin] wants to, obviously, probably keep the war going,” Trump said. “But we’re going to put on tariffs and the various things that you put on.”
The US president, who has in the past spoken about having a good relationship with Putin, has grown increasingly frustrated with Moscow’s refusal to agree to a ceasefire. The fresh deadline suggests Trump is prepared to move forward on his threat of sanctions, after previously hesitating on doing so.
Speaking in Scotland on Monday, he threatened sanctions on both Russia and buyers of its exports — also known as secondary sanctions — unless progress is made.
US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters that he raised the issue of secondary sanctions with Chinese officials during two days of bilateral talks this week. He said he told Chinese officials that Beijing could face high tariffs if it continued its Russian oil purchases.
In a post on X, former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, a close ally of Putin, said Trump was playing “a game of ultimatums” that could lead to a war involving the United States.
 






The Kremlin said it continues to monitor statements by Trump regarding sanctions against Moscow, but that Russia had acquired immunity to such measures thanks to long experience.
“We have been living under a huge number of sanctions for quite a long time, our economy operates under a huge number of restrictions,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
“Therefore, of course, we have already developed a certain immunity in this regard, and we continue to note all statements that come from President Trump, from other international representatives on this matter.”
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova called the threat of new sanctions “routine” and said it was odd that the US and the West had not yet understood that imposing such measures did not work and only served to hurt Western economies.
“We see that the West simply cannot let go of the issue of sanctions. It seems as if they are constantly stuck in a rut,” Zakharova told a news briefing in Moscow.
“Apparently, there are no other options left — they have been exhausted. We are responding and taking measures to counteract all of this or even turn it to our own advantage.”
Trump, who is also struggling to achieve a peace deal in Gaza, has touted his role in ending conflicts between India and Pakistan as well as Rwanda and Congo. Before returning to the White House in January, Trump campaigned on a promise to end Russia’s conflict with Ukraine in a day.</p><small>2025-07-30 15:20</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616537-pakistani-businessman-laundered-37-million-court-told' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani businessman laundered £37m, court told</strong></a><br><p>

Pezeshkian will be the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. The visit was initially planned for the last week of July.
In April 2024, Ebrahim Raisi undertook a three-day official visit to Pakistan. During the trip — which took place a month before Raisi’s death in a helicopter crash — the foreign dignitary also visited Lahore and Karachi.
In a post on X, Political Adviser to the Iranian President Mehdi Sanai said Dr Pezeshkian would travel to Pakistan on Saturday at the invitation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.
He said official meetings and discussions with “cultural and commercial elites” were on the agenda.
“The relations between the two countries encompass political, economic, religious and cultural dimensions, and the goals of the trip include developing provincial and border cooperation and increasing trade exchanges from the current $3 billion.”
 






The Foreign Office has been reached out to for a response on the matter.
Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar previously said that President Pezeshkian would “soon” make an official visit to Islamabad, IRNA reported.
Speaking in an interview on the sidelines of his visit to New York, FM Dar had said Pezeshkian was scheduled to visit Pakistan and expressed hope the trip would take place in early August.
“Pakistan supports diplomacy and a wise approach in the region and welcomes all efforts toward de-escalation and dialogue with Iran,” he was quoted as saying.
He said that he was in close contact with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, adding that Pakistan could not remain silent regarding recent events, including the attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Dar had condemned the Israeli regime’s aggression against Iran and the United States’ attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities. “Diplomacy and dialogue are the only way out of the current situation, and Pakistan will continue to support both sides,” he had added.
PM Shehbaz visited Iran on May 27 as part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the conflict with India. He met Iranian leaders, including President Pezeshkian, to strengthen ties and deepen regional cooperation.
He had previously visited Iran in May 2024 to attend the memorial ceremony of former president Raisi and met Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.</p><small>2025-07-30 14:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616528-iranian-president-pezeshkian-to-visit-pakistan-on-saturday-iranian-official' target='_blank'><strong>President Pezeshkian to visit Pakistan on Saturday, says Iranian official</strong></a><br><p>

Monsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September, are crucial to the livelihoods of millions of farmers and food security. However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.
This year’s monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.
Mansehra’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson, Amir Khadam Khan, told Dawn.com that 160 tourists were stranded after floods hit Naran, Jalkhad, Barwai and Besar.
“Rescue 1122 personnel crossed the flood drain on foot near Besar to access more than 160 stranded tourists and vehicles,” he said. “All the people were safely evacuated and accommodated in nearby hotels.”
He added that the Naran Road was also blocked in multiple locations. However, after “tireless” efforts of 12 consecutive hours, it was cleared for all traffic by the National Highway Authority, with the support of the police and the Kaghan Development Authority.
The spokesperson said that the rescue operation still continued in the area, and the stranded tourists’ vehicles were also successfully recovered.
He added that during the operation, Rescue 1122 provided first aid to seven or eight people with minor injuries, severe body pain, hypoglycemia, vomiting and other ailments. Fresh water was also provided to the tourists.
“Fortunately, no serious casualties were reported,” Khadam said.
Meanwhile, flash floods triggered by heavy rain caused the deaths of two children due to a house collapse in the Hazara Division in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
The Abbottabad police spokesperson, Azam Khan, told Dawn.com that two children were killed after a house collapsed in Bakot, Abbottabad, on Tuesday night.
“The bodies were recovered by locals,” he said, adding that the girls were between two and three years old.
Last week, 250 tourists and passengers stranded at the Babusar Highway were rescued by the Diamer district administration, volunteers, police, Rescue 1122 and the army, according to a spokesperson.
However, at the same time, the national death toll from monsoon-related casualties surged to 234 since late June, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority. Of the 234 deaths, 79 were men, 42 women and 113 — nearly half of the total — were children.
4 drown, 1 missing as van falls into nullah in Punjab’s Attock
At least four people drowned, and one child was still missing after a seven-seater van fell into a rain drain in Punjab’s Attock district, according to Rescue 1122.
“At 02:46am, Attock Rescue 1122 received information about a vehicle falling into a storm drain,” according to a press release by District Emergency Officer Ali Hussain.
“The BRV van fell into the rain drain in Tehsil Hassan Abdal at Jharika,” he added.
The bodies of four people have been recovered so far,  Rescue 1122 Punjab spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said in a statement issued at 5:30pm.
“Five people were rescued and shifted to the Hassan Abdal Tehsil Headquarters Hospital,” he added.

The two countries entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
During Tuesday’s debate, Indian Home Minister Amit Shah claimed that security forces killed three “Pakistanis” involved in the Pahalgam attack in Operation Mahadev, Reuters reported. “I want to tell … the entire nation that these were the three terrorists who killed our citizens … and now all three have been killed,” Shah told parliament during the discussion.
In a statement issued today on the Indian parliament debate, FO spokesperson Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan said: “Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless assertions and provocative claims made by the Indian leaders during the Lok Sabha debate on the so-called ‘Operation Sindoor’. These statements reflect a dangerous tendency to distort facts, justify aggression and glorify conflict for domestic consumption.
“The world knows that India attacked Pakistan without any verifiable evidence or a credible investigation into the Pahalgam Attack. During the intervening night of May 6 and 7, 2025, India’s targeting of the alleged terrorist infrastructure resulted actually in the martyrdom of innocent men, women, and children. India failed to achieve any of its strategic objectives. On the other hand, Pakistan’s resounding success in neutralising the Indian fighter jets and military targets is an indisputable fact.”
He said that “instead of misleading their compatriots, the Indian leaders would be well-advised to acknowledge the losses incurred by their armed forces and accept the active role played by the third parties in realising the ceasefire”.
The FO spokesperson said that India had not used the immediate offer made by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for a transparent and independent probe into the Pahalgam Attack but had instead chosen the “path of belligerence and aggression”.
He further added that India had “acted as a judge, jury and executioner at the same time” and thus in the backdrop of all this, “any claims regarding the so-called ‘Operation Mahadev’ do not hold any significance for us”.
“The account given by the Indian home minister is replete with fabrications, leading to serious questions about its credibility. Is it a mere coincidence that the alleged perpetrators of the Pahalgam Attack were killed at the start of the Lok Sabha debate?”
 






The FO statement also criticised the Indian government for its statements about establishing a “new normal” in bilateral relations through the strikes and rubbished New Delhi’s narrative of “nuclear blackmail” on the part of Pakistan, calling such claims “a misleading and self-serving construct” that were “an attempt to veil its own escalatory impulses while shifting blame onto Pakistan”.
“For us, the only ‘normal’ in bilateral relations is respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, and adherence to the principles and purposes of the UN Charter,” the statement read.
 
 

The FO said it was “well known that Pakistan deterred India through its conventional capabilities, affirming that discipline and restraint remain its guiding principles”.
The FO spokesperson also once again expressed disapproval of the “misplaced assertions” by the Indian leadership regarding the Indus Waters Treaty. “India’s decision to hold the treaty in abeyance shows its blatant disregard for the sanctity of international treaties, and strikes at a fundamental pillar of regional cooperation,” the spokesperson said.
He added that India should adhere to the terms of the agreement rather than “taking pride in a unilateral and illegal move”.
“India’s continued reliance on disinformation, jingoism, and chest-thumping risks destabilising South Asia,” the FO stated, reiterating that Pakistan was a “responsible” nation and reaffirming its commitment to “peace, regional stability and a meaningful dialogue for resolution of all outstanding issues”.</p><small>2025-07-30 12:44</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/301531096a9fa1f.png?r=170832' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927601/state-bank-keeps-monetary-policy-rate-unchanged-at-11pc' target='_blank'><strong>State Bank keeps monetary policy rate unchanged at 11pc</strong></a><br><p>The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept its policy rate unchanged on Wednesday at 11 per cent.
The central bank’s policy rate, after being slashed by 1,000bps from 22pc since June 2024 in seven intervals, was cut to 11pc in May. The bank had kept the rate unchanged on June 16 as well.
 


A press release issued by the SBP said its Monetary Policy Committee noted that inflation in June had decelerated to 3.2pc year on year, led mainly by lower food prices, whereas core inflation also declined slightly.
However, it noted that the inflation outlook had worsened in the wake of higher-than-anticipated adjustment in energy prices, especially gas tariffs.
 






“Nonetheless, inflation is projected to stabilise in the target range going forward.
“Moreover, economic activity is gaining further traction amidst the still-unfolding impact of the earlier
reductions in the policy rate. At the same time, the committee noted that the trade deficit is expected to
widen further in FY26 amidst the pickup in economic activity and slowdown in global trade. Given this
macroeconomic outlook and the emerging risks, the MPC considered today’s decision as necessary to ensure price stability,” the SBP said of the decision to keep the policy rate unchanged.
The bank noted that since the MPC’s prior meeting, its foreign exchange reserves had crossed $14 billion on the back of improved financial inflows and a current account surplus.
It said the recent upgrade in Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating had led to a decline in Eurobond yields and narrowed credit default swap spreads in international markets. It also said that inflation expectations had increased slightly for consumers but declined for businesses in the latest sentiment surveys.
The SBP said that the Federal Board of Revenue’s tax revenue for FY25 was recorded at Rs11.7 trillion, which fell short of the revised estimate by around Rs200bn. Lastly, it said that global oil prices
had remained volatile, whereas metal prices increased, while at the same time, the impact of global trade tariffs remained uncertain, prompting central banks to maintain their cautious monetary policy stance.
“In view of these developments and potential risks, the committee assessed that the real policy rate
should continue to be adequately positive to stabilise inflation in the target range of 5-7pc. The MPC
emphasised on the need to continue the ongoing prudent monetary and fiscal policy mix to sustain
macroeconomic stability. Moreover, the committee reiterated its view that without structural reforms, it
would be difficult to achieve higher growth on a sustainable basis,” the press release said.
Awais Ashraf, director research at AKD Securities, said that stability in the currency market along with clarity on the inflation front would allow the SBP to cut interest rates into the single digit.
The Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) had claimed that both interest and exchange rates were being kept artificially high without economic justification, and appealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to ensure a correction to support growth and stability.
The PBF also criticised the current interest rate of 11pc, calling it unjustifiable given that the Consumer Price Index-based inflation had dropped to 4pc. It urged the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) to reduce the policy rate to at least 9pc in its upcoming monetary policy announcement scheduled for July 30.</p><small>2025-07-30 12:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/301057143983884.png?r=170403' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927575/coas-munir-reaffirms-resolve-to-eradicate-terrorism-warns-of-decisive-response-to-all-threats' target='_blank'><strong>COAS Munir reaffirms resolve to eradicate terrorism, warns of decisive response to all threats</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Wednesday reaffirmed the military’s resolve to eradicate the menace of terrorism from the country,  underscoring the nation’s preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats, a statement from the military’s media wing said.
Pakistan has lately seen a surge in terrorism across the country, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.
In recent months, the security situation in Balochistan has also worsened, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
According to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army chief was speaking to a group of stakeholders at the 16th National Workshop in Balochistan.
“[The] COAS resolutely reaffirmed Pakistan Army’s unwavering commitment to uproot the menace of terrorism and [the] inevitability of socio-economic uplift of Balochistan for national cohesion and integration,” the statement said.
Field Marshal Munir also shed light on Pakistan’s recent military escalation with India, condemning New Delhi’s “blatant sponsorship of terror proxies, characterising them as a failed attempt to target the deep-rooted patriotism of the people of Balochistan.”
The two countries entered a brief but intense military escalation after India, without evidence, blamed Pakistan for the April 22 Pahalgam attack. On May 6–7, New Delhi launched air strikes that killed civilians, followed by a week-long missile exchange. A US-brokered ceasefire ended the war.
He elucidated that India, having suffered defeat in Marka-i-Haq — the period of conflict from April 22 to May 10 — had “now escalated its proxy war to advance her nefarious designs.”
He said New Delhi was using Fitna-al-Khawarij and Fitna-al-Hindustan — terms the state uses to refer to the TTP and terrorist groups in Balochistan, respectively — as “pawns of Indian hybrid war against Pakistan.”
“The COAS said that these proxies will face a similar fate and humiliation as faced in Marka-i-Haq,” the statement said.
During his talk, the army chief also emphasised that terrorists knew no bounds of religion, sect, or ethnicity, necessitating a unified national response, stressing the imperative of collective resolve in confronting this menace.
He highlighted the “pivotal role of development initiatives in Balochistan, advocating for enhanced inter-agency cooperation and a cohesive national approach to propel provincial progress and national advancement.”
While reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace, the COAS underscored the nation’s preparedness to respond decisively to any external or internal threats, protecting national prestige and ensuring the well-being of its citizens, the statement concluded.</p><small>2025-07-30 12:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/30104059651bceb.jpg?r=104141' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927570/tsunami-waves-reach-hawaii-japan-after-huge-88-magnitude-quake-rattles-russias-far-east' target='_blank'><strong>Tsunami waves reach Hawaii, Japan after huge 8.8-magnitude quake rattles Russia’s Far East</strong></a><br><p>A magnitude 8.8 earthquake struck off Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula on Wednesday, the strongest in the region since 1952, damaging buildings and generating a tsunami of up to 4 metres that prompted warnings and evacuations in Hawaii, Japan and across the Pacific Ocean.
Several people were injured in the remote Russian region, while much of Japan’s eastern seaboard — devastated by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in 2011 — was ordered to evacuate as Tsunami waves hit the Pacific coast of the country.
Meanwhile, Hawaii recorded tsunami waves measuring up to 5ft, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre. However, no waves of consequence have hit Hawaii yet.

What we know so far:

8.8-magnitude quake hit Russia’s Kamchatka peninsula at 8:24am local time (4am PKT)
Several people injured, no casualties reported
Tsunami warnings issued in Japan, Mexico, Hawaii, Ecuador, China, Chile, Costa Rica
Tsunami waves up to 1.7m hit Japan, Hawaii, California; 3-4m recorded in parts of Kamchatka
Russian mayor says ‘everyone’ on tsunami-hit islands evacuated
French Pacific Marquesas islands warned of 4m tsunami waves


The magnitude 8.8 quake struck at 8:24 am (4am PKT) off Petropavlovsk on Russia’s remote Kamchatka peninsula and was one of the 10 biggest recorded, according to the US Geological Survey.
The USGS said the earthquake was shallow at a depth of 19.3km, and was centred 119 km east-southeast of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, a city of 165,000.
 


The epicentre of the earthquake is roughly the same as the massive 9.0 temblor in 1952, which resulted in a destructive, Pacific-wide tsunami, according to the USGS.
“Today’s earthquake was serious and the strongest in decades of tremors,” Kamchatka Governor Vladimir Solodov said in a video posted on the Telegram messaging app.
A tsunami with a height of 3-4m was recorded in parts of Kamchatka, said Sergei Lebedev, regional minister for emergency situations, urging people to move away from the shoreline.

Russian authorities said a tsunami hit and flooded the port town of Severo-Kurilsk, while local media said one wave of between three and four metres high was recorded in the Elizovsky district of Kamchatka.
“The strongest earthquake since 1952 has just occurred in the Kamchatka seismic zone … Given the scale of the event, strong aftershocks with a magnitude of up to 7.5 should be expected,” Kamchatka’s geophysical service said on Telegram.
Thirty additional tremors were recorded following the main earthquake off the Kamchatka Peninsula, a regional branch of the Geophysical Service of the Russian Academy of Sciences said.
In December 2004, a 9.1 magnitude earthquake struck off the Indonesian island of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that killed around 220,000 people in 11 nations.
Several people sought medical assistance following the quake, Oleg Melnikov, regional health minister, told Russia’s TASS state news agency.
“Unfortunately, there are some people injured during the seismic event. Some were hurt while running outside, and one patient jumped out of a window. A woman was also injured inside the new airport terminal,” Melnikov said.
“All patients are currently in satisfactory condition, and no serious injuries have been reported so far.”
While a kindergarten was also damaged, most buildings withstood the quake, and no fatalities had been reported, the ministry added.
Russia’s Ministry for Emergency Services said on Telegram that the port in the Sakhalin town of Severo-Kurilsk and a fish processing plant there were partially flooded by a tsunami. The population has been evacuated.
“Everyone was evacuated. There was enough time, a whole hour. So everyone was evacuated, all the people are in the tsunami safety zone,” Mayor Kuril Islands district Alexander Ovsyannikov said at a crisis meeting with officials.
Authorities in Russia’s far eastern Sakhalin region declared a state of emergency in the northern Kuril Islands.
“A state of emergency has been declared in the North Kuril District, where an earthquake and tsunami occurred today,” the Sakhalin government said in a statement.
Meanwhile, the Kamchatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team recorded that the Klyuchevskoy volcano —  a highly active volcano in the region — ejected ash to a height of up to 3km above sea level as a result of the quake, Al Jazeera reported.
“The volcano is continuing to erupt explosively at the summit. Ash emissions at altitudes up to 8km above sea level may occur at any time,” said KVERT in a statement.
KVERT has assigned an orange colour code for aviation hazards to the volcano, which indicates an increased likelihood of eruption.
Japan records tsunami waves
The whole Pacific coast of Japan has reported tsunami waves, Al Jazeera reported, citing Japanese broadcaster NHK World.
Waves as high as 60cm were recorded along some parts of the coast, including Kuji Port and Hamanaka town, according to NHK.
The size of the waves has grown steadily from 20cm earlier this morning, and authorities say they could reach as high as 3m.
Tsunami warning advisories will be in place across Japan for at least the next 24 hours, the Japanese broadcaster said.
According to Japan’s Meteorological Agency, the country’s Pacific coast has already been hit by four to five rounds of tsunami waves, and has warned that there are no signs of the Tsunami waves receding, Al Jazeera reported.
There is also a chance of powerful and unexpected surges, it added.
Earlier, Japan’s weather agency issued a warning, saying it expected tsunami waves of up to 3m to reach large coastal areas starting around 1am GMT (6am PKT).
Tsunami alarms sounded in coastal towns across Japan’s Pacific coast with authorities urging people to seek higher ground.
Footage on public broadcaster NHK showed scores of people in the northern island of Hokkaido on the roof of a building, sheltering under tents from the beating sun, as fishing boats left harbours to avoid potential damage from the incoming waves.
“We came here hoping to swim, but once we heard a tsunami warning had been issued, we didn’t go in at all, not even close to the water,” local Tomoyo Fujita, 35, told AFP as she left the area with her young daughter.
Television footage showed several whales washed up on a beach.
Workers evacuated the stricken Fukushima nuclear plant, where a meltdown following the 2011 tsunami caused a radioactive disaster, operator TEPCO said.
There were no injuries or damage reported so far, and no irregularities at any nuclear plants, Japan’s Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said.
Tsunami waves hit Hawaii, California; warnings issued across the Pacific
The Pacific Tsunami warning centre recorded waves measuring up to 1.7m in Maui, Hawaii, while another high wave of 1.5m was recorded in Hailo, the BBC reported.
Tsunami waves were “now impacting Hawaii”, the Centre said in an update.
The US National Weather Service confirmed the reports, according to Al Jazeera.
Hawaii Governor Josh Green said so far, no waves of consequence have hit the islands, but all flights in and out of Maui were cancelled, Reuters reported.
In light of the tsunami situation, the Department of Transportation in Hawaii announced, in a social media post, the cancellation of all flights to and from Kahului Airport, the main airport in Maui, Al Jazeera reported.
 






Earlier, the US Tsunami Warning Centres issued a Tsunami Warning — its highest level alert — for the entire US state of Hawaii, with the first waves expected at 7:17pm local time (10:17pm PKT).
“People are also advised to stay away from the beach and not to go to the coast,” the seismology centre said in a warning.
Hawaii ordered evacuations from some coastal areas. “Take Action! Destructive tsunami waves expected,” the Honolulu Department of Emergency Management said on X.
 






The Hawaii warning urged residents of low-lying areas to either move to higher ground or to the fourth floor of a building.
“Due to a massive earthquake that occurred in the Pacific Ocean, a Tsunami Warning is in effect for those living in Hawaii,” US President Donald Trump said in a social media post.
“A Tsunami Watch is in effect for Alaska and the Pacific Coast of the United States. Japan is also in the way. Please visit tsunami.gov/ for the latest information. Stay strong and stay safe!”
Tsunami waves have also hit California on the West Coast, according to the National Weather Service. The weather body said the waves hit the coast at 1:12am local time (1:12pm PKT).
 






Earlier, Tsunami alerts were pushed to mobile phones in California, according to local AFP reporters.
The US Tsunami Warning System also warned of “hazardous tsunami waves” within the next three hours across the Pacific. According to the seismology centre, waves reaching more than 3m were possible along some coasts of Russia and Ecuador, while waves of 1-3m were possible in Japan, Hawaii, Costa Rica, French Polynesia, Guam, Chile and the Solomon Islands, it said. Smaller waves were possible along coastlines across much of the Pacific, including the US West Coast.
Waves of up to one metre were possible elsewhere, including Australia, Colombia, Mexico, New Zealand, Tonga and Taiwan.
It described the potential conditions as “hazardous.”
In Mexico, the Navy warned that strong currents are expected at port entrances from Baja California in the northwest to Chiapas in the south of Mexico, AFP reported.
The country has mobilised authorities at all levels of government to keep its population away from Pacific beaches.
Following suit, Peru also issued a statement warning of a possible tsunami.
“After an analysis and evaluation by the National Tsunami Warning Centre, it has been determined that this event generates a tsunami warning for the Peruvian coast,” the Directorate of Hydrography and Navigation of the Peruvian Navy said in a statement, adding that the situation “will be kept under constant surveillance.”
Ecuador officials ordered ‘preventive evacuations’ from Galapagos beaches and the suspension of all maritime activities, AFP reported.
Meanwhile, China’s tsunami warning centre said that waves of between 30 centimetres and one metre were expected to hit parts of the eastern seaboard.
“Based on the latest warning and analysis results, the Tsunami Advisory Centre of the Ministry of National Resources has determined that the earthquake has triggered a tsunami, which is expected to cause damage to certain coastal areas of China,” the advisory centre said.
‘Ring of fire’
Kamchatka and Russia’s Far East sit on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a geologically active region that is prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
The Russian Academy of Sciences said it was the strongest quake to hit the region since 1952.
“However, due to certain characteristics of the epicentre, the shaking intensity was not as high … as one might expect from such a magnitude,” said Danila Chebrov, director of the Kamchatka Branch of the Geophysical Service, on Telegram.
“Aftershocks are currently ongoing … Their intensity will remain fairly high. However, stronger tremors are not expected in the near future. The situation is under control.”
French Pacific Marquesas islands warned of 4-metre tsunami waves
Authorities in French Polynesia warned the population of several of the Marquesas Islands to expect tsunami waves up to four metres high in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
They said the waves would reach the islands of Ua Huka, Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa at 00:57am local time (3:27pm PKT).
Other islands in the Marquesas were expected to experience wave heights between 0.6m and 0.9m, the local government also said.
“Our armed forces in French Polynesia are on alert as a precautionary measure, to be ready to assist our fellow citizens and state services in potential search and rescue operations or medical evacuations,” French Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said on the social media platform X.
 






Residents were urged to move to higher ground and follow official instructions, including securing boats or moving them away from the shore.
The Marquesas Islands, among the most remote in the world, have a population of approximately 9,500, according to a 2022 census. The population is predominantly of Polynesian descent, alongside French and other immigrant communities. The largest settlements are Taiohae on Nuku Hiva and Atuona on Hiva Oa.
Other archipelagos in French Polynesia may be affected by waves less than 30 cm high, which do not require evacuation or sheltering, local authorities said.
French Polynesia covers 4,200 sq km of the Pacific Ocean. Its five archipelagos comprise 118 islands.</p><small>2025-07-30 12:01</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616495-sindh-to-award-best-decorated-vehicle-shop-or-building-on-august-14' target='_blank'><strong>Sindh to award best-decorated vehicle, shop or building on August 14</strong></a><br><p>

The incident comes over a week after the killing of a man and a woman in the Degari area of Quetta on the orders of a tribal jirga ahead of Eidul Azha for so-called ‘honour’. The police had subsequently arrested at least 14 suspects for their involvement in the incident.
Wali Khan Station House Officer Pir Muhammad Alizai said in a statement today that the deceased couple got married seven years ago.
“The couple was travelling from Panjgur to Lakpass in a pickup upon the invitation of the woman’s brothers,” the police said. “The suspects told them to wait at the Noshki Cross, arrived on two motorcycles at about 7am on Tuesday, shot the couple dead with a pistol, and fled.”
“Action to arrest the suspects is underway,” SHO Alizai said.
According to a first information report (FIR) of the incident, dated July 29, seen by Dawn.com, the deceased were travelling with their two children and brother. They stayed at a hotel near Lakpas at night.
A case was registered by the deceased husband’s brother at the Wali Khan Levies police station under Sections 34 (common intention), 302 (murder) and (assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).
Five people were nominated as suspects in the FIR.
“The reason for the murder is enmity and a love marriage,” it said.
Last week, a man allegedly shot dead his daughter and nephew in Quetta in the name of ‘honour’, just days after the Degari case, in which a couple was gunned down in broad daylight, drawing widespread condemnation, according to the police.
On July 26, a court in Rawalpindi remanded three suspects to police custody over an alleged murder and ‘honour’ killing case of a newlywed woman.
Police had initiated the investigation based on information that a woman had been murdered in the name of ‘honour’ in Pirwadhai, following a jirga in which members of both families participated.
As the woman’s family and in-laws became aware that the police were secretly investigating the incident, the deceased’s husband registered a case with the police under Section 496A. Police sources had said that the case was registered by the husband on the same day the woman was allegedly killed by suffocation with a pillow.
In Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.
Data from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.</p><small>2025-07-30 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616481-police-detain-11-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Police detain 11 following murder of couple in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>

Pakistan joined the United Nations shortly after gaining independence in 1947 and has played a prominent role in peacekeeping efforts, contributing to 48 missions in 29 countries since 1960.
Islamabad has repeatedly called for enhancements in UN peacekeeping, with Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad in April urging the integration of the use of advanced technologies to boost effectiveness.
Ambassador Ahmad, while addressing the 15-member UN Security Council on Tuesday, said: “Nowhere is this more urgently needed than in Jammu and Kashmir, a longstanding dispute on the UN Security Council’s agenda.
 






“This Council, which mandates the missions, must ensure that missions are deployed with an accompanying credible political process that addresses the root causes of conflicts, and that mission mandates are demand-driven, clear, sequenced, and context-specific.”
The Pakistan envoy was speaking at a debate titled ‘Adapting Peace Operations for the Pursuit of Political Solutions’.
“This council should fulfil its obligations and make concerted efforts to secure a just and lasting solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” he added.
In his remarks, Ambassador Iftikhar highlighted Pakistan’s experience of nearly eight decades of engagement with UN Peace operations, saying the country had remained among the top troop contributors, host to one of the UNs oldest missions United Nations Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan, which monitors the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Kashmir region.
“We are also a founding member of the Peacebuilding Commission,” he said, pointing out that over 235,000 Pakistani peacekeepers have served with distinction in missions across four continents.
“A total of 182 of our bravest have laid down their lives in the service of peace. We greatly value the importance of the UN peace operations”.
In May, the UN honoured 57 military, police, and civilian peacekeepers from 32 countries, including two from Pakistan, who died serving in missions last year, at a ceremony marking the annual ‘International Day of UN Peacekeepers’. Two of them were honoured posthumously.
“Overall, peace operations are a success story,” said Ahmad, who is the UNSC President for July.
“With an annual budget of $5.5 billion, UN peacekeeping worldwide constitutes less than 0.3 per cent of global military spending.”
He pointed out that multiple studies have confirmed that peacekeeping reduces violence, protects civilians and helps sustain peace arrangements.
“All reform efforts must therefore preserve operational credibility, institutional memory and readiness of peace operations,” he said. “Peacekeeping is not a silver bullet, but neither is it obsolete.”
 






The Pakistani envoy said the success of peace operations depends on a strong political undertaking by member states, particularly the Security Council.
“Where the UN and the council retreat or hesitate, political vacuums emerge,” he said, noting that this vacuum is being increasingly filled by negative actors and soldiers of fortune, thus proliferating the threats to international peace and security.
“That space must be reclaimed through credible political processes, anchored by the Council’s authority and implemented through empowered UN missions.”
He urged that peacekeeping missions should put greater emphasis on promoting local peace arrangements at the community level wherever possible to reduce violence and build trust.
In April this year, while speaking at a UN peacekeeping meeting, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar proposed a comprehensive reform of UN peacekeeping operations, urging the international community to adapt peacekeeping structures and strategies to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing global security landscape.
Also in April, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi reiterated Pakistan’s longstanding support for UN peace operations while speaking to UN Under-Secretary General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix, who called on him at the interior ministry.</p><small>2025-07-30 09:55</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/07/3013003358b7160.jpg?r=130108' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1927588/uk-rejects-criticism-that-move-to-recognise-palestinian-state-rewards-hamas' target='_blank'><strong>UK rejects criticism that move to recognise Palestinian state rewards Hamas</strong></a><br><p>Britain on Wednesday rejected criticism that it was rewarding fighter group Hamas by setting out plans to recognise a Palestinian state unless Israel took steps to improve the situation in Gaza and bring about peace.
The sight of emaciated Gaza children has shocked the world in recent days, and on Tuesday, a hunger monitor warned that a worst-case scenario of famine was unfolding there and immediate action was needed to avoid widespread death.
Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s ultimatum, setting a September deadline for Israel, prompted an immediate rebuke from his counterpart in Jerusalem, who said it rewarded Hamas and punished the victims of their 2023 cross-border attack.
US President Donald Trump said he did not think Hamas “should be rewarded” with recognition of Palestinian independence.
Asked about that criticism, British Transport Minister Heidi Alexander — designated by the government to respond to questions in a series of media interviews on Wednesday — said it was not the right way to characterise Britain’s plan.
“This is not a reward for Hamas. Hamas is a vile terrorist organisation that has committed appalling atrocities. This is about the Palestinian people. It’s about those children that we see in Gaza who are starving to death,” she told LBC radio.
“We’ve got to ratchet up pressure on the Israeli government to lift the restrictions to get aid back into Gaza.”
France announced last week it would recognise Palestinian statehood in September.
Successive British governments have said they would recognise a Palestinian state when it was most effective to do so.
In a televised address on Tuesday, Starmer said that moment had now come, highlighting the suffering in Gaza and saying the prospect of a two-state solution — a Palestinian state co-existing in peace alongside Israel — was under threat.
Starmer said Britain would make the move at the UN General Assembly in September unless Israel took substantive steps to allow more aid to enter Gaza, made clear there will be no annexation of the West Bank and committed to a long-term peace process that delivered a two-state solution.</p><small>2025-07-30 08:05</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/616454-indias-pralay-missile-tests-threaten-arms-race-pave-way-for-war' target='_blank'><strong>'India's Pralay missile tests threaten arms race, pave way for war'</strong></a><br><p>

• Mysterious woman accused of ‘trapping’ accused men surfaces in court
ISLAMABAD: A two-judge bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) has said any commission formed to investigate the alleged misuse of the blasphemy law could interfere in cases pending before other courts.
The judges on Tuesday explained the reasons for suspending a single bench’s order in the high-profile case.
The now-suspended judgement was issued by Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan after 42 hearings in the case whose proceedings were streamed live, in a divergence from the norm.
It directed the federal government to establish an inquiry commission within 30 days to investigate the allegations of entrapment, custodial deaths, flawed investigations and violations of fundamental rights.
The order, issued on July 15, said nearly 400 FIRs and around 700 individuals were implicated for allegedly committing blasphemy online.
 
 

The court also flagged irregularities in FIA’s investigations, including the reuse of Facebook IDs across multiple FIRs, same-day arrests and FIR registrations, private detentions and the use of unverified digital evidence.
Last week, an IHC bench comprising Justices Khadim Hussain Soomro and Mohammad Azam Khan heard appeals challenging the single-bench’s ruling.
After a preliminary hearing, the bench suspended for a month the order to form the commission.
During Tuesday’s hearing, the two-judge bench noted the nearly 400 blasphemy cases, at the heart of this issue, were registered nationwide.
The trials in most of these cases had already concluded, resulting in either convictions or acquittals. In some cases, appeals have been filed against those decisions that are currently pending before various high courts.
The order stated that forming an inquiry commission in such a context could interfere with pending, potentially rendering the legal process “ineffective”.
Interim or final order
The two-judge bench also clarified that Justice Khan’s order was final as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.
 
 

The question over the order’s status was raised during the last hearing when the petitioners’ lawyer claimed the case was initially decided but the written verdict stated it would remain pending.
The division bench further clarified that although intra-court appeals are typically not filed against interim orders, the single bench’s ruling was final in nature as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.
‘Mysterious’ woman
Also on Tuesday, a woman named Komal Ismail also appeared before the division bench along with her lawyer.
She is accused of honey-trapping the victims using a false social media identity by the name of “Imaan”.
In a hearing earlier this month, Justice Khan directed the FIA to block her national identity card after she repeatedly failed to appear before the court.
 
 

During Tuesday’s proceedings, Ms Ismail’s counsel argued her client was not a party in the main case, yet her CNIC was blocked and her name placed on the Exit Control List.
Justice Soomro responded that Ms Ismail had only been asked to appear before the investigating officer and questioned the harm in complying with that direction.
The bench emphasised that while the case involving Ms Ismail remained under investigation, the court would not interfere in the matter.
Later, the court linked Ms Ismail’s applications with the already pending intra-court appeals and adjourned the hearing.

•  Officials’ reluctance to share names of mill owners with lawmakers draws rebuke
•  Committee told Rs150m spent out of Rs1.95bn allocated for flood awareness campaign, rest of the money diverted
ISLAMABAD: Amid a hike in sugar price, the Public Accounts Committee was informed on Tuesday that the sugar mills have earned Rs300 billion due to recent fluctuations in the rates of the essential commodity.
The Auditor General of Pakistan made these revelations during the meeting of the apex parliamentary panel, which convened the high-stakes session to review the sugar import and export policy, rising prices, and the lack of transparency in the sugar industry.
The PAC met under the chairmanship of Junaid Akbar Khan and it was briefed by Industries and Production Secretary Saif Anjum, who stated that price regulation and relevant laws fell under provincial jurisdictions.
He revealed that from 2013 to 2023, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) permitted sugar exports amounting to 5.09 million metric tonnes, of which 3.927 million tonnes were actually exported. In 2023-24 alone, the country had a surplus of 1.3 million tonnes, and 790,000 tonnes were cleared for export, the secretary said, adding that the price remained “stable”.
However, the PAC members expressed serious concern, citing ground realities. Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan and other members, including Omar Ayub and Senator Fauzia Arshad, contradicted the government’s claims about the commodity.
Omar Ayub reported that sugar was selling for over Rs200 per kilogramme in many regions, while National Food Secu­rity Secr­etary Amir Mohy­uddin maintained the national average was Rs173. According to Senator Fauzia Arshad, sugar had become both scarce and unaffordable.
‘Cycle of mismanagement’
Mr Akbar, meanwhile, slammed the cycle of mismanagement, stating, “Every year we repeat the same drama: first export (sugar), then import it.”
The PTI lawmaker questioned the lack of transparency, asking, “Who owns these sugar mills?” The committee had requested a list of owners, but the industries secretary said only directors’ names were available.
 
 

The committee rejected this explanation, demanding complete records. It warned, “No further briefings will be accepted without disclosure of owners.”
The Sugar Advisory Board (SAB) also drew flak for failing to regulate the industry effectively. “This is daylight robbery,” said MNA Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood, citing massive profiteering and poor governance. “Rs287 billion have gone into a few pockets,” claimed MNA Riaz Fatyana, while others accused the president and prime minister of allegedly protecting the profiteers.
The Federal Board of Revenue officials told the panel that a list of mills’ directors had been obtained, but the lawmakers sought full ownership transparency, leading to heated exchanges among the members.
Malik Amir Dogar named President Asif Ali Zardari, Jahangir Tareen, and the ruling Sharif family as major sugar mill stakeholders, leading to fiery arguments with fellow lawmakers Shazia Marri, Afnanullah Khan, and Bilal Mandokhail.
PAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan noted that only 42 families profited from this massive windfall. “Why is no one else allowed to set up sugar mills?” he questioned, pointing to the concentration of ownership and lack of competition.
PAC member Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood highlighted that sugar was currently available in India at the equivalent of Rs143/kg, much cheaper than local prices.
The food secretary responded that the reduction in sales and other taxes was intended to make sugar more affordable. However, he warned that an import duty of Rs80 per kg would naturally make imported sugar more expensive.
The PAC chairman also questioned the rationale behind importing sugar despite claims from all provinces that ample stock was available. “If there was enough stock, why was the decision made to import it?” he asked.
 
 

Regarding sugar stocks, officials claimed 1.9 million tonnes were available, which will last till November. Nonetheless, PAC members voiced concern about potential spoilage and stressed the need for careful planning ahead of the next crushing season. The government had approved the import of 300,000 tons of sugar to stabilise the supply, while pledging it would not affect farmers or involve previous export destinations.
The PAC members reiterated that the issue would not be dropped until full transparency over sugar mill ownership and profit beneficiaries was achieved. Separately, the PAC scrutinised Rs1.95 billion supplementary grant allocated to the Press Information Department for a flood awareness campaign. Audit officials revealed that only Rs150 million was spent on the campaign, while the rest was diverted elsewhere. The matter was referred to a subcommittee for investigation.

Seventeen countries plus the European Union and Arab League threw their weight behind a seven-page text agreed at a United Nations conference on reviving the two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians.
“In the context of ending the war in Gaza, Hamas must end its rule in Gaza and hand over its weapons to the Palestinian Authority, with international enga­gement and support, in line with the objective of a sovereign and independent Pales­tinian State,” said the declaration.
It followed a call on Monday by the Palestinian delegation at the United Nations for both Israel and Hamas to leave Gaza, allowing the Palestinian Authority to administer the coastal territory. The text also condemned the Hamas raid against Israel of Oct 7, 2023.
France, which co-chaired the conference with Saudi Arabia, called the declaration “both historic and unprecedented.”
“For the first time, Arab countries and those in the Middle East condemn Hamas, condemn Oct 7, call for the disarmament of Hamas, call for its exclusion from Palestinian governance, and clearly express their intention to normalise relations with Israel in the future,” said French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot.

The people had to leave different villages in Taunsa, including Mauza Moor Jhangi, Bait Kachhela, Panj Darain, Bait Channar, Bait Ashraf, Jarh Leghari and Mouza Baloch Khan.
In Layyah, the people were evacuated from Mouza Lohaj, Thori, Samra Jhok Khan, Basti Kanjo Mohana, Darkhan Khokhar, Panwar, Alliyani Basti, and Rakhwan. A double-storey police check post built in Rakhwan was also submerged completely by floodwater and all its structure demolished. A high school in Basti Alliyani also submerged by water and cracks appeared in its building.
In Karor Lal Esan, Bait Mongar was also flooded and all its houses and mosque were also destroyed. The floodwater entered cultivated lands, making it a part of the river in Layyah and Karor Lal Esan.
In Dera Ghazi Khan, several villages were submerged by floodwater including Jhok Utra, Kot Chuta, Malkani Kalan.

DG Khan residents protest turning of river for new Layyah-Taunsa Bridge

The residents of the area protested against poor management of a bund built to turn the river to construct Layyah-Taunsa Bridge. They said that the river had changed its way and started flowing in another direction, engulfing thousands of agriculture land where different crops, including cotton, were destroyed by the medium level flood.
“A high level flood in the past would easily pass from Layyah but the poor design of the newly-constructed Layyah-Taunsa bridge changed the flow of the river and it started flooding old localities and villages. Thousands of acres of crops also come under water in both districts,” the locals said.
The crack emerged in the bank of the river to protect the Layyah-Taunsa Bridge also could not be filled after two days due to poor management of the authorities.
A resident of Layyah Khurrum Khar told Dawn that out of their 450 acres, only 175 acres was left dry and all their land had been swallowed up by the Sindh river.
He also said the government had changed the way of the river to construct the Layyah-Taunsa Bridge and it resulted in catastrophe for their land.
“We only can demand the government to fix the problem otherwise we would become landless and the river will also swallow our villages permanently,” the man decried.
Earlier, the Punjab Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued a flood alert for several regions as the province braces for rising water levels in major rivers and urban flooding due to more heavy monsoon rains.
According to the Pakistan Met Department (PMD), scattered to widespread thunderstorms with isolated heavy falls are expected over the upper catchments of the Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, and Ravi rivers, as well as in Islamabad, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, and Lahore divisions over the next 48 hours.
The Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) has reported that the Indus river is currently at medium flood level at Guddu, while low flood conditions persist at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma, Taunsa, and Sukkur.
Meanwhile, the Jhelum and Chenab rivers are experiencing low to medium-level flows and more flow is expected due to an incoming weather system from July 30 to 31. The FFD also warned of moderate flooding in the nullahs of the Ravi river and tributaries of the Kabul river, with increased flows expected in the Sutlej river at Ganda Singhwala after 24 hours. Urban flooding is likely in Islamabad, Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Lahore.
PDMA Punjab issued alerts to commissioners and deputy commissioners of multiple divisions, including Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Faisalabad, and Bahawalpur.
Relief Commissioner Punjab Nabeel Javed directed officials to remain vigilant and ensure all precautionary measures are in place.
PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia emphasized the need for advanced preparations, including the activation of emergency control rooms and disaster response teams.
He urged the public to cooperate with administration efforts, particularly in evacuation procedures for riverside settlements and livestock.
Reservoir levels remain under watch, with Tarbela Dam at 87.08% live storage and Mangla Dam at 57.36%. Historical data indicates the potential for significant peaks, though current forecasts suggest manageable conditions.
The Punjab government has assured citizens of comprehensive support, including food, clean water, and medical aid at relief camps.
