Almost six months since he last represented Pakistan, the flamboyant opener sparkled with a career-best 74 as hosts trounced a hapless Bangladesh by 57 runs in the second Twenty20 International at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday to seal the three-match series with a game to spare.
With Sahibzada in full flow — having returned to the national team fold after an impressive show in the Pakistan Super League — and Hasan Nawaz making a quickfire 51 not out, Pakistan amassed 201-6 after electing to bat.
The bowlers then came to the fore as Bangladesh lost their way after a bright start; spinner Abrar Ahmed being the destroyer-in-chief with 3-19 as Pakistan bundled them out for 144 with only Tanzim Hasan Sakib (50) offering some late resistance.
 


It was Pakistan’s first series victory since they beat Zimbabwe in December last year. Sahibzada’s poor return in that series had seen him fall out of national reckoning, but on his return, he set the tone for Pakistan.
Sahibzada, who replaced Fakhar Zaman in the playing eleven, had a nervy start, almost getting caught on the third ball he faced but on the next ball he faced, he slammed Mehidy Hasan Miraz for four through extra cover.
Fellow opener Saim Ayub, though, departed early; the left-hander losing his footing as he was sent back by Sahibzada while looking for a third run on the last ball of the second over that was completed by spinner Shamim Hossain after pacer Shoriful Islam got injured.
The dismissal didn’t stop Sahibzada though and Mehidy was slog-swept for consecutive sixes in the next over. Hasan Mahmud was then hit for back-to-back fours down the ground with the incoming Mohammad Haris coming to the party with a thumping six over midwicket on the fifth ball of the fourth over.
Sahibzada was proving unstoppable; a six over mid-wicket followed over Tanzim. Haris was also in the mood; hitting Hasan for three successive boundaries — thorugh fine leg, midwicket and cover — as Pakistan ended the powerplay at 67-1.
Lady luck was smiling on Pakistan too with Farhan seeing an edge fly past the keeper for four off Shamim. Sahibzada got to his maiden T20 International half-century off 29 deliveries in the ninth over before Haris ended a 13-ball boundary drought with a scoop for six off Shamim.
Sahibzada then got another life — Mehdiy dropping him — and celebrated it by depositing Rishad Hossain for back-to-back sixes; first down the ground and the next over square leg with Pakistan reaching the midway point of their innings at 107-1.
Haris scooped Tanzim for four on the first ball of the 11th over but was gone by the end of it, finding Rishad at backward point after making 41 off 27. Sahibzada soon followed, caught behind off Rishad having hit the previous ball for the sixth six of his 41-ball stay as Pakistan slipped from 115-1 to 121-3.
Skipper Salman Ali Agha, though, kept the momentum going, dispatching the first two balls he faced for fours. Hasan also didn’t take long to get going; a six over extra cover off Mehidy followed by a four and six off Rishad.
Salman got his third boundary off Hasan but was gone next ball after a 12-ball 19 as he was trapped lbw trying to sweep, offering Bangladesh a chance to rein in Pakistan.
Mehidy then gave away just six runs in the 17th over and Tanzim seemed primed to do the same in the next until Hasan slashed him away for four off the last ball. Big hits were getting scarcer and Shadab Khan fell attempting one off Hasan Mahmud (2-47) on the last ball of the 19th.
But Hasan freed his arms in the last over, pulling Tanzim (2-36) for six and then raising his half-century of just 25 balls before Faheem Ashraf fell on the final ball of the innings.
Tanzid Hasan (33) got Bangladesh’s chase off to a flier, hitting back-to-back fours off spinner Salman and a six over extra cover; the first over yielding 17. Two more boundaries came off the next over by Hasan Ali.
Pervaiz Hossain Emon at the other end was having the best view of Tanzid’s charge as Faheem Ashraf was slashed for four to begin the third over. But Pervaiz perished in an attempt to emulate his partner, getting caught at long-on as he tried to go big off Haris Rauf and Tanzid was sent back by Faheem soon after, snapped by Abrar at short-fine leg.
Bangladesh were coming off the rails and Hasan sent back Litton Das — Haris diving at mid-on to take a sharp catch, before Abrar (3-19) had Towhid Hridoy and Jaker Ali lbw  off consecutive balls in the seventh over; the visitors losing five wickets in the space of 18 deliveries.
Shamim denied Abrar a hat-trick by cutting him away for four but he fell in the spinner’s next over, pouched in the deep by Saim. Leg-spinner Shadab then had Rishad caught behind as Pakistan continued to chip away.
Mehidy, who had come in at number five, kept Pakistan at bay and Tanzim smashed consecutive sixes off Haris to help his side cross the 100-run mark. But the writing was on the wall for them when Khushdil sent back Mehidy (23).
Tanzim, though, kept delaying the inevitable — depositing Khushdil for consecutive sixes. He then hit Saim for his fifth maximum on the first ball of the 19th over, completing his century three balls later before getting caught behind to bring down the curtains for his side.

Pakistan faces a potential 29 per cent tariff on its exports to the US due to a $3 billion trade surplus with the world’s biggest economy, under tariffs announced by Washington last month on countries around the world.
Pakistan’s formal negotiations with the United States on reciprocal tariffs started earlier in the day with a phone call between Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, a press release from the finance ministry said.
“Pakistan representatives are coming in next week,” Trump told reporters at Joint Base Andrews after departing Air Force One.
“And India, as you know, we’re very close to making a deal with India. And I wouldn’t have any interest in making a deal with either (Pakistan and India) if they were going to be at war with each other. I went that and I let them know,” the US president stressed.
The developments follow a recent military confrontation between Pakistan and India over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad responded by downing five Indian jets. After intercepting drones sent by India on May 8 and tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
 
 

Indian Trade Minister Piyush Goyal visited Washington recently to advance trade talks, with both sides aiming to sign an interim agreement by early July.
India faces 26pc tariffs on shipments to the US.
Reuters reported last week that India is likely to allow US firms to bid for contracts worth over $50 billion, mainly from federal entities, as it negotiates a trade deal with Washington.
The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products, amongst a global tariff announcement by US President Donald Trump, which were paused, could have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s important exports and serve as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics warned that these tariffs could have a “devastating impact” on the country’s export sector, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion.
Trump’s tariffs, implemented on April 2, introduced a 10 per cent baseline tariff for every country the US trades with, and additional reciprocal tariffs on rivals and allies alike.
Trump again claims role in Pakistan-India ceasefire
President Donald Trump also reaffirmed his claim of having brokered the May 2025 Pakistan-India ceasefire — a statement that continues to irk New Delhi but is quietly welcomed in Islamabad.
Speaking at a White House press conference on Friday, President Trump said his intervention “stopped India and Pakistan from fighting”, adding that the conflict could have “turned out into a nuclear disaster”.
“We talk trade and we said we can’t trade with people that are shooting at each other and potentially using nuclear weapons,” he said. “They’re great leaders in those countries. And they understood and they agreed and that all stopped.”
This marks the fifth time President Trump has publicly cited his role in halting the conflict. He underscored America’s power to both wage and prevent wars, stating, “Ultimately, we can fight better than anybody,” but added, “we’re stopping others from fighting also.”
He also expressed gratitude to the leaders of both South Asian nations, as well as his own diplomatic team. “I want to thank the leaders of India, the leaders of Pakistan, and I want to thank my people also,” he said.
 


A Pakistani delegation, led by PPP chairman and former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, will arrive in New York on Sunday. It is expected to meet UN Secretary-General António Guterres, the current president of the UN General Assembly, and ambassadors of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council. The delegation will also address a joint session of OIC envoys during its two-day stay in New York.
The group will travel to Washington on June 3, where it hopes to meet Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other senior US officials. The visit also includes meetings with congressional lawmakers, policy experts from major think tanks, and US media representatives.
While Pakistani officials have been cautious in public, they privately acknowledge that President Trump played a significant role in defusing the recent conflict. In contrast, India has repeatedly rejected the notion of outside involvement, claiming that the ceasefire was initiated by Pakistan and achieved without US mediation.
Curiously, Islamabad denies making such a request and instead credits President Trump — creating an unusual diplomatic convergence between Pakistani officials and the current US president.
Trump’s latest comments are seen in Islamabad as a timely morale booster for the visiting delegation. Pakistani diplomats say they not only endorse his claim but would welcome a broader US role in South Asia, particularly in resolving the Kashmir dispute. Trump had earlier underscored the need to resolve this issue, calling it a “festering wound” that must be addressed to ensure lasting peace in the region.
President Trump’s remarks were part of a broader narrative positioning his second term as one focused on restoring global stability. “When I left, we had no wars, we had no problems. We defeated ISIS, we rebuilt our military, and we had no inflation,” he said. “And when I came back, we had a lot of inflation. We had wars all over the place.”
Listing current global crises — including the war in Ukraine, the Israeli invasion of Gaza, and tensions in the Indo-Pacific — President Trump cited South Asia as another region where US leadership has made a difference. “And now we have something where we’re really healing a lot of that,” he said, casting himself as a stabilising force in a turbulent world.
His assertion of having averted a “nuclear disaster” is likely to prompt strong reactions in diplomatic circles, particularly in New Delhi, which has consistently rejected third-party involvement in its disputes with Pakistan.
Yet, the timing of his remarks is significant. The Pakistani delegation’s visit to Washington aims to focus on trade, regional security, and reshaping US-Pakistan ties amid shifting global alliances and domestic political transitions. President Trump’s comments may complicate the diplomatic tone — or, for Islamabad, provide an opening to highlight its international relevance and US engagement.
Analysts say even if the president’s role in the ceasefire is exaggerated, the fact that hostilities ceased suggests that diplomatic pressure — including from Washington — was a factor. Given President Trump’s preference for direct engagement and bold claims, his involvement cannot be ruled out.
For Pakistan, the ceasefire remains a rare instance where a US president publicly acknowledged playing a role in reducing South Asian tensions — something successive governments in Islamabad have long sought.
As one Pakistani official noted privately: “It doesn’t matter who claims the credit, as long as the firing stops.”
Meanwhile, Christine Fair, a US scholar once seen as aligned with pro-Indian perspectives, challenged New Delhi’s narrative of success in the recent Pakistan-India conflict.
“Indians who fail to see the victories that Pakistan snatched from the latest skirmish will fail to understand just why India has not and will not deter Pakistan,” she wrote in a post on X.</p><small>2025-05-31 06:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/310919401122524.jpg?r=092554' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914423/nowhere-in-world-courts-martial-try-terrorism-cases-justice-mandokhail' target='_blank'><strong>Nowhere in world, courts martial try terrorism cases: Justice Mandokhail</strong></a><br><p>• Justice Mandokhail issues 36-page dissenting note against majority decision to uphold civilians’ military trial
• Regrets govt opted to burden military courts instead of improving judicial system
ISLAMABAD: Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail of the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench on Friday issued a 36-page dissenting note challenging the majority verdict that upheld the trial of civilians in military courts and raising questions about the use of military courts for civilian cases.
“Nowhere in the world, courts martial try terrorism-related cases,” said Justice Mandokhail, a member of the seven-judge constitutional bench, in the dissenting note.
Justice Mandokhail and Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, in a minority judgement on May 7, set aside intra-court appeals against the Oct 23, 2023, five-judge judgement that had declared the military trials of civilians illegal.
While brushing aside the perception that civil courts had failed to tackle the menace of terrorism and courts martial were the only solution to the problem, Justice Mandokhail explained that courts martial did not have jurisdiction to deal with cases of terrorism or other criminal matters.
 
 

He regretted criticism of criminal courts was unfounded and was not supported by any reliable data. It was true that the conviction rate by the ordinary criminal courts was low, but it did not mean that the courts did not have the will to do proper justice, he added.
Justice Mandokhail also expressed regrets that the elected governments instead of addressing the politically motivated and frivolous cases, improving the system of investigation, establishing a mechanism of collecting truthful witnesses and protecting them, providing workable atmosphere, protection to the judges and improving the judicial system, expressed no confidence in criminal courts by opting to burden the courts martial with such a huge responsibility.
According to him, Pakistan Army Act relates to members of the armed forces to ensure proper discharge of their duties and maintenance of discipline, as provided by Article 8(3a) of the Constitution and, therefore, does not offer fundamental rights to persons under military discipline.
On the right to appeal against decisions of the court martial, Justice Mandokhail observed there was always a possibility of mistakes or errors in court rulings. He noted that an appeal to a higher, independent and impartial forum was a universally recognised tool to scrutinise the decision of fora below so as to eliminate the slightest instance of miscarriage of justice.
Appeal being a continuation of trial was, therefore, an important substantial ingredient of the fundamental principles of fair trial and due process, without which, the fundamental rights of individuals would be compromised.
Justice Mandokhail said the military officers presiding over the courts martial may be good at disposing military-related matters, but had no judicial expertise and experience to deal with criminal cases. Courts martial cannot be considered on a par with the judicial officers who are not only law graduates but also with the only function to deliver justice and having vast judicial experience at their credit, he emphasised.
 
 

The judicial officers were independent, impartial and without the influence, command and control of the executive, he noted.
He regretted that the federal and provincial governments, instead of attending to the causes of terrorism and taking preventive measures, were trying to achieve their goal through courts martial, which was “not a correct approach”.
Justice Mandokhail was of the opinion that expecting ordinary criminal courts to convict persons without evidence and material, connecting them with the offence, would amount to violating the principle of natural justice, fair trial and due process.
He noted that the Pakistan Army Act was a disciplinary statute related to members of the armed forces as provided by Article 8(3a) of the Constitution and therefore, did not offer fundamental rights to persons under military discipline.
However, on the effect of taking away fundamental rights in civilians’ trial, Justice Mandokhail observed that these rights were inalienable, unless expressly taken away by the Constitution. Taking away, abridging or denying the fundamental rights, had serious consequences, he observed, as it could undermine the fundamental principle of democracy, compromise the well-being of a citizen, and amount to giving a licence to the executive to abuse, torture, illegally detain and treat the citizens inhumanely.
Besides, the denial of fundamental rights would have a negative impact upon the economic treaties and domestic and foreign investments, Justice Mandokhail observed, adding that violating or denying the fundamental rights could weaken the rule of law.
 
 

Article 245 prescribed the functions of the armed forces, limited to defending the state from external aggression and internal threat, while Article 175(3) mandated that the judiciary shall be separated from the executive, he wrote.
As the function of the armed forces did not include the prosecution of general criminal offences committed by civilians, exercising powers beyond the defined scope was without jurisdiction, he noted.
According to him, indulging courts martial in adjudication of criminal cases of a general nature in respect of the general public would subject them to strong criticism in either case of conviction or acquittal, which will result in loss of trust and confidence in the army, whose function is only to defend and protect the country.

Both associations have launched a high-profile lobbying campaign, writing to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and initiating a nationwide media blitz, demanding the immediate abolition of the Export Facilitation Scheme (EFS) or the removal of sales tax on domestically produced cotton and its byproducts.
The premier subsequently sou­­ght policy recommendations from the Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR).
In response, the ministry has formally endorsed the industry’s proposals.
 
 

In a letter to PCGA President Dr Jassu Mal, Cotton Commis­sioner Dr Khadim Hussain stated that the government has recommended that the 18pc sales tax on domestic cotton, cottonseed, oilcake, and cottonseed oil be lifted immediately, or that imports of cotton, yarn, and grey cloth be taxed at the same rate.
The ministry’s recommendations, forwarded to safeguard farmers’ incomes, revive local production, and stem Pakistan’s soaring dependence on costly cotton imports, it says.
The communiqué notes that Punjab has implemented targeted subsidies for farmers to increase their incomes and reduce production costs for various crops.
Industry data reveals that textile mills have imported over 300 million kgs of cotton yarn and two million bales of cotton during the first nine months of 2024-25, draining billions of dollars in foreign exchange.
Despite this, domestic production has fallen to a historic low of just 5.5m bales. Meanwhile, more than 200,000 bales of unsold cotton and vast stocks of yarn remain idle in factories, with demand at a standstill.
 
 

Cotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq says the fallout has been devastating as over 800 ginning units and 120 spinning mills have ceased to function, while hundreds more textile units are barely functioning.
“If the current policy persists, the sector risks total collapse,” he warns, adding that Pakistan may soon be forced to import not only cotton but also edible oil, compounding the country’s financial woes.
The MNFSR’s recommendations underscore the urgency, recommending immediate tax relief for domestic producers or the imposition of equal taxes on imports to restore a level playing field. All eyes are now on the federal government, as the fate of Pakistan’s cotton and textile industry hangs in the balance.

While day temperatures could reach the blistering highs of the plains, nights in Quetta were far cooler than what the lowlands of the Indian Subcontinent offered. Given the lakes, mountains, and serenity of the area, Quetta’s population swelled in the summer months, adding thousands more people compared to those who generally resided in the city.
Over time, Quetta had been established as one of a string of garrison towns along the future Durand Line dividing Afghan territories with the plains and other towns including Razmak, Peshawar, Dir, and Chitral.
After the death of Ranjit Singh in 1839, which had kept Punjab and Ranjit’s Sikh army as a buffer between the Afghans and the British, the colonists aimed to find a new layer of protection. This was also after the events of the first Anglo-Afghan War in 1839, where, after the British captured Kandahar and Ghazni, they later installed Shah Shuja in Kabul.
Shah Shuja’s tyranny and the Afghans’ displeasure at having foreign invaders and a puppet ruler being installed, rebelled incessantly and by 1843, any British they could find in their territories was slaughtered.

Soon, the Balochistan Agency was established in 1877 following the “Sandemanisation” of Balochistan, in which tribal chiefs were given patronage by the British. At the same time, Russian influence was growing in Afghanistan and in 1878, the British launched the second Anglo-Afghan War and once again occupied Kabul. The second success of the British was even more short-lived, however, since in September 1879, the British envoy was killed in Kabul, and an even larger number of British forces had to be sent to the city. By 1880, Abdur Rehman Khan became Emir of Afghanistan, and the Durand Line was drawn in 1893. The last British troops had left Afghanistan by April 1881.
An Afghanistan that the British could not quite control placed Quetta and the line of garrison towns that dotted the Durand Line at increased importance as the years went by. Quetta would later become the home of the Royal Air Force’s No. 31 Squadron, becoming one of the first military units to fly in British India. During the Third Anglo-Afghan War (May-August 1919), No. 31 Squadron RAF conducted raids in Jalalabad and, for the next decade, would be involved in military operations suppressing any insurgencies in the region.
It was through this military lens that the British primarily saw Quetta.
When the earth trembled
When the earthquake on May 31 struck a few minutes after 3am, [how do we know this so precisely? Pictures and text from government accounts of the earthquake show that the clock at the Central Post Office was stuck at 3:03am] the city of Quetta had been flattened in a mere 45 seconds. Quetta Cantonment in the north-east of the city suffered far less.

Even in the design of the city — much like the city today — the Cantonment featured wide streets. The main municipality of Quetta, however, was not only its most populous area, but also had narrow streets and houses made with mud or bricks with poor mortar. When the earthquake struck, not only could people not leave their homes since it was so early in the morning, but the narrowness of the streets meant that even if one were to miraculously dig themselves out of the rubble, navigating outside of it was impossible.
At around 3:30am, Lieutenant General Sir Henry Karslake, witnessing the city from the Cantonment, could see multiple large fires that had erupted across the landscape.
Writing 18 months after the disaster in the ‘Report on The Quetta Earthquake of 31st May 1935’, Captain LAG Pinney, who was serving as the additional political agent, Quetta, listed eight “major problems” at dawn when first light appeared.
Some of the major problems, which rose at daybreak on the morning of May 31, can be summarised as follows:


The subordinate civil officials and the Quetta Police Force had been practically wiped out and were not available for any of their usual functions


The most pressing need of all was the rescue of those in the city who were buried under the débris and were still alive


Communication with the outside world had to be established
- All the houses of the civilian population had been destroyed, and as food supplies were cut off, immediate shelter, food and medical attention had to be provided.


The water supply had to be assured


The ingress of people into Quetta had to be stopped, as the rations at the disposal of the Military were limited in quantity


Arrangements had to be made to evacuate all survivors, particularly those who were injured, and to provide them with food and clothing for their journey


The prevention of looting by irresponsible people in the city or by tribesmen


For the first point, the Pinney Report states that Karslake, as General Officer Commanding (GOC), gave control of his command to the Agent to the Governor General (and Chief Commissioner of Balochistan) Sir Norman Carter.
Carter and Karslake then decided that since the civilian administration and the police force had been completely decimated by the earthquake, martial law had to be imposed on Quetta immediately. Karslake then began rescue efforts, carving the city into units to expedite recovery efforts, while also imposing complete martial law over the city.
As news of the earthquake reached other cities in the morning, several people asked to help in relief efforts. Miraculously, the railway link between Quetta and the rest of British India was still operational, which not only meant that survivors could quickly be taken out of the city, but aid workers could come in to rescue those who were trapped in the rubble.

As the list in the Pinney Report shows, while rescuing survivors was one priority that emerged, Karslake and Pinney also decided to have a cordon of British troops patrolling the perimeter and streets of Quetta. Pinney wrote, “Those troops who were not required for rescue work were put on duty round the city and on patrol work in the city to prevent any untoward events, and to deal with the various outbreaks of fire which occurred.”
The controversies
Official British accounts mention repeatedly that a cordon was thrown around the city because of a fear of looting from Pashtun and Brahui tribesmen. While Quetta today is predominantly a Pashtun city, Quetta in 1935 was home to a large Punjabi population, which had settled there following the Sandeman Plan. As The Times of India reported on June 17, 1935, the largest number of refugees out of Quetta were coming back to their hometowns in Dera Ghazi Khan, Lahore, Amritsar, Gujranwala, Multan, Rawalpindi and Ludhiana.
Workers and entrepreneurs had gone to Quetta not only for its climate, but also for work, the remittances of which they would send back to their hometowns. The Government of Punjab had to send in police and medical staff to aid in evacuation efforts and tend to refugee camps, the largest of which were at Quetta’s Racecourse and Polo Ground.

Meanwhile, rumours were also rife, in which it seems that word had gotten out that the city would be “sealed” or that it would be completely levelled with dynamite. According to The New York Times, Indian leaders protested against any measures by the British to completely destroy the city, and referred to survivors from the Bihar Earthquake of 1934 being found even after a week of the earthquake.
However, while this was later touted to be a confusion or a rumour, a cable to The New York Times on June 3, 1935, four days after the earthquake, came with the headline, “Quake-Ruined City Will be Abandoned” where a communique by the British government in Delhi not only wrote that the city has been sealed under military guard on medical advice, but also, “it is estimated that 20,000 corpses remain beneath the debris. There is no hope of rescuing more of the living”.
As we also see in the June 3 news report, the British Raj had quoted 20,000 people dead with 10,000 survivors — later government reports would show that 30,000 people died. The same New York Times article mentions that those survivors reaching Karachi claimed that the number of dead was much higher. On June 5, the number of dead had reached 56,000 according to an Associated Press wire. However, officially still on June 17, the Under-Secretary of the India Office, Richard Butler (later Deputy Prime Minister of the UK), placed the death toll at 40,000.

However, the greatest controversy that emerged from the time was still the matter of not allowing anyone else to enter the city. Karslake and Carter argued that there were not enough provisions, that outsiders would start looting, and that ultimately that an epidemic could arise from the sheer amount of dead bodies that were rotting inside the rubble and outside on the streets.
Efforts were underway to properly bury the bodies, and a pamphlet issued by the Raj in August 1935 titled “The Quetta Earthquake 1935” noted how, on the first day, 18,000 pounds of firewood was supplied for cremating the Hindus that had died.
The same report from August 1935 attempted to respond criticism that volunteers were not allowed to enter the city, in which while it accepted that the first 48 hours are the most critical in rescue work, it stated that “the first application from any political organisation for permission to carry on relief work was made several days after the earthquake”. Why was permission needed? The British had imposed martial law in the area and would not allow any outsiders to come in unless approved prior. The report does not mention which political organisation made the request, though newspaper articles mention that Mahatma Gandhi, with his Congress Party, had been stopped from entering the area.
Calls for inquiry
Controversy over the conduct of British troops reached a head in September 1935, when Kumaraswami Raju moved a resolution in the Legislative Assembly, where “a committee consisting of officials and non-officials be forthwith appointed to investigate the report as to whether the situation arising out of the recent earthquake in British Baluchistan, and particularly in the town of Quetta, was properly handled, particularly with regard to the search for the rescue of the living, wounded and buried, salvage of property and transference of the wounded and injured to places outside the affected area”.
Sir Abdullah Haroon was in support of the motion, and spoke on how the authorities had not only not taken the help of the honorary magistrates in Quetta, but that anyone who opposed the martial law was removed. Lalchand Navalrai then quoted a telegram from Sir Norman Carter, who had refused him permission to enter Quetta on June 3 and also refused the excavation of a building of his relative. Additionally, he spoke about how “trainloads of people left Karachi for Quetta on May 31, but they were held up at Sibi”. Lastly, quoting the opinion of “a Dewan Bahadur in Quetta”, Carter had been willing to allow volunteers in, but the military authority denied these requests.
Bhulabhai Desai, who had drafted the resolution, said that the motion “contained no charge and no insinuation” against the Raj, and speakers in the assembly were all in agreement that the army had done an incredible feat in what it had accomplished in saving human lives. However, it was a practice of the government to conduct inquiries after calamities such as famine to use as a reference in the future. Desai then read from a report (not mentioned which one) where rescue work was abandoned on June 2, and when the Mayor of Karachi (Qazi Khuda Buksh) had offered volunteers, the military had replied, “We are able to cope with all work.”

British authorities, however, felt that the resolution was unfairly putting blame on the Raj, and even Indian leaders debated against an inquiry. Sir Cowasjee Jehangir was quoted as saying that “he had never had the misfortune to hear a more atrocious speech” and that the resolution “contained malicious insinuations against the British and Indian troops and the speaker would be no party to it”. Dr Ziauddin Ahmed also explained how it would be difficult for anyone to be alive after three days of lying under debris.
Sir Zafarullah Khan, in his speech, said that the “governments are not prepared to agree to an inquiry” but were ready for the appointment of a committee to assist authorities in the salvage of property (which became the Quetta Claims Committee) and the resettlement of the civilian population.
Congress’ resolution for the formation of a committee by the Legislative Assembly was lost by 4 votes on September 21, a day after debates. Officially, 30,000 people died in Quetta; unofficially, 60,000 perished. No. 31 Squadron RAF moved to Karachi at RAF Drigh Road, today PAF Base Faisal.
Research on the Quetta earthquake of 1935 has remained shockingly limited, where anthropologists and historians can study colonial policies and particularly as they stand with reconstruction efforts following the disaster. The Directorate of Archives Balochistan has a treasure trove of reconstruction documents and has also republished the Pinney Report, which it has available for sale. Images of the earthquake surface not only on eBay auctions, but also from the children of survivors and troops who were involved in rescue efforts.

Daniel Haines at University College London has written on the lens through which tensions emerged between the Raj and South Asians following the earthquake.
A recent monograph titled ‘Acts of Aid: Politics of Relief and Reconstruction in the 1934 Bihar–Nepal Earthquake’ by Eleonor Marcussen shows that archival work on natural disasters in South Asia during the British Raj might find some pace. Marcussen analyses the role of the British Raj and civil society in rebuilding their lives following the 8.0-magnitude earthquake, which killed 7,000 people in Bihar alone, and nearly 12,000 in its total destruction.
While 60,000 people died, the 1935 Quetta earthquake is remembered as a footnote in colonial records — a logistical challenge that was overcome by the Raj rather than a human catastrophe. As we see from the lack of an independent inquiry, its memory remains fragmented, and its survivors’ voices largely absent from the official record.

Among the posthumous recipients of Dag Hammarskjold medals were Sepoy Muhammad Tarique and Havildar Ahsanullah Khan from Pakistan, both of whom served with the UN Interim Security Force for Abyei (UNISFA).
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who presided over the ceremony in the Trusteeship Council Chamber at UN Headquarters, presented the awards for the fallen peacekeepers. These were received by the ambassadors of their respective countries.
Awards for civilians were received on behalf of their families by UN Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support Atul Khare.
 







57 peacekeepers from 32 countries also honoured

Pakistan’s UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, accompanied by the Mission’s Military Adviser Col Umar Shafique, accepted the awards for his countrymen.
Mr Guterres also presented the 2024 Military Gender Advocate of the Year award to Squadron Leader Sharon Mwinsote Syme from Ghana, and the UN Woman Police Officer of the Year award to Superintendent Zainab Gbla of Sierra Leone. Both also serve with UNISFA.
 






 






This year’s theme focused on the future of peacekeeping. Mr Guterres said, “peacekeepers face increasingly complex situations in an increasingly complex world,” citing growing polarisation, terrorism, misinformation, climate change, and transnational crime.
“Now more than ever, the world needs the United Nations and the United Nations needs peacekeeping that is fully equipped for today’s realities and tomorrow’s challenges,” he said.
The secretary-general stressed that “it is essential that peacekeepers have what they need to do their jobs,” calling it “the shared responsibility of the United Nations and Member States”.
UN Under-Secretary-General for Peace Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix said, “Our personnel are our most important capability. The sacrifices made by our peacekeepers call for more than remembrance; they demand action.”
He added, “The future of peacekeeping hinges on our collective commitment to continue to adapt and invest so we can continue delivering hope and protection where it’s needed most.”
 






The first UN peacekeeping operation was established in 1948. Today, more than 68,000 personnel serve in 11 missions.
Pakistan is the fifth-largest contributor of uniformed personnel, currently deploying over 2,800 military and police personnel to UN operations in Abyei, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cyprus, Somalia, South Sudan, and Western Sahara.
International Day of UN Peacekeepers, established in 2002, honours the more than 4,400 peacekeepers who have died in the line of duty over the past 77 years, with 57 fatalities recorded in 2024 alone.

The protest call was issued by the Pak-China Traders Action Committee, an alliance comprising the Gilgit-Baltistan Importers and Exporters Association, the Nagar Chamber of Commerce, and small trade associations from Nagar, Hunza, and Gilgit. Protesters chanted slogans against Pakistan Customs and the Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) government.
According to the protesters, the primary grievance is the suspension of customs clearance for imported consignments from China at Sost Dry Port for the last six months, effectively halting Pak-China trade.
According to traders, 257 consignments imported from China have been stuck at Sost Dry port since December last year, causing “billions of rupees losses” from expired items, daily port charges, and other expenses. They demanded that the stranded consignments be cleared through a “one-time amnesty scheme” as they cannot absorb the damages.

Demand ‘one-time amnesty’ for over 250 consignments stuck at Sost since last year

 
 

They highlighted that a large portion of GB’s population, including transporters, hotel owners, shopkeepers, labourers and customs agents, depends on this trade due to a lack of other job opportunities. Also, new policies of Pakistan Customs were described as “anti-poor”, rendering thousands jobless.
Further demands include exempting consignments at Sost Dry Port from misdeclaration cases, arguing it’s challenging to prepare detailed packing lists and invoices under the current Chinese import circumstances, where traders buy various items from multiple shops.
They also requested permission to submit import documents after examination of consignments at Sost.
Traders called for the facilitation of barter trade between Gilgit-Baltistan and Xinjiang province under the 1985 border agreement. They asked that goods imported by border pass holders be cleared separately near the Sost customs check post, continuing a 40-year practice.
Additionally, seized counterfeit items at Sost Dry Port should be destroyed or auctioned within Gilgit-Baltistan, where facilities already exist, rather than being transported out. A comprehensive future policy is sought to ensure uninterrupted trade.
Initially, organisers had planned a car march to Sost town near Khunjerab Pass on Friday to decide on joint protest actions. However, when convoys from Gilgit and Nagar began to move towards Sost, the administration deployed police at the KKH in Pissan, the Ganish bridge in Hunza, and other connecting roads.
 
 

A convoy of hundreds of vehicles from Gulmat Nagar was stopped by the police, leading protesters to stage a sit-in at Pissan, which was later joined by other rally participants.
Addressing protesters, Ebad Nagri, Mir Abbas, Muhammad Ismail and others said they initially had no plan for a sit-in but decided on it after police stopped their march to Sost.
Protesters claimed they were protesting peacefully but accused the government of “trying to make it violent”. They noted the local administration had imposed Section 144 — a provision often used to suppress public gatherings — despite no law-and-order situation. They said the sit-in would continue until their demands were met.
“GB has no representation in parliament and other federal institutions, but still always remains in the forefront to defend the country,” said Abbas Mir, an organiser, criticising the federal government for crippling Gilgit-Baltistan’s financial lifelines. He added that political, religious, and regional parties supported their protest.
Protesters said they had met high-level officials over the past six months, but to no avail. Ebad Nagri announced that the protest “will only be called off after the fulfilment of our demands”.

Osaka University, one of the top-ranked in Japan, is offering tuition fee waivers, research grants and help with travel arrangements for students and researchers at US institutions who want to transfer.
Japan’s Kyoto Univers­ity and Tokyo University are also considering similar schemes, while Hong Kong has instructed its universities to attract top talent from the United States. China’s Xian Jiaotong Uni­versity has appealed for students at Harvard, singled out in Trump’s crackdown, promising “streamlined” admissions and  “comprehensive” support.
Trump’s administration has enacted massive funding cuts for academic research, curbed visas for foreign students — especially those from China —and plans to hike taxes on elite schools.
Trump alleges top US universities are cradles of anti-American movements. In a dramatic esca­lation, his administration last week revoked Har­vard’s ability to enrol foreign students, a move later blocked by a federal judge.
Masaru Ishii, dean of the graduate school of medicine at Osaka Univer­sity, described the impact on US universities as “a loss for all of humanity”.
Japan aims to ramp up its number of foreign students to 400,000 over the next decade, from around 337,000 currently.
Jessica Turner, CEO of Quacquarelli Symonds, a London-based analytics firm that ranks universities globally, said other leading universities around the world were trying to attract students unsure of going to the United States.
Germany, France and Ireland are emerging as particularly attractive alternatives in Europe, she said, while in the Asia-Pacific, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Korea, Japan, and mainland China are rising in profile.
Switching schools
Chinese students have been particularly targeted in Trump’s crackdown, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio pledging to “aggressively” crack down on their visas.
More than 275,000 Chi­nese students are enrolled in hundreds of US colleges, providing a major source of revenue for the institutions and a crucial pipeline of talent for US technology companies.
International students — 54 per cent of them from India and China — contributed more than $50 billion to the US economy in 2023.
Critical period
Trump’s crackdown comes at a critical period in the international student application process, as many young people prepare to travel to the US in August to find accommodation and settle in before the term starts.
Dai, 25, a Chinese student based in Chengdu, had planned to head to the US to complete her master’s but is now seriously considering taking up an offer in Britain instead.

• Says millions of lives must not be held hostage to ‘narrow political gains’
• Terms 2022 floods a consequence of glacial melt
• Tajik president wants global plan to save melting glaciers
DUSHANBE: Rejecting the “weaponisation of water”, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday warned that Pakistan would not allow India to cross the “red line” by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, describing any such move as a reckless act that would jeopardise millions of lives for narrow political gain.
“India’s unilateral and illegal decision to hold in abeyance the Indus Water Treaty, which governs the sharing of the Indus Basin’s water, is deeply regrettable,” the prime mi­n­ister said while addr­essing the High-Level Int­e­rnational Conference on Glaciers Preservation. “Millions of lives must not be held hostage to narrow political gains, and Pakistan will not allow this. We will never allow the red line to be crossed.”
The three-day conference, held in Tajikistan’s capital Dushanbe from May 29-31, brought toge­ther over 2,500 delegates from 80 UN member states and 70 international orga­ni­sations, including prime ministers, vice presidents, ministers, and UN assistant secretaries-general.
 
 

Hosted by the government of Tajikistan in collaboration with the United Nations, Unesco, World Meteorological Organisa­tion (WMO), and the Asian Development Bank, the summit aimed to push forward the agenda for glacier protection and international climate cooperation.
In his address, Prime Minister Shehbaz touched all the relevant issues, including glacial preservation, Pakistan’s climate vulnerability, the 2022 floods in Pakistan, global climate action and responsibility, scientific projections on glacial melt, weaponisation of water, and a call to protect nature and humanity’s shared destiny.
“The world today bears fresh scars from the use of conventional weapons in Gaza that have left deep wounds. As if that were not enough, we are now witnessing an alarming new low — the weaponisation of water,” he told participants.
The 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly, through a resolution, declared 2025 as the International Year of Glaciers Preservation, designated 21 March as the annual World Day for Glaciers beginning in 2025, and assigned the government of Tajikistan to host the inaugural international conference on the subject that year.
Prime Minister Shehbaz reminded the international audience that Pakistan, with over 13,000 glaciers, was among the countries most vulnerable to climate change. These glaciers contribute nearly half of the annual flows in the Indus River system, which sustains Pakistan’s civilisation, culture and economy.
“The five great rivers that shape our geographical landscape — Indus, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej — all depend on the stability of glacial systems. This makes Pakistan one of the most vulnerable countries to any climatic changes that impact glaciers,” he added.

He told the international gathering that Pakistan had faced the peril of glacial melt in the form of devastating floods in 2022, which destroyed millions of acres of standing crops and hundreds of thousands of houses and infrastructure, despite Pakistan’s only less than half a per cent contribution to the total world emissions.
Referring to the “sobering” scientific projections, he highlighted that glacial melt in our region was expected to accelerate flooding in the coming decades, followed by a drastic decline in river flows as glaciers recede further.
“These changes threaten our fragile ecosystem. As we inch closer to these grim new realities, we must heed the alarm bells, deflection signs of haunting consequences — lost livelihoods, displaced families and deep chaos,” he warned.
 
 

Highlighting Pakistan’s commitment to shared responsibility and collective action, he called for enhanced global climate action to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change.
“The developed countries must meet their climate financial commitments without any delay and with a balanced focus on adaptation and mitigation as well as loss and damage,” the prime minister said.
“Adequate funding for climate resilience, infrastructure and overcoming financing gaps remains critical for climate-vulnerable countries. Investment must be made in early warning systems and disaster preparedness and management,” he added.
Measures to protect glaciers
President Emomali Rahmon of Tajikistan, co-hosting the international conference, called on the world to take urgent and coordinated action to safeguard glaciers, warning that their rapid melting poses a global crisis.
“I want to note clearly that glaciers preservation is not just a problem of countries with glaciers but rather a global crisis that deserves the immediate attention of the international community,” President Rahmon said.
He urged comprehensive monitoring and scientific research to better understand glacier dynamics, their role in ecosystems and their socio-economic impacts.
He suggested that countries with the ability to collect accurate data on the state of glaciers, particularly through satellites, should establish a regular exchange of information with countries that lack such capabilities.
The president called for implementing collective actions to address the socio-economic consequences of glacier melting, including its impact on accessing water, ensuring food security, producing electricity, and protecting cultural and natural heritage.
“We must make every effort to ensure the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and take the necessary measures to prevent an increase in global temperature,” he said.
Tajikistan, with 93 per cent of its territory covered by mountains, is home to the largest glaciers in Central Asia. “So far, 1,300 out of 14,000 glaciers have completely melted. These glaciers supply 60pc of the region’s drinking water,” he said.
President Rahmon stressed that climate change had already caused the loss of about a third of mountain glaciers around the world and this process is not just an environmental problem but is closely related to many aspects of human life. “Tajikistan’s glaciers are vital not just for regional rivers, but for climate stability worldwide,” he said.
Citing the Fedchenko Glacier, one of the world’s largest continental glaciers, President Rahmon said it could yield thousands of years of climate data crucial for future strategies. He called on all countries to support Tajikistan’s proposal to develop a global preservation framework under the United Nations.

A variety of opinions are being shared by people looking at the treaty through different lens.
However, the most important question remains whether India has the capacity to use water as a weapon of war against Pakistan. This at once gives a new dimension to the treaty, requiring a perspective that is not merely legal but also political, with many layers of complexities.
The IWT is not merely a treaty between an upper and lower riparian country. It is a treaty between two states that have gone to war many times previously, with no sign of any long-term cessation in hostilities. The IWT can be re-examined, taking into account the changes that have taken place since 1960 when it was signed. This includes both climatic factors and changes in the political landscape.
Climate change has already reduced the snow mass by 30 per cent in the upper Indus basin lar­g­e­­ly due to the depletion of wetlands, urbanisation, and glacier melt. This trend is likely to increase, ca­­using a reduction in flow and a decrease in water availability as well as making water more contentious.
The political landscape has undergone a massive change after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2016 statement that water and blood cannot flow together.
 
 

Any discussion on the IWT will remain incomplete and unrealistic if it does not factor the above-mentioned points into the calculus. This also means that if both are not addressed simultaneously, water will remain a live threat looming over the fate of the region. The nuclear red line offers retaliatory action but is not a solution to the problem.

India’s plans for the Chenab are a matter of deep concern for Pakistan.

While accelerated melting and concomitant reductions in flows due to global warming are not within the management capacity of the two countries, both can, in the interest of peace, collaborate on issues related to water and security.
On the political front, the currently volatile situation is unsustainable, making water a source of continued regional tension. Having a single basin, a single river and being a lower riparian to a hostile upper riparian, Pakistan has reservations about discussing the treaty as it might derail the current arrangement without adding additional safeguards.
While the concern is legitimate, the country can propose a conversation that is built on the principles of ensuring sustainable flows and equitable water-sharing.
 
 

Supplementary protocols within the existing treaty and under the jurisdictional purview of the IWT commissioners can address issues like the permissible cumulative capacity for live storage, environmental flows, demographic changes, telemetric information-sharing, and most importantly, the environmental impact assessment (EIA) of planned infrastructure as part of the discussion agenda.
After 2019, India has given an EIA exemption to all infrastructure being built within 100 kilometres of the LoC. While technical studies rule out the possibility of earthquakes getting triggered by the construction of dams in this highly seismic geography, it does not exclude the possibility of dams collapsing and causing massive losses to downstream communities.
Pakistan does not face any serious threat on the Jhelum River from India. Most people in India-occupied Kashmir have shifted from agriculture to horticulture which does not require large quantities of water. Moreover, diverting water in a mountainous territory for the construction of canals and tunnels is not easy. With its current capacity, India could delay the release of water by 16 to 24 hours at best. Beyond that, it risks flooding the whole area including big towns like Jammu.
However, India’s plans for the Chenab are a matter of deep concern for Pakistan. India started plans in 2016 to develop the capacity to weaponise water. This is being done by building capacity purely for storage to withhold water. These projects on the Chenab are not designed as hydroelectric projects but as military structures to use water as a weapon of war.
A discussion on the treaty will allow Pakistan to address issues that were not a concern in 1960 but which now pose an existential threat to the country. However, none of this will be possible without lowering tensions and improving the overall environment for a conducive conversation.
The 2022 Pakistan National Security Policy made a statement of intent to prioritise geo-economics, but circumstantial roadblocks prevented the agenda from moving forward.
Regional water security will hang in the balance till we untie the Gordian knot. This can be done by decoupling politics from other issues or reaching a collaborative arrangement on climate. Both nations need to take a cue from countries that are separating politics from the economy and moving forward with a new paradigm.
After 78 years of conflict, Pakistan and India need to realise that climate change is a bigger enemy and poses a greater threat to their survival. All contentious issues will become irrelevant in the face of the existential threat that confronts us.
We have a ‘Cold Start’ for conflict, but what we need is a ‘Cold Start’ for collaboration to be better prepared for a rapid response to combat the forces of nature.
The IWT will come under increasing pressure if political issues are not addressed. The treaty stood the test of time for 65 years because climate imp­acts had not become so threatening and political tensions had not mounted to the current incendiary levels. It is time for both countries to shift from a ‘Mutually Assured Destruction’ (MAD) to a ’Mu­­tually Assured Survival Strategy (MASS). Passion in politics is a poisonous recipe for South Asia and its two billion inhabitants. It is time to pause, reflect and think about the future pragmatically.

• Reviews Nadra reforms
ISLAMABAD: The government on Friday deci­d­­ed to immediately block all the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) cards issu­­ed against expired CNICs.
The decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Interior Minister Moh­sin Naqvi at the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) headquarters here.
In the first phase, SIMs issued against the CNICs from 2017 or earlier will be blocked. In subsequent phases, the same policy will apply to deactivate SIM cards issued against CNICs issued after 2017, ensuring that only active identity cards are used for issuing SIMs.
Mr Naqvi, speaking on the occasion, stated that the Ministry of Interior will issue directives to all relevant institutions to stop storing citizens’ bio­metric data separately.
He instructed that the facial recognition technology would be implemented nationwide by Dec 31 and this process will be supervised by the Ministry of Interior.
Mr Naqvi emphasised the importance of providing better services to overseas Pakistanis, directing a comprehensive assessment in coordination with the Ministry of Foreign Af­­fairs to identify those countries and regions where Nadra services are most needed.
 
 

He also app­roved the establishment of authority’s regional offi­ces in Multan, Sukkur, and Gwadar.
Nadra Chairman L­t  Gen Muham­mad Munir Afsar gave a briefing on the authority’s outreach, service delivery, and progress on digital transformation.
The interior minister reviewed the progress of reforms in Nadra and appreciated its significant achievements in the past year, which include the establishment of 87 new registration centres and 417 additional counters.
Mr Afsar said various government dep­artments and service providers are storing citizens’ biometric data in local databases, which puts this sensitive information at risk of misuse and theft.
He added that a facial recognition system should be used, benefiting especially those citizens who face issues with fingerprint verification, by utilising Nadra’s secure and verified database.
The registration certificates for children and fa­­milies have been updated to ensure legal clarity and prevent fraud. Further­m­ore, Nadra has introduced an effective identity verification system incorporating facial recognition and iris scanning as additional biometric measu­r­­es.
 






The aut­hority is continuing necessary cooperation with PTA, FIA, State Bank of Pakis­tan, Se­­c­u­rities and Exchange Commission of Pak­istan  and other relevant insti­­tutions to combat identity fraud, SIM misuse, and biometric discrepancies.
It was also shared that the authority is focusing heavily on enhancing the features and utility of the PAK ID mobile app, which has been downloaded over seven million times. Its recently added features include digital ID issuance, “proof of life” for pensioners, and renewal of federal arms licences.
Mr Naqvi also laid the foundation sto­ne of a 10-storey Nadra Mega Center in Sector I-8. The completion of the Mega Center is expected by June 2026.
State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry and senior Nadra officials were also present on the occasion.

Chairman Asghar Ali Tareen, while presiding over the PAC meeting, uncovered un­­accounted expenditures, violations of procurement laws, and delayed mega projects.
The meeting was attended by committee members engineers Zamrak Khan Achak­zai, Zabid Ali Reki, Ghulam Dostgir Badini, Fazal Qadir Mandokhail, PHE Secretary Imran Gichki, DG Audit Balochistan Shuja Ali, Additional Accountant General Hafiz Noorul Haq, PAC Additional Secretary Siraj Lahri, Director Audit Dr Faiz Muhammad Jaffar, and Chief Accounts Officer Syed Idris. Opposition Leader Younis Aziz Zehri and Maulana Hidayatur Rahman were invited as special guests.
 
 

During the meeting, the DG audit presented a special audit report conducted in November 2022 covering the financial years from 2018 to 2021 for the PHE department, Gwadar.
The report revealed that the department incurred expenses exceeding Rs5.9 billion, however, significant amounts remained unaccounted for in official records, raising serious transparency concerns.

Audit shows over Rs5.9bn in unaccounted-for expenses between 2018 and 2021

It further disclosed that no income tax deductions were made on payments totaling nearly Rs240m, which were disbursed without legal deductions.
Work worth approximately Rs4.9bn was awarded to various companies without tenders, violating procurement laws. The audit also pointed to irregularities worth over Rs380m in schemes for water supply during drought conditions.
Irregularities were also found in the procurement of fuel, oil, lubricants, and repair materials. The executive engineer in Gwadar made multi-crore purchases from different companies without proper documentation, leading the committee to classify these expenditures as suspicious.
The members of the committee expressed strong reservations and demanded inquiry proceedings against responsible officers for failing to provide complete records.
Mr Tareen emphasised in his address that safeguarding public funds is a top priority and warned that anyone found misusing national resources would not be spared. He assured that while an opportunity for explanation would be given, strict action would follow if irregularities were confirmed.
Maulana Hidayatur Rahman, speaking on the occasion, criticised the Gwadar water project expenditures, stating billions had been spent but honest utilisation could have ensured water availability from Singapore by ship.
In his remarks, Fazal Qadir Mandokhail suggested referring the matter to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), though other members advocated for full fact-finding before the chairman exercises his authority.
The meeting also reviewed the audit report of the Mangi Dam project, which was due to be completed in June 2022 but faced extraordinary delays and a 42 per cent cost overrun. The initial estimated cost of Rs7bn has now crossed to over Rs18bn. The audit attributed these issues to consultant inefficiency and poor planning, with key aspects ignored in the initial PC-1 document and recurring revision needs.
The DG audit reported that the department had not yet submitted any progress report on the project, drawing strong condemnation from the committee. PAC Chairman Tareen described this as an example of extreme institutional failure, pointing out that despite such a major project, public still live without access to clean drinking water.
He announced plans to personally visit the Mangi Dam site with committee members for on-ground assessment.
The project director informed the meeting that completion was possible by December 2025 if the required funds were released promptly. Mr Tareen decided to write to the Balochistan chief secretary to expedite fund release and warned of another special audit if the project fails to complete on time.
Further disclosures included that over 1.43 million litres of diesel were used to supply water to Gwadar, with fuel distributed to tankers without proper record keeping or storage details in logbooks, violating procurement rules.
The chairman stated that the committee would not only expose financial corruption but also initiate strict legal action to restore public trust in Balochistan’s governance.

• Macron says abandoning Gaza ‘will kill’ West’s credibility
GENEVA: Gaza is “the hungriest place on Earth”, the United Nations said on Friday, warning that the Palestinian territory’s entire population was now at risk of famine.
Negotiations to end nearly 20 months of war have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough, with Israel resuming operations in Gaza in March, ending a six-week truce.
“Gaza is the hungriest place on Earth,” said Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN humanitarian agency OCHA.
“It’s the only defined area — a country or defined territory within a country — where you have the entire population at risk of famine. 100 per cent of the population at risk of famine,” he said, rejecting claims to the contrary by Israeli authorities. In recent days, Israel has partially eased a total aid blockade on the Palestinian territory that it imposed on March 2, leading to severe shortages of food and medicine.
 
 

Daniel Meron, Israel’s ambassador in Geneva, rejected the claim, saying UN agencies “cherry-pick the facts to paint an alternative version of reality and demonise Israel”.
“In a desperate effort to remain relevant, they lambast the best efforts of Israel and its partners to facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid to the civilian population. UN feeds Hamas, we make sure aid gets to those in need,” he wrote on X.
‘Catastrophic hunger’
At a press briefing in Geneva, Laerke detailed the difficulties faced by the United Nations in delivering humanitarian aid into the Gaza Strip.
Laerke said 900 trucks of humanitarian aid had been authorised by Israel to enter the Gaza Strip since the blockade was partially lifted.
But so far only 600 trucks have been offloaded on the Gaza side of the border, and a smaller number of truckloads have then been picked up, due to multiple security considerations.
Once truckloads enter Gaza, they are often “swarmed by desperate people”, Laerke said. “I don’t blame them, for one second, for taking the aid that essentially is already theirs — but it’s not distributed in the way we want.”
‘Desperate and tragic’
The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a new organisation backed by Israel and the US that emerged in early May — has been distributing aid at several sites across the Strip this week.
Asked about the foundation’s operations, Laerke said: “It’s not working. It does not meet the needs of people. It creates chaos.”
Thousands of Palestinians rus­hed into a GHF centre on Tuesday, AFP journalists reported, as Israel implemented a new distribution system that bypasses the UN.
Laerke said that by having people collect aid rather than delivering it to them where they are, they become a target for looters once they leave the site.
‘Free pass’
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that abandoning war-torn Gaza to its fate and giving Israel a “free pass” would kill the West’s credibility with the world.
“If we abandon Gaza, if we consider there is a free pass for Israel, even if we do condemn the terrorist attacks, we will kill our credibility,” Macron told a top defence forum in Singapore, adding: “And this is why we do reject double standard.”

The military’s media wing said on Thursday that 12 terrorists had been neutralised in both provinces over the past few days. However, the counterterrorism operations have come at a high cost, as a number of security men were martyred in various incidents.
These include four troops in North Waziristan, who lost their lives while confronting “Indian-sponsored” khawarij (the term the state uses for the banned TTP), as well as the loss of two Coast Guard men in Jiwani, who were reportedly attacked by militants near the Iranian border. These vulnerabilities must be plugged to prevent the loss of more troops.
There had been some media reports that an Afghan Taliban commander had apparently issued a warning to fighters against attacking Pakistani forces and launching self-styled jihad. Attributed to an individual named Saeedullah Saeed, the warning stated that fighting Pakistan would be considered fasad (corruption) rather than jihad.
 
 

The veracity of this statement is hard to establish. Even if we were to assume that the statement had been made, the warning has not had its intended effect, as the continuing TTP terrorist attacks inside Pakistan show. What is needed from the Afghan Taliban are firm commitments that they will not let their territory be used for staging attacks against Pakistan.
This principle had been clearly enunciated at the trilateral meeting of Afghanistan, Pakistan and China’s foreign ministers in Beijing earlier this month. Summarising the main points of the meeting, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi had said that the three participants had agreed “to oppose all forms of terrorism … and … jointly combat terrorist forces of concern to each side”.
Perhaps Islamabad and Beijing need to remind Kabul of this commitment. Hopefully, Pakistan’s elevation of diplomatic relations with Afghanistan to ambassadorial level should help improve matters.
Regarding Balochistan, ties with Iran are largely cordial, so both sides must reinforce CT cooperation. As for the larger problem of Baloch separatist militancy, CT efforts must be carried out in tandem with a political process to address Balochistan’s challenges.
Beating terrorism requires proactive engagement with foreign friends and neighbours, as well as internal security efforts and intel operations to bust terrorist cells. While hostile actors in the region may well be supporting terrorist groups, Pakistan must remain vigilant to thwart fresh threats.
The key remains blending kinetic efforts with sociopolitical interventions to address immediate terrorist threats and the underlying factors that fuel militancy. Pakistan succeeded in thwarting foreign aggression, and with resolve the domestic terrorist threat can also be neutralised.

• Deploys drones to spot unregistered pilgrims; hundreds of apartments raided
• Fines doubled for performing rites illegally; violators to face 10-year ban
• Family, tourist visas barred to nationals of more than 10 countries
RIYADH: Saudi Arabia is ramping up a crackdown on unregistered worshippers at next week’s Haj, a year after hundreds perished in scorching conditions.
Regular raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts are aimed at rooting out unauthorised visitors hoping to mingle among the crowds in and around the holy city of Makkah.
The simple message, “No Haj without a permit”, is being blared out in a relentless campaign promoted nationwide at shopping centres, on billboards and across media platforms.
Last year, 1,301 pilgrims, most of them unregistered and lacking access to air-conditioned tents and buses, died as temperatures soared to 51.8 degrees Celsius.
“Since the end of last season, we realised the biggest challenge is preventing unauthorised pilgrims from undermining the success of the Haj season,” said one official helping organise the Haj, requesting anonymity.
Official permits are allocated to countries through a quota system and distributed to individuals via a lottery. Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs make the irregular route — which costs thousands of dollars less — more attractive.
Saudi officials said 83 per cent of those who died last year did not have official Haj permits. Temperatures of up to 44C are forecast next week.
‘Unprecedented’ security
To seek out unregistered pilgrims, Saudi authorities have rolled out a new fleet of drones to monitor entrances into Makkah.
Security forces have also raided hundreds of apartments in search of people hiding out in the area.
An Egyptian engineer living in Makkah, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said his building was raided multiple times in recent weeks.
“Police officers in uniform came to my home twice and asked to see my and my wife’s residency permits,” he told AFP.
“Almost everywhere, we’re being asked to show residency or work permits in Makkah. The security presence is unprecedented.”
The problem of illegal pilgrims has become acute since Saudi Arabia loosened visa restrictions in line with economic reforms, trying to attract more tourism and business. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have used family and tourist visas, instead of the designated Haj visa, to enter the country each year.
Fines and bans
Saudi Arabia is now trying to cut off the problem at source, restricting multiple-entry visas for citizens of several countries since January.
Family and tourist visas were also barred to nationals of more than 10 countries, including Egypt, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Jordan.
Umar Karim, an expert on Saudi affairs at the University of Birmingham, said officials previously focused on “deterring people but not stopping them” from coming before the Haj.
“Saudi authorities have seen that once these people are inside the kingdom, stopping them from physically entering Makkah is a difficult task even if a huge number of security officials are deployed,” he added.
For the past month, entry into Makkah has been restricted to individuals with work and residency permits. Many people in Makkah have been forced to send their wives and children, who lack the proper visas, out of the city. Pilgrims coming for Umrah have also been required to leave.
Meanwhile, fines for performing Haj illegally have doubled to 20,000 Saudi riyals ($5,333), with violators facing a 10-year ban from the country.
Those found to be harbouring and helping unauthorised pilgrims can be fined up to 100,000 riyals ($26,666).
“All of this is aimed at ensuring that Makkah is reserved exclusively for authorised pilgrims during the Haj season,” the official added.
Residents of Makkah told AFP that the crowds there have noticeably thinned compared to previous years.
However, officials said on Tuesday that more than a million pilgrims had already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the Haj.
Last year’s Haj-related deaths were a high-profile example of the havoc wrought by heat in 2024, which the Copernicus Climate Change Service said was the hottest year ever recorded.
While the pilgrimage, which follows a lunar calendar, will eventually shift to the cooler winter season, relief will be temporary.
A 2019 study published by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change and the timing of the Haj, heat stress for pilgrims will exceed the “extreme danger threshold” from 2047 to 2052, and 2079 to 2086.

The reference is based on an application filed by former MNA Babar Nawaz, who lost 2024 general election from NA-18 (Haripur) to Omar Ayub Khan with a margin of 82,000 votes. 
The ECP instantly fixed the reference for first hearing on June 4 and notices have been issued to both Mr Ayub and Mr Nawaz. 
On the same day, the ECP will also resume hearing on a petition filed by Mr Nawaz on May 11,2024 seeking action over alleged rigging in his constituency. 
He had also demanded a thorough probe into the alleged rigging. In his petition, the former MNA had alleged that Mr Ayub was guilty of financial corruption and misrepresentation in the affidavit submitted to the election commission. 
One of the interesting claims made by Mr Nawaz was that the PTI leader had himself complained of rigging in elections on February 9. 
A source in PTI, however, rejected the claim that the party had written a letter to the DRO complaining over its own victory with a margin of 82,000 votes. He said the fake letter had never been written by the PTI and was not there on the official record. 
He said the DRO concerned had also denied receiving such a letter. He also pointed out that Mr Nawaz in his posts on social media including X and Facebook had accepted his defeat with open heart and had congratulated Mr Ayub. 
The source further said Mr Nawaz filed his petition on May 11, 2024, after 24 days from the date of expiry of filing of the petition deadline (April 17). 
He alleged the state machinery and ECP have been activated once again as a tool to deprive PTI of those seats they could not manage to steal after elections. 
On April 18, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had lifted the stay order that had halted the ECP’s probe into alleged rigging in NA-18 Haripur, directing the electoral body to proceed with the case after hearing all concerned parties. 
Announcing the reserved verdict, Acting Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar dismissed the petition filed by mr Ayub, which had sought to block the ECP’s inquiry into the alleged irregularities. 
On April 23, the PTI leader challenged in the Supreme Court the ECP’s jurisdiction to proceed with a representation filed by his rival candidate, Babar Nawaz Khan, under sections 8, 9, and 95 of the Elections Act, 2017.
The petitioner argued that the ECP became functus officio (lacking jurisdiction) after the statutory 60-day period from the Feb 17, 2024 notification of the returned candidate expired on April 17, 2024. Despite this, the ECP continued proceedings, which he contended was unlawful.

“Pakistan’s nuclear weapon program is the sole guarantor of peace and stability in South Asia,” Gen Kidwai said in his keynote at a round table discussion hosted by the Center for International Strategic Studies to mark the 27th anniversary of Pakistan’s 1998 nuclear tests.
Speakers at the event described India’s resp­onse as a reckless attempt to challenge Pakistan’s strategic restraint.
Among others who spoke at the meeting were former foreign secretary Sohail Mahmood, director general of the Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad; Muhammad Naeem, former chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission; Dr Adil Sultan, dean of Air University; and retired Brig Dr Zahirul Haider Kazmi, adviser on arms control at the Strategic Plans Division.
The speakers warned of an emerging pattern in which India employs false flag operations as pretexts for limited military strikes, ignoring the risks inherent in a nuclearised environment. Such beha­v­iour, they said, could trigger catastrophic misjudgments with far-reaching consequences.
“India has shown a pattern of conducting false flag operations as a casus belli to justify aggressive actions against Pakistan, disregarding the prevailing nuclear environment and deliberately testing the limits of Pakistan’s conventional capabilities and nuclear thresholds,” CISS said in a statement on the discussion.
“Pakistan’s credible nuclear capability, operationalised through Full Spectrum Deterrence, remains the cornerstone of peace in South Asia,” one of the speakers said, arguing that the recent confrontation underscored the continued relevance of nuclear deterrence in preventing conflict escalation.
They also emphasised Pakistan’s readiness to respond to future provocations with a range of kinetic and non-kinetic options, as part of ‘Quid Pro Quo Plus’ strategy — defined as swift, and precise retaliation aimed at deterring escalation and compelling de-escalation.

The increase in trade tariffs on Pakistani products announced by US President Donald Trump, which were paused, could have a devastating impact on Pakistan’s important exports and served as a wake-up call for diversification, according to a state-owned think tank.
The Pakistan Institute of Development Economics warned that these tariffs would have a “devastating impact” on the country’s export sector, translating into an annual loss of $1.1-1.4 billion.
 
 

According to the finance ministry, Aurangzeb and Greer “exchanged their view point through a constructive engagement, with the understanding that technical level detailed discussions would follow in the coming few weeks”.
“Both sides expressed confidence in advancing these negotiations for successful conclusion at the earliest,” the ministry added.
Trump’s tariffs, implemented on April 2, introduced a 10 per cent baseline tariff for every country the US trades with, and additional reciprocal tariffs on rivals and allies alike.
The steep hike targeting Chinese goods raised Washington’s additional rate on many products to 145 per cent, the White House confirmed. The two nations have engaged in talks, which the US treasury secretary says have “stalled”.</p><small>2025-05-30 18:52</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/30233851bb93b85.jpg?r=234547' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914331/abortion-pill-inventor-etienne-emile-baulieu-dies-aged-98' target='_blank'><strong>Abortion pill inventor Etienne-Emile Baulieu dies aged 98</strong></a><br><p>French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, the inventor of the abortion pill, died at the age of 98 at his home in Paris on Friday, his wife told AFP.
The doctor and researcher, who achieved worldwide renown for his work that led to the pill, had an eventful life that included fighting in the French resistance and becoming friends with artists such as Andy Warhol.
“His research was guided by his commitment to the progress made possible by science, his dedication to women’s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,” Baulieu’s wife Simone Harari Baulieu said in a statement.
French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to his life, calling him “a beacon of courage” and “a progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom”.
“Few French people have changed the world to such an extent,” he added in a post on X.
 






Baulieu’s most famous discovery helped create the oral drug RU-486, also known as mifepristone, which provided a safe and inexpensive alternative to surgical abortion to millions of women across the world.
For decades, he pushed governments to authorise the drug, facing fierce criticism and sometimes threats from opponents of abortion.
When Wyoming became the first US state to outlaw the abortion pill in 2023, Baulieu told AFP it was “scandalous”.
Then aged 96, Baulieu said he had dedicated a large part of his life to “increasing the freedom of women,” and such bans were a step in the wrong direction.
On news of his death, French Equality Minister Aurore Berge passed on her condolences to Baulieu’s family, saying on X he was “guided throughout his life by one requirement: human dignity.”
‘Fascinated by artists’
Born on December 12, 1926 in Strasbourg to Jewish parents, Etienne Blum was raised by his feminist mother after his father, a doctor, died. He changed his name to Emile Baulieu when he joined the French resistance against Nazi occupation at the age of 15, then later adding Etienne.
After the war, he became a self-described “doctor who does science,” specialising in the field of steroid hormones.
Invited to work in the United States, Baulieu was noticed in 1961 by Gregory Pincus, known as the father of the contraceptive pill, who convinced him to focus on sex hormones.
Back in France, Baulieu designed a way to block the effect of the hormone progesterone, which is essential for the egg to implant in the uterus after fertilisation. This led to the development of mifepristone in 1982.
Dragged before the courts and demonised by US anti-abortion groups who accused him of inventing a “death pill”, Baulieu refused to back down.
“Adversity slides off him like water off a duck’s back,” Simone Harari Baulieu told AFP.
“You, a Jew and a resistance fighter, you were overwhelmed with the most atrocious insults and even compared to Nazi scientists,” Macron said as he presented Baulieu with France’s top honour in 2023. “But you held on, for the love of freedom and science.”
In the 1960s, literature fan Baulieu became friends with artists such as Andy Warhol. He said he was “fascinated by artists who claim to have access to the human soul, something that will forever remain beyond the reach of scientists.”
Alzheimer’s, depression research
Baulieu kept going into his Parisian office well into his mid-90s.
“I would be bored if I did not work anymore,” he said in 2023.
His recent research has included trying to find a way to prevent the development of Alzheimer’s disease, as well as a treatment for severe depression, for which clinical trials are currently underway across the world.
“There is no reason we cannot find treatments” for both illnesses, he said.
Baulieu was also the first to describe how the hormone DHEA secreted from adrenal glands in 1963.
He was convinced of the hormone’s anti-ageing abilities, but drugs using it only had limited effects, such as in skin-firming creams.
In the United States, Baulieu was also awarded the prestigious Lasker prize in 1989.
After his wife Yolande Compagnon died, Baulieu married Simone Harari in 2016. He leaves behind three children, eight grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren, according to the statement released by his family.</p><small>2025-05-30 18:45</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/302156056fab848.jpg?r=215832' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914324/field-marshal-asim-munir-assails-indias-hydro-terrorism-during-address-to-quetta-college' target='_blank'><strong>Field Marshal Asim Munir assails India’s ‘hydro-terrorism’ during address to Quetta college</strong></a><br><p>Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir on Friday emphasised the need for a peaceful resolution to the Kashmir dispute, assailing India’s “unlawful and legally untenable hydro-terrorism,” a statement from the military’s media wing said.
His statement came during a visit to Quetta Command and Staff College where he addressed student officers and faculty of the college. The comments followed a recent military confrontation between India and Pakistan over New Delhi’s allegations against Islamabad, without evidence, about a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam.
New Delhi, based on the allegations, launched a series of air strikes in Pakistan in early May, killing civilians. Islamabad retaliated by downing five Indian jets. It took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire.
India, however, is still weaponising the Indus Water Treaty — a water distribution deal between the two countries — saying that it will no longer abide by the treaty, placing the agreement in “abeyance”.
According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army chief emphasised the need for a peaceful resolution of the Kashmir dispute, and warned against India’s “unlawful and legally untenable ‘hydro-terrorism’.”
“Commenting on the global and regional environment, the COAS shed light on the character of emerging conflict, with particular emphasis on India’s increasingly dangerous propensity to use unprovoked military aggression against Pakistan,” the statement said.
“While reiterating the resolve to defeat any aggression and ability to deal with threats across the entire conflict spectrum, the COAS asserted that Pakistan will never be coerced and inimical designs to distract Pakistan’s efforts against the war on terrorism will be comprehensively defeated.”
The field marshal also paid tribute to the martyrs of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos against India and expressed complete solidarity with their family members.
He said that the Pakistani people became “a wall of steel for the defence of the motherland” under the national leadership.

The ISPR also said that the army chief highlighted the “Indian state’s role in sponsoring terrorism inside Pakistan”, adding that he spoke on the “reinvigorated counter-terrorism drive and expressed confidence that the nation’s fight against terrorism will be driven to a logical conclusion”.
The statement further said, “Talking about leadership, the Field Marshal advised the student officers to fulfill their obligations with utmost dedication, passion and resolve.
“Emphasising the need for innovative thinking and research, he lauded the Command & Staff College Quetta for grooming future military leaders who uphold the highest standards of this sacred profession.”
He was quoted in the statement as saying, “Training must reflect not only the current realities but also prepare us for the future battlefield, one that demands agility, innovation, and unwavering resolve.”
Upon his arrival in Quetta, the Field Marshal was received by Quetta Corps Commander and Quetta Commandant Command and Staff College, it added.
Last week, the government promoted Gen Munir to the rank of field marshal in recognition of his “strategic leadership and decisive role” in defeating India during the military confrontation between the two countries that ended with a US-mediated ceasefire.
Field marshal is the highest rank in armies modelled after the British Army. In Pakistan, it was awarded only once before, to General Mohammad Ayub Khan in 1959.</p><small>2025-05-30 18:09</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/302249098475f48.jpg?r=224917' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914322/robbers-hijack-rickshaw-carrying-sacrificial-animals-in-karachi-police' target='_blank'><strong>Robbers hijack rickshaw carrying sacrificial animals in Karachi: police</strong></a><br><p>Four armed robbers hijacked a Qingqi rickshaw carrying three sacrificial sheep at gunpoint in Karachi’s Ayesha Manzil area, police said on Friday.
According to a first information report (FIR), the complainant Mohammed Rashid Saleem said that he had purchased three sheep and was carrying them in his Qingqi rickshaw on Thursday when the incident occurred.
“Four suspects riding on two motorcycles snatched the rickshaw along with the animals at gunpoint and fled,” the FIR read, adding that the suspects also snatched cash and a cell phone from the victim.
According to a statement from the Karachi Police spokesperson, the Additional Inspector General of Police (AIG) Javed Alam Odho took notice of the incident and ordered action against the Azizabad station house officer for negligence, issuing orders to suspend his service for one year.
The AIG ordered that the suspects involved in the incident must be arrested within three days, with the recovery of the animals and rickshaw, otherwise, strict legal action will be taken, the statement added.
Days before Eidul Azha, people rush to cattle markets to buy sacrificial animals, with sheep usually costing upwards of Rs30,000.
In 2023, five animals worth Rs800,000 were stolen from a locked shop in Karachi’s Orangi Town, according to ARY News. The incident pointed to the growing security concerns around cattle markets, later raised in the Sindh Assembly.</p><small>2025-05-30 17:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/3022341973dc4c7.jpg?r=223440' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914326/world-boxing-to-introduce-mandatory-sex-testing-for-all-boxers' target='_blank'><strong>World Boxing to introduce mandatory sex testing for all boxers</strong></a><br><p>World Boxing will introduce mandatory sex testing for all boxers in its competitions, the body said on Friday, adding that Paris Olympics women’s welterweight champion Imane Khelif will not be allowed to compete until she undergoes such a test.
The governing body, which will run the boxing competitions in the 2028 Olympics after being granted provisional recognition by the IOC, said it aims to deliver a competitive level playing field for men and women.
“Imane Khelif may not participate in the female category at the Eindhoven Box Cup, 5-10 June 2025 and any World Boxing event until Imane Khelif undergoes genetic sex screening in accordance with World Boxings rules and testing procedures,” World Boxing said in a statement.
 
 

All athletes over the age of 18 will have to undertake a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) genetic test, which can be conducted by a nasal or mouth swab, saliva or blood, World Boxing said.
“The PCR test is a laboratory technique used to detect specific genetic material, in this case, the SRY gene, that reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex,” the statement added.</p><small>2025-05-30 17:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606988-adc-martyred-after-terrorists-attack-residence-in-balochistans-sorab' target='_blank'><strong>ADC martyred after terrorists attack residence in Balochistan's Sorab</strong></a><br><p>

Balochistan Government Spokesperson Shahid Rind, in a statement, termed the incident a “nefarious attempt to challenge the writ of the state”.
“A bank was looted and the homes of several government officials were attacked, including Additional Deputy Commissioner (Revenue) Hidayatullah Buledi.
“Buledi was martyred while defending his home during the attack,” Rind said in the statement, adding that the official “set a new example of bravery” through his sacrifice.
“Women and children were also present at the residence during the attack,” he added.
The spokesperson added that “Indian-sponsored proxies have taken action on (India’s) behalf”, adding that a search operation was underway in the area.
“We are determined to thwart efforts of anti-state elements,” he said, according to the statement.
Frontier Corps and Levies personnel had arrived at the scene, he said.
Separately, Rind spoke to DawnNews TV and said that “geo-fencing is being used to track down the attackers.”
Dawn.com has reached out to the police and local administration in Surab for comment.
Last month, ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.
“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said, using the state-designated term for the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.
The security situation in Balochistan has worsened in recent months, as militants, long involved in a low-level insurgency, have stepped up the frequency and intensity of their attacks. The outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army, in particular, has adopted new tactics to inflict higher casualties and directly target Pakistani security forces.
In March, the Jaffar Express train was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area, resulting in the deaths of 26 hostages, including 18 security personnel. Five more security personnel were martyred during the operation.
However, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).
Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.</p><small>2025-05-30 17:23</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606982-coas-vows-to-thwart-hostile-attempts-aimed-at-derailing-pakistans-anti-terror-efforts' target='_blank'><strong>COAS vows to thwart hostile attempts aimed at derailing Pakistan's anti-terror efforts</strong></a><br><p>

On May 9, 2023, PTI supporters, protesting the party founder Imran Khan’s arrest, staged violent protests throughout the country, vandalising military installations and state-owned buildings, while also attacking the Lahore corps commander’s residence. Following the riots, thousands of protesters, including party leaders, were arrested.
ATC Special Court-II judge Tahir Abbas Sipra handed down the punishment under different sections of the Pakistan Penal Code after finding the accused guilty of attacking the Ramna police station during the May 9 riots.
The accused were sentenced to a total of 27 years in prison along with a fine worth Rs327,000. The sentences shall run concurrently, the judge said.
MNA Abdul Latif, who was elected from NA-1 Chitral, was not present in the court when the verdict was announced. The lawmaker will be disqualified for five years after the conviction.
The judge told the accused that 20 witnesses, including magistrates recorded their testimonies against them, noting that protests should be held peacefully and participants should never take the law into their own hands.
“You are accused of attacking the Ramna Police Station in Islamabad. If you attack your own police stations, the country will no longer be livable,” the judge remarked.
A case had been registered against the accused in Ramna police station under various sections for offences including burning a motorcycle and attacking police personnel.
The eleven accused who were convicted were Zariyab Khan, Muhammad Akram, Meera Khan, Abdul Latif, Sameol Robert, Wazeerzada, Abdul Basit, Shan Ali, Shahzaib, Muhammad Yousaf, and Sohail Khan.
Following the verdict, the police took the four accused present in the court, namely Mira Khan, Muhammad Akram, Shahzeb, and Sohail Khan, into custody. The court also issued arrest warrants for other PTI supporters accused of involvement in the riots but was absent from the court.
The sentences ranged from ten years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs200,000 for terrorism provisions under Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, five years in prison and a fine of Rs50,000 for the murderous attack on policemen under Section Section 324 (attempted murder) of the PPC.
Additionally, the accused were sentenced to four years in prison and fined Rs40,000 for burning a motorcycle under Section 426 (punishment for mischief); and a separate sentence of four years in prison and a fine of Rs40,000 under Section 440 (mischief committed after preparation made for causing death or hurt) for vandalising a police station.
A sentence of three-month imprisonment was imposed for interfering in the work of the police under Section 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), one month for violating Section 144 (joining unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon), and two years for committing a crime in a group under Section 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of common object).
Prosecutor Raja Naveed conducted the testimony and cross-examination against the accused.
In December 2024, military courts had sentenced 85 civilians to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for their involvement in violent attacks on military installations during the riots on May 9.
The military’s media wing said in a statement that the trials of those accused of the May 9 riots under military custody had been “concluded under the relevant laws”, and the “convicts retained the right to appeal and other legal recourses, as guaranteed by the Constitution and law”.
Imran’s nephew Hassan Khan Niazi, who was handed into military custody in August 2023, was among the two people sentenced to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.
The military’s press wing later announced that 19 civilians convicted for their involvement in the riots were granted pardon. It said the mercy petitions of 19 convicts were accepted on “humanitarian grounds”.</p><small>2025-05-30 16:04</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/302101104ffcca5.jpg?r=210202' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914319/flood-death-toll-rises-to-117-in-nigerias-niger-state-emergency-official' target='_blank'><strong>Flood death toll rises to 117 in Nigeria’s Niger state: emergency official</strong></a><br><p>At least 117 people have died and several others are still missing after heavy flooding destroyed thousands of homes in Nigeria’s Niger state, an emergency official said on Friday.
The death toll is a sharp rise from Thursday’s figure of 21 people, Ibrahim Hussaini, head of the Niger State Emergency Management Agency, said, adding that some 3,000 houses were submerged in two communities in the north-central state.
Nigeria is prone to flooding during the rainy season, which began in April.
 
 

In 2022, Nigeria experienced its worst wave of floods in more than a decade which killed more than 600 people, displaced around 1.4 million and destroyed 440,000 hectares of farmland.
The flooding incident in Niger state occurred on Wednesday night and continued into Thursday morning, Hussaini said, with a number of people still in the water.</p><small>2025-05-30 16:02</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/05/30191310691a4a6.jpg?r=201252' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1914300/pakistani-diplomat-in-afghanistan-granted-rank-of-ambassador-amid-improving-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistani diplomat in Afghanistan granted rank of ambassador amid ‘improving ties’</strong></a><br><p>Pakistan on Friday announced its elevation of diplomatic representation in Afghanistan from Charge d’Affaires to Ambassador level as bilateral ties “move on a positive trajectory.”
Pakistan and Afghanistan agreed to upgrade their diplomatic relations by exchanging envoys — a key step towards normalising ties after years of strained relations between Islamabad and the Taliban administration in Kabul.
Ties between the two neighbouring countries had turned sour due to frequent border skirmishes and Islamabad repeatedly demanding that Kabul take action against the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) for using Afghan soil to launch attacks in Pakistan. Kabul has denied the allegations.
The recent understanding was reached during an informal trilateral meeting of foreign ministers from Pakistan, China, and Afghanistan in Beijing earlier this month. Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met Afghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi in the Chinese capital.
In a post on X, Dar said, “Pakistan-Afghanistan relations are on positive trajectory after my very productive visit to Kabul with Pakistan delegation on 19th April 2025.
“To maintain this momentum, I am pleased to announce the decision of the Government of Pakistan to upgrade the level of its Chargé d’Affaires in Kabul to the level of Ambassador.
“I am confident this step would further contribute towards enhanced engagement, deepen Pak-Afghan cooperation in economic, security, [counterterrorism] and trade areas and promote further exchanges between two fraternal countries.”
 






Although no country has formally recognised the Taliban regime since its return to power in 2021, several including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia maintain ambassadors in Kabul.  China and the UAE also host Taliban-appointed ambassadors, while Russia has agreed to accept a Taliban ambassador in Moscow.
Recent diplomatic efforts have aimed to turn the tide. In March 2025, Special Envoy for Afghanistan Mohammad Sadiq visited Kabul for the first time in over a year. His mission was followed by a high-level visit by Dar on April 19, where both sides pledged to prevent their territories from being used for terrorist activities and agreed on trade facilitation measures.</p><small>2025-05-30 15:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606962-reserved-seats-ecp-says-relief-granted-to-pti-in-july-12-verdict-unconstitutional' target='_blank'><strong>‘Reserved seats': ECP says relief granted to PTI in July 12 verdict ‘unconstitutional'</strong></a><br><p>

China signed a convention setting up an international organisation for mediation in Hong Kong that Beijing hopes will be on par with the International Court of Justice and bolster the city’s international credentials, Reuters reported.
Pakistan, Indonesia, Laos, Cambodia and Serbia were among the countries attending the signing ceremony, while representatives from 20 international bodies, including the United Nations, were also expected to join, public broadcaster RTHK said.
 






“Deputy Prime Minister [and] Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, today signed, on behalf of Pakistan, the convention on the establishment of the International Organisation for Mediation in Hong Kong,” the statement by the FO read.
Speaking on the occasion, Dar appreciated the Chinese leadership for its wisdom in developing and consistently leading efforts in establishing the IOMed and fostering a global community with a shared future, the statement added.
He added that the creation of IOMed underscores the indispensability and significance of multilateralism as the centrepiece for international peace, stability, and development.
“IOMeD also offers new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world. As one of the founding members of IOMed, Pakistan would continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,” the statement quoted him as saying.
The deputy PM underlined Pakistan’s strong commitment to the promotion of peace and security as well as development. He elaborated on the critical importance of advancing and preserving multilateralism through faithful adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as international law.
He also drew attention to India’s violation of international law through its acts of aggression against Pakistan and its unlawful holding in abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty. He also highlighted the occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and the occupied Palestinian Territories as drivers of conflict to regional peace and security.
Dar called for the resolution of the longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute under the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.
The idea for the establishment of the IOMed was one of the key outcomes of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing in April 2019. China initiated discussions for the establishment of IOMed in 2021, and invited Pakistan to join negotiations as one of its founding members, the statement added.
The organisation is open to all countries; is based on respect for the sovereignty, core interests and legitimate concerns of every country; aims to promote dialogue and trust between parties concerned based on equality; and desires inclusion of various legal systems, and their mediators, the FO said.
FM Dar visits Hong Kong’s chief executive
Separately, FM Dar, in a meeting with the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, John Lee, congratulated him on the establishment of IOMed, according to a separate statement by FO.
Noting Hong Kong’s growing significance in international mediation efforts, FM Dar highlighted the region’s role as a “global hub, linking east and west”.
The pair discussed measures to “deepen economic investment and trade cooperation” between Pakistan and the administrative region of Hong Kong.
“Hailing the launch of IOMed as a milestone inspired by President Xi Jinping’s vision, the DPM/FM noted its alignment with Pakistan’s commitment to dialogue-driven diplomacy and UN Charter’s principles,” the statement read.
The foreign minister acknowledged the chief executive and SAR government for their “impressive economic and social development strides under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ framework” while recalling Pakistan and Hong Kong’s “long-standing friendship.”
FM Dar also commended the Pakistani community in Hong Kong for strengthening bilateral ties and contributing to the city’s diversity and economy.
He also took to X to announce the meeting, describing it as “cordial and productive”.
 






Welcoming FM Dar’s visit, the chief executive expressed eagerness to enhance collaboration between Hong Kong and Pakistan further.
Says IOMed reafirms international peace, stability, development
Separately, Dar, while speaking at a ceremony in Hong Kong, said the creation of IOMed reaffirmed Pakistan and China’s shared a view of multilateralism that is the centerpiece of international peace, stability and development.
He said that IOMed offered “new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world”.
“Pakistan will continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,” Dar said.
He said that Pakistan would bring IOMed “not just a rich diplomatic experience, but also unflinching commitment to dialog, justice and fair play, excellencies”.
“Let me commit to empower this organisation, allowing it to fulfill its potential in the service of these equity and justice I thank you all,” he said.</p><small>2025-05-30 12:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/606931-pti-leaders-workers-sentenced-in-may-9-police-station-attack-case' target='_blank'><strong>PTI leaders, workers sentenced in May 9 police station attack case</strong></a><br><p>
