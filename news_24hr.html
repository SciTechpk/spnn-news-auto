After arriving in the city, Afridi addressed PTI supporters and workers at Khurshid Chowk and in other areas of the city.
CM Afridi arrived in Karachi yesterday on a four-day visit to garner momentum in the lead up to the planned February 8 protests, which would mark two years since the general elections that the opposition claims were rigged.







Sindh govt grants NOC for PTI’s Mazar-i-Quaid rally
The Sindh government issued a formal no-objection certificate (NOC) to the PTI for their rally on Sunday at Bagh-i-Jinnah, adjacent to the Mazar-i-Quaid, said Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon.
“The PTI leadership was informed in advance about permission for legal and constitutional activities,” he said.
“There are some procedures for issuing a NOC which would take time to implement, but the Sindh government fulfilled its promise.”
Memon added that the PTI is free to pursue political activities in Sindh, but noted that they would need to abide by the terms and conditions outlined in the NOC.
“The Sindh government allows all political parties to carry out activities within the ambit of the law,” he stated.
Arrival in Jamshoro
Earlier today, CM Afridi was welcomed by Sindh United Party (SUP) President Syed Zain Shah upon his arrival at the G.M. Syed Edifice.







Addressing the welcome event, CM Afridi said the politics of President Asif Ali Zardari has “ended” the politics of PPP’s Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and his daughter Benazir Bhutto.
“Now, there is Zardari’s control over Sindh,” he said.
Afridi was responding to SUP’s Shah, who had mentioned the KP CM’s remarks from Friday, in which he praised the PPP for “keeping the democratic traditions” of Bhutto and Benazir alive. He said Shah had misconstrued his remarks about PPP’s rule in Sindh.
The chief minister slammed the PPP, which he said was once the “flag-bearer of the Constitution”, for changing the basic fabric of the Constitution through the 26th and 27th Amendments.
“Whenever Imran Khan issues a call for a street movement, we hope that you will support us,” Afridi said.
“The name is Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi. Remember it,” he said, taking a jibe at those who were “scared” of his name. He further quipped that “every chowk is D-chowk” when supporters raised slogans of Islamabad’s renowned D-Chowk.



CM Afridi stressed that PTI founder Imran Khan’s struggle was for the “supremacy of the Constitution and the law, true democracy, rule of law, free media and the restoration of an independent judiciary”.
“God willing, we will not sit calmly unless we fulfil this heartfelt desire of Imran Khan,” he vowed.
PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja said Sindh had been deprived of its resources and added that “powerful quarters” have usurped provinces‘ resources.
He said Sindh has the first right to use its gas over any other part of the country, adding that no one could snatch the province’s water.
Raja pointed out that the PTI supported Sindh’s stance on the six canals issue. He maintained that PTI was not there for “politics of power” and therefore, it would not strike a deal.

In his speech, the SUP president came down hard on the PPP, accusing it of selling Sindh’s resources in lieu of power.
Shah said that for the last 79 years, either “military rule or puppet civilian rulers have ruled the country”. He said a “fake government” was installed not only in the 2024 elections but in 2022 as well, when Imran was ousted.
He demanded fresh and transparent elections and the release of all political prisoners, including Imran and Yasmin Rashid.
In a post on Facebook, the SUP demanded the release of “all political prisoners, including Imran Khan, Ali Wazir, Mahrang Baloch, and Moro [incident’s] prisoners“.



At around 2pm, the PTI shared a video, saying CM Afridi and his convoy had reached Jamshoro. Another video showed him raising slogans of “Imran Ahmad Khan Niazi”.
Hours earlier, the PTI’s KP chapter stated on X that the SUP was ready to welcome Afridi, with a stage set.







PTI Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh told reporters that Jamshoro district’s Kotri city was also among the party caravan’s stops.
In a post earlier in the day, the PTI shared a video of PTI Hyderabad Youth Wing’s “enthusiastic” members chanting slogans as they stood prepared to welcome the KP CM at the Hyderabad Insaf House.







In a post on X, the PTI detailed the KP CM’s itinerary for his trip to Hyderabad, where he is set to address the local press club, attend the Insaf Students Federation’s convention and participate in “street movement activities”.
The party agenda also listed an address to the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) in Hyderabad, though the lawyers’ body claimed it had never granted permission for Afridi to visit or address the bar.
The bar association’s general secretary had invited the KP CM in a letter dated Jan 7. However, in a press release issued on Jan 8, the HCBA clarified that its executive committee had rejected the application by a clear majority. It said the general secretary issued the letter in his personal capacity and used the bar’s letterhead without consent.
Departure from Karachi
“[We] have departed from Karachi for Hyderabad,” announced Sheikh shortly after 12pm.
“God willing, Hyderabad will also come out on the streets massively like Karachi,” Sheikh said, hailing the massive public response received by CM Afridi in the metropolis a day earlier.







Speaking to the media before departing, CM Afridi said, “We were extremely happy with the way we were welcomed in different districts of Karachi and the passion and spirit we saw in the public. We thank everyone.”
Referring to his planned public gathering at Mazar-i-Quaid in Karachi on Sunday, the chief minister said the people of Karachi had “another big responsibility”.
“We have to make this jalsa successful under all circumstances and send a message to the world that Karachi was Imran Khan’s, is Imran Khan’s, and, God willing, will remain Imran Khan’s,” he stressed.







“Toward Hyderabad for street movement [sic],” said KP Local Government Minister Meena Khan Afridi on X, sharing a picture with CM Afridi, Sheikh and Raja.







Sheikh also shared a video showing people showering petals on Afridi in a “splendid welcome” at Karachi’s Toll Plaza.







We are patriots of Pakistan: Salman Akram
Earlier on Saturday, Sheikh and Raja, along with others, gathered at Karachi‘s Hassan Square to record a statement as they began their journey to join CM Afridi’s convoy.
Umer Dar, the brother of Usman Dar who quit the party in the wake of the May 9 riots, was among those present.
Raja said: “Dear citizens of Sindh, we are present on your land today. I am standing opposite Karachi’s Hassan Square. As you know, a grand jalsa is being organised at 4:30pm tomorrow at Bagh-i-Jinnah under the shadow of Mazar-i-Quaid.
“We have come before you with Imran Khan’s message. This is a message of freedom […], of defending the water of Sindh’s farmers,” he said.
The PTI secretary general urged the public to attend the powershow and collectively raise their voice against the imprisonment of PTI leaders and the “violation of their privacy”.
“We have to tell the oppressor that ‘we are alive, you cannot erase us’,” he said, calling the PTI and its founder “Pakistan’s future”.
“We are the patriots of Pakistan, we are the sons of Sindh, we are the guardians of Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber Paktunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan,“ he said.







Plan ahead
A schedule shared by the PTI on X lists CM Afridi’s planned activities for Sunday, including the Mazar-i-Quaid gathering and a meeting with the All City Tajir Ittehad Association in Karachi.
The schedule stated that Afridi would meet Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah on Monday (Jan 12) morning.







Sindh Local Government Nasir Hussain Shah said in a statement that the authorities had decided to allow the rally at Mazar-i-Quaid.
On the other hand, a notification issued by the Korangi deputy commissioner’s office on January 8 cited “great traffic congestion” and consequent “public inconvenience” as the reasons to deny permission to hold a gathering in Qayyumabad.
Last month, CM Afridi’s visit to Lahore — also undertaken for mass mobilisation — was marked with difficulties. Subsequently, he had written a letter to Punjab CM Maryam Nawaz complaining about the treatment meted out to him during his visit.

In particular, the JF-17‘s role in the May conflict and in the skirmish with India in 2019 proved the jet’s capabilities in battle. During last year’s war with India, the Thunder was credited with destroying the state-of-the-art S-400 surface-to-missile system deployed by India at Adampur. The jet also made a strong showing at last year’s Dubai Airshow.
Earlier this week, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.
“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif told Geo News.
Here is a brief timeline of arms deals that Pakistan has finalised or is currently discussing with friendly countries since May 2025.
January 10, 2026: Iraqi Air Chief expresses ‘keen interest’ in JF-17
On January 10, Iraqi Air Force Commander Lt Gen Staff Pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi praised the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) professionalism during the May conflict and expressed interest in acquiring the battle-proven jets during a visit by PAF Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu to Iraq.
According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Lt Gen Al-Asadi expressed “interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed a keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets [and] Super Mushshak trainer aircraft”.



January 7: Saudi Arabia in talks for jets-to-loans deal
It was reported earlier this week that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert around $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources told Reuters, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.
One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and that the total deal was worth $4 billion, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.
January 6: Bangladesh expresses interest in buying JF-17s
Pakistan and Bangladesh’s air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, ISPR said in a statement.
Air Chief Marshal Sidhu briefed his Bangladeshi counterpart on the PAF’s recent advancements and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting the Bangladesh Air Force through a comprehensive training framework from basic to advanced flying and specialised courses across PAF institutions, it said.

“He also assured fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem,” it added.
“Detailed discussions were also held on the potential procurement of JF-17 Thunder aircraft.”
December 22, 2025: Pakistan finalises arms deal with Libya
Pakistan signed a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell conventional military equipment to the Libyan army last month, entering a select club of countries that export conventional arms and equipment.
A copy of the deal, which was seen by Reuters before it was finalised, listed the purchase of several JF-17 fighter jets and Super Mushak trainer aircraft.

The decision comes a day after Hayat rebuffed rumors and fake news on social media regarding the extension of holidays and maintained that schools would reopen on Jan 12.
The education minister, however, created a poll on his X account, asking people if schools and colleges should reopen from Jan 12 or 19. The majority of the users voted for Jan 19.







In the latest post today on X, Hayat wrote: “In view of the prolonged severe winter spell and the forecast of extremely low temperatures in the coming days, and on the advice of PDMA, the Government of Punjab has decided to extend winter vacations until January 19.”



Meanwhile, in a separate notification, the Punjab Higher Education Department stated that winter vacations for higher educational institutions were extended from January 10 to January 16 due to the severe weather.
“All colleges (public and private) shall re-open on Monday, January 19, 2026, resuming [the] full/normal week for all classes,” the notification, available with Dawn, read.
It added that BS 4-year programmes would continue to function and all examinations would be held as per the notified schedules of boards and universities.



The Punjab government had announced winter vacations for all public and private schools and colleges from December 22 to January 10.
Earlier in the week, a fake notification claiming to have been issued by Punjab’s School Education Department went viral on social media, spreading confusion among parents and students.
The notification claimed that “due to severe weather conditions,” the vacations had been extended until January 17, and that schools would reopen on January 19.</p><small>2026-01-10 14:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/101728322094603.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966201/new-rallies-erupt-in-iran-as-protest-death-toll-climbs-to-65-crackdown-fears-grow' target='_blank'><strong>New rallies erupt in Iran as protest death toll climbs to 65, crackdown fears grow</strong></a><br><p>Major Iranian cities were gripped overnight by new mass rallies denouncing the Islamic Republic, as activists on Saturday expressed fear that authorities were intensifying their suppression of the demonstrations under the cover of an internet blackout, with the death toll rising to 65.
The two weeks of protests have posed one of the biggest challenges to the Iranian authorities, although Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has expressed defiance and blamed the United States.
Following the movement’s largest protests yet on Thursday, new demonstrations took place late Friday, according to images verified by AFP and other videos published on social media.
This was despite an internet shutdown imposed by the authorities, with monitor Netblocks saying early Saturday that “metrics show the nationwide internet blackout remains in place at 36 hours”.







The blackout has sparked fears among activists that authorities are now violently cracking down on the protests, with less chance that the proof will reach the outside world.
According to a report by the Iran Human Rights Activists News Agency, the death toll in the protests rose to 65, Anadolu reported.
The report added that protests took place in 512 locations in 180 cities in all 31 provinces, resulting in the deaths of 50 protesters, 14 law enforcement and security officials, and one government-affiliated civilian.
Demonstrations also left dozens injured and 2,311 detained. The injuries were largely caused by pellet shots and plastic bullets, according to the report.
Authorities have not issued a statement about those killed or injured.
Amnesty International said it was analysing “distressing reports that security forces have intensified their unlawful use of lethal force against protesters” since Thursday in an escalation “that has led to further deaths and injuries”.
Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi warned on Friday that security forces could be preparing to commit a “massacre under the cover of a sweeping communications blackout”, and said she had already received reports of hundreds of people being treated for eye injuries at a single Tehran hospital.
Norway-based Iran Human Rights group has claimed that at least 51 people have been killed in the crackdown so far, but warned the actual toll could be higher.
Iranian authorities are using the “most blatant tools of repression”, prize-winning filmmakers Mohammad Rasoulof and Jafar Panahi said, pointing to the internet blackout.
“Experience has shown that resorting to such measures is intended to conceal the violence inflicted during the suppression of protests,” they added.
‘Seize city centres’
In Tehran’s Saadatabad district, people banged pots and chanted anti-government slogans as cars honked in support, a video verified by AFP showed.
Other images disseminated on social media and by Persian-language television channels outside Iran showed similarly large protests elsewhere in the capital, as well as in the eastern city of Mashhad, Tabriz in the north and the holy city of Qom.
In the western city of Hamedan, a man was shown waving a Shah-era Iranian flag featuring the lion and the sun amid fires and people dancing.
In the Pounak district of northern Iran, people were shown dancing round a fire in the middle of a highway. It was not possible to immediately verify the videos.
Reza Pahlavi, the US-based son of Iran’s ousted Shah, hailed the “magnificent” turnout on Friday and urged Iranians to stage more targeted protests on Saturday and Sunday.







“Our goal is no longer just to take to the streets. The goal is to prepare to seize and hold city centres,” Pahlavi said in a video message on social media.
‘Big trouble’
Pahlavi, whose father Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ousted by the 1979 revolution and died in 1980, added he was also “preparing to return to my homeland” at a time that he believed was “very near”.
Authorities say several members of the security forces have been killed, and Khamenei, in a defiant speech on Friday, lashed out at “vandals” and accused the United States of instigating the protests.
State TV on Saturday broadcast images of funerals for several members of the security forces killed in the protests, including a large gathering in the southern city of Shiraz.
Iran’s army said in a statement that it would “vigorously protect and safeguard national interests” against an “enemy seeking to disrupt order and peace”.
National security council chief Ali Larijani said in comments broadcast late Friday that “we are in the middle of a war”, with “these incidents being directed from outside”.
US President Donald Trump again refused on Friday to rule out new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel’s 12-day war against the Islamic Republic in June.
“Iran’s in big trouble. It looks to me that the people are taking over certain cities that nobody thought were really possible just a few weeks ago,” Trump said.</p><small>2026-01-10 14:17</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644350-pti-gets-permission-for-karachis-bagh-e-jinnah-rally-warned-against-anti-state-speeches' target='_blank'><strong>PTI gets permission for Karachi's Bagh-e-Jinnah rally, warned against 'anti-state speeches'</strong></a><br><p>

However, local authorities closed all doors and blocked people from entering the Minar-i-Pakistan ground.
The TTAP delegation is currently in Lahore to rally support for the opposition’s street movement.







PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza Malik chided the Punjab government for not even allowing the TTAP delegation to present a resolution at Minar-i-Pakistan.
Speaking to Dawn, she said the party had called its workers to go along the TTAP delegation but the “terrified Punjab government” shut the Minar-i-Pakistan ground’s gates.
Drawing a comparison, Malik said the Punjab government allegedly smashed delegation members’ vehicles, while Sindh allowed a reception for the PTI delegation led by KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.







Later, the TTAP delegation visited Mazar-i-Iqbal and the Bibi Pak Daman shrine to pay homage.
Earlier, Abbas and Achakzai held a press conference at the Lahore Press Club, along with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar and Haqooq-i-Khalq Party General Secretary Ammar Ali Jan.
Abbas, speaking at the press conference, said that the opposition movement was about “reforms, protection of the Constitution, ensuring the rights of the people, and the liberation of the downtrodden classes of society”.







He maintained that those in power were “blocking all routes to any reform”. “What avenues will people be left with otherwise?” the leader questioned.
“They will rise and revolt against the system.”
Achakzai also spoke at the press conference, reiterated his earlier stance that the “Constitution was under attack” and the country had been plunged into a crisis.
“We are the common people of Pakistan, and we love this country just as much as anyone,” he said.
“We have to collectively bring the country out of this crisis,” Achakzai said.
“We are not here to tell people that please come follow us; we are here to ask them to stand with us,” Achakzai added.
Achakzai also called on people to join the opposition’s movement, stating that, “In such a crisis, it is a sin to stay at home; you must come out on the streets”.
“It does not matter what party you belong to, which sect, if you love this country, come and sit with us,” he said.
In response to a question regarding talks with the government, the TTAP chief said that regardless of what happens, “we will not make a deal at the expense of Pakistan”.







Achakzai further reiterated that “Pakistan’s army needs to stay within its framework as other countries’ armies do.”
“Those playing with the Constitution of Pakistan are a security risk,” he said.
Achakzai said the powerful quarters “had stopped the natural process of developing leadership through suppression that led to create internal crises.”
Citing that PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif tried to take the right path of the constitution, the TTAP chief said he was sidelined and punished for a 10-year forced exile.
Hoping that history would forgive him, Achakzai said that he had asked Nawaz and would also speak to incarcerated PTI chief Imran Khan that the “next democratic government should honour all those judges with the title of ‘heroes of democracy’ — those who did not surrender to the powerful and resigned from their jobs.”
“Such judges should one day be rewarded with all privileges that they had surrendered in their endeavour to uphold the Constitution, judiciary and courts,” Achakzai said.
Responding to a question, Achakzai suggested Pakistan could request the United Nations to call a round-table conference, where Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan and China could sit together, thrash out issues and find solutions.
“No country alone can find and implement solutions,” he added.
Ammar Ali Jan also spoke at the press conference and announced that his party, along with trade unions and student organisations, was joining the TTAP for “restoration of democracy, upholding of the Constitution, and the security of the country”.







He lamented that the parliament had been “rendered dysfunctional, the judiciary ruined, and the media chained.”
Meanwhile, PTI has also issued a call to the masses to gather at Minar-i-Pakistan, where the TTAP leadership is expected to announce a formal resolution.
PTI Punjab chief organiser Aliya Hamza Malik had urged party leaders, workers and others to reach Minar-i-Pakistan and prove themselves as good hosts.
As part of today’s activities, the delegation was expected to head to the Data Darbar and Bibi Pak Daman shrines to pay their tributes.
The TTAP delegation wanted to visit Data Darbar to pay homage as soon as it entered Lahore on Thursday; however, the Punjab government blocked all roads leading to the shrine.
Therefore, the opposition alliance had kept the TTAP delegation’s movements secret, hoping they would find open routes to the shrine and Minar-i-Pakistan.
PTI Punjab also distributed pamphlets in an effort to mobilise the party’s support base for the upcoming street movement.
On Thursday, Achakzai, who led the TTAP caravan from Islamabad to Lahore, urged the nation and political parties to support its wheel-jam and shutter-down strike to mark the second anniversary of the Feb 8 elections, saying the protest would also pave the way for talks with the government.</p><small>2026-01-10 13:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10172914eab9f81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966200/denmarks-greenland-dilemma-defending-a-territory-already-on-its-way-out' target='_blank'><strong>Denmark’s Greenland dilemma: Defending a territory already on its way out</strong></a><br><p>When US Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets his Danish and Greenlandic counterparts next week, Denmark will be defending a territory that has been moving steadily away from it and towards independence since 1979.
United States President Donald Trump’s threats to seize Greenland have triggered a wave of European solidarity with Denmark. But the crisis has exposed an uncomfortable reality — Denmark is rallying support to protect a territory whose population wants independence, and whose largest opposition party now wants to bypass Copenhagen and negotiate directly with Washington.
“Denmark risks exhausting its foreign policy capital to secure Greenland, only to watch it walk away afterwards,” said Mikkel Vedby Rasmussen, a political science professor at the University of Copenhagen.
Strategic relevance
Denmark cannot let Greenland go without losing its geopolitical relevance in the Arctic territory, strategically located between Europe and North America and a critical site for the US ballistic missile defence system.
Yet it may ultimately have nothing to show for its efforts if Greenlanders choose independence — or strike their own deal with Washington.
The stakes extend beyond Denmark’s national interests. European allies have rallied behind Denmark not just out of solidarity, but because giving up Greenland would set a dangerous precedent that could embolden other powers to pursue territorial claims against smaller nations, upending the post-1945 world order.

Denmark’s foreign ministry declined to comment, but referred to joint remarks by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen on December 22.
“National borders and the sovereignty of states are rooted in international law,” the two leaders said. “They are fundamental principles. You cannot annex another country … Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.”
This week, Frederiksen said: “If the US chooses to attack another Nato country, everything stops, including Nato and the security the alliance has provided since World War Two.”

The ‘Greenland Card’
For now, the Trump administration says all options are on the table, including buying the territory or taking it by force.
Copenhagen professor Rasmussen said any discussion of whether holding on to Greenland is worth the cost has been drowned out by outrage at Trump’s threats.
“It is not part of the political debate in Denmark. I fear we have gone into patriotic overdrive,” he said.
During the Cold War, Greenland’s strategic location gave Denmark outsized influence in Washington, allowing it to maintain lower defence spending than would otherwise be expected of a Nato ally.

This became known as “the Greenland Card”, according to a 2017 report by the University of Copenhagen’s Centre for Military Studies.
But Greenland’s aspirations for self-determination have been brewing since the former colony got greater autonomy and its own parliament in 1979. A 2009 agreement explicitly recognised Greenlanders’ right to independence if they choose.
All Greenlandic parties say they want independence, but differ on how and when to achieve it.
Trump’s pressure has accelerated a timeline that was already in motion, forcing Copenhagen to spend political capital and financial resources on a relationship with an increasingly uncertain endpoint.
“How much should we fight for someone who doesn’t really care about us?” Joachim B. Olsen, a political commentator and former Danish lawmaker, told Reuters.
The financial burden
Copenhagen provides an annual block grant of roughly 4.3 billion Danish crowns ($610 million) to Greenland’s economy, which is near stagnation with GDP growth of just 0.2 per cent in 2025.
The central bank estimates an annual financing gap of approximately 800m Danish crowns to make current public finances sustainable. Denmark also covers police, the justice system and defence — bringing total annual spending to just under $1bn.
In addition, Copenhagen last year announced a 42bn Danish crowns ($6.54bn) Arctic defence package in response to US criticism that Denmark has not done enough to protect Greenland.
Some reject framing the relationship in transactional terms, pointing to Denmark’s legal and moral obligations under international law and centuries of shared history.
“We’re talking about family relations, [a] long history of relations between Denmark and Greenland,” said Marc Jacobsen, associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College. “So this is much more, it’s not just about defence and economy, it’s about feelings, it’s about culture.”
Difficult balancing act
Prime Minister Frederiksen faces a difficult balancing act, said Serafima Andreeva, researcher at Oslo-based Fridtjof Nansen Institute.
For now, Denmark has little choice but to stand firm to maintain its diplomatic credibility, but in doing so risks the relationship with the United States at a time “when Russia is an accelerating threat and being on the US’s bad side is no good for anyone in the West”.

According to a statement issued by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), PAF Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, who on a visit to Iraq, called on Iraqi Air Force Commander Lt Gen Staff Pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi.
The two met at the Iraqi Air Force headquarters, where ACM Sidhu received a guard of honour upon his arrival, it said.
“Discussions focused on enhancing bilateral military cooperation, with emphasis on joint training, capacity building and improving operational cooperation,” ISPR said.







During the meeting, ACM Sidhu “highlighted the deep-rooted religious, cultural, and historical ties between Pakistan and Iraq”.
He also “reaffirmed PAF’s commitment to support the Iraqi Air Force in training and capacity development”.
The statement said the pair “agreed to pursue joint exercises and training initiatives to strengthen interoperability”.
Meanwhile, the Iraqi air chief commended PAF’s “professionalism and technological advancement”.
The statement added that he also expressed “interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed a keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, Super Mushshak trainer aircraft”.
The commander also appreciated Pakistan for its role in regional stability, it said.
“The visit underscored the shared resolve of both air forces to further strengthen defence ties and professional collaboration,” ISPR added.
The JF-17 Thunder aircraft are jointly developed by Pakistan and China. Earlier this week, Bangla­desh had expressed an int­e­rest in the “potential pro­cu­r­e­ment” of JF-17 Thun­der aircraft.
Meanwhile, reports have emerged stating that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a mutual defence pact last year.</p><small>2026-01-10 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644334-govt-moves-to-address-water-crisis-in-islamabad-via-emergency-plan' target='_blank'><strong>Govt moves to address water crisis in Islamabad via emergency plan</strong></a><br><p>

In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), said that the two-week-long exercise — which began on Friday and is being held at the National Counter Terrorism Centre (NCTC) in Pabbi — will focus on the “counterterrorism domain, involving professional contingents from the armies of Pakistan and the US”.
Officials from both sides attended the opening ceremony, it added.



“The exercise is aimed at enhancing mutual understanding and interoperability through the sharing of counterterrorism experiences, while further refining tactics, techniques, and procedures essential for effective CT operations,” the statement said.
“Emphasis is being laid on marksmanship skills during urban warfare, as well as on understanding each other’s operational doctrines and best practices,” it added.
The military’s media wing termed the exercise of “vital importance“, stressing its role in “addressing evolving security challenges, improving professional military standards, and strengthening the capacity of both forces to operate in complex counter-terrorism environments”.
“‘Inspired Gambit 2026’ reflects the continued commitment of Pakistan and the US towards collaborative efforts for peace and stability,” ISPR added.

Dr Sidhu is currently serving as the chairman of the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP), a position he assumed in August 2023.
Under his leadership, the CCP witnessed significant institutional turnarounds in its history. Within two years, the CCP reduced its court case backlog by over 70 per cent, with 434 cases decided out of 567 pending matters, helping restore the regulator’s credibility and enforcement capacity.
During Dr Sidhu’s tenure, the CCP recovered approximately Rs1.36 billion in penalties. In contrast, its total recoveries in the last 20 years were merely Rs20o million. The regulator also imposed over Rs2bn in fresh penalties through new enforcement actions.
As CCP head, Dr Sidhu launched a renewed crackdown on cartels and market abuse, initiating major investigations and actions against cartels in poultry, sugar, edible oil, telecom, and medical services. Several of these actions were upheld by the Supreme Court and the Competition Appellate Tribunal, providing strong judicial validation to CCP’s enforcement work.
Dr Sidhu also placed strong emphasis on consumer protection and deceptive marketing enforcement. The CCP imposed significant penalties on companies operating in real estate, FMCG, education, pharmaceuticals, and automobile sectors. These included Kingdom Valley, Unilever, FrieslandCampina Engro, Al-Ghazi Tractors, Hyundai Nishat, British Lyceum and 3N Lifemed, sending a clear signal against misleading business practices.

 

A major institutional reform during his tenure was the launch of the Market Intelligence Unit (MIU), CCP’s first AI-powered surveillance arm. This initiative marked a shift toward data-driven, proactive detection.
On the market facilitation front, the CCP processed 139 mergers across 34 sectors during Dr Sidhu’s tenure. High-profile transactions included the PTCL–Telenor merger, Shell Pakistan’s sale to Wafi Energy, and several deals in financial services, energy, and logistics. The PTCL–Telenor merger order, in particular, was widely noted by stakeholders for balancing investment facilitation with competition safeguards.
The CCP also set up a centre of excellence in competition law. Its purpose was to carry out competition assessment studies to modernise the legal and regulatory framework in every sector of the economy.
According to the CCP website, Dr Sidhu holds a Bachelor’s degree in law, an LLM (Master’s in Law) in banking, insurance and international business law, and a PhD from the University of Manchester. His doctoral research was focused on the investor protection and regulation of stock exchanges in the United Kingdom, the United States and Shariah-compliant stock exchanges.
He also earned a postgraduate diploma in civil litigation from the Manchester Law Society and certifications in mortgage and financial advice from the London Institute of Banking and Finance.
With over 20 years of professional experience, Dr Sidhu has worked with insurance companies, law firms and financial institutions in the UK, as well as government ministries in Pakistan.
Prior to joining CCP, Dr Sidhu had served as a senior legal consultant at the Ministry of Law. He has also worked in the Privatisation Commission in a similar role, and remained a research associate with leading academics in UK universities.</p><small>2026-01-10 11:21</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10154514a3c8fda.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966196/pakistan-navy-successfully-tests-surface-to-air-missile-at-sea' target='_blank'><strong>Pakistan Navy successfully tests surface-to-air-missile at sea</strong></a><br><p>The Pakistan Navy conducted a “comprehensive exercise” in the north Arabian Sea, successfully firing a surface-to-air missile, the military’s media wing said on Saturday.
In a statement, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, “Pakistan Navy demonstrated its operational readiness and combat preparedness through a comprehensive exercise in the north Arabian Sea, showcasing both conventional and unmanned capabilities, as per dictates of evolving naval warfare.
“The exercise included the successful live firing of LY-80 (N) surface-to-air missile from a vertical launching system at an extended range, validating the long-range capabilities of Pakistan Navy’s modern air defence systems,” said ISPR.



It said that the missile “successfully engaged and neutralised an aerial target, demonstrating Pakistan Navy’s robust air defence capabilities”.
It added that the exercise also featured the “successful engagement” of surface targets using loitering munition, demonstrating Pakistan Navy’s precision strike capabilities.
It added that the loitering munition successfully engaged and destroyed surface targets.
“Successful open-sea trials of an unmanned surface vessel were also conducted, marking a significant leap in autonomous naval technology. The trials validated the platform’s ability to combine high-speed performance with mission-critical durability,” it said.
“Key capabilities demonstrated include extreme manoeuvrability, precision navigation and weather resilience,” it said, adding that an unmanned surface vessel offered a low-risk, high-impact solution with the stealth of a tactical interceptor.
It added that the Pakistan Fleet commander witnessed the exercise, which showcased Pakistan Navy’s ability to “employ advanced systems”.
It stated that Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf commended officers on their “professionalism and operational competence”.
He reaffirmed Pakistan Navy’s resolve to “ensure seaward defence of Pakistan and safeguard national maritime interests under all circumstances”, it added.</p><small>2026-01-10 11:10</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10142921ee6a521.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966191/jui-f-leader-succumbs-to-injuries-following-blast-in-lower-south-waziristan' target='_blank'><strong>JUI-F leader succumbs to injuries following blast in Lower South Waziristan</strong></a><br><p>SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A senior Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) leader succumbed to his injuries on Saturday morning after being critically wounded in a bomb blast near a madressah in the Wana bazaar area.
Police said on Friday that a remote-controlled improvised explosive device (IED) was planted in the Konra Cheena area near a religious seminary to target Maulana Sultan Muhammad Wazir, who was also the district president of Wafaqul Madaris al Arabia.
He was immediately taken to Dera Ismail Khan for medical treatment but breathed his last on the way.
Lower South Waziristan District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Tahir Shah Wazir confirmed that an investigation into the incident was underway. He said law enforcement agencies were examining all aspects of the incident, adding that the evidence collected from the site was being analysed to trace those responsible.
The attack on Maulana Sultan is the latest in a series of incidents targeting religious scholars and JUI-F leaders in South Waziristan, particularly in Wana and the Birmal tehsil, over the past two years.
In a statement posted on X, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman expressed his deep grief on Sultan’s death, describing him as a “devoted and courageous leader”.
“This incident is not merely an attack on an individual but an assault on the moderate, peaceful, and democratic ideology,“ he said, asserting that the JUI-F was the “flag-bearer” of these values.
“Following Bajaur, the targeting of freedom-loving and peace-advocating scholars in regions carrying deep religious significance like South Waziristan marks a deeply alarming pattern,” he said.
Fazl recalled that in March 2025, JUI-F’s South Waziristan Emir was “severely injured” in a bomb blast and “till date remains under treatment at Multan’s Nishtar Hospital”.
He further pointed out that former JUI-F district president Maulana Mirza Jan Wazir had been injured in a terrorist attack in June 2024 and had now passed away.

 

Fazl said that the targeting of a party such as the JUI-F, which believed in “moderation, tolerance and constitutional struggle”, was extremely upsetting and a moment for serious reflection.
The JUI-F chief said such attacks on scholars were “not only resounding proof of the failure and negligence of security institutions but also sinister attempts to suppress the peaceful narrative” that his party had been promoting for years across the country, including tribal areas.
“The sole crime of such scholars is that they advocate for reason over the gun, love over hatred, and peace over discord,” Fazl lamented.
He asserted that the JUI-F had always opposed oppression and violence, spoken for the supremacy of the Constitution and law, and adopted the struggle for reform and peace as its motto while remaining within the framework of the state.
“This is precisely why the party, while staying away from all shades of extremism and radicalism, is recognised as a balanced, responsible, and mainstream national political force.”
Fazl called on the “institutions responsible for national security” to recognise their constitutional and moral obligations; ensure the establishment of peace and the effective protection of scholars across the country, particularly in the tribal districts; and fulfil the demands for justice by meting out punishment to the elements involved in these tragic incidents.
He affirmed that the JUI-F would continue its struggle for peace, religious harmony, democratic values, and constitutional supremacy in the country with “full resolve, no matter how many sacrifices it must give along the way”.







Peace committee chief unhurt in blast
Separately, a suspected improvised explosive device (IED) blast targeted the vehicle of peace committee chief Qadeem Khan in the Barwand area of South Waziristan’s Servekai tehsil.

Upper South Waziristan DPO Arshad Khan said that the vehicle sustained significant damage in the attack, but the peace committee chief escaped with minor injuries.
Police sources said security personnel reached the site immediately, cordoned off the area, and shifted the injured leader to a local hospital.
The DPO confirmed that initial inquiries suggest the blast was carried out using an IED, deliberately targeting the peace committee chief. He said police were examining all aspects of the incident and had launched a search operation to apprehend the perpetrators.</p><small>2026-01-10 10:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644312-punjab-extends-winter-vacation-for-schools-colleges-amid-cold-snap' target='_blank'><strong>Punjab extends winter vacation for schools, colleges amid cold snap</strong></a><br><p>

“Such judgments do not give confidence to women to come out and report sexual violence perpetrated on them,” said Ayesha Farooq, chairperson of the government-notified Committee of the Anti-Rape Investigation and Trial Act, formed in 2021.
Despite protective legislation, 70 per cent of gender-based violence (GBV) incidents go unreported. Of those reported, the national conviction rate stands at just 5pc, with some categories as low as 0.5pc and domestic violence convictions at 1.3pc.
Senator Sherry Rehman highlighted the stark figures: in 2024, Islamabad recorded just seven convictions out of 176 reported rape cases. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported one conviction from 258 cases, Sindh reported no convictions despite 243 cases, and Balochistan recorded 21 rape cases with no convictions.
Legal precedent or social regression?
Nida Aly, Executive Director AGHS Legal Aid Cell, said, “I have never felt so disappointed in our judiciary. Judges have failed as a gender-competent forum and lost credibility.”
The SC case involved a survivor who, in 2015, was raped at gunpoint while relieving herself in the woods. She reported the incident seven months later; DNA tests confirmed the accused as the father of her child. The trial court convicted him, and the Lahore High Court (LHC) upheld the verdict. Yet at the SC, two of three judges reclassified the act as fornication, citing the complainant’s silence, lack of resistance, and absence of physical marks. Section 496-B of the Penal Code prescribes five years of imprisonment and a Rs10,000 fine for fornication.
This reasoning drew sharp criticism from the National Commission on the Status of Women, which said consent cannot be inferred from silence, delayed reporting, or lack of resistance, and urged courts to recognise the realities of trauma, fear, coercion, and power imbalances in sexual violence cases.
Ironically, after the recasting of the case, the woman was exempted from punishment.
She was reminded of another case of rape in 2024, where a woman accused her brother’s friend of rape.
“The same judge converted the conviction of rape into fornication along with arguments like “the woman showed no resistance; there were no marks of violence” and there was a two-day delay in reporting to the police.
Justice Ayesha Malik’s dissenting note arguing there was no “standardised” rulebook response by the victim emphasised consent.
Jamshed M. Kazi, UN women country representative, said such cases resonate far beyond the courtroom. “The language used and the conclusions reached shape not only legal precedent but also social attitudes, survivor confidence, and public trust in justice.”
He added, “For survivors of sexual violence, judgements can leave lasting marks on the lives of women and girls, affecting how their experiences are believed and remembered, and may discourage reporting, reinforcing silence, fear, or self-doubt among survivors.”
Another case saw the LHC dismiss rape complaints against a husband because he was still legally married, even though he raped the woman at gunpoint. The judge, while maintaining the conduct of the man to be “immoral” and “inappropriate under religious or social norms”, said it was not a crime since the marriage continued to exist legally at the time of the incident.
“The judge focused on the validity of the marriage and completely disregarded the woman’s claim of non-consent and being subjected to forced sex at gunpoint,” pointed out Aly.
Marriage, consent and the law — A dangerous grey area
While there is no explicit provision criminalising marital rape, the Protection of Women (Criminal Law Amendment) Act, 2006 removed marriage as a defence to rape. When the definition of rape was substantially revised under the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2021, no marital exemption was reintroduced.
Between 1979 and 2006, Maliha Zia, Director, Gender, Inclusion & Development at the Karachi-based Legal Aid Society, explained, marriage operated as a defence to rape because the law defined rape as sexual intercourse by a man with a woman “who is not his wife” under specified circumstances. The deliberate removal of the words “not his wife” in 2006 therefore eliminated marriage as a defence, a position that has remained unchanged since.
“The 2006 Protection of Women Act was an important step; it corrected major injustices by separating rape from zina (unlawful sexual intercourse – including adultery and fornication),” said Dr Sharmila Faruqui, a member of the National Assembly.  “But it stopped short of clearly saying that lack of consent within marriage is also rape and that silence has allowed old assumptions to survive.”
Faruqui stressed the need for judicial sensitisation, particularly at senior levels, but noted that judges are ultimately bound by the law. “When the law is unclear, even well-intentioned interpretations can go wrong,” she said. She called for legislative clarity — through a penal code amendment or another carefully considered route — emphasising that consent, grounded in dignity and equality, must remain central regardless of marital status. “Marriage was never meant to be a license for violence.”
This was endorsed by Zia, who has been among the trainers of judges who hear GBV cases. “Much work needs to be done to constantly sensitise the justice sector on women’s experiences and the trauma they go through due to sexual violence. “Many work on the assumption that the woman is most likely lying, especially if she didn’t fight or run or report straight away,” she added.
To its credit, Pakistan, under the anti-rape act of 2021 special courts were notified to look into GBV cases. To date there are 174 such courts. Unfortunately, these courts are not exclusively handling GBV cases, said Zia.
But even with this limitation, rape case convictions in Sindh rose to 17pc in 2025, from 5pc in 2020, when such courts did not exist. “Imagine how much better it could be!” According to her, in districts where there is a high caseload of GBV, courts should be exclusive, not necessarily more.

Taking media queries after a meeting with oil and gas executives at White House in Washington, Trump was asked about Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado’s offer to share her Nobel Peace Prize with the US president.
“Norway is very embarrassed with what took place,” Trump said; the Norwegian Nobel Committee is responsible for selecting the Nobel Peace Prize laureates.
“Whether people like Trump or don’t like Trump, I settled eight wars — big ones,” Trump said — a claim that he has repeated in the past.
“Some going on for 36 years, 32 years, 31 years, 28 years, 25 years. Some just getting ready to start, like India and Pakistan, where already eight jets were shot out in the air,” Trump said.
He pointed out that he arranged a ceasefire between the two countries in “rapid order without nuclear weapons”.







“I can’t think of anybody in history that should get the Nobel prize more than me, and I don’t want to be bragging but nobody else settled wars. Obama got the Nobel prize. He had no idea why. He still has no idea,” Trump said, calling former US president Barack Obama a “bad president”.
“You should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. These were major wars. These were wars that nobody thought could be stopped. President Putin called me [and] he said about two of the wars that he’s been trying to stop them for 10 years [but] he wasn’t able to do it. He couldn’t believe it,” Trump said.
“So, in theory, you should get the Nobel prize for every war you stopped. Every war was major. But I don’t care about that; I care about saving lives. I’ve saved tens of millions of lives,” he added, before recalling his Oval Office meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif in September.
“The prime minister of Pakistan came here and he made a very public statement. He said that President Trump saved a minimum [of] 10 million lives having to do with Pakistan and India, and that was going to be raging.”
Tensions between India and Pakistan had flared in April 2025 when a deadly terror attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir was, without evidence, blamed on Islamabad, which strongly refuted the allegations.
The two sides traded a series of tit-for-tat blows that ended in May with the declaration of a ceasefire by Trump, who has since repeatedly talked about his role in ending the military escalation between the two countries.

 

India has differed with Trump’s claims that the ceasefire between the two countries resulted from his intervention and his threats to sever trade talks.
Initially stating that five jets were shot down during the May conflict — albeit without specifying of which side — Trump gradually raised that number to seven in October, and then eight in November.
He has also praised Chief of the Defence Forces and Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir on several occasions, calling him a “highly respected general”, a “great fighter” and “my favourite”.</p><small>2026-01-10 07:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/101134470a33d42.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966182/fo-urges-pakistanis-to-avoid-unnecessary-travel-to-iran-amid-growing-unrest' target='_blank'><strong>FO urges Pakistanis to avoid unnecessary travel to Iran amid growing unrest</strong></a><br><p>The Foreign Office on Saturday issued a travel advisory urging Pakistani nationals to avoid unnecessary travel to Iran amid growing unrest in the neighbouring country.
In a statement, FO said, “For their safety and security, Pakistani nationals are advised to avoid all unnecessary travel to the Islamic Republic of Iran until conditions improve.”
It also advised Pakistani nationals residing in Iran to exercise “extreme caution, remain vigilant, minimise non-essential travel, and stay in regular contact with the Pakistani missions” in Tehran, Zahidan and Mashhad.







The FO also shared the phone numbers for the Pakistan embassy in the three cities; Tehran +98-21-66-9413-88/89/90/91, +98-21-66-9448-88/90, +98 910 764 8298; Zahidan +98 54 33 22 3389, +989046145412; Mashhad +98 910 762 5302, +98 937 180 7175.
Protests have taken place across Iran for nearly two weeks in a movement sparked by anger over the rising cost of living, leading to authorities imposing internet restrictions.
Iranian rights group HRANA said on Friday it had documented at least 62 deaths, including 14 security personnel and 48 protesters, since demonstrations began on December 28.
At the start of January, US President Donald Trump had warned that the US was “locked and loaded” to respond if Iran’s security forces killed protesters.
In response, in his first comments on the escalating protests, Khamenei on Friday called the demonstrators “vandals” and “saboteurs”.
In a speech broadcast on state TV, he said Trump’s hands “are stained with the blood of more than a thousand Iranians”, in apparent reference to Israel’s June war against the Islamic republic, which the US supported and joined with strikes of its own.
He predicted the “arrogant” US leader would be “overthrown” like the imperial dynasty that ruled Iran up to the 1979 revolution.
For his part, Trump issued a new warning to Iran’s leaders on Friday, saying: “You better not start shooting because we’ll start shooting too.”
“I just hope the protesters in Iran are going to be safe, because that’s a very dangerous place right now,” he added.
Earlier this week, Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson said Islamabad firmly opposed any foreign interference in the domestic affairs of other countries, including Iran, in its first public comments since protests erupted.
He said Pakistan viewed the situation in Iran as an internal matter and rejected external pressure or aggression. The spokesperson stressed that Pakistan did not wish to comment on Iran’s internal developments.</p><small>2026-01-10 07:36</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10090200e75b734.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966064/low-gas-pressure-disrupts-domestic-kitchens-amid-cold-snap-in-karachi' target='_blank'><strong>Low gas pressure disrupts domestic kitchens amid cold snap in Karachi</strong></a><br><p>KARACHI: As the mercury dropped to a single digit in the city for the first time this winter, low gas pressure in cooking stoves, running on natural gas supply from Sui Southern Gas Company Limited (SSGC), has affected a large number of households, compelling them to postpone breakfast preparation at homes for students, office workers, and others.
As winter hit the city, people have begun lighting bonfires on street corners to keep themselves warm. Gatherings at steaming soup shops have also increased.
At the same time, warm-clothing shops and stores are experiencing a sudden rush of customers.
However, citizens are experiencing a sudden fall in gas pressure with the start of the cold spell, a pattern that repeats every winter, piling misery on people.

Chilly winds, gas shortage pile miseries on citizens; SSGC concedes ‘technical fault’ affecting supply

The SSGC acknowledges the problem, saying that the utility is short of30 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) from one of their fields, which is causing low pressure in parts of the city.
Many residents have complained that the gas pressure has dropped sharply over the past three days, forcing them to turn to costly LPG cylinders as an alternative.
“I woke up to barely a whisper of gas in the morning,” grumbled a disgruntled resident of the Defence Housing Authority, adding that the pressure was so low that the tea wouldn’t even boil.
Sehrish Rehan, a resident of Saddar, said that the situation was the same every winter and she had already bought an LPG cylinder to cope with the situation.
“Expecting normal gas supply during winters in Karachi is just living in a fool’s paradise,” she quipped.
A SSGC spokeswoman told Dawn that the gas utility was presently dealing with a shortfall of roughly 30 mmcfd of natural gas from one of its production fields.
She said that the reduction stemmed from an unexpected ‘technical problem’ at that field, which had cut its output and left the utility with less gas than it needed to maintain normal distribution pressures.
The spokesperson said that because the overall supply was now tighter, some districts of the city were seeing lower-than-standard pipeline pressure.
She said to manage the crunch, the government approved load management plan prioritised domestic use.
“Fertiliser plants have been shut off and weekly industrial closures are being enforced.”
The spokesperson said that the field issue was expected to be fixed by early next week, after which the overall supply should improve.
The dip in pressure has affected household cooking, heating, and the operation of appliances that rely on a steady gas flow.
She said that the SSGC was grappling with a severe gas shortfall as winter approaches.
“Over the past five years, supply has fallen 57 per cent from 1,156 mmcfd in201819 to 660 mmcfd this year, widening the demand and supply gap,” she added.
She said that in Balochistan, winter demand spiked from 6080 mmcfd to 170180 mmcfd and the gas utility was now delivering 180 mmcfd there to keep households running in subzero temperatures.

Bessent said he had been pressing for a separate meeting on the issue since last summer’s summit of G7 leaders, and finance ministers had already held a virtual meeting in December.
India was also invited to attend the meeting, Bessent told Reuters in an interview after touring the Minneapolis-area engineering lab of RV and boat maker Winnebago Industries. He said he was unsure if it had accepted the invitation.
It was not immediately clear which other countries had been invited.
The G7 includes the United States, Britain, Japan, France, Germany, Italy and Canada, as well as the European Union, most of whom are heavily dependent on rare earth supplies from China. The group last June agreed on an action plan to secure their supply chains and boost their economies.
Australia signed an agreement with the US in October aimed at countering China’s dominance in critical minerals. It included an $8.5 billion project pipeline and leveraged Australia’s proposed strategic reserve, which will supply metals like rare earths and lithium that are vulnerable to disruption.
Canberra has said it has subsequently received interest from Europe, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.
China dominates the critical minerals supply chain, refining between 47 per cent and 87pc of copper, lithium, cobalt, graphite and rare earths, according to the International Energy Agency. These minerals are used in defence technologies, semiconductors, renewable energy components, batteries and refining processes.

Western countries have sought to reduce their dependence on China’s critical minerals in recent years, given moves by China to impose strict export controls on rare earths.
Monday’s meeting comes days after reports that China had begun restricting exports to Japanese companies of rare earths and powerful magnets containing them, as well as banning exports of dual-use items to the Japanese military.
Bessent said China was still living up to its commitments to purchase US soybeans and ship critical minerals to US firms.</p><small>2026-01-10 06:49</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/101022346378c48.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966179/11-terrorists-killed-in-2-intelligence-based-operations-in-kp-ispr' target='_blank'><strong>11 terrorists killed in 2 intelligence-based operations in KP: ISPR</strong></a><br><p>Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Saturday that security forces killed eleven terrorists in two separate intelligence-based operations (IBOs) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
In a statement, the military’s media affairs wing said the operations were carried out on Jan 8 and that the terrorists belonged to Indian proxy Fitna al Khawarij.
Fitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
It said that an IBO was conducted by the security forces in North Waziristan district on the reported presence of terrorists. During the operation, troops engaged the terrorists, and six were killed after an “intense fire exchange”.
“Another joint IBO by police and security forces was conducted in Kurram district. In the ensuing fire exchange, five khawarij were effectively neutralised,” it said.







The statement said weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against security forces, law enforcement agencies and the target killing of innocent civilians”.
It added that sanitisation operations were being conducted to eliminate other terrorists in the area, adding that the counterterrorism campaign would continue at “full pace to wipe out the menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the “professional capabilities of the armed forces” for the successful operations.
“We will continue the war against terrorism until it is completely eliminated,” the premier said, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.
He said that Pakistan’s armed forces, as well as the police, remained engaged in combat with the enemies of the country.
“The entire nation, including myself, stands shoulder to shoulder with the security forces in their unwavering resolve to protect the homeland,” he said.







President Asif Ali Zardari also lauded the efforts of the security forces, stating that “the role of security forces and law enforcement agencies in protecting the lives and property of the people is commendable”, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.
Despite record militant deaths, Pakistan saw a sharp escalation in militant violence in 2025, with terrorist attacks rising by 34 per cent and terrorism-related fatalities increasing by 21 per cent year on year, according to a report released by the Islamabad-based Pak Institute for Peace Studies.
In a press conference earlier this week, the Director General (DG) Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry shared that law enforcement agencies of Pakistan — including the army, police, Federal Constabulary, and intelligence agencies — conducted a total of 75,175 IBOs in 2025.</p><small>2026-01-10 05:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/1010253295dc3ba.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966180/venezuela-says-in-talks-with-us-to-restore-diplomatic-ties' target='_blank'><strong>Venezuela says in talks with US to restore diplomatic ties</strong></a><br><p>Venezuela said on Friday it had launched talks with the United States on restoring diplomatic ties, days after US forces deposed Nicolas Maduro as its president.
It was the latest sign of cooperation following the leftist leader’s capture and US President Donald Trump’s claim to be “in charge” of the South American country.
Officials said US diplomats were in Caracas to discuss reopening the country’s embassy, while in Washington, Trump met with oil companies over his plans to access Venezuela’s huge crude reserves.

 

The government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez “has decided to initiate an exploratory diplomatic process with the government of the United States of America, aimed at re-establishing diplomatic missions in both countries,” Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said in a statement.
John McNamara, the top US diplomat in neighbouring Colombia, and other personnel “travelled to Caracas to conduct an initial assessment for a potential phased resumption of operations,” a US official said on customary condition of anonymity.
Venezuela said it would reciprocate by sending a delegation to Washington.
Rodriguez, in a statement, condemned “the serious, criminal, illegal and illegitimate attack” by the United States and vowed: “Venezuela will continue to confront this aggression through the diplomatic route.”
Trump vows oil investments
Trump said earlier on Friday that he had called off a second wave of attacks on Venezuela due to the prisoner releases.
The US president had suggested he might use force again to get his way in Venezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves.
At a White House meeting on Friday, he pressed top oil executives to invest in Venezuela’s reserves, but was met with a cautious reception — with ExxonMobil chief executive Darren Woods dismissing the country as “uninvestable” without sweeping reforms.
Trump said foreign firms had enjoyed no meaningful protections under Maduro, “but now you have total security. It’s a whole different Venezuela.”
He also stressed that the companies would deal only with Washington, not Caracas, when exploiting Venezuela’s oil resources.
Trump earlier said that oil companies promised to invest $100 billion in Venezuela, whose oil infrastructure is creaky after years of mismanagement and sanctions.
He had earlier announced a plan for the United States to sell between 30 million and 50 million barrels of Venezuelan crude, with the money to be used at his discretion.
He promised any funds sent to Caracas would be used to buy only US-made products.
In the meantime, Washington has maintained maritime pressure on oil tankers in the Caribbean, where it seized a fifth tanker carrying Venezuelan crude — oil that would be sold, Trump said.
State-owned oil company PDVSA confirmed in a statement that one vessel was returning to Venezuelan waters, describing it as the “first successful joint operation” with Washington.
Prisoners’ release
Anxious relatives waited outside Venezuelan jails for a glimpse of their loved ones as the authorities began releasing political prisoners — a move Washington claimed credit for.
“When I heard the news, I broke down,” said Dilsia Caro, 50, waiting for the release of her husband, Noel Flores, who was jailed for criticising Maduro.
Venezuela began releasing prisoners on Thursday in the first such gesture since US forces removed and detained Maduro in the deadly January 3 raid.
Trump told Fox News he would meet next week with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, whom he earlier brushed aside as lacking the “respect” to lead Venezuela.

 

Exiled Venezuelan opposition figurehead Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia said that any democratic transition in the country must recognise his claim to victory in the 2024 presidential elections.
Maduro was proclaimed the winner of the vote, but his re-election was widely seen as fraudulent.
Gonzalez was hoping on Friday for the release of his son-in-law, who was detained a year ago in Caracas.
Protests in Caracas
Maduro was seized in a US special forces raid accompanied by airstrikes, operations that left 100 people dead, according to Caracas.
US forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, to New York to face trial on drug-trafficking and other charges.
Rodriguez insisted on Thursday that her country was “not subordinate or subjugated” despite her pledge to cooperate with Trump.
Angry protesters rallied in the streets of Caracas on Friday, demanding Maduro’s release in the latest of a daily series of demonstrations.
“We don’t have to give one little drop of oil to Trump after all that he has done to us,” said one protester, Josefina Castro, 70, a member of a civil activists’ group.
“Our Venezuelan brothers died (in the attack), and that hurts.”</p><small>2026-01-10 05:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/644251-dpm-dar-reaches-saudi-arabia-for-oics-extraordinary-moot-on-somaliland' target='_blank'><strong>DPM Dar reaches Saudi Arabia for OIC's extraordinary moot on Somaliland</strong></a><br><p>

“Paper mulberry trees, which are a major cause of allergies and have caused deaths among chronic asthma patients, have been chopped following Supreme Court’s orders which were issued in 2023. In 2025, the order was again implemented to rid the city of this invasive species which is not indigenous and is life threatening,” said Dr Malik while talking in a TV talk show after presiding over a meeting on the issue.
“It is planned not to plant non-indigenous species,” said the minister, adding: “One tree chopped is being replaced with three new saplings/trees in the capital city”.
The meeting was held in the wake of widespread criticism on the authorities in the media over cutting of thousands of grown-up trees in different locations of the capital city, including the leveling of acres of tree cover around Shakarparian.








Claims 29,000 allergy causing trees have been cut; CDA starts early tree-plantation drive in unfavourable weather

Recently, thousands of trees were chopped in Islamabad’s three areas – Shakarparian, H-8 and Chak Shahzad. In Shakarparian, at least four patches have been turned into almost a desert, where citizens stated that besides paper mulberry, other trees had also been cut down. However, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has been stating that only paper mulberry was removed.
A number of trees have been cut in H-8 area where a park is being upgraded while cutting of decades-old trees took place in Chak Shahzad for the construction of a dual carriageway for the CDA-DHA housing society.
The minister said that paper mulberry were non-indigenous trees planted in the 1960s. According to him, the felling of trees was planned after confirming from Ministry of Health that paper mulberries are a major health concern.
Meanwhile, a statement issued by the ministry said the minister was briefed on the ongoing campaign aimed at reducing the number of non-native paper mulberry trees in Islamabad. The minister reviewed and discussed measures for environmental protection and preservation of green cover in Islamabad.
The meeting was attended by Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry, CDA Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa, Secretary Climate Change Aisha Moriana and senior representatives from the CDA, Environment Protection Agency (EPA), Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) and others.
It was stated that paper mulberry was an allergenic species and a major contributor to severe allergies and asthma-related health issues among residents of the federal capital. The campaign focused on the selective removal of paper mulberry trees in areas where their concentration exceeded 90 per cent such as Shakarparian, F-9 Park and along H-8 and H-9 sectors, and replacing them with native, fruit-bearing trees and pine species.
The minister was informed that to safeguard Islamabad’s green cover, plans were underway to plant more trees against every tree removed under the campaign, ensuring that the city’s overall tree cover was not reduced.
The statement said plans for plantation included installation of mature native trees to accelerate ecological recovery. The meeting also discussed the need for enhanced coordination among EPA, CDA and the Ministry of Climate Change to ensure timely plantation activities during the upcoming spring season. Emphasis was placed on synchronised planning and execution to maximise environmental and public health benefits.
Dr Malik stressed the importance of streamlining processes and strengthening communication among relevant ministries, environmental protection agencies such as EPA and IWMB and CDA. He directed that a transparent, well-defined and streamlined mechanism be developed to ensure full compliance with existing laws, rules, and procedures related to permissions and licensing for such environmental campaigns.
Interestingly, when the official handout talked about cutting of trees in various sectors, it has no mention of the cutting of trees along Park Road at Chak Shahzad.
Tree plantation
Interestingly, in an apparent move to counter the ongoing criticism, the CDA has started a tree plantation campaign in January, which is otherwise known for frost and not ideal for plantation.
In the past, the CDA used to start tree plantation around mid-February. However, this time around it has started the campaign more than a month earlier in Shakarparian area – a step which is being criticised by public on social media, stating that nowhere trees are planted in January as Islamabad faces due and frost in this month.
The CDA officials, on the other hand, are stating that only those species are being planted which survive in January, such as Chir Pine. They said this campaign, in which 30,000 trees would be planted, would get momentum next month.

In an open letter to PM Shehbaz Sharif, Agnes Callamard — secretary general of the global rights watchdog — noted that Pakistan has been a generous host to refugees for over 40 years, but noted that its policy changed significantly once the repatriation plan was announced in Sept 2023.







“Since then, Amnesty Inte­rnational has documented a complete lack of transparency, due process and accountability in the unlawful arrests, detentions and deportations of Afghan nationals in Pakistan,” it said.
It also called on the country to create well-resourced and accessible pathways for the registration of refugees, taking proactive measures to expedite the registration of refugees particularly at risk, including but not limited to women and girls, journalists, and those belonging to minority and ethnic communities, and those facing barriers due to gender, disability, language, among others.

The ministry confirmed that not only did overall revenues decline, but consolidated profits also fell, and financial losses and budget injections increased in 2024-25 compared to the previous year. The consolidated financial results of the SOEs firmed up by Central Monitoring Unit (CMU) of the MoF came up for review before a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on SOE (CCoSOEs) presided over by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb on Friday.
The committee was informed that “during 2024-25, aggregate revenues of SOEs stood at approximately Rs12.4 trillion, reflecting a decline largely attributable to reduced profitability in the oil sector following lower international oil prices,” the MoF said.
Aggregate profits of pro­­fit-making SOEs decli­ned by 13pc to Rs709.9bn compared to Rs820.7bn last year, while aggregate losses of loss-making SOEs showed improvement, declining by around 2pc to Rs832.8bn. “Despite this improvement, the net result was an overall net loss of Rs122.9bn for the SOE sector, compared to a net loss of Rs30.6bn in the previous year,” showing more than three times increase, the MoF said.

Finance ministry cites power sector drag in FY25 performance

It was highlighted that losses remain heavily concentrated in a small number of entities, particularly in the transport and power distribution sectors. National Highway Authority and several power distribution companies continued to be major loss contributors, reflecting structural issues, high depreciation, financing costs, and the public service nature of certain operations that are not commercially viable.

 

The committee was briefed on the categorization of SOEs into green, amber and red categories based on financial sustainability, with a view to prioritising reforms and decision-making.
On fiscal support, the committee noted that total government support to SOEs increased to Rs2.078tr during 2024-25, driven mainly by higher equity injections to clear circular debt stock, while subsidies showed a modest decline. At the same time, inflows from SOEs to the government increased to Rs2.119tr, supported by higher dividends, tax rec­eipts and interest income on government lending.
The debt profile of SOEs was discussed in detail. Total SOE debt at the portfolio level increased to Rs9.57tr, comprising cash development loans, foreign re-lent loans, bank borrowings and accrued interest. The committee was also explained the quantification of unfunded pension liabilities across SOEs, estimated at around Rs2tr, which was identified as a major legacy risk requiring policy attention. Guara­ntees and other off-balance-sheet contingencies were reported at Rs2.16tr.
The meeting reaffirmed commitment to transparency and structural refo­rms while reviewing the Annual Consolidated Per­formance Report of Comm­ercial and Non-Commercial State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) for 2024-25. Director General CMU Majid Soofi presented the report and briefed the committee.
The report covered the financial and non-financial performance of SOEs, government support and fiscal flows, contribution of SOEs to the exchequer, debt profile, corporate governance and compliance status, business plan assessments, and the proposed way forward under the SOEs Act 2023.
The finance minister commended the CMU for strengthening transparency, consolidating SOE financial information on an International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) aligned basis, and establishing a comprehensive digital database to support evidence-based decision-making.
He noted that the presentation reflected meaningful progress in oversi­ght, disclosure and risk id­­­­entification, particular­­ly in areas of fiscal flows, debt mapping and unf­u­nded pension liabilities.
The minister said the report was a credible foundation for informed policy action and sustained refo­rms, and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to improving governance, enfo­rcing accountability, and placing SOEs on a path toward financial sustainability and operational efficiency.
The meeting stressed the need for enforcement of audit completion in compliance with the SOEs Act 2023, and timely transition to IFRS-based reporting by February 2026. The importance of realistic business plans, sector-specific eng­age­ment, loss reduction strategies and hard budget constraints, particularly for chronically loss-making enti­ties, was also underscored.

Citing people familiar with the matter, who spoke anonymously, Bloomberg reported that the talks are at an advanced stage and “a deal is very likely”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh last September, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.
“The expanded alliance would make sense because Turkiye’s interests increasingly overlap with those of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan in South Asia, the Middle East and even Africa,” the Bloomberg report said.
“Turkiye also sees the pact as a way of strengthening security and deterrents when there are questions over the reliability of the US, which has strong military ties with all three countries, and President Donald Trump’s commitment to Nato,“ it added.
The report noted Riyadh’s financial clout and Islamabad’s nuclear capability, ballistic missiles, and manpower, with Turkiye offering military experience and a developed defence industry, according to Nihat Ali Ozcan, a strategist with the Ankara-based think tank TEPAV.
“As the US prioritises its own interests and that of Israel in the region, changing dynamics and fallout from regional conflicts are prompting countries to develop new mechanisms to identify friends and foes,” Ozcan was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.
The information ministry and Turkiye’s defence ministry declined to comment. Saudi Arabian authorities weren’t immediately available to respond to a request for comment to the American publication.
New era
According to Bloomberg, Turkiye joining the alliance would underscore a new era in relations with Saudi Arabia.
“After turning the page on years of rancour, the countries are working to develop economic and defence cooperation,” the report read. “They held their first-ever naval meeting in Ankara this week, according to the Turkish defence ministry.”
The report noted Riyadh and Ankara’s longstanding concern over Tehran and their preference for engagement with the country rather than the use of force.
With regard to Pakistan, Bloomberg noted Turkiye’s construction of corvette warships for the Pakistan Navy and its work upgrading the Pakistan Air Force’s fleet of F-16 fighter jets.
“Turkiye is already sharing drone technology with both countries, and now wants them to join its Kaan fifth-generation fighter jet program,” the outlet added, citing an earlier report.
“The trilateral defence talks come in the wake of a cease-fire between Pakistan and India that ended a four-day military clash between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May,” Bloomberg added.
The report also acknowledged Pakistan‘s tensions with Afghanistan following border clashes, as well as Turkiye and Qatar’s efforts to broker talks, which were inconclusive.
Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage.
These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.
With Turkiye, defence cooperation remains a key pillar of bilateral relations. According to the 2023 Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report, Turkiye is Pakistan’s second-largest arms supplier, accounting for 11pc of its total arms imports.
The defence partnership has grown significantly, with joint projects such as the Milgem warships, aircraft modernisation, and drone acquisitions deepening military collaboration.</p><small>2026-01-10 02:37</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/01/10075951cb5befa.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1966117/pm-shehbaz-woos-uae-investment-in-it-sector' target='_blank'><strong>PM Shehbaz woos UAE investment  in IT sector</strong></a><br><p>

ISLAMABAD: Appre­ciating the growing interest of the UAE investors in Pakistan’s digital economy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that the government is giving special importance to business-to-business (B2B) cooperation in the fields of information technology, digital innovation, blockchain, and other emerging technologies.
The prime minister, in a meeting with a delegation of the UAE’s Sajwani Group, said that the recent high-level contacts and exchanges had increased mutual trust between the private sectors and investors of Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, providing a strong foundation for advancing bilateral cooperation.







He said that the deep, fraternal and longstanding Pakistan-UAE relations were based on mutual trust, which were heading towards more effective economic cooperation and investment.
The premier vie­wed that the recent visit of the UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan to Pakistan had further strengthened the bilateral partnership, also creating a conducive environment for promoting cooperation.
He said that the UAE’s in­­vestment and global con­­nectivity, combined with Pakistan’s human resour­c­­es and workforce, repres­e­n­­ted a highly beneficial partnership for economic growth.
PC as apex forum
Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar on Friday stressed that the Planning Commission (PC) should act as the central clearinghouse for econo­m­­ic decisions, providing guidance to ministries and divisions to maintain policy consistency and development planning, while supporting sustainable reforms to strengthen Pakistan’s economic governance.
Chairing a meeting on economic reforms, Mr Dar highlighted the historic and central role of the PC in economic and development policy-making, said a news release.
He emphasised the need to empower PC to drive strategic policy, give priorities, and oversee public investment effectively.

Petroleum Minister Ali Pervaiz Malik held a briefing session with Pakistan’s ambassadors and high commissioners posted in key foreign capitals to advance preparations and mobilise international participation for the event.
The meeting was conducted virtually with Pakistan’s missions abroad, while senior officials from the petroleum division and representatives of key public sector entities attended in person.
The session focused on aligning diplomatic outreach with national economic priorities and positioning PMIF26 as a premier global platform for investment in Pakistan’s mineral and mining sector, the petroleum division said.

PM approves national policy framework to reform gemstones sector

During the briefing, the minister explained the aims, scale, and strategic importance of PMIF26 as a forum representing a national economic priority.
He urged ambassadors and high commissioners to actively engage leading mining companies, institutional investors, financial institutions, and relevant government counterparts in their host countries to ensure broad-based and meaningful international participation.
“PMIF26 will serve as a key platform for promoting mining awareness, stimulating economic activity, and attracting sustainable investment into Pakistan’s mineral sector,” the minister said, adding that the forum would build on the “success of PMIF 2025” held last year.
He said the previous edition of the forum was organised in line with international standards and delivered tangible outcomes.
“The forum attracted participants from over 50 countries and more than 5,000 delegates, while the signing of 14 memorandums of understanding with globally recognised companies validated growing international confidence in Pakistan’s mineral sector,” he added.
PMIF 2026 is being planned as a strategic. technical conference — alongside an international gemstone exhibition — and a comprehensive resource library aimed at supporting informed as well as data-driven investment decisions.
APP adds: Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday gave in-principle approval to a national policy framework to reform the gemstones sector, align it with international standards, and create a conducive environment for foreign investment, state-run APP reported.
Chairing a high-level meeting on the country’s gemstone reserves, sectoral reforms, export enhancement, and adoption of modern technology, the prime minister directed strict adherence to timelines outlined in the policy framework this year.
He also instructed immediate steps to establish international-standard laboratories and certification systems.
PM Shehbaz ordered the establishment of two model centres of excellence for gemstones during the year and the engagement of internationally recognised experts to remove obstacles in policy implementation.
He noted that Pakistan’s gemstone exports remained negligible despite the country having immense reserves, and called for encouraging private companies, particularly young entrepreneurs, to invest in the sector.
Citing vast reserves of gemstones in Pakistan, he directed geological surveys to determine their location and value, ensuring full consultation with relevant institutions, provincial governments, and stakeholders.
The meeting was told that Pakistan’s gemstone reserves were valued at around $450 billion, while annual exports stood at just $5.8 million.
More than 5,000 companies are processing more than 30 types of precious stones in the country. Leading reserves in the country include those of emerald, peridot, ruby, topaz, and aquamarine.
The industries and production ministry has chalked out a comprehensive action plan identifying challenges and priority measures to achieve a $1bn export target over five years through reforms.
This year, the ministry will integrate the gemstone value chain into the national economy, promote local processing for value addition, adopt modern technology, launch private-sector training programmes, and introduce ‘Brand Pakistan’.
