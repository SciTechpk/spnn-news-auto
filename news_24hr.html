Thrust into prominence with the assassination of her father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and much of her family in a military coup, Hasina early on fought for democracy, but her long reign as prime minister became marked by arrests of opposition leaders, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent.
She was found guilty of ordering lethal force by a tribunal in the capital Dhaka 15 months after resigning and fleeing to India in the face of a student-led uprising that killed hundreds or more.

Joined rival to seek democracy before feud
Despite criticism of her years in power, Hasina, 78, was credited with turning around the economy and the massive garments industry of the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million, while winning international praise for sheltering Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.
But her downfall — she was ousted less than seven months after winning a fifth term as leader — was the protests that began over job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her removal.
Hasina, from her exile in India, has denied the allegations against her, saying the verdict was “biased and politically motivated”.
“I am not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal where evidence can be weighed and tested fairly,” Hasina said in a statement after the verdict.
Her state-appointed defence counsel told the court the charges were baseless.
A UN report in February said up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests, most from gunfire by security forces, and cited evidence that it was official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters and sympathisers.
The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal — a court Hasina set up to try war crimes from Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence from Pakistan — marks a dramatic turn for a political career that began when she avoided death during the 1975 coup because she happened to be in Europe.
Born in 1947 in the southwest of the country, which was then East Pakistan, Hasina was the eldest of five children.
After getting a degree in Bengali literature from Dhaka University in 1973, she gained political experience as a go-between for her father and his student followers.
Exiled to India after the coup, she returned in 1981 and was elected head of the Awami League, Bangladesh’s oldest political party and a force in the struggle for independence.
Hasina joined political foe Khaleda Zia, chief of the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.
But the alliance did not last. The bitter rivalry between the two — called the “battling begums”, using an Urdu honorific for prominent women — went on to dominate Bangladeshi politics for decades.
Hasina first led the Awami League to victory in 1996, serving a five-year term, then regained power in 2009, never to lose it again.

Claims of abuses, downfall, exile
As time went on, critics said, she became increasingly autocratic and her rule was marked by mass arrests of political opponents and activists, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings.
Rights groups warned of a virtual one-party rule by the Awami League. Hasina defended her tenure as a period of stability and development, arguing that strong, uninterrupted leadership was needed to keep Bangladesh on track.
Khaleda — herself a former prime minister and the widow of an assassinated former president — was jailed in 2018 on graft charges that her party said had been trumped up. She was freed after Hasina’s ouster.
Hasina and Khaleda accused each other of trying to create chaos and violence to jeopardise a democracy that had yet to take firm root in Bangladesh.
The once-racing economy has slowed sharply since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine pushed up prices of imported fuel and food, forcing Bangladesh to turn last year to the International Monetary Fund for a $4.7 billion bailout.
After Hasina fled the uprising in August last year with her sister on a military helicopter, jubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent presidential residence, carrying out looted furniture and televisions.
Since then, Bangladesh has been governed by an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus — a figure Hasina had attacked for years, who was convicted of graft under her government.
Her Awami League is barred from contesting parliamentary elections to be held in early February.

The resolution for a vote of no confidence against Haq was submitted to the Assembly secretariat on Friday afternoon. The resolution was signed by 25 lawmakers, 23 from the PPP and two from the PML-N.
Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar is chairing today’s session. Apart from PPP and PML-N members, Leader of the Opposition Khawaja Farooq Ahmad from the PTI is also in attendance.
Shortly after the session began, PM Haq also arrived in the house. He went up to Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore — the PPP’s nominee for the top office and his likely replacement — and exchanged greetings with him.
He also delivered a speech, after which he left the assembly.

The requisite number
Meanwhile,  the PPP appears poised to elevate its regi­onal sec­retary general, Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, to the coveted office.
On Sunday, two PTI lawmakers, said to be from the party’s forward bloc — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur, raising its own support base to 29.
In October, the PPP’s ranks in the AJK Legislative Assembly had swelled to 27 after 10 lawmakers from the PTI forward bloc joined the party.
The AJK Legislative Assembly has 52 members, and to achieve a simple majority, a party requires the support of 27 members.
Under the AJK Constitution, a vote of no confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution. So, if the motion succeeds, which seems to be the likely scenario, Rathore would stand elected as the new prime minister, fourth in the sitting assembly since its installation in 2021.
Changing PMs
With almost six months remaining in the assembly’s term, upon his election, Rathore will be the fourth prime minister in AJK in four years.
In August 2021, the PTI picked Abdul Qayyum Niazi as the premier after he was named for the slot by then-PM Imran Khan. Niazi had secured 35 votes against the joint opposition candidate Latif Akbar, who bagged only 15 votes, in the 53-seat house.
After nine months, Niazi resigned from the position and was replaced by PTI regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas.
In April 2023, Tanveer was disqualified by the full court bench of the AJK High Court from being a member of the legislative assembly for contempt. He was then replaced by Haq.</p><small>2025-11-17 11:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/634032-tarar-takes-notice-of-fake-video-targeting-journalist-benazir-shah' target='_blank'><strong>Tarar takes notice of fake video targeting journalist Benazir Shah</strong></a><br><p>

“Deeply saddened by the accident in Madina involving Indian nationals. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones,” the prime minister wrote on X.
 






“I pray for the swift recovery of all those injured. Our embassy in Riyadh and consulate in Jeddah are providing all possible assistance,” he added.
Indian media reported dozens had potentially been killed in the incident, though officials have yet to provide a toll.
Transporting worshippers around Saudi Arabia’s holy sites has frequently proven dangerous, particularly during the Haj, when roads can be chaotic with buses creating interminable traffic jams. Millions also visit Saudi Arabia for umrah, which happens outside of the Haj period.
In March 2023, a bus ferrying pilgrims to Makkah burst into flames after a collision on a bridge, killing 20 people and injuring more than two dozen others.
And in October 2019, some 35 foreigners were killed and four others injured when a bus collided with another heavy vehicle near Madina.
Pilgrimages are an essential component of Saudi Arabia’s burgeoning tourism sector that officials hope will help diversify the kingdom’s economy away from fossil fuels.
The Gulf kingdom is also home to more than two million Indian nationals who have long played a pivotal role in its labour market, helping construct many of the country’s mega-projects while sending billions of dollars in remittances back home each year.
Saudi Arabia and India have fostered a close relationship for decades.
India’s rapidly developing economy relies heavily on petroleum imports, with Saudi Arabia ranked as its third-largest supplier, according to the Indian foreign ministry.</p><small>2025-11-17 09:58</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17125648b089c37.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955626/information-ministry-debunks-zalmay-khalilzads-claim-of-isis-k-commander-being-killed-in-punjab' target='_blank'><strong>Information ministry debunks Zalmay Khalilzad’s claim of ISIS-K commander being killed in Punjab</strong></a><br><p>The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MoIB) on Monday debunked a claim by former United States special envoy for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad, who had alleged that a ISIS- Khorasan (ISIS-K) commander had been killed in Punjab.
On Sunday night, Khalilzad said on social media platform X, “Good news from #Pakistan: Reportedly a senior ISIS-K commander Burhan, also known as Zaid, was killed in Patak part of Akhtarabad city in Punjab.”
 






In response to the post, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting’s official fact-checking account said the incident in question took place in Habibabad in Kasur district on March 5 and not in Akhtarabad as claimed.
 






“The victim, Burhan, was killed by a dacoity/robbery-related incident or a case of personal enmity, not a counter-terror operation,” the ministry said, adding that a first information report (FIR) of the incident was also registered on March 6 at the Saddar Pattoki police station.
It said that Burhan was living with his father-in-law, Shah Muhammad, near a fruit market in Habibabad.
“There is no presence of ISIS/Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) elements in Punjab, Pakistan, according to credible security assessments,” the ministry said.
“There is no evidence linking Burhan to ISKP nor was he a commander,” the ministry said, adding that Khalilzad’s post twisted a “purely criminal or personal dispute into a terrorism-linked killing, creating a false impression of ISKP activity in Punjab”.
“The case remains a criminal matter, not related to militancy or organised terror groups,” it added.</p><small>2025-11-17 09:53</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17112307a4423e3.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955615/2-more-judges-of-federal-constitutional-court-sworn-in' target='_blank'><strong>2 more judges of Federal Constitutional Court sworn in</strong></a><br><p>Two more judges of the Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) were sworn in on Monday.
FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan administered the oath to Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Arshad Hussain Shah at a ceremony held in Islamabad. In their oath, both judges vowed to uphold the Constitution.
“I do solemnly swear, I will bear true faith and allegiance to Pakistan, that as a judge of the FCC of Pakistan, I will discharge my duties and perform my functions honestly to the best of my abilities and faithfully in accordance with the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the law,” the judges said in their oath.

Other members of the FCC,  Justices Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Aamer Farooq, Ali Baqar Najafi and KK Agha, were sworn in over the weekend.
A source had previously told Dawn that Justice Shah was appointed after it emerged that Supreme Court’s Justice Musarrat Hilali was not willing to join the FCC.
President Asif Ali Zardari had appointed Justice Aminuddin as the chief justice of the FCC last week, after giving his assent to the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
The initial strength of the FCC was determined through a presidential order, while any fu­­ture increase in the number of judges will require parliamentary approval through an act of Parliament.
According to government officials, the FCC’s creation aims to reduce the SC’s workload, ensure timely adjudication of constitutional cases and strengthen judicial independence and credibility.
The FCC formally commenced on Friday after its chief justice and four judges took the oath. The newly formed apex constitutional forum begun work under makeshift arrangements, as its permanent premises have yet to be finalised.
The oath-taking was overshadowed by a boycott from five senior judges Islamabad High Court, as questions were raised over what principle, if any, guided appointments to the FCC.
Critics pointed out that if seniority was the yardstick, none of the appointees — except Justice Aminuddin — were senior to members of the now-defunct Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court, several of whom were ignored.
Plea against FCC filed in SHC
Meanwhile, a petition against the formation of the FCC was filed in the Sindh High Court by Barrister Ali Tahir. The Federation of Pakistan through the Ministry of Law and Justice was named as a respondent in the plea.
“All judges (so called) of the FCC (under challenge as unconstitutional in this instant petition)”, including FCC Chief Justice Aminuddin Khan, were also named as respondents.
“The petitioner seeks to challenge attempts to do away with the constitutional jurisdiction of the superior judiciary” through the 27th Amendment, the petition said.
It said that the FCC, “if permitted to proceed, would fundamentally alter the constitutional framework, destroy the independence of the judiciary, violate the doctrine of separation of powers, and extinguish the citizens’ right of access to justice and judicial review guaranteed by the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973”.
“It is obvious that the executive wanted to build a tailor-made court for himself,” the petition said.
The petitioner requested that the 27th Amendment be struck down and set aside in its entirety, and direct that no part, provision, rule or notification made under the amendment shall have no legal effect.
The petitioner also urged the court to issue a writ of quo warranto against the respondents, and demanded that the impugned provisions of the amendment relating to the creation of the FCC or any appointments or tenures that curtailed “ordinary judicial assignment and independence” be declared unconstitutional and void.
The petitioner directed that the plea be placed for hearing before a regular full bench of the SHC constituted of judges that were not appointed or otherwise beneficiaries of the 27th Amendment, and that no bench or tribunal created under this amendment should decide on its constitutionality.</p><small>2025-11-17 09:39</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17131147764cd81.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627/bangladeshs-ousted-pm-hasina-sentenced-to-death-for-students-crackdown' target='_blank'><strong>Bangladesh’s ousted PM Hasina sentenced to death for students crackdown</strong></a><br><p>A Bangladesh court sentenced ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year.
The ruling comes months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February.
Hasina’s Awami League party has been barred from contesting and it is feared that Monday’s verdict could stoke fresh unrest ahead of the vote.
The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court located in the capital Dhaka, delivered the guilty verdict amid tight security and in Hasina’s absence after she fled to India in August 2024.

Hasina, 78, defied court orders that she return from India to attend her trial about whether she ordered a deadly crackdown against the student-led uprising that ousted her.
She called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”.
“The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,” Hasina said in a statement issued from hiding in India. “They are biased and politically motivated. “
The verdict can be appealed in the Supreme Court.
But Hasina’s son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed, told Reuters on the eve of the verdict that they would not appeal unless a democratically elected government took office with the Awami League’s participation.

Worst violence since 1971
During the trial, prosecutors told the court that they had uncovered evidence of her direct command to use lethal force to suppress a student-led uprising in July and August 2024.
According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most of them by gunfire from security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence.
Hasina was represented by a state-appointed defence counsel who told the court that the charges against her were baseless and pleaded for her acquittal.
Ahead of the verdict, Hasina dismissed the accusations and the fairness of the Tribunal proceedings, asserting a guilty verdict was “a foregone conclusion”.
Bangladesh has been tense ahead of the verdict, with at least 30 crude bomb explosions and 26 vehicles torched across the country over the past few days. There have been no casualties, however.</p><small>2025-11-17 09:34</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/17112339e7c14c1.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955613/info-minister-takes-notice-of-fake-video-of-journalist-benazir-shah-terms-it-highly-condemnable' target='_blank'><strong>Info minister takes notice of ‘fake’ video of journalist Benazir Shah, terms it ‘highly condemnable’</strong></a><br><p>Information Attaullah Tarar took notice after journalist Benazir Shah said that an account he followed on the social media platform X had made an AI-generated video of her. He asserted that nobody had the right to make “fake videos” or try to harass journalists by defaming them.
Shah posted on Sunday on X that an account on the social media platform followed by Tarar had “made an AI video of me”.
“But as we’ve said before, we’ll say it again: #AttacksWontSilenceUS,” she added. Her post was in response to the video in question, shared by an account called PakVocals. The description with the clip claimed that it was a “leaked video” of Shah “dancing in a club in London”.
Subsequently, Tarar responded to Shah on Sunday night, saying, “Totally unacceptable and highly condemnable. Notice taken, please.
“Nobody has the right to make fake videos and then disseminate them or try to harass any journalist by defaming them. I follow more than 1,900 accounts. I do not condone the behaviour of this account and also assure you that action will be taken,” the minister said.
 






Later, Shah said she appreciated the minister taking the matter seriously. However, she said that she did not want to pursue a case under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) through the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) as “doing so would lend legitimacy to a law and an institution that have been used to harass journalists, silence private citizens, and suppress dissent”.
“If the minister and his government are serious about ensuring safety for journalists and citizens, they should scrap Peca and the NCCIA and begin a genuine consultation process to draft legislation that truly addresses journalists’ concerns,” she said.
 






Journalists also rallied behind Shah as the matter garnered attention on social media.
“Deep fake, condemnable, culpable crime, should be investigated and the one who doctored the video must be brought to the court of law. My sincere support to fellow brilliant journalist Benazir Shah who always stands by facts, neutrality and truth. More power to you. Stand firm, please,” posted journalist Zahid Gishkori on X.
Journalist Asad Ali Toor said he was sure that the person in the video was not Shah. He said he was also certain that the account that shared the video was a “pro PML-N account followed by pro PML-N journalists and the minister”.
“This is [a] shameful and disgusting campaign, and I strongly condemn it. At the same time, I want to say all political parties have their own pool of dirt which they time to time launch against their critics. Shameful,” he commented.
Journalist Meher Bokhari, referring to the video in question and the accosting of Geo News anchor Shahzeb Khanzada in a separate incident, called for more respect.
“This is not who we were meant to become. Whether it’s PTI supporters harassing Shazeb Khanzada or or PML-N supporters circulating fake AI videos of Benazir Shah, none of it reflects who we are.
“Both are hardworking journalists, people who have dedicated their lives to informing the public despite constant pressure. Sure, nothing makes sense here anymore, but the least we can do is hold on to our values and our respect for one another. Character is what you choose to keep intact when everything around you falls apart,” she said.

Addressing the post-match ceremony after his side completed a series sweep against Sri Lanka on Sunday, Pakistan’s One-day International captain hailed a good day for cricket in the country.
“We’ve now won two consecutive [ODI] series,” said Shaheen, referring to the team’s victory against South Africa a week earlier, after Pakistan eased to a six-wicket victory over Sri Lanka in the third and final ODI in Rawalpindi.
“Today Pakistan Shaheen also won, and more importantly they against our neighbours … it makes you happy that all the youngsters performed,” he added when asked to comment on Pakistan Shaheens’ eight-wicket thrashing of India ‘A’ in Qatar.
“Here [in Pindi] as well, everyone chipped in across the three matches, everyone played their best cricket which is why we won.”
Pakistan’s bowlers set up the victory for the hosts after they shot down Sri Lanka for 211 before Mohammad Rizwan struck a second half-century on the trot settled the chase.
“[Having in-form] senior players at the crease gives an altogether different outlook,” Shaheen said. “Rizwan and Babar [Azam] have always been the backbone of the team and have always performed. Rizwan finished both matches, living up to his role as a senior player.”
The second ODI had seen Babar end an 83-inning century drought across all formats and Shaheen was happy that the batting mainstay was back among the runs.
“It wasn’t the first time he’s made a hundred,” said Shaheen. “But it’s important for Pakistan cricket when your main batter gets big runs. He was working on it throughout, he’s been fighting, he kept his focus and reaped the rewards.”
Shaheen said Pakistan will look to keep up the momentum as they head into the tri-nation T20 series against Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe that starts from Tuesday.
“We will give our best,” Shaheen said. “The team is performing well and all the players are doing well, which is good for Pakistan cricket. As a team we’re ready for the challenge.”</p><small>2025-11-17 09:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/1712371786dd629.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955622/mustafa-kamal-confident-local-govts-will-be-addressed-in-next-constitutional-amendment-slated-for-coming-months' target='_blank'><strong>Mustafa Kamal confident local govts will be addressed in next constitutional amendment slated for ‘coming months’</strong></a><br><p>Health Minister Mustafa Kamal expressed confidence on Monday that the changes pertaining local governments sought by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) would be addressed in the next constitutional amendment slated for the “coming months”.
Kamal made the remarks while addressing a press conference in Karachi, less than a week after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was enacted into law amid protests by the opposition and other quarters.
When the 27th Amendment was tabled in the National Assembly on Nov 11, Kamal had referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of the 28th Amendment.
Speaking to the media today, he said that changes were initially pitched to be included in the 26th Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year.
Kamal then thanked other parties, including the ruling PML-N, and “individual friends from the PPP” and “many friends from the PTI” for “vocally backing” the MQM-P’s changes related to local governments.
He said the proposed changes were extensively discussed for over six hours in the parliamentary standing committee meeting called to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment.
“We had enough numbers […] We had won our case in the standing committee. We had the numbers. We had the support of the PML-N and others,” he maintained. “But the PPP was not ready to support the [inclusion of] our bill [on local governments] in the 27th Amendment, which resulted in a deadlock,” he added, clarifying that he was not making any allegations in saying so.
Kamal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the ruling PML-N then requested the MQM-P to postpone its proposed changes once again as the 27th Amendment included crucial provisions pertaining to the Pakistan Army and the judiciary.
“We were assured that they all supported the bill. They asked for one more chance, assuring that this would be included in the next amendment,” he added.
Subsequently, the MQM-P decided to accept the request in the “larger interest of the country,” he said.
Stressing the importance of changes pertaining to local government, Kamal further stated: “In Pakistan, […] in the coming months, this constitutional amendment will be introduced in the assembly and get approved, and the people will get resources at their doorstep.”
Kamal also referred to the Punjab As­­sembly unanimously passing a resolution last month, calling for an amendment to Article 140-A of the Constitution to ensu­­re empowerment and protection of local bodies, along with mandatory and timely elections for effective governance. He deemed the development a success of the MQM-P.

Can the 11th NFC Award rewrite the script?</strong></a><br><p>The inaugural session of the newly constituted 11th National Finance Commission (NFC) has been delayed, yet again, amid a downward revision in the economic growth forecast for the current fiscal year.
Established on August 22 to give a fresh award for the sharing of federal divisible resources among the Centre and provinces. The first meeting of the commission was called for Aug 27, which was first postponed to Aug 29 and then to November 18.
The maiden session was expected to spotlight the debate on Pakistan’s resource-sharing framework, for which the federal government had summoned provincial representatives, even as the 27th Constitutional Amendment raised fresh questions about the future of fiscal federalism.
Both developments have revived a long-delayed conversation: why hasn’t the NFC delivered for a strengthened social contract and improved public service delivery?
 


It has been over 15 years since the 7th NFC Award — a landmark in its time — reshaped Pakistan’s revenue-sharing model. That award tilted decisively toward a needs-based approach, giving dominant weight to population, poverty, and backwardness. But while it addressed the equity gap, it fell short of recognising provincial efforts in revenue mobilisation or expenditure efficiency. The model served its time; today, however, it needs refinement for betterment in the true spirit of the 18th Amendment.
Lessons from Awards past
The 7th Award gets fairness right but efficiency wrong. It treats a rich province collecting more tax as “efficient,” even if it’s barely trying. The formula rewards size, not effort; capacity, not commitment. With little weight given to tax effort, provinces have no real incentive to strengthen their own revenue systems.
It is in this context that Pakistan’s NFC framework must shift — from overwhelming needs-based distribution to efficiency-seeking sharing of resources. The NFC should evolve beyond a tool of political consensus into a mechanism that promotes fiscal discipline and incentivises provinces to collect and spend resources efficiently.
This requires rebalancing the formula through three changes:

adjusting the weights of existing indicators
revising their composition
learning from good examples from abroad to include performance-based
indicators

Before turning to specific proposals, it is worth noting that other countries in the region have progressively updated their frameworks to reflect changing macroeconomic, poverty, inequality, and environmental realities. Each new commission redefines priorities, blending needs and performance in a way that keeps the formula dynamic and relevant — a practice Pakistan and its federating units can learn from.
Proposals for 11th NFC Awards
A more judicious resource distribution formula must move away from narrow, static parameters such as population — a measure based on outdated census data that ignores migration and demographic shifts. Instead, Pakistan should start introducing globally recognised efficiency indicators.
The reform trajectory could begin by:

Reducing the weight of population by 15 per cent in the 11th NFC awards, and by another 15pc in the next NFC, bringing it down to 52pc
Replacing absolute tax revenue with tax effort, measured as the
difference between actual tax collected and estimated tax potential,
and doubling its weight to 10pc.
Transforming the poverty indicator from absolute to relative poverty,
using “poverty distance” — the gap between a province’s poverty rate
and the province with the lowest incidence.
Introducing new indicators — forest cover and air quality index, with
a 10pc weight, to encourage responsible provincial spending and
sustainable development.

Not an impossible task
Many a time, negotiations have stalled, leading to interim awards that favoured larger provinces. Over time, this has deepened resentment among smaller federating units and the erstwhile Fata. Citizen feedback highlights key concerns that must be addressed if Pakistan is to move toward a more efficient and equitable formula.
First, there is a trust gap between the federal government and provinces. Participants frequently cited that even existing formulas, such as the AGN Qazi formula — a formula for the calculation of the net hydel profit to the provinces — were not implemented in letter and spirit. Provinces argue that it is futile to debate new formulas when past ones remain only partially executed.
Second, provinces remain wary of the federal narrative surrounding the 18th Amendment. Statements from federal officials suggesting that the current NFC framework “weakens the federation” have caused unease.
Third, everyone’s guilty. The federal government has been struggling to expand the resource pie. Meanwhile, provinces have sat back, collecting their shares instead of deepening their own resource base or spending smarter. And now, they’re doing to districts what Islamabad did to them; centralising power and budget instead of passing it down through efficient local governments.
 
 

Finally, the NFC is toothless; incapable of reform, decision-making, or acting on evidence. Pakistan needs to give constitutional cover to an empowered fiscal body that is technical, not tactical. Unlike other economies, where finance commissions have research muscle and legally binding recommendations, here every NFC starts from scratch with no data, continuity, or political will, often resulting in a deadlock.
The moment for fiscal reform is now
Pakistan’s fiscal federalism is overdue for a reboot, and citizen voices must drive the change. The 9th and 10th NFC Awards never happened, leaving the 7th in force far past its expiry. With the 11th NFC and the 27th Amendment on the table, Pakistan has a rare chance to rethink fiscal federalism. Revisiting the formula is more than a technical requirement; it tests the federation’s maturity. A modern, transparent, performance-based system would build trust, make decentralisation meaningful, and shift the focus from entitlement to effort, from needs to results.
Before the 12th NFC, Pakistan must move beyond mere arithmetic and confront deeper structural questions: Are provinces ready for a performance-based, equitable formula? Can the NFC evolve from a consensus forum into a mechanism that ensures timely, evidence-based decisions?
Breaking the status quo will take time, but citizen voices must drive the debate. Engaging media, civil society, academia, and think tanks can make reforms credible and forward-looking. Fiscal federalism must deliver sustainable development.

In a statement, the FO said Dar would be leading the delegation at the summit, being held on November 17-18, at the invitation of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Vladmirovich Mishustin.
“The CHG will be attended by the heads of government of Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the vice president of Iran, and the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India,” the statement said.
 






Further, in addition to SCO member states, the heads of the governments of Mongolia, Bahrain, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait and Turkmenistan will also be attending the meeting alongside those of regional/international organisations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), Euro Asian Economic Union (EAEU), Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and Democratic Socialists of America (DSA).
“In his address to the SCO CHG, the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s perspective on important regional and global issues as well as ways to strengthen the organisation for the benefit of the SCO region,” the statement added.
Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with the leaders of other SCO countries on the sidelines of the summit, the FO added.
The CHG is the second-highest decision-making institution in the SCO and provides guidance in the areas of economy, finance, trade, connectivity, commerce and socio-economic cooperation, including the organisation’s budgetary matters, according to the FO. The SCO CHG adopts joint communiqué, statements and important decisions.
The SCO held a summit in Tianjin, China from August 31 to September 1 earlier this year.

The video, which has been circulating on social media since Sunday night, shows a man following Khanzada in what appeared to be a clothing store. In the video, the man told the journalist he should be “ashamed” of “what he has done against Imran” and his wife. For his part, Khanzada — who appeared to be present with his family — did not engage with the man and walked away.
 
 

While the man did not provide an explanation for the allegations he was levelling against the journalist, PTI’s Shahbaz Gill shared an old clip of Khanzada talking about the Iddat case, filed against Bushra Bibi and Imran by her former husband Khawar Maneka, on his show. The case pertains to Imran and Bushra Bibi’s marriage during the latter’s Iddat period.
“This is the filth Shahzeb did,” he said. He added that if the condemnation had come from the media fraternity, then the situation would not have reached this point, an apparent reference to the harassment of the journalist.
 






The incident comes two days after The Economist published an article covering Imran’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as premier, which the party has termed recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary.
Many on social media came to Khanzada’s defence, terming the incident “condemnable”.
Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the incident was “yet another filthy reminder of the mob mentality Imran Khan has carefully bred within PTI”.
“This crowd does not [have] manners, they were never taught dignity, decency or basic humanity. Their entire existence feeds on confrontation, chaos, and bullying. This is not politics, it is brute thuggery masquerading as activism. They know that they can only survive when society is torn down,” said the minister.
 






PPP leader and Sindh Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said he strongly condemned the incident.
“You can certainly disagree, but do so within the bounds of decency and respect. Your actions have not affected Shahzeb Khanzada’s honour, but rather [of] those who taught you this behaviour,” he said.
 






Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Senator Faisal Subzwari said the incident was “another glimpse into the filth that had taken root in politics over the past decade”.
“When national leaders praise the abuse brigade and give bad names to everyone except their own kind, then these lamentable traditions take root,” he said.
 






Journalist Waseem Abbasi called the incident harassment, adding that this was “no crusade”.
 






“This is disgusting and utterly condemnable,” said Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousufzai.
“Khanzada is an honourable man and an outstanding journalist. This incident exposes the ugly face and behaviour of an intolerant cult,” he said.
 






Journalist Asad Ali Toor termed the incident a “shameful campaign” against Khanzada.
“I still maintain that Shahzeb in that interview completely exposed Khawar Maneka that his ‘Iddat’ case is a politically motivated case and he is just a disgusting proxy,” he said, adding that the PTI should be thanking him, rather than harassing him.
 






Journalist Matiullah Jan said that Imran’s supporters should learn that harassing a journalist in this manner in the presence of his family members was condemnable.
“There are a hundred civilised ways of protesting. Shahzeb Khanzada has left the government and its ministers speechless on many occasions,” he said.
 






Journalist Zahid Gishkori, who has previously worked with Khanzada, said it was “extremely painful to see a strange man” harassing the latter and his family, adding that he stood with the journalist during this difficult time.
 






“This is unacceptable and outright shameful. Harassing someone in a public place is not freedom of expression, it’s intimidation and thuggery,” said sports journalist Faizan Lakhani.
“Shahzeb Khanzada is a respected, credible journalist, and this behaviour towards him is shameful. This incident exposes the true face of an intolerant society,” he said.
 






“I strongly condemn the worst kind of fascism and the targeted harassment being inflicted on Shahzeb Khanzada by zombies of a political party,” said journalist Asma Shirazi.
 






The Pakistan Daily founder Hamza Azhar Salam said the PTI had not taken Khanzada to court for defamation because “it knows they will be taken to the cleaners”.
“Instead, PTI workers unleashed to harass Pakistan’s most credible journalist in front of his family. We stand by Khanzada and condemn this campaign of harassment,” he said.
 






Meanwhile, Khanzada responded to PTI leader Gill on X, accusing him of lying.
“This is classic Shahbaz Gill. When he was a minister, he was caught lying several times and here again he is lying,” he said, adding that he was responsible for reporting court proceedings.
“These trolls actually don’t care about facts even if they go in favour of Imran Khan,” he said.
 






“We didn’t just expose the Iddat case but also spoke for Shahbaz Gill, condemned his torture under custody and the use of the outdated treason law against him even when his own party and leaders were refusing to speak for him,” he said.
 






The PTI founder and his wife — who are both currently under arrest — were convicted by an Islamabad court in the Iddat case and sentenced to seven years in jail each on Feb 3, 2024, five days before the general elections.
In July the same year, they were acquitted in the case but then arrested on charges related to the sale of state gifts.</p><small>2025-11-17 05:08</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633980-rathore-poised-to-become-new-ajk-pm-as-no-confidence-vote-against-haq-takes-place-today' target='_blank'><strong>AJK Assembly session begins to vote on no-confidence motion against PM Haq</strong></a><br><p>

Trump’s post on his Truth Social came after House Speaker Mike Johnson said earlier that he believed a vote on releasing Justice Department documents in the Epstein case should help put to rest allegations that Trump had any connection to Epstein’s abuse and trafficking of underage girls.
“House Republicans should vote to release the Epstein files because we have nothing to hide,” Trump wrote on Sunday night.
“And it’s time to move on from this Democrat hoax perpetrated by radical left lunatics in order to deflect from the great success of the Republican Party, including our recent victory on the Democrat ‘shutdown’.”
 






Although Trump and Epstein were photographed together decades ago, the president has said the two men fell out before Epstein’s convictions.
Emails released last week by a House committee showed the disgraced financier believed Trump “knew about the girls,” though it was not clear what that phrase meant.
Trump, who has recently dismissed the Epstein files as a Democratic smear campaign, has since instructed the Department of Justice to investigate prominent Democrats’ ties to Epstein.
The battle over disclosure of more Epstein-related documents, a subject Trump himself campaigned on, has opened a rift with some of his allies in Congress.
Many of Trump’s most loyal supporters believe the government is withholding sensitive documents about Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide in jail in 2019, that would reveal the late financier’s ties to powerful public figures.
Trump late on Friday withdrew his support for US Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, long one of his staunchest supporters in Congress, following her criticism of Republicans on certain issues, including the handling of the Epstein files.
US Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat and an original sponsor of the petition calling for a vote on the files’ release, said on Sunday that he expected more than 40 Republicans to vote in favor.
Republicans hold the majority in the House, with 219 seats, versus 214 for Democrats.</p><small>2025-11-17 04:47</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/170943048d97280.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955518/hiv-found-in-children-previously-treated-at-hospital-in-karachis-site-town' target='_blank'><strong>HIV found in children previously treated at hospital in Karachi’s SITE town</strong></a><br><p>• Local political activists put their heads together after first case of infection confirmed in 18-month-old girl
• Over 15 HIV cases found after Valika Hospital administration persuaded to screen children treated there
• Govt official says health dept ‘focusing’ on treatment and prevention
KARACHI: A serious health crisis, involving children as young as one year, is brewing in the impoverished and densely-populated neighbourhood of SITE Town where more than 15 children have been diagnosed with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) over the past few weeks with at least two fatalities during the same period while the number of the affected children is still rising.
At the centre of the crisis is the Kulsum Bai Valika Social Security SITE Hospital, commonly known as Valika Hospital, in SITE Town, where the children treated for different health complaints over the past few months have been diagnosed with HIV.
It all emerged recently when people of the neighbourhood with the help of their local government representatives and political leadership of the locality took a solid stand when they learnt about the dark reality.
“In August 2025, an 18-month-old girl fell ill. She was admitted to the Valika Hospital,” said Irshad Khan, vice chairman of SITE Town’s UC-1, which comprises Pathan Colony and Bawani Chali areas.
 
 

“However, her weakness and fever persisted, after which she was taken to a private hospital. Doctors at the private hospital suspected that the child might have some other serious issue. They conducted several tests, after which she was diagnosed with HIV. When the private hospital doctors inquired about the child’s prior treatment, they were informed that she had earlier been treated at the Valika Hospital. It rang alarm bells. We set up a five-member committee on our own comprising leaders of all political parties working of the area — the Jamaat-i-Islami, PPP and ANP.”
The committee led by Mr Khan — who himself belonged to the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf — has since been aggressively pursuing the management of the Valika Hospital to conduct screening of those children of the UC who have been treated at the facility over the past few months. It was found that at least 18 of them were HIV-positive.
“But the problem is that despite severity of the issue, we don’t see any seriousness and urgency in the hospital management while the health department seems least bothered about it,” he said.
“We [the committee members] visit the hospital almost daily, but hardly anyone responds. We want every child, at least those who have been treated here since August 2025, to be screened. Currently dozens of children have gone through tests and 18 of them have been diagnosed with HIV. They are aged between one to nine years. On the other hand, hundreds of children are still there roaming in streets, living in houses or going to schools in the impoverished locality. This revelation could only be the tip of the iceberg. We need to take this situation seriously and devise an urgent and aggressive strategy. But authorities are not cooperating.”
Authorities respond
Responding to Dawn queries, an official at the Valika Hospital confirmed that screening for AIDS was underway at the facility while some children had been found to be HIV-positive. However, the officer did not disclose the exact number of affected children.
The government authorities, however, have rejected any such adverse impression.
Dr Kanwal Mustafa, Additional Director HIV/AIDS, Communicable Disease Control (CDC), Sindh Health Department, claimed that her institution responded immediately and set up an anti-retroviral therapy (ART) centre at the same health facility under the question.
“We are further expanding access to HIV treatment and care services in that area,” she added.
Other than recent reported cases at the Valika Hospital, she claimed that a “comprehensive approach” was being taken by the health department, CDC-1 HIV/AIDS Sindh, to tackle HIV/AIDS, focusing on both treatment and prevention.
A total of 31 ART centres have been established across Sindh, offering free counselling, diagnostics and prophylaxis services to HIV-positive individuals, including pregnant women and their children, she added.
When asked about the possible cause of the recent outbreak among the children who were treated at the Valika Hospital, she said “facts and data are still being analysed”.
She referred to common practices that usually cause such viruses to spread.
“HIV transmission in Pakistan, whether urban or rural, is a complex issue driven by several factors,” said Dr Kanwal. “Unlicensed practitioners reusing syringes and IV drips play a major role in the spread of the virus. Unregulated blood banks further exacerbate the issue, while widespread illiteracy and poverty create an environment conducive to the transmission of viruses.”
Despite the risks associated with injections, many Pakistanis believe that injections offer a quick relief, driving their widespread use, she added.
“Quackery in our society and high-risk behaviour among drug users compound the problem. Pakistan’s high anaemia prevalence among children under five also increases the likelihood of blood transfusions, heightening the risk of HIV acquisition,” she said.
The government-led investigations may take time to uncover the truth behind the recent HIV outbreak among children of SITE Town, but Vice Chairman of the UC Irshad Khan’s personal observations paint a dangerous scenario.
“During our recent visits to the Valika Hospital, we ourselves repeatedly witnessed the reuse of used syringes,” he revealed his shocking observation.
“Many staff members also confirmed this practice. I am shocked at how something like this is even possible at a government hospital. I’m not an expert, but I am certain that, among many other factors, this could be one of the reasons why HIV has spread among the children being treated there.”

Acting under the command of local TTP commander Abuzar, two important Afghan terrorists were among those who were killed in Merikhel area. Local sources said that the operation took place on Saturday-Sunday night. Three of the slain insurgents were identified as Ehsan Badri and Subaib Lezari, both Afghans, and Omar Sangari from Khyber district.
It was learnt that funeral of the two Afghan terrorists was later held in the Nangarhar province of Afghanistan.
There was, however, no official confirmation of the killing of these insurgents by security officials in the region.
The sources in Bara said that the five TTP men were involved in an attack on a security check point in Bar Qambarkhel area of Bara a few days back.

It was also learnt through the sources that these terrorists had also earned notoriety by filming beheading of some people and later posting their gory images on social media.

The district administration issued a notification advising all drivers and relevant parties to steer clear of travelling towards Jiwani.
Officials warned that any vehicle in violation of the ban would be subject to strict legal consequences, including on-the-spot confiscation by law enforcement agencies.
Law enforcement bodies, including the police, Pakistan Coast Guard, and Frontier Corps, have been instructed to rigorously enforce the ban, as per the district administration’s directive.
The measure aims to curb an illicit trade that costs the national treasury billions. An inquiry in 2020 revealed oil smuggling from Iran was worth over Rs250 billion annually.

Move aims to curb fuel smuggling from across the border

A more recent intelligence report from April 2024 noted that approximately 10 million litres of Iranian petrol and diesel were smuggled into Pakistan daily, causing a revenue loss of over Rs227 billion.
The significant difference in fuel prices between Pakistan and Iran has turned smuggling into a thriving business.
According to officials, a main smuggling artery is the sea route from Sistan, Iran, where speed boats transport fuel in cans along the Dasht river to Jiwani. Thousands of boats are allegedly involved in the illegal operations, supported by storage facilities and hotels along the coast.
From the coast, the cargo is moved in modified trucks to areas near Gwadar. It is then transported in non-Custom-paid pickups to the rest of Balochistan and bordering areas of Punjab and Sindh.
While the trade serves as the only means of livelihood for many people, it remains a lucrative opportunity for others. Smuggling continues to undermine legitimate business, facilitates tax evasion and fuels organised crime in the province.
The region’s reliance on smuggled fuel has previously led to widespread disruption. During a recent conflict between Israel and Iran, the supply of Iranian oil was severely affected, forcing a large number of petrol pumps to close.
The border districts of Turbat, Gwadar, Panjgur, Chagai, Washuk and Mashkail were the worst-affected, facing not only fuel shortages but also food scarcity, as many edibles are also imported from Iran. At the time, 60 to 70 per cent of petrol pumps reportedly closed due to the supply suspension.
 
 

Successive governments have laun­ched initiatives to stop the smuggling, but the problem persists. Last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the Balochistan government to take measures to discourage the transport of smuggled fuel out of the province.
Additionally, in August this year, the government passed a bill in the National Assembly to digitally track petroleum products from their origin to sales, aiming to curb smuggling and adulteration.

Speaking at a press conference on Sunday, VBMP Chairman Nasrullah Baloch urged the state and its institutions to realise that the use of force, extrajudicial killings and disappearances of Baloch citizens would not improve the situation in the province.
Instead, he called for a serious political approach to address Balochistan’s long-standing grievances.
 
 

Flanked by family members of the missing, including VBMP General Secretary Hooran Baloch and activist Ghani Baloch, he said the organisation’s protest camp outside the Quetta Press Club had now completed 6,000 days.
“This camp has also been set up in various parts of Balochistan, as well as in Karachi and Islamabad. It is viewed across Pakistan and the world as a symbol of peaceful resistance,” he said.

Use of force can’t bring peace to Balochistan, Nasrullah Baloch warns

He said that over the past 16 years, the organisation had held protests, seminars and long marches from Quetta to Islamabad, both on foot and by train.
Nasrullah Baloch said the VBMP had registered cases of enforced disappearances with the judiciary, inquiry commissions and the federal and provincial governments, and had presented evidence to the relevant authorities despite “serious difficulties and hardships”.
“False cases under the Anti-Terrorism Act were filed against me, General Secretary Hooran Baloch, Vice Chairman Mama Qadeer Baloch and others. We faced arrests and torture, but we did not abandon our struggle,” Nasrullah Baloch said.
He claimed that two VBMP district coordinators were extrajudicially killed during the movement, yet the campaign continued.
Families of missing persons, he said, submit complete details of their loved ones to the VBMP, which then forwards the cases to the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances and to the provincial government.
“The commission initiates legal proceedings within a week and issues notices to the relevant institutions. We also guide victims’ families about legal requirements,” he said.
Drawing on years of experience, he urged the state to understand that peace in Bal­ochistan could not be restored through force.
“Thousands of Baloch have been forcibly disappeared and thousands have been killed extrajudicially, yet the situation continues to deteriorate. We appeal to the state to refrain from using force in Balochistan. The issue is political and must be resolved through political dialogue,” he stressed.
He also demanded that all citizens be treated in accordance with the law, that missing persons be recovered, that those facing charges be produced before courts and that extrajudicial arrests and killings be stopped.
He called for legislation “in line with human dignity and constitutional principles” to address enforced disappearances.
Nasrullah Baloch also urged the families of missing persons not to remain silent. “Come forward with complete details of your loved ones,” he appealed.

While Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari believed the report to be “completely accurate and fully aligned with the facts”, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram asked the PPP and the PML-N to refrain from the “agenda-driven” campaign against ex-PM Imran Khan and his spouse.
He said the campaign through “concocted stories” was nothing but an effort to divert public attention from disastrous policies that had devastated the country “politically, morally, socially and economically”.
 
 

According to the PTI leader, the government had exhausted every tactic and committed every act over the past three years to remove the PTI founding chairman from the political arena, but all these measures proved counterproductive, and his popularity continued to flourish with each passing day. He predicted that the days of incumbent governments were numbered, and they were now frantically searching for escape routes.

Meanwhile, the Punjab information minister quipped that after the revelations about PTI founder Imran Khan, Bushra Bibi’s actions were now making headlines in the international media.
In a statement here on Sunday, she said that the report had exposed the “deception of the fake spiritual setup and the so-called mysticism that concealed darker intentions”.
“The man who used to threaten his opponents, saying he won’t spare them, himself believed that the manipulated information fed to his wife was some form of spirituality,” she stated.
Commenting on the publication’s report, Ms Bokhari said that for four years, the ‘coach’ and ‘spiritual guide’ misled the PTI founder. Despite claiming to champion change and end corruption, Bushra Bibi was facilitating a new form of “legitimised corruption”.
“A country and its economy cannot run on sorcery, spells, or fraudulent spiritual practices. The so-called spirituality of those who wanted to bury their opponents metaphorically has already been dead for three years,” she added.
Last week, The Economist published an article covering Mr Khan’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as prime minister.
‘The mystic, the cricketer and the spy: Pakistan’s game of thrones’, written by Owen Bennett Jones and Bushra Taskeen, claimed Bushra Bibi wielded an “absolute” influence and “upset crucial friends and allies”. The article also quotes a former driver of Mr Khan, alleging that Bushra Bibi used to practice ‘black magic’.
“Accepting his wife’s claim that she could read faces, he would ask for photographs of potential candidates, which would be sent to Bushra Bibi for a decision. She also got involved in pettier matters,” the article went on to say.
The article also shed light on her alleged ties with the intelligence community.
“According to the rumours, the officer would, for example, give one of Bushra Bibi’s pirs advance notice about which politician was about to be arrested. Bushra Bibi would then tell Khan that she had received a revelation about the future. When the event she predicted came to pass, Khan would be amazed at his wife’s perspicacity and conclude she did indeed have a direct line to God,” it claimed.

The UNIFIL protested that Israeli forces “fired on UNIFIL peacekeepers from a Merkava tank from near a position Israel has established in Lebanese territory,” adding that heavy machine gun rounds hit about five metres from their personnel.
Sunday’s incident was not the first in which UNIFIL accused Israel of endangering its troops. “Yet again, we call on the IDF to cease any aggressive behaviour and attacks on or near peacekeepers,” the force said.
Lebanon’s army, meanwhile, accused Israel of “violating Lebanese sovereignty, causing instability and obstructing the full deployment of the army in the south”.
The army is meant to deploy to the area alongside UNIFIL as part of the ceasefire agreement. It said it was “working, in coordination with friendly countries, to put and end to the continuous violations”.
The UNIFIL said the peacekeepers this time managed to “leave safely 30 minutes later” after the tank withdrew inside the Israeli position.
However, the Israeli military blamed ‘poor weather conditions’ for the shooting.
Israel denied it had deliberately targeted UN troops. In a statement, the Israeli military said “two suspects were identified” in the El Hamames area of southern Lebanon.
“The troops subsequently fired warning shots, and the suspects distanced themselves. No injuries were reported,” it said.

Israel blames poor weather, says it mistook blue helmets for ‘suspects’

“After a review, it was determined that the suspects were UN soldiers who were conducting a patrol in the area and were classified as suspects due to poor weather conditions. No deliberate fire was directed toward UNIFIL soldiers.”
UNIFIL has been working with Lebanon to consolidate a truce between Israel and Hezbollah reached last year. It said the Sunday shooting “represents a serious violation of UN Security Council resolution 1701”, which ended a 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, and also formed the basis of last November’s truce.
Under the deal, Israel was to withdraw its forces from south Lebanon, but it has kept them at five areas in violation of the ceasefire agreement. It has also carried out regular strikes on targets in Lebanon.
About Sunday shooting, the Israeli military said the incident was under examination.

Borrowing from President Donald Trump’s vocabulary, he described the relationship as having “never been so good looking” in recent memory, while acknowledging that it still requires more substance.
The envoy was speaking at a symposium, organised by Pakistani students at Georgetown University, which covered a wide range of topics and featured several speakers from diverse backgrounds.
 
 

Most speakers attended the discussions in person, while some participated via video link.
Ambassador Robin Raphel, a former head of the State Department’s Bureau of South Asian Affairs, said President Trump had removed the “emotionalism” that previously hindered US efforts to rebuild ties with Pakistan.

“Now is the time to strengthen the relationship with a country that remains strategically important,” she added, pointing to Pakistan’s proximity to some of the world’s most sensitive regions.
Ambassador Shaikh also highlighted Pakistan’s potential as “a large country with the fifth-largest population and many things to offer”, adding that the Trump administration viewed Pakistan as a country with its own identity, rather than solely in reference to Afghanistan or India.
Former US ambassador Maleeha Lodhi outlined five key areas likely to dominate Pakistan’s foreign policy in the years ahead.
These areas include managing relations with China and the United States amid the US-China confrontation, addressing challenges in Afghanistan, maintaining an adversarial stance towards India, and balancing ties between strategic ally Saudi Arabia and neighbour Iran.
 
 

She described the situation in Kabul as a major security and foreign policy challenge, calling it “a severe policy dilemma” for Islamabad.
“There are obvious limits to a coercive approach and military response, as a total breakdown in relations with Afghanistan is not in Pakistan’s interest — especially given the already fraught ties with India,” she said.
Former senator Mushahid Hussain reflected on Pakistan’s evolving relationship with the US, urging Islamabad to leverage the current focus on economic and strategic engagement to rebuild its economy.
 
 

He emphasised Pakistan’s role as a regional security provider in the Middle East, asserting that only a strong and stable Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as its capital, can bring lasting peace to the region. His remarks were met with warm applause from the audience.
Prof Akbar S. Ahmed highlighted the challenges in the country’s tribal areas, praising the wisdom of local communities and warning about Balochistan, which makes up over 40 per cent of Pakistan’s total area. He urged that the mistakes of East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) should not be repeated.
He said no state can be sustained without justice, fairness and generosity. “We must consider the factors that truly support democracy,” he added, stressing that a functioning democracy is impossible without education.
Other speakers highlighted the critical role of Pakistan’s young population, with a median age of just 23, in shaping social and political movements.
Dr Mehlaqa Samdani, who leads a group lobbying for Mr Khan’s release from prison, sought permission to address Ambassador Shaikh, but the session ended before she could speak.

Asia states
• Afghan traders say Islamabad still shortest, cheapest route to seaports
• Uzbek president proposes new bloc
AFGHANISTAN is seeking to significantly bolster trade with the oil-rich countries of Central Asia as it attempts to end its economic dependence on Pakistan, which has historically been Kabul’s biggest trading partner.
However, experts warn that geography, high costs, and political constraints will hinder efforts by Afghanistan’s cash-strapped and unrecognised Taliban government to shift trade to Central Asia, according to a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty report.
Kabul’s attempts to find new trade partners come after the worst outbreak of hostilities with Islamabad in years. The neighbours exchanged military attacks last month, killing dozens of people and leading to Pakistan closing its border with Afghanistan.
The month-long border closure has inflicted some $200 million in losses for Afghan traders, who rely on Pakistani seaports to access international markets.
Similarly, Pakistan had been exporting fresh fruits, cement, medicines, surgical items, agricultural tools, fabrics, shoes, plastic pipes and sanitary items, cosmetics, and a variety of other locally manufactured products valued at around $100–200m per month to the neighbouring country.
‘Trade alternatives’
Senior Taliban officials have urged Afghan traders and investors to end their activities in Pakistan and find new business and trade opportunities in Central Asia. “We are actively working with our northern neighbors to find reliable trade alternatives,” Taliban Commerce Minister Nooruddin Azizi said last week.
Abdul Ghani Baradar, a Taliban deputy prime minister, accused Islamabad of using trade as a “tool of political pressure” and framed the ongoing border closure as evidence that Kabul must reduce its reliance on its neighbour.
Swiss-based Afghan expert Torek Farhadi said the Taliban’s new emphasis on trade with Central Asia is “largely political posturing”.
Central Asia is landlocked, and Afghanistan must rely on long-distance overland corridors to reach markets. The region’s tariff structures impose high costs on many Afghan exports, especially agricultural goods. The logistics of handling, storing, and transporting perishable goods such as fruits and vegetables remain underdeveloped.
“To make the northern route commercially viable, Afghanistan would need to remove tariffs and offer incentives to its Central Asian partners,” Mr Farhadi told RFE/RL.
“But for the government in Kabul, customs revenue is one of their primary income sources.”
Meanwhile, several railway projects, crucial for scaling cross-border trade, remain unfinished or lack financing.
The Taliban’s lack of international recognition also prevents it from accessing funds from global institutions like the World Bank and IMF, limiting investment in the infrastructure needed to support northbound trade, Farhadi said.
Those factors have ensured that Afghanistan’s trade with Central Asia, although growing, has remained modest.
Trade between Afghanistan and the five Central Asian states — Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan — has grown steadily, reaching nearly $1.7 billion, according to Afghan officials.
Still dependent
Despite Afghanistan’s growing trade with Central Asia, Kabul remains dependent on Pakistan as Islamabad has long provided its neighbor with the fastest and most affordable access to global markets.
The border crossings at Torkham and Chaman remain the backbone of Afghanistan’s commercial lifelines, but the repeated skirmishes in recent months caused frequent border closures. The most recent closures following armed clashes between Pakistani and Taliban forces left thousands of trucks stranded for weeks.
But for Afghan traders, few alternatives can match Pakistan’s proximity or port infrastructure. Shifting trade away from those routes means higher transport costs, longer transit times, and increased logistical risks, experts say.
“The reality is that Afghanistan’s shortest and cheapest route to seaports as well as India and other South Asian markets is through Pakistan,” said Azarakhsh Hafizi, the former head of the Afghanistan Chamber of Commerce.
“We need all transit routes to remain open. It would benefit not only Afghanistan and Pakistan, but it is also important for the regional economic integration,” said Hafizi, who previously held membership in the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Saarc.
Regional bloc proposed
Uzbek President Shavkat Mirzi­yoyev proposed on Sunday forming a regional co-operation organisation he called the “Community of Central Asia”, in what he said was a bid to promote economic integration in the region of more than 80 million people, Reuters reported.
In a speech at a meeting in Tashkent of the leaders of the five post-Soviet republics of Central Asia, as well as Azerbaijan, Mirziyoyev suggested transforming regular meetings between the leaders of the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia into a formal regional bloc.
He also stressed the need to boost economic, security and environmental cooperation.
There was no immediate indication of the other countries’ response to the Uzbek proposal, but all five countries have in recent years said they want greater regional integration, where ties were sometimes testy in decades past.
All five leaders visited Washington in unison for talks with US President Donald Trump earlier this month.
Two of the countries, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, earlier this year settled a longstanding border conflict that had claimed hundreds of lives.

The resolution for a vote of no confidence against Mr Haq was submitted to the Assembly secretariat on Friday afternoon. Sho­rtly afterwards, Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar summoned the Assembly to meet at 3pm on Monday.
While the PPP had already secured the supp­ort of the required 27 law­makers, its chairman Bila­wal Bhutto-Zardari had stressed at a meeting with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) should not only support the no-trust move to ensure a “thum­ping majority” but also join the next coalition setup.
 
 

However, the PML-N leadership announced that it would back the no-confidence motion but would not take any share in a PPP-led government. Cons­equently, the party’s two senior AJK leaders Shah Ghulam Qadir and Raja Farooq Haider signed the resolution along with the 23 PPP legislators.
On the other hand, the five-member PTI, which currently holds the office of Leader of the Opposition, as well as the two single-seat parties — Muslim Conference and Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party (JKPP) — have announced that they will stay away from the process.
On Sunday, two more PTI ‘forward-bloc’ lawmakers — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur, raising its own support base to 29.
“We will get the no-confidence motion through with a wide margin,” said Chaudhry Qasim Majeed, a senior PPP figure and cabinet member in the Haq-led coalition government. “The PML-N will also support us in this regard,” he added.
 
 

It was, however, yet to be seen whether the movers of the no-trust motion, who have accused Mr Haq of causing “serious damage to the constitutional, ideological and democratic framework of the state through his governance style, political narrative and confrontational conduct”,  would defend their position through speeches in Monday’s session.
Ironically, neither had any of the movers stepped down on their own, nor had Mr Haq mustered the courage to remove them in response to their allegations.
Referring to these accusations in an interview with a private TV channel, Mr Haq termed them “childish” and “frivolous”, adding that those who drafted them did not themselves appear to understand what they had written.
“The charge sheet against me leaves one wondering whether the allegations were even understood before being made. If my cabinet colleagues had difficulty writing in Urdu, they could have asked me; I would have drafted the accusations against myself in better words,” he remarked.
Mr Haq claimed he had broken the “status quo” and ensured cabinet involvement in all decisions.
Responding strongly to the allegation of “confrontational conduct” in the no-confidence text, the embattled prime minister asserted that his speeches, videos and public statements over the past two and a half years were on record, and that a disruptive mindset did not — and could not — exist in him. “The person who wrote this phrase should at least know what he was writing,” he said.
Under the AJK Constitution, a vote of no confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution. Once the motion succeeds, Mr Rathore will stand elected as the new prime minister, fourth in the sitting assembly since its installation in 2021.
Mr Majeed said the new premier was likely to take the oath of office on Tuesday before President Barrister Sultan Mahmood.
PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari is also expected to attend the swearing-in ceremony, among other dignitaries, he added.

• Calls from IMF, armed forces, others to re-balance transfer of resources to provinces go unheeded
• Centre ‘backs off’ from changes to award after deal with PPP
ISLAMABAD: The inaugural session of the National Finance Commission (NFC), constituted three months ago, is not in sight, as the proposed date of Nov 18 has also been postponed amid a downward revision in the economic growth forecast by up to 0.7 per cent to 3.5pc for the current fiscal year.
Informed sources said told Dawn that Prime Minister Shehbaz  Sharif wanted to set the ball rolling at the political level on key Centre-provincial matters before opening the debate for financial rearrangements at the technically-constitutional forum of NFC.
The 11th NFC was constituted on Aug 22 to give a fresh award for the sharing of federal divisible resources among the Centre and the provinces.
The first meeting was originally called for Aug 27 and then delayed to Aug 29 for unannounced reasons. The meeting was postponed again on the request of Sindh government due to floods.
The 7th NFC award delivered in 2009 thus remains in place for over 15 years against its five-year constitutional term.
As a result, repeated calls from various quarters, including the finance ministry, the armed forces, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to re-balance the transfer of a larger chunk of divisible pool resources to the provinces under the 7th NFC award have gone unaddressed.
 
 

The Constitution promises that provincial shares in each NFC award cannot be reduced. The NFC award has to be achieved with consensus of five parties — the Centre and the four provinces.
Under the 7th NFC award, the four provinces are collectively entitled to 57.5pc of divisible pool taxes, besides the revenue from income tax, wealth tax, capital value tax, general sales tax, customs duties and federal excise.
The provincial governments receive their horizontal shares on the basis of population, poverty, revenue collection, and inverse population density.
This allows Punjab to obtain a share of 51.74pc, Sindh 24.55pc, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 14.62pc, and Balochistan 9.09pc.
Political bargain
The sources said the provinces had been conveyed the date of Nov 18 for the inaugural meeting early this month, although without issuing a formal notification.
They added that the Prime Minister’s Office called for postponing the meeting and for not communicating a new date to the provinces before the premier could take up the matter with the coalition partners.
The prime minister has officially no role in the NFC engagements after the commission is constituted by the president.
The revision in the NFC parameters was originally part of the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment as the Centre wanted to reduce the financial shares of the provinces and take back some of the devolved subjects like education, population, etc.
However, the federal government stepped back in a political bargain with its main coalition partner, the PPP, for amendments relating to the armed forces and the judiciary.
Nevertheless, the prime minister has been hinting at continuing dialogue with the PPP for the NFC.
While the Centre had already crafted a major revenue source — petroleum development levy (PDL) on various products instead of the NFC –it has also secured about Rs1.5tr cashback from the provinces outside the award.
Revenue sources outside NFC
The combined impact of the two — PDL and provincial cash surplus — work out to be around Rs3 trillion for the current fiscal year — almost 2pc of the GDP.
On top of this, the Centre has secured Rs2.5 billion each for the current and last fiscal years on account of State Bank of Pakistan’s profits as a consequence of record-high interest rates.
The provincial cash surplus could be impacted by the shortfall in Federal Board of Revenue’s (FBR) tax collection, which has already amounted to Rs275bn in the first four months and is likely to grow as the year progresses amid lower than the budgeted economic growth rate.
The GDP growth rate has a direct bearing on the FBR’s tax collection and as a consequence on the NFC shares of the provinces and then their commitments to provide cash surplus to the Centre under the National Financial Pact orchestrated outside the Constitution under the dictats of the IMF to ensure healthy finances to the federation.
The lower GDP growth could, however, be partly compensated by higher inflation that generate greater sales tax receipts.
Flood devastation
Recently, the finance ministry told the National Assembly that a report compiled by the planning ministry based on data available as of Sept 30 showed that flood “devastation has led to a projected reduction in FY2026 GDP growth by 0.3-0.7pc, lowering the growth outlook from 4.2pc to a range of 3.5-3.9pc”.
The planning ministry had estimated economic loss of Rs822bn, equivalent to approximately $2.9bn, it said.
The finance ministry said the floods had exerted upward pressure on inflation.
In the first two months of FY2026 — July and August — inflation remained at 4.1pc and 3pc, respectively; however, in September, it surged to 5.6pc, mainly driven by higher food prices, it added.
The agriculture sector, with damages of Rs430bn (crops losses at Rs422.7bn), alongside significant infrastructure losses of Rs307bn (road infrastructure losses at Rs187.8bn), have been a primary driver of this downturn, the finance ministry said, adding that “due to the crops damages, the growth of agriculture sector is projected at 3pc-3.8pc against the target of 4.5pc.
 
 

The finance ministry further said the annual targets for key macroeconomic variables were approved by the National Economic Council.
“These targets remain intact; however, internal assessments are carried out to evaluate the impacts of changing domestic and external conditions,” it added.
“Amid the recent floods, considering the estimated economic loss of Rs822bn, the overall GDP growth is projected to decline for FY2025- 26 based on lower growth in agriculture due to extensive crop damages while growth in industry and services may also suffer due to linkages with agriculture.”
Moreover, it warned that the rice exports could also suffer while imports of raw cotton, wheat, pulses, and construction materials could increase, thereby widening the trade deficit and straining foreign exchange reserves.
However, higher expected workers’ remittances might offset the adverse impact of floods and keeping the current account deficit in check. Likewise, there is a risk of inflationary pressures, particularly on food and essential items, due to crop losses, supply chain disruptions, and higher input costs.

“Iran is a brotherly, friendly country. Pakistan is always in favour of finding peaceful resolutions of issues through dialogue and diplomacy, and we appreciate the offer of mediation of our brotherly country, Iran,” Andrabi told Dawn upon a query about reports that Tehran was working to convene a regional meeting for mediation between Islamabad and the Afghan Taliban.
“We believe that Iran can play an important role. We would not shy away from any mediatory role by Iran. Mediations are always welcome,” Andrabi said, adding that Pakistan had a “very strong case”.
He further stated: “Generally, mediations are resented by a country or a side which is on a weak legal or a political case. Pakistan’s case on this issue, on terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, is very strong. So, obviously we will not shy away from mediation.”
Pakistan, which has been grappling with the problem of terrorism for long, has been demanding that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. But, the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan.
Earlier this month, a third round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators from Turkiye and Qatar, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to prevent cross-border terrorism. The talks had followed deadly border clashes between the two neighbours in October.
The border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on the night of October 11 and continued into the next morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul.
Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm or deny whether it was behind the strikes, but maintained that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”.
After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.
A ceasefire was then agreed upon on the evening of October 15, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.
On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism.
However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6.
But on November 7, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “over” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides.
Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban have suspended trade ties with Pakistan.
Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Iran and Russia called for continued dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan to resolve their ongoing disputes on cross-border terrorism.
Previously on Nov 9, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had spoken with his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul.
According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi had also expressed Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries.
The same day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to suffer casualties among its security forces and civilian population in terror attacks, which authorities link to Afghanistan.</p><small>2025-11-17 02:25</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/11/16223032cfa138b.webp' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1955444/rizwan-fakhar-half-centuries-bowling-trio-seal-odi-series-whitewash-for-pakistan-over-sri-lanka' target='_blank'><strong>Rizwan, Fakhar half-centuries, bowling trio seal ODI series whitewash for Pakistan over Sri Lanka</strong></a><br><p>A brilliant bowling show from Pakistan and a laboured chase later saw the hosts beat Sri Lanka by six wickets to complete a 3-0 series sweep over the visitors in the third and final One-day International at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
Pacers Haris Rauf and Mohammad Wasim Junior (3-47) and left-arm wrist spinner Faisal Akram (2-42) starred with the ball before contrasting half centuries by Fakhar Zaman (55 off 45) and Mohammad Rizwan (61 not out off 92) guided Pakistan to the 212-run target with 32 balls remaining.
It was Pakistan’s second successive ODI series triumph after their 2-1 win over South Africa earlier this month, with focus now shifting to the T20I tri-series featuring the hosts alongside Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.
After Pakistan won the toss and opted to field, Haris, Wasim and Faisal struck at regular intervals through the innings, preventing Sri Lanka from building momentum at any stage.
A flurry of crisp strokes on a batting-friendly pitch by Sri Lankan openers Patthum Nissanka and Kamil Mishara gave the visitors a flying start before the in-form Haris forced Nissanka to play one onto his stumps. Sri Lanka nevertheless reached 57-1 by the end of the first 10 overs.
First-drop Kusal Mendis carried the momentum, flicking two full deliveries by Haris for boundaries in the 11th over. But Sri Lanka suffered another setback when Mishara poked at an outswinger by Wasim to get caught behind in the next over.
The dismissal slowed down the run-rate, with Kusal and Sadeera Samarawickrama taking Sri Lanka to 99-2 by the 20th over, which featured a successful DRS review saving Samarawickrama after an lbw decision by spinner Faisal.
With the boundary drought stretching — 47 balls to be precise — pressure mounted on the batters, culminating in another breakthrough for Pakistan and another for Wasim, who seamed one in to castle Kusal through the gate as the Islanders slipped to 117-3 at the halfway mark.
Faisal, who had kept things tight in his five overs, returned to remove Kamindu Mendis off his own bowling in a soft dismissal, pushing Sri Lanka deeper into trouble. Janith Liyanage followed next, chopping Faheem Ashraf’s medium pace onto his stumps.
Faisal then produced a superb delivery in the 36th over, spinning one back sharply into the right-handed Samarawickrama to bowl him for 48.
Maheesh Theekshana fell soon after to a searing yorker by Pakistan captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, with DRS upholding the lbw call. Another pinpoint yorker saw Wasim uproot Jefferey Vandersay’s middle stump.
After Pavan Rathnayake threatened a late rally by launching Haris over long-off for six, his partner Pramod Madushan succumbed to a fierce bouncer, the ball flying off his gloves into the hands of wicket-keeper Haseebullah Khan.
Rathnayake was the last to fall, courtesy of a sharp throw by substitute Saim Ayub that found him short of his crease.
Pakistan’s start with the bat proved tricky as opener Haseebullah perished attempting to clear the infield off Maheesh Theekshana but ended up holing out to Eshan Malinga at mid-on in the fourth over.
Fakhar responded to the early wicket with a firm whip through midwicket off Pramod Madushan for his second boundary, before Babar Azam punched Theekshana for two crisp drives through the off side in the next over.
Fakhar heaved Theekshana over his head for another four as Pakistan reached 46-1 by the end of 10 overs.
Fakhar and Babar raised their fifty stand in the 12th over, the latter caressing Madushan for a cover boundary before the former punished a wide delivery by medium-pacer Liyanage for four.
Fakhar notched his 19th ODI half-century by smacking Jeffery Vandersay through the on side in the 14th over. But he departed soon after — for 55 off 45 — finding a diving Kamindu Mendis at deep midwicket off Vandersay.
Just as Pakistan crossed 100 in the 20th over, Vandersay delivered a brilliant googly to deceive Babar (34 off 52) and shatter his stumps.
The leg-spinner struck again in the 25th over, trapping Salman Ali Agha lbw, the third umpire overturning the on-field decision as Sri Lanka sensed an opening at the halfway stage.
Rizwan, at the other end, responded with an exquisite cover drive off Malinga in the following over.
But as the pitch’s sluggishness increasingly came into play, Rizwan and incoming Hussain Talat opted for caution, relying on hard running rather than strokeplay.
The next boundary arrived after more than 12 overs when Rizwan placed a full toss by Malinga behind square with ease. The former Pakistan captain brought up his second successive fifty off 84 balls in the 42nd over.
He was dropped on 55 in the 44th over, but Pakistan needed only nine more runs by then.
Four came off a straight drive by Rizwan against Madushan before Hussain (42 off 57) struck another boundary to seal the match.</p><small>2025-11-16 17:40</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/633916-jordans-king-commends-pakistan-militarys-professionalism-operational-capabilities' target='_blank'><strong>Jordan's king lauds Pakistan Army's professionalism, operational capabilities</strong></a><br><p>
