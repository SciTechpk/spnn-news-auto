On Aug 10, a fast-moving dumper hit a motorcycle and crushed to death Mahnoor, 22, and her brother Ahmed Raza, 14, on main Rashid Minhas Road near the UBL Sports Complex. Enraged people took to the streets and set to fire seven dumpers within the remit of the Federal B Industrial Area and Yousuf Plaza police stations.
On Wednesday, the investigation officers of the two cases produced the suspects before the administrative judge of the ATCs at the Judicial Complex inside the central prison.
They requested the court to grant their 14-day police remand for interrogation and to arrest other absconding suspects.
 
 

The court remanded all 12 suspects in police custody for seven days and directed the IOs to submit progress reports at the next hearing.
Remand of dumper driver extended
A judicial magistrate on Wednesday extended the physical remand of a dumper driver booked and arrested for killing the two siblings in the fatal accident.
IO Fida Hussain brought dumper driver Firdos Khan before Judicial Magistrate (Central) Farman Ali Tager and sought an extension of his police remand, stating that more time was needed to verify the suspect’s documents.
During the hearing, the IO informed the court that the suspect had claimed to possess an HTV (Heavy Transport Vehicle) licence issued from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. For verification, he said, a letter had been sent to the relevant authority in the province.
However, the IO added that the licence had not yet been verified, which was why Sections 322 (punishment for qatl-bis-sabab) and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) had been added to the case. He requested more time as he awaited a response from the authorities concerned.
After hearing arguments from the defence counsel and the IO, the court extended the suspect’s physical remand for three more days and directed the IO to submit a progress report at the next hearing, scheduled for Aug 16.

They said the day served as a reminder of courage, unity, and sacrifices that led to the creation of Pakistan and paid homage to founding father Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the workers of the Pakistan Movement for their struggle and sacrifices.
In his message on the occasion, President Zardari emphasised that the nation had “reaffirmed its strength, resolve, and unity in the face of external aggression”.
“Our success in Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos is a landmark moment in our history,” he said. “It was a demonstration of unshakable national will, professional excellence, and united purpose.”
In July, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said this year’s Independence Day would be marked as “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth). The term is used by the state for the conflict with India from the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the end of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos with a ceasefire on May 10.
The clash began after India blamed Pakistan for the attack without evidence, leading to air strikes and a week of missile exchanges stretched until a US-brokered ceasefire.
The day dawned with a 31-gun salute in Islamabad and 21-gun salutes at the provincial headquarters, Radio Pakistan reported.
Special prayers were offered in mosques for peace, solidarity and prosperity of the country. Various renowned buildings across the country have also been decorated with the national flag and lights as the nation celebrates Independence Day with fervour.
The main flag hosting ceremony was held at the Pakistan Monument in the federal capital, where PM Shehbaz unfurled the national flag.
Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, cabinet members, parliamentarians and school students were present on the occasion, according to Radio Pakistan.
Special prayers were offered for the country’s progress and prosperity.
 






A flag hoisting ceremony was also held at the Supreme Court, where Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Yahya Afridi unfurled the national flag.
In his message, President Zardari noted that “faced with unjustified Indian aggression, Pakistan responded with clarity, courage and restraint.
“The world witnessed a nation that is peace-loving, but fully capable of defending its sovereignty and territorial integrity.”
 






“Today, the world sees Pakistan as a country that seeks peace but does not bow to coercion.
“But this moment is about more than military success. It is a reminder of what we can achieve when we are united, focused, and committed to a common goal,” the president said.
He asserted that this victory gave the people of Pakistan a sense of renewed confidence. It has lifted the morale of the people, restored faith in our institutions, and enhanced Pakistan’s stature on the global stage, he added.
President Zardari urged the nation to channel this spirit into economic revival, educational reform, technological advancement, institutional development, and environmental resilience.
“The same discipline, courage, and clarity that led to our recent success against India can lead us toward victory in eradicating poverty, creating opportunities for our people, and building a just and inclusive society.”
He also expressed solidarity with the people of India-occupied Kashmir, saying that “their courage and struggle for justice and their right to self-determination remain close to our hearts.
“Pakistan will continue to extend its unwavering diplomatic, moral, and political support until their right to self-determination is realised.”
In his message, PM Shehbaz paid tribute to Jinnah and national poet Allama Muhammad Iqbal, who along with other resolute leaders and workers of the Independence Movement, united the nation under one vision, one mission and one goal.
“Their relentless efforts changed the course of the history with the establishment of an independent, ideological state, thus realising a seemingly impossible dream into a reality,” he said in a statement.
“The past 78 years tell a tale of resilience, strong faith and a hope of a bright future when as a nation, we braved several difficult challenges”, he stated. “Despite this, Pakistan achieved a series of milestones of success and achievements in every field.”
He also paid tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of Pakistan’s freedom, saying Marka-i-Haq was not just a military conquest, but also the victory of validation of the Two-Nation Theory.
 






“Pakistan’s historic victory in Marka-i-Haq during the four-day war imposed by India has not only reinforced the sanctity of our freedom, but has also instilled a renewed sense of ambition and national spirit in the hearts of our people, magnifying the pride and fervour of this Independence Day.”
He continued: “With the blessings of Almighty Allah, our brave armed forces revived their past glory and shattered the false pride of enemy by acting as a Bunyanum Marsoos — a solid fortified wall.
“The military capability, valour and faith of our brave soldiers and air warriors forced the enemy to kneel down. We pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the sake of our freedom and offer prayers for the elevation of their ranks in eternal life.”
While expressing his resolve to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty, PM Shehbaz said: “We reiterate our belief in the principles of peaceful coexistence and resolving the regional and global issues through dialogue and diplomacy.”
He said India needs to demonstrate the same will for the resolution of all disputes, including the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
PM Shehbaz also highlighted the government’s initiatives for the welfare of the common people, such as a reduction in electricity prices. “The government is utilising all resources to make the country effectively meet the economic, industrial technological demands of the present era.”
He called for demonstrating the spirit of Marka-i-Haq and Pakistan Movement for a strong and stable economy, which is inevitable for an impregnable national defence and sovereignty.
‘Unbreakable bond between armed forces, people’
The military top brass congratulated the nation on Independence Day as they vowed to safeguard Pakistan’s sovereignty and unity, according to a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).
Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu extended “heartfelt felicitations to the nation on the auspicious occasion” of Independence Day, “marking the triumph of unity, resilience, and an unwavering commitment to a shared vision for a brighter future”.
“As guardians of national security, we reaffirm our unwavering resolve to safeguard Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, uphold the Constitution, and protect the values that define our national identity,” the statement said.
“The unbreakable bond between the armed forces and the people is the cornerstone of our collective strength.”
The military top brass paid homage to the founding fathers and honoured their “indomitable spirit, resolute determination, and unparalleled sacrifices”, which paved the way for independence“. “Their courage, foresight, and unshakeable faith in the cause of freedom remain an enduring beacon of guidance,” it highlighted.
The armed forces also paid solemn tribute to the “visionaries, statesmen, and soldiers who laid our nation’s foundations, cherishing their legacy with deep reverence and gratitude”.
“On this Independence Day, let us renew our resolve to strive for peace, progress, and unity, upholding the ideals of Faith, Unity, and Discipline to realise the dream of a resilient, prosperous, and progressive Pakistan.”
Rubio, others extend greetings
Meanwhile, leaders from various countries also felicitated Pakistan on its Independence Day.
United States Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement: “On behalf of the United States, I extend our warm congratulations to the people of Pakistan as they celebrate their Independence Day on August 14.”
He added that the US “deeply appreciates Pakistan’s engagement on counterterrorism and trade”.
“We look forward to exploring new areas of economic cooperation, including critical minerals and hydrocarbons, and fostering dynamic business partnerships which will promote a prosperous future for Americans and Pakistanis,” Rubio said, building upon the two countries’ intensified economic and military in recent weeks.
 






Russian Embassy in Pakistan hailed the country’s “significant progress in many areas”, while the Chinese embassy wished for the “ironclad friendship” between the two nations to grow stronger.

Based on current tax rates, informed sources said the ex-depot price of HSD is estimated to decline by around 4pc, depending on final calculations, while petrol could rise by about 0.5pc.
International petrol prices inched up by 15 cents per barrel over the past fortnight, while diesel rates fell by about $4.5 per barrel. The rupee also appreciated slightly against the dollar.
The current ex-depot petrol price stands at Rs264.61 per litre, following a Rs7.54 per litre cut on August 1. This came after cumulative hikes of Rs20 per litre in the previous four fortnights since May 15. Petrol, used mainly in private cars, small vehicles, rickshaws and two-wheelers, directly impacts the budgets of middle- and lower-middle-income groups.
HSD is presently priced at Rs285.83 per litre, after an almost Rs27 per litre surge since May 15, including a minor Rs1.48 per litre cut earlier this month. The fuel powers most of the transport sector — from trucks and buses to trains, tractors, tube-wells and threshers — and has a strong inflationary effect, particularly on the prices of vegetables and other essential goods. Transport fares have already risen in response to earlier price hikes and rarely come down.
Kerosene and light diesel oil (LDO) prices are expected to drop by about Rs6 and Rs7 per litre, respectively.

He sees violence, corruption, poverty, extremism, and an unlawful regime lording over it. Perhaps, nearly 80 years on, freedom means something else.
He’s shocked, regrets what he’s founded, and calls it a day — or becomes a vehicle for some conservative columnist to tell the public what they should be doing instead. Only, the question lingers: would the Quaid have been all that surprised by what he’d seen?
Because Jinnah witnessed violence, corruption, poverty and extremism under an unlawful regime for most of his years. And that’s without touching on the constant defeats that rutted his path: his family business collapsing around the time he returned from London; Gandhi elbowing him offstage as India’s most promising politician by 1920; the civil liberties he championed crushed by the British Raj; and the Nehru Report setting fire to Hindu-Muslim unity — the work of a lifetime. His own.
In fact, the odds against anything resembling Pakistan were brutal before 1946: the Unionist Party’s obese landlords ran Punjab; Sindh was in the grips of Gandhian arch-feudal Soomros; the frontier was ruled by Congressites outright; and Balochistan wasn’t even on the provincial map.
Lesser men, almost all men, would have surrendered; yet others would have haggled for scraps from within the Raj’s cage. But Jinnah had long understood that freedom was a terrible, vital business: not so much the absence of pain, but the choice to endure it for something essential to being alive.
 
 

For freedom’s sake
After all, beyond those dry law books, Jinnah was an idealist — no freedom fighter isn’t. His friend, Sarojini Naidu, called it right as early as 1917: “Never was there a nature whose outer qualities provided so complete an antithesis of its inner worth.” If he was skinny, it concealed “exceptional … endurance”; if he was aloof, it hid a “naïve and eager humanity”. If he seemed too rational and practical, it was only to “disguise a shy and splendid idealism”.
It’s also how he changed map of the world — by keeping his eyes fixed to the eternities. As has been said of British premier Disraeli’s career (whom Liaquat Ali Khan enjoyed comparing to Jinnah): “Failure, failure, failure, partial success, renewed failure. Ultimate and complete victory.”
But such victory can never be complete: if indeed the Quaid came home, he’d have found freedom in recession. We know this not from speculation, but from decades of documentary record.
Interestingly, most of that record is nowhere to be found on August 14: beyond a few bumper stickers, Jinnah seems to have become much too radical, and thereby much too dangerous, for his own country to contend with.
Jinnah vs the state
For starters, consider liberty: is a citizen free if they can be tried by a military tribunal? Said Jinnah in 1919, “I am a firm believer that no man’s liberty should be taken away for a single minute without a proper judicial inquiry.” The Supreme Court disagreed last May, and chose to cite Ayub Khan’s laws rather than the founder’s speech.
That brings us to the judiciary itself, the crown jewel of any free republic. But are the judges in a position to safeguard the people’s rights, now that the executive has snatched away their powers via the 26th amendment?
 
 

“Powers which are going to be assumed by the executive, which means substitution of executive for judiciary, such powers are likely to be abused,” said Jinnah. He had said prior, “Instead of giving the powers to the executive, I would rather that the power was given to the judiciary … because in my opinion, it is a lesser evil than the executive.’
The unity regime has thought the opposite: stripping the courts of suo motu powers, choosing its own chief justice every three years, and reducing the entire judicature to a popularity contest. The regime may think, as the British once had, that Jinnah doth protest too much. London’s Edwin S. Montagu once asked him acidly, “Have you ever known any proposal come from any government which met with your approval?”
And yet the Quaid wasn’t instinctively opposed to the state: he viewed a free country as one where the executive was in charge — just not its armed forces. He warned a future chief of general staff in 1947, “Never forget that you are the servants of the state. You do not make policy. It is we, the people’s representatives, who decide how the country is to be run. Your job is only to obey the decision of your civilian masters.”
Yet what of said people’s representatives? As blanket convictions stream in and lawmakers are flung out of the assembly, it’s hard not to remember the Quaid’s words when Satyendra Chandra Mitra, a member of the Central Legislative Assembly, was slapped with preventive detention: “Here is a man who was arrested under a most obnoxious law which gives the executive absolute power to imprison a man on suspicion without trial … How long are you going to prevent him from what he is entitled to do?”
And if the state cried law and order, he replied, “Is it to be performed in spite of the will of the people … by retaining a most reactionary and oppressive measure …? I maintain sir, that if the government were really responsive to public opinion, all the revolutionary organisations and anarchical organisations that you are now talking of and which you want to arrest and to destroy…will disappear.”
This was part of a broader, daring stance — that violence and disorder stem not from uncontrollable populations, but unresponsive rule. Jinnah may well have been addressing Balochistan when he said, “Why do these educated young men take to bombs? Have you ever thought of it? … The way to prevent bombs being thrown is to meet the people, respond to their feelings, their sentiments and their legitimate and proper aspirations.”
It most certainly isn’t to punish those who raise their voices for a better world, as we’re seeing today: journalists thrown on stop lists and anchors taken off television. Yet again, the barrister from Bombay was clear: “I say, protect the innocent, protect those journalists who are doing their duty and who are serving both the public and the government by criticising the government freely, independently, honestly, which is an education for any government.”
Back to the Raj
In sum, Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s starting point was freedom. As the late lawyer-historian A.G. Noorani wrote, no parliamentarian spoke as sharply to the British “or their Indian stooges” as Jinnah: “There was no nationalist more fervent than he; no stronger champion of freedom from British rule.”
Because freedom was the end in and of itself. That seems hard to believe these days: as we recently read in these pages, Faisalabad’s anti-terrorism court handed down scores of convictions over the 9 May riots by reasoning the law was well-drafted and wide-ranging: arch-imperialist Lord Macaulay, “the first law-giver of the subcontinent”, had authored it after “the famous mutiny of 1857”.
![](https://www.dawn.com/news/1930158/why-you-should-care-about-the-atc-verdict-that-condemns-senate-na-opposition-leaders-to-jail
It’s already been questioned why the court would compare itself to its colonisers, and the PTI to yesterday’s rebels. But as a scholar of the Raj — if not of our own freedom movement — the learned judge would also know what Macaulay had written when those rebels were fired from cannons in Peshawar: that “their heads, legs, arms, flying in all directions was read with delight”. Reflected Macaulay, “I could be very cruel just now if I had the power.”
 
 

The learned judge would also know that these weren’t the emotional outbursts of a jolted regent, but sober policy directions, steeped in the racial superiority of an alien overclass. All things considered, Macaulay thought us unfit for self-rule anyway; that what we could really “have [is] the next best thing — a firm and impartial despotism”; and that the British carried with them “all the noblest virtues of a sovereign caste”. By jingo, chaps.
In fairness to Faisalabad, the anti-terrorism courts quote Macaulay instead of Jinnah in the same way the Supreme Court leans harder on Ayub’s Pakistan than the Quaid-i-Azam’s. As the song goes, it looks like freedom but it feels like death.
All of which is to say that if Jinnah indeed came home today, the story of his life points to anything but a lament, a lecture, a sad retreat in the rain. What it points to is, frankly, audacity: that no wall can’t be breached — the Congress, the provincials, empire itself; none yielded willingly, and all looked permanent until the moment they fell. But fall they did, and Pakistan was born.
So we continue. And we keep the faith.</p><small>2025-08-14 05:19</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/689d5e17f1411.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930814/78-volatile-years-torment-amp-triumph' target='_blank'><strong>78 volatile years: Torment & triumph</strong></a><br><p>AS Pakistan begins its 79th year of independence, it is evident that both torment and triumph in multiple manifestations have persisted throughout.
First, the torment. Embedded in genesis. Because with cheers for freedom came tears. In torrents. Rivers of blood, when about 800,000 humans crossed borders created overnight. Ten million persons migrated within months to seek refuge in severely strained infrastructure. A hugely botched, arbitrarily advanced transition arrogantly imposed by the departing British. Grossly disadvantaged areas that became Pakistani territory given only 10 weeks to become part of the new state.
Callous withholding by India of Pakistan’s pre-agreed share of the undivided region’s resources. Unrivalled crises in binding two halves of a population 1,000 miles distant from each other with a hostile neighbour in between. And two neighbours — India and Afghanistan — wishing us ill. Forced to attempt fair play for the people of Kashmir within weeks of August 14 when India and Mountbatten fabricated a fake accession. The far too early demise — only 13 months after its birth — of the giant who crafted the new nation-state. Just three years later, his valiant deputy also departed, through an assassin’s bullet.
Civil politicians and bureaucrats invited the armed forces to participate in political decision-making — PM Bogra’s disastrous error in 1954 appointing a serving army chief, General Ayub Khan, to become his own boss as defence minister. Incursion of the military into the political domain expanded in successive decades. Torment intensified up to the trauma of 1971, largely due to our own missteps, but also covertly promoted by India in East Pakistan.

The creation of Pakistan represents the first-ever realisation of Muslim nationalism achieving independent statehood anywhere, not just in South Asia.

The Hydra-headed monster
The attempted cure becoming worse than the malady brings to mind the multi-headed monster of Greek myth— the Lernaean Hydra that Hercules challenged. Each of the serpent’s nine heads would regenerate into even more heads whenever cut off.
In 2025, our own Pakistani version of the Hydra legend shows how trumpeted relief for workers and farmers actually spurs rocketing inequality. Disconnect is starkly evident when shares owned by a few thousand in the stock exchange reach spectacular heights of billions of rupees, just as mass poverty of millions rises to 44.7 per cent, or about 120 million people, almost half the total population.
Engineered elections
Engineered February 2024 elections deprived those securing the largest number of votes from office at the federal level and in the largest province — with KP a diversionary façade. The collusion between state institutions and political parties creating a crude new scenario enacted every day. Mass arrests, prolonged imprisonments, rejection of bail for the PTI leader, frenetically fast disqualifications even before legal appeals are completed, manipulated parliamentary proceedings in which lack of quorum occurs frequently — except when certain bills are adopted post-haste. The 26th Constitutional Amendment, rushed like an express train through both Houses, inflicted grievous havoc. Moreover, there has been a deliberately mixed approach to coercion of news media permitting some candour, preventing much else.
Small coteries, big effects
Persistence of savage practices against women and girl-children on the pretext of family honour are reported almost every day. Though the numerosity of such incidents in 250m is relatively low, the very fact of recurrence is appalling. Especially so in the very same country that, 37 years ago, produced the world’s first Muslim woman prime minister. Fortunately, no person convicted of blasphemy has ever been executed, thanks to superior judicial review. But dozens have been lynched by mobs. Many others suffer long jail terms pending review hearings. Small, vociferous coteries of extremists are permitted to intimidate lawyers, judges, citizens and to influence laws, policies and actions.
Criminalisation of society & state
Criminalisation of large segments of both society and the state proceeds apace. Officials appearing before a parliamentary committee recently investigating the sugar sector committed contempt of parliament by declining to reveal the names of sugar mills’ owners — far too many are in power. Transparency becomes foggier. The Benazir Income Support Programme was obliged in recent months to remind a provincial government that, in one department alone, reportedly hundreds of government employees were detected for making false claims for compensation — and received plentiful sums.
Painful perceptions
Perhaps the unkindest cut is a recent global index of passports’ ranking placing my favourite travel document among the three least-respected at overseas entry points. Governments make no long-term investment to correct the unjust negative global image. A second painful cut is for the state to be a perennial borrower, a perpetual seeker of aid and grants. Bloated bureaucracies, ravenous elites, and long-sterile state-owned enterprises suck billions from the public exchequer every year. Meanwhile, illegal transfer of big money to overseas caches carries on.
Though the PM belatedly presided over a meeting on imbalanced population growth, cross-sectoral, sustained, practically visible actions still remain inadequate to reduce the ominous 2.5pc annual growth rate. Instead of basic change in Balochistan and KP that would prevent poll rigging and end enforced disappearances, futile arrests of activists and the use of force instead of dialogue exacerbate alienation.
Over 23m children are already out-of-school — projected to grow to 40m in a few years. Grim prospects in a new era driven by artificial intelligence and radical change.
First-ever Muslim nation-state
Just as genesis was marked by torment, so too was triumph present with birth. The first element is a hard fact: the creation of Pakistan represents the first-ever realisation of Muslim nationalism achieving independent statehood anywhere, not just in South Asia. Everywhere else, Asia and Africa, when Muslim-majority communities secured independence from colonialism, formative factors were ethnic, or linguistic, or other affinities. The remarkable facet of Pakistan’s formation was the recognition that religion-based factors alone could also become the foundation for an entirely new nation-state.
That, while ethnic, linguistic, cultural factors are potent, by its own pristine self, Muslim nationalism is an inescapable reality. Muslims were not just a large religious minority alongside a large Hindu majority: Muslims constitute a nation, as enunciated by Iqbal, Rahmat Ali, and finally M.A. Jinnah, endorsed on a mass level through the Muslim League. Pre-1947 Muslim religious political parties, several of which strongly opposed the creation of Pakistan — till its actual creation — were all roundly rejected by the Muslim masses of South Asia who, while being motivated by their religious faith, were equally determined not to create a theocratic state but a moderate, balanced Muslim-majority state. Which is why in 11 general elections since 1970, religious parties never received a real majority vote.
Two-Nation reality alive & well
The separation of East Pakistan in 1971 was a rejection of the original state structure: undue influence of the western wing on the eastern wing. But it was not a rejection of Muslim nationalism. Indeed, the very opposite. Bangladesh 1971-72 and today in 2025 remains irrevocably committed to being a Bangladeshi Muslim-majority nation-state which, laudably, acknowledges the sanctity of other faiths but has no wish to merge with Indian West Bengal or India — where Muslims today, though themselves a nation comprising enormous diversity, are nevertheless willing to remain loyal citizens of India as a religious minority — now facing daily persecution by Hindutva.
Fusion of history with today
The second triumph is the fusion of bringing together ancient heritage with contemporary sensibility. The 8,000-year-old Mehrgarh site in Balochistan and the 5,000-year-old Indus Valley civilisation in KP, Sindh, Punjab, as also the influences of Greece, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Christianity, culminating in the advent of Islam 1,300 years ago — which brought the impact of Turkic, Persian, Central Asian and Arab characteristics: the new nation-state blends pioneering stages of humanity’s history with regional cultures, and with numerous successive centuries of advancement as well as regression, of unequalled egalitarianism and inherent, irrepressible preference for participatory and democratic practices, notwithstanding the feudalism, tribalism and despotism that have ruled these past decades.
Mohenjodaro provides a stellar instance of Pakistan’s unique proletarian heritage. Whereas other concurrent civilisations like the Egyptian and Mesopotamian, in which individual rulers deployed thousands to build giant statues and pyramids for self-glorification, there are virtually no signs yet in Harappa or Mohenjodaro of similar ruler-centric monumental obsessions. Instead, open architectural layouts without huge edifices signal that the way of life was notably equitable.
Renewal, rebuilding post-1971
The third triumph is the way, after 1971, the residual Pakistan renewed, rebuilt, reaffirmed itself from 1972 to 2025. Despite all the many setbacks and blunders of both civil and military leaders over the past five decades, innate resilience demonstrated so readily in the first two decades (1947-1965) helped sustain the country through many travails.
A fourth triumph came when the state was obliged to develop nuclear weapons in response to India’s ill-considered introduction of the menace into South Asia. Pakistan showed extraordinary technological capability, both in acquiring nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems — apart from little-publicised yet invaluable applications of nuclear power for peaceful, productive purposes.
Though their leadership’s appetite for political control distracts from fair appraisal, the rank and file of the armed forces embody features of a merit-based system, unflinching courage, selfless sacrifice of life and, in the war on terrorism and the May 2025 conflict with India, grit, phenomenal dexterity, and technical ability to make this a fifth triumph.
The people’s ingenuity & creativity
The people’s ingenuity with mastering technology and innovating new sources of income are apparent in differing fields. Be it a semi-literate motor mechanic who fixes a sophisticated but malfunctioning Mercedes-Benz or the myriad ways by which men and women, in cities or small towns do freelance work to make Pakistan’s gig economy (estimated at about $500m) one of the five largest in the world — basic ingenuity makes for a fine sixth triumph.
Aptly juxtaposed are the seventh and eighth shining seals: abundant talent in vocal and instrumental music, painting, traditional crafts, modern design, performing arts, poetry, literature, film-making. And a passion for bold adventure inspires women to climb the highest mountains of the world. Or in recent decades, produces world champions in the most challenging mental game of bridge, and the most strenuous sport of squash.
Generous, hospitable, friendly
The ninth triumph is almost as heart-warming as the tenth. Pakistan ranks 17th in 101 countries in “Giving” — generously, frequently sharing wealth with the poorest and those in most need. Even the poor give more frequently than the rich who, of course, give more. When cognisance is taken of the fulsome contribution of voluntary time, skills and money by thousands of citizens to public service institutions like hospitals, free food centres, orphanages, educational institutions, etc Pakistani philanthropy deserves a rank higher than no. 17. India makes it to only no. 26.
Pakistanis are possibly the friendliest, most hospitable people on earth. They open hearts and homes — even to strangers just met — to serve food and fraternity in unrivalled measure. Overseas visitors make special mention of this trait.
Pakistani women
The eleventh triumph is the dignity and beauty, devotion and love with which women in particular, be they in remote villages or in big cities, work to care for their families, combining household labour increasingly with jobs in fields, factories, offices, as nurses, petrol pump attendants, doctors, bankers, engineers, aeroplane pilots.
The identity of Pakistan
The World Happiness Index ranks Pakistanis happier than Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, and Indians. Most fittingly, over the previous 78 years there has evolved a distinct sense of Pakistaniat in which coexist multiple positive features as well as some negative traits: the crystallisation of an exclusive identity that never existed in history before 1947.
To amend the adage which states “Life begins at 40”: for Pakistan, the best is yet to come — because now, “Life begins at 80”. Coming soon.

Both countries inherited the bitterness of partition and some unresolved issues from the British Raj. Ideally, the two countries could have resolved those issues and converted the bitterness of partition into cooperative sweetness.
However, rather than cultivating a cordial relationship and resolving issues, today, the two countries have institutionalised rivalry, which is evident in media and military doctrines, and national narratives. Today, balanced views and peace advocacy are considered a ‘cultural crime’ in both countries. Hence, voices of peace constituencies have either been muted or sidelined.
From better past to bleak future
It seems that the first-generation leaders as well as public of India and Pakistan had greater appetite for peace and bilateral engagement. For instance, from December 1947 to January 1957 — prior to the first military coup in Pakistan — the two countries signed 12 landmark agreements related to economic cooperation and promotion of socio-cultural activities. These agreements largely helped to enhance connectivity and ease cross-border communication for both sides.
For example, an agreement in 1948 established air services for the people of both sides. Similarly, the landmark agreement on banking between India and Pakistan in 1949 helped Muslims to transfer their accounts from Indian to Pakistani banks.

The two sides need to work on resumption of backchannel diplomacy, which could help in mitigating mistrust.

The most significant agreement in the early years was the Nehru-Liaquat Agreement, which was signed in 1950, which not only ensured greater rights for minorities in both countries but also eased tensions between both states. From 1951 to 1957, four trade agreements and two agreements related to connectivity not only boosted trade activities between the two countries, but also eased cross-border travel.
From 1958 to 1978, the two countries signed 20 additional agreements, pacts and protocols. While some of those agreements were cooperative in nature such as the landmark Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) of 1960, the majority of the agreements were meant to repair the bilateral relationship, damaged due to the 1965 and 1971 wars.
Islamabad and New Delhi signed 35 out of 47 agreements, protocols, or pacts, during democratic tenures in Pakistan. In fact, Delhi signed several agreements with Pakistani democratic regimes to repair the already damaged relationship during military rule.
These include resumption of rail and air connectivity, ease of visa issuance of 1974, normalisation of trade activities of 1974, resumption of shipping activities of 1975, etc. Similarly, during the 1990s — a troubled but democratic decade in Pakistan — Islamabad and Delhi signed six significant agreements, including the Lahore Declaration of 1999.
However, the 25 years of the 21st century turned the already fragile and complicated relationship into one of perpetual hostility, with no light at the end of the tunnel. During this period, the two sides only reduced bilateral engagements. During this period, the frequency of armed clashes and cross-border firing has substantially increased.
Today, the consistent refusal of Delhi to engage in dialogue with Pakistan and limited armed conflicts in 2019 and 2025 have not only minimised space for dialogue, but also redefined priorities of the two states. The two sides, apparently, are preparing for an eventual ‘South Asian Armageddon’.
The latest ‘Modi Doctrine’ might bring this ‘South Asian Armageddon’ more quickly than expected. The ‘Modi Doctrine’ outlines three broader parameters, ie, a) if there is a terrorist attack in India, a befitting reply will be given; b) India will not tolerate any ‘nuclear blackmail’; c) India will not differentiate between the government of Pakistan and the ‘masterminds’ of terrorism. This doctrine has brought the threshold of conflict to the lowest point in history between the two countries.
Similarly, Pakistan has a rare consensus at the civil and military leadership level that any attempt to divert the water flow will be considered an act of war. Moreover, the ‘surgical strikes strategy’ of 2019 and ‘Modi Doctrine’ of 2025 have forced Islamabad to shift its strategic posture from ‘defensive defence’ to ‘offensive defence’, where pre-emptive strikes could be one of the options to minimise the Indian threat at times of conflict. This is why both states are eagerly buying arms, improving defence capabilities and trying to technologically maintain a strategic edge.
Missed opportunities
While there is a long list of attempts by the international community, as well as the Pakistani and Indian leadership to ease tensions between 1948 to 1998, two opportunities might have changed the fate of the people of the subcontinent: in 1999 and 2015 — both opportunities coming when the BJP and former PM Nawaz Sharif were in power.
There are two important factors that made these two peace gestures significant. First, A.B. Vajpayee and Narendra Modi were both leaders of BJP — a political party with a reputation for hard-line politics. Endorsement of any peace plan by these two leaders would have gained legitimacy in India.
Second, in 1999 Nawaz Sharif had two-thirds majority and in 2015 he was enjoying simple majority. Therefore, there were less chances of obstructions by other political forces in Pakistan.
The first historic opportunity emerged in 1999 when Vajpayee, an ideologue and seasoned politician, travelled by bus to Lahore and signed the Lahore Declaration. As per several accounts, Islamabad and Delhi could have changed the course of history from hostility to cooperation, but the Kargil crisis disrupted the process.
The second historic opportunity, which is often either ignored or overlooked in Pakistan, was Modi’s surprise visit to Lahore in 2015. Today Islamabad views Mr Modi’s entire tenure from 2014 to 2025 negatively.
However, the fact is that during Modi’s first two years in office, from 2014 to 2016, the Indian PM had a conciliatory approach towards Pakistan. He not only invited then-PM Nawaz Sharif to his oath-taking ceremony but also extended frequent pleasantries during that period. Pakistan could have built on the surprise visit of Modi but the Pathankot attack disrupted the entire process. While Pakistan denied any linkages to the attack, the pressure of Indian media, public sentiment and Modi’s altered perceptions changed Delhi’s posture towards Pakistan.
End of bilateralism
The India-Pakistan relationship is primarily heading towards the end of bilateralism. New Delhi has initiated a process to undo what was achieved through difficult negotiations in the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s. In 2019, Delhi not only ended cross-LoC trade but also revoked Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status of Pakistan. A few months later, in August 2019, it abrogated the special status of held Jammu and Kashmir, which Islamabad believed might lead to change in demographics in the disputed territory. Lately, Delhi has not only put the IWT in ‘abeyance’, but also expelled Pakistani citizens.
In response to India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, Pakistan suspended bilateral trade and downgraded diplomatic relations without a clear strategy on the objectives it sought to achieve.
Islamabad has repeatedly indicated revoking the Simla Agreement of 1972. Resultantly, the bilateral trade agreements, socio-cultural pacts, political and security arrangements are practically either suspended or ineffective.
Way forward
Soon after the fragile ceasefire in 2025 and in the presence of aggressive competing military doctrines, there should be no expectation of a major breakthrough between the two hostile neighbours.
At best, the two countries need to prioritise stability over peace, which could be achieved through a few baby steps. Steps such as resumption of visa services for patients and family reunions could lower hostilities, while easing the miseries of those whose families were divided by the border. The civil society of India and Pakistan needs to play an active role in developing peace constituencies on both sides.
In presence of fiery rhetoric, peace overtures by both governments will not be an easy task. Therefore, the two sides also need to work on resumption of backchannel diplomacy, which could help in mitigating mistrust.
The most recent successful example of backchannel diplomacy was in 2021, when India and Pakistan agreed to strictly implement the ceasefire understanding of 2003 on the LoC.
Perhaps Islamabad can appoint former PM Nawaz Sharif as an ‘ambassador of peace’. His goodwill and past experiences could create positive impact on India-Pakistan relationship.
Revival of Saarc could also open a channel of communication between the two countries. In 2004, the famous handshake between then-president Musharraf and Indian PM Vajpayee on the sidelines of the Saarc meeting resumed the process of composite dialogue. There is an utmost need for a joint counterterrorism framework between India and Pakistan to address concerns related to militancy.
From 1800 to 1945, European countries fought eight major wars and countless battles, yet eventually learned to coexist. Will India and Pakistan draw lessons from Europe’s model of coexistence without enduring eight major wars of their own, or are they destined to repeat that history?
Today, the challenge for Islamabad and Delhi is not improving ties but preventing further decline. Small steps toward normalisation could help the region achieve stability, if not peace. Are the leaders of both countries ready to take those steps?

According to media reports, during the meeting chaired by Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, some members questioned the sincerity of the party’s high command, accusing them of being “compromised”.
Reports also claimed that outspoken MNA Iqbal Afridi exchanged heated words with the leadership.
However, PTI leader Asad Qaiser denied any such development, claiming that all such reports were frivolous.

Asad Qaiser terms reports of rifts ‘frivolous’; MNA admits to expressing ‘difference of opinion’

Mr Afridi also told Dawn that he had merely expressed a difference of opinion, and it should not be portrayed as if he had shown mistrust in the leadership.
“It is a fact that the party has been facing the oppression of the state, and there can be a little difference of opinion in adapting strategy to tackle the situation,” Mr Afridi said.
“Such a difference of opinion is a routine matter. I believe that we are here (in the parliament) with only two objectives: to represent and address the issue of people of our constituencies and play a role to get the founding chairman Imran Khan released,” he added.
When asked if he opposed the party’s strategy, Mr Afridi said that a difference of opinion was usual even while making a decision to build a mosque.
“However, once a mosque is built, all people start saying prayers there. The same is the case within the PTI. I may disagree with the leadership’s opinion, but I am confident that our leaders, such as Asad Qaiser and Malik Amir Dogar, are genuinely committed to the PTI and our leader, Imran Khan. I have no grievances against them,” he said.
“All leaders of PTI try to talk in favo­­ur of Imran Khan and for his release. At least voters of my constituency again and again stress that I should speak for Imran Khan, but unfortunately, we are not allowed to speak on that topic in the parliament,” Mr Afridi explained.
ATA amendment
Meanwhile, PTI leaders on Wed­nes­day criticised the government for amen­ding the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA).
Party leader Sardar Latif Khosa said that Section 4 of the ATA was amended in violation of Article 10 of the Constitu­tion and against the fundamental rights.
He said that earlier, only a high court judge had the power to grant an additi­onal three months of detention, but the new amendment allows even a superintendent of police (SP) to extend detent­ion for three months. He feared that the law would be used against politicians.
Public Accounts Committee Chair­man Junaid Akbar also warned that the law could be applied against political parties.

First, the market acknowledges that there is money to be made by speaking to those people. Products appear, stories are told, marketing campaigns are tuned to resonate with them.
Second, mainstream politicians realise that there are careers to be built by engaging with the people who hold that belief, even if — until recently — doing so would have been considered toxic or fringe.
The belief now surging in this territory is that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza.
This has been well known to Genocide Scholars for a long time now. But awareness has now seeped into mainstream American society to a level that mainstream institutions are beginning to engage with it.
Nowhere is this clearer than in the US Senate — an institution not known for sudden swings of conscience. Back in April 2025, Bernie Sanders introduced two resolutions to cancel $8.8 billion in weapons sales to Israel. Only 15 Democratic senators backed him. It was a courageous stand for a small minority, but a minority nonetheless. The resolutions failed by huge margins: 82-15 and 83-15.

The belief now surging is that Israel is committing genocide.

Then, on July 30, something remarkable happened. Sanders came back with two new resolutions: one to block the sale of 20,000 assault rifles to Israel, the other to block $675 million in bombs. Both still failed — but the votes were 70-27 and 73-24. This time, a majority of Senate Democrats supported at least one of the measures.
 
 

What changed was political calculation. The senators could now see that more voters, including within their own base, view Israel’s actions in Gaza as not only wrong but as genocide. In April, siding with that view looked like a risky moral stand; by July, it was becoming a credential.
If politics moves with the polls, the market moves with the ticket sales. This summer’s runaway success at the box office, James Gunn’s Superman, offers a striking cultural parallel to the Senate floor’s shift. The film grossed over $580m worldwide, with $332m domestic — making it the highest-grossing solo Superman film ever and even surpassing Batman v Superman in US earnings.
Ordinarily, box office reporting focuses on franchise fatigue or marketing budgets. But much of the public conversation around Superman was about its political subtext. Online debates exploded over whether its fictional conflict — between the technologically advanced Boravia and the besieged land of Jahranpur — was an allegory for Israel and Gaza. On TikTok, edits framing Superman as “pro-Palestinian” or “anti-Zionist” racked up millions of views. On Letterboxd, users praised the film as “very anti-Israel” and “awesome to see from a major studio blockbuster”.
 
 

Whether Gunn intended this reading or not, the fact that a major studio tent pole could be interpreted this way — and still thrive commercially — suggests that studios no longer fear this audience. In fact, they may be starting to court it. If the market once punished films that could be read as sympathetic to Palestinians, today it seems ready to reward them. That is not the beginning of a movement; it’s the middle of one.
Markets respond to spending power; politicians to voters. But journalism, at its best, responds to audience engagements. For decades, mainstream US outlets have often reported on Gaza’s suffering in the sanitised language of ‘clashes’ and ‘conflicts’.
On July 30, Washington Post shattered that euphemistic habit; it published the names and ages of 18,500 children killed in Gaza since Oct 7, 2023, according to the Gaza health ministry. The list was searchable, sortable — human lives rendered visible in the most intimate way. Infants who never saw a sunrise outside of rubble. Teenagers who once dreamt of becoming doctors, poets, athletes.
The impact was visceral. Numbers in headlines can feel abstract; names do not. By giving each child an identity, the Post moved the conversation from casualty figures to human loss.
It was a statement, perhaps unspoken but unmistakable, that the deaths of these children are not the unfortunate byproduct of a legitimate war. They are the destruction of a people’s future. In editorial rooms, decisions like this are not made lightly.
That the Post chose to publish it now speaks to a confidence that their readership will not only tolerate but demand this degree of unflinching coverage. That confidence is rooted in the changing beliefs of their audience.
What ties these three episodes together is the simple arithmetic of belief. In April, 15 Democratic senators sided with the view that US weapons should not flow to a country committing what many of their constituents call genocide. By July, that number had grown to over 20.
In cinema, the audience willing to embrace or at least tolerate a politically charged allegory has proven large enough to make Superman one of the year’s biggest hits. In journalism, one of America’s most influential papers has judged that giving a name to each child killed will not alienate its readership — it will inform them.
Public opinion data supports this. Polls in the US over the past year have shown rising numbers, es­­p­e­­cially among younger Americans, who believe Is­­rael is committing genocide in Gaza. Among De­­mo­crats under 35, the figure has climbed into a clear majority. The belief has moved from activist circles into the political and cultural mainstream. In marketing, when you lose the youth you lose the future.
The most telling part is not that this is happening but how quickly it is happening. For decades, unflinching support for Israel was a bipartisan art­icle of faith in Washington. In just a few months, the Senate has recorded historic votes, the box of­­fice has crowned an unexpected champion, and one of the nation’s premier newspapers has memorialised Gaza’s dead with the intimacy of a family album.
The tide is turning, and with it, the incentives that shape politics and culture. Israel’s days of securing unconditional support from the West are numbered.
Once the institutions of America’s mainstream politics, entertainment and journalism learn there is money to be made, votes to be secured, readers to be found, by engaging with those who see Israel’s actions in Gaza as genocide, the momentum can become unstoppable.

A three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and comprising Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, was hearing the appeal against the IHC’s Aug 4 short order.
At the outset, when senior counsel Farooq H. Naek, representing Bahria Town, came to the rostrum for arguments, the CJP suggested that he refer to the original bench, which earlier heard the matter.
On Aug 8, a different three-judge bench consisting of Justice Aminuddin Khan, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Siddiqui heard the matter during which Justice Afghan wondered why auction of the property developer was being rushed in haste when culmination of trials in the pending references against Zain Malik will determine confiscation of attached properties.
On Wednesday, Mr Naek stated that since the detailed judgement of the high court had come, he would prefer to furnish additional submissions in the light of that verdict.
At this, the CJP decided to adjourn further proceedings for an indefinite period to provide the counsel ample opportunity for submitting additional arguments before the apex court.
In its 14-page detailed judgement, the IHC held that the orders passed by the Islamabad’s Accountability Court No. 1 was quite in accordance with law and warrants no interference by the high court.
As a result, the petitions moved by the Bahria Town were dismissed.
Authored by IHC Chief Justice Sardar Muhammad Sarfraz Dogar, the verdict recalled that the Bahria Town had claimed that it was an independent entity and was not responsible for any act or deed of any of its shareholders and that it was never declared a proclaimed offender.
But the judgement recalled that Sections 87 and 89 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) allow attachment of the properties of an absconding accused as a coercive measure to compel his appearance.
If the absconder fails to comply with the proclamation as per Section 88 of CrPC, the court can order the attachment of his movable and immovable property, including sealing bank accounts, seizing assets and restricting transactions, the IHC said.
The attachment under Section 88 of CrPC was not punitive but coercive, with the sole aim of securing the attendance of the accused before the court, the high court order said, highlighting that in the case at hand, the accused Malik Riaz Hussain and Ahmad Ali Riaz were declared proclaimed offenders on Jan 6, 2024.

Though products of the same colonial legacy, India and Pakistan have developed fundamentally different approaches to ecological governance.
Genesis: Both embarked upon their sustainability journeys after the 1972 Stockholm Conference, where they were represented by Indira Gandhi and Nusrat Bhutto respectively. Their responses established divergent trajectories. India created a National Council for Environmental Policy and Planning, culminating in the 42nd constitutional amendment in 1976.
This embedded environmental protection in state responsibilities through Article 48A and made it a citizen duty via Article 51A(g). The foundation provided an enduring strategic framework guiding policy through multiple political transitions.
Progression continued with legislative milestones. The Water and Air Pollution Control Acts established regulatory bodies and created the Central and State Pollution Control Boards. The 73rd and 74th Amendments created the three-tiered Panchayati Raj systems, integrating governance structures from national to village levels. Each step built upon previous foundations.
Pakistan chose administrative action over constitutional amendment. It creating an Urban Affairs Division in 1972, which focused on urban pollution. However, the UAD remained largely inactive for two decades. It has since been reorganised at least six times under different names or mandates.

Environmental challenges require patience that comes from clear direction.

Later legislation — the Environmental Prot­ection Ordinance (1983) and Act (1997) — represented guidance by iconic environmental leaders like Dr Parvez Hassan but lacked the components of a coherent, long-term strategy. The superior courts then stepped in, expansively interpreting ‘right to life’ of Article 9 to include environmental rights in the landmark 1994 Shehla Zia vs Wapda case.
While this judicial innovation provided the foundation for environmental jurisprudence, it also highlighted the absence of clear executive and legislative direction in policy development.
Pakistan demonstrated early climate leadership by chairing the G-77 at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. The country pioneered climate justice through the 2015 Leghari case, becoming the first nation to establish climate change as a fundamental rights issue. Pakistan’s ’Ten Billion Tree Tsu­nami’ was one of the world’s most ambitious reforestation programmes, while significant renewable energy additions of over 1,300 MW since 2015 showed progress towards the 30 per cent renewables target by 2030.
Institutional evolution: India’s federal structures enabled expansion of ecological capabilities, with the central ministry providing national coordination and states developing complementary frameworks. This approach created space for synergies with initiatives like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which simultaneously provides livelihood security while protecting biodiversity and enhancing climate adaptation through water conservation and watershed management.
However, India’s system faces significant challenges. Implementation gaps persist between constitutional mandates and ground reality, with persistent air quality crises in Delhi and major cities, along with industrial water contamination.
Enfor­cement varies dramatically between states, while federal-state coordination complexities create bureaucratic delays. Courts sometimes substitute for policymaking through judicial activism, creating inconsistent governance patterns that undermine the systematic approach that constitutional clarity was meant to provide. Several state-level climate action plans remain unimplemented.
Pakistan’s institutional journey is a different story. Repeated restructuring consumed valuable time and energy while disrupting institutional memory and stakeholder relationships.
The 18th Amendment devolved powers to the provinces without adequate coordination mechanisms. While decentralisation offered benefits, implementation created fragmentation challenges. The 2017 Climate Change Act attempted to recentralise functions by creating an authority, thus undermining federal ministry mandates and creating duplication.
It added to federal-provincial tensions that remain unresolved in climate-related policy documents: National Climate Change Policy, Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plan, Policy Guidelines for Trading in Carbon Markets, National Climate Finance Strategy and Pakistan Green Taxonomy. Despite the challenges, Pakistan has come up with notable innovations.
Resource mobilisation: India’s constitutional mandate facilitated integration of sustainability considerations into domestic budgeting, enabling resource allocation that has grown. International cooperation supplements rather than substitutes domestic investment, maintaining autonomy in policy direction.
Pakistan’s financing shows a drift through external dependency, though the country recently initiated budget-tagging. Provin­cial programmes remain underfunded, creating cycles where donor preferences override national goals. This dependency exposes challenges in boosting sustainable domestic capabilities.
India’s enforcement benefits from frameworks created with constitutional clarity and systematic institutional development. Courts operate within the established law, providing interpretation that supports long-term planning. Despite enforcement challenges, the approach perhaps creates cumulative improvements in compliance and institutional capacity. Pakistan’s enforcement reflects a broader strategic drift. The judiciary plays a central role, filling gaps left by inadequate policy frameworks. While the environmental protection tribunals represent innovation, they operate within uncertain policy direction parameters and insufficient resources, resulting in crisis-driven enforcement.
The strategic compass: The basic difference lies in strategic direction: clear guidance enabling ins­titutions to navigate challenges while maintaining progress. India’s constitutional framework provi­ded this compass. Pakistan’s journey, despite im­­pressive institutional innovation and policy creativity, lacks consistent long-term direction.
This creates patterns of starting initiatives, changing course and restarting. Both countries face mounting pressures requiring sustained responses. Pak­istan’s experience demonstrates that success dep­ends on developing strategic clarity to guide consistent progress.
The tale of these two environmental journeys demonstrates that in governance, as in navigation, knowing your destination and staying the course may be more important than the speed of travel. Environmental challenges require patience that comes from clear direction. As both countries face mounting pressures from transboundary climate challenges, the need for strategic clarity becomes even more critical for their shared environmental future.

The debate — fuelled by Islamabad’s chronic fiscal stress — is sustained by the belief that reducing revenue transfers to the provinces would provide an easy, if contentious, fix to the federal government’s fiscal woes. It is argued that the centre has to bear major expenses such as debt payments, defence needs, large infrastructure development, subsidies, social protection, etc, while the provinces get the majority share from the federal divisible pool.
Many also say that the enhanced NFC transfers have lulled the provinces into a state of fiscal complacency, leading to weak revenue-generation efforts. There has also been criticism that the provinces spend the funds to gain political mileage for the ruling parties, instead of investing in the social sector or public service delivery.
It is against this background that PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari has demanded a new NFC award — in accordance with the 18th Amendment, which devolved several ministries, departments and functions from the centre to the provinces.
 
 

He said the previous award preceded the amendment, and that since devolution had increased the responsibilities of the provinces, they should have more resources. This implies a demand for further raising the provincial share from the divisible pool from the present 57.5pc. He also spoke about the deteriorating security situation in Balochistan to reinforce his case for a bigger provincial share from federal revenue transfers, and blamed the FBR’s incompetence for not collecting enough taxes to address federal fiscal woes, saying this burden could not be shared by the provinces.
Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s demand is consistent with his party’s politics: the PPP played a dominant role in both the 2009 NFC award and passage of the 18th Amendment, and deserves credit for resisting repeated attempts to reverse fiscal devolution and alter the existing revenue-sharing framework.
However, whatever differences of opinion there may be, there is no doubt that the NFC award does require an overhaul — not to shrink the provincial pie but to make the framework operate effectively and efficiently for citizens.
For this to happen, the centre and provinces must engage in meaningful discussions to devolve powers and transfer fiscal resources further down to the third tier of governance — the local governments. Equally important are changes in the formula for resource distribution among the provinces.
The disproportionate emphasis on population should be reduced in favour of indicators such as poverty, regional backwardness and disparities, and, more importantly, provincial revenue generation efforts to ensure quality public service delivery and promote more equitable and sustainable economic development.

Mufti Munir Shakir, founder of the banned Lashkar-i-Islam, was killed in a blast outside his seminary in Urmar area on the outskirts of the provincial capital on March 15 this year.
They said the department identified the gang involved in this heinous act while efforts were under way to apprehend the culprits in the near future.
The CTD officials, while briefing media-persons said that it busted a group of militants responsible for no fewer than 18 terrorist incidents in the settled areas of the provincial capital, adding that those attacks include the martyrdom of deputy superintendent of police Sardar Hussain Khan and 14 other police officials of various ranks.

Officials reveal terrorists using digital currency for extortion; propose seminary registration should be subject to CTD’s consent

They said that following interrogation from arrested terrorists involved in several terrorist activities, CTD recovered a substantial cache of arms, ammunition, and explosive material, including IEDs, adding that the timely action also led to securing of at least six sensitive installations that had already been subjected to reconnaissance by militants and were in the final stages of planning an attack.
 
 

“CTD has identified the gang responsible for the targeted killing of religious scholars, enabling focused follow-up operations to apprehend the culprits,” they said.
Also, the CTD officials, who didn’t want to be named, claimed to have busted the Daesh Khorasan network directly responsible for the suicide attack in Peshawar city on 11 May, 2025, some four kilometres from a JUI-F gathering being addressed by Maulana Fazlur Rehman at Mufti Mehmood Markaz on Ring Road, on outskirts of the provincial capital.
While briefing journalists, CTD revealed that apart from currency notes and bank transactions, terrorist organisations received extortion money through digital currency as well.
The CTD officials told reporters here that apart from Afghanistan, people also received extortion calls from Saudi mobile numbers.
“They [militants] now seek extortion money in digital currency — Bitcoin,” a senior CTD official said, adding that the terrorist organisations generated finances not only from extortion but from drug smuggling as well.
Also, the CTD officials said that the terrorists were involved in online propaganda on several social media platforms and the department had established contact directly with the organisations owning the Apps, adding that the department had proposed to the government to establish counter cyber terrorism police stations.
“CTD also wants empowerment under Prevention of Electronic Crime Act,” they said, adding that the counter violent extremism policy was in the final stage. The CTD officials said that the religious seminaries and their registration should be subject to the approval of the CTD, adding that they had proposed empowering the deputy commissioners to registrar the religious seminaries under Societies Registration Act 1860.
They also said that they had been facing issues while arresting the accused persons in the merged districts, as it took years to arrest one person, adding that the department wanted powers under a mix of Frontier Crimes Regulations 1901 and Police Act 2017.
“We have 44 special weapon and tactics (SWAT) teams for each district. All these teams are equipped with modern gadgets,” they said, adding that capacity building of the department was under way with an explosives handling and analysis laboratory.
They said the prosecution department had developed enough expertise and the bail refusal ratio, which was 6 per cent in 2022, had gone up to 34pc in 2025, adding that 25pc was the conviction rate in 2025 as compared to 23pc in 2022.
They informed reporters that ratio of logically concluding cases was 13pc in 2022, which had gone up to 34pc in 2025, adding that 11 scientists were recruited for forensic laboratory with latest technology to be adopted in the near future.

In Gulmit, Gojal, Hunza, a powerful torrent surged through the Juchar nullah on Tuesday evening, triggered by accelerated glacier melt.
The floodwaters destroyed a women-owned restaurant, a government tourist facilitation centre, orchards, farmland, and critical infrastructure including electricity and internet poles, according to Rescue 1122 officials.
A bridge and sections of the KKH were swept away, leaving no alternative route for locals and tourists travelling to and from China via the Khunjerab Pass. 



 
“Never experienced such intensity of floods in the nullah,” Saeed Jan, a local resident, told Dawn.
The destruction of a fibre optic line has left the area without mobile and internet services, while rising water in the Khunjerab River damaged a power transmission line near Sost, plunging communities into darkness.
Efforts to reopen the highway have been repeatedly hampered by rising water levels and mudflows, with even foot crossings for patients and travellers now deemed impossible.
In Hunza’s Hassanabad, erosion linked to outburst flooding from the Shishper glacier continued on Wednesday, dismantling two more houses and putting others at risk.
Power to Roshanabad Mohallah was cut after an electricity pole collapsed. With a section of the KKH already washed away, traffic is being diverted through the Sas valley in Nagar. 



 
Flash floods also struck Shigar district, damaging homes and property in Dogoro village of Basha, while a glof in the Horchas nullah damaged crops and blocked the road leading to K2, according to local officials.



 
Faizullah Faraq, spokesperson for the Gilgit-Baltistan government, said rehabilitation work is underway across affected areas, but warned that climate change-induced disasters “have changed the map of Gilgit-Baltistan”, with high river flows, erosion, and landslides complicating repairs.
“Passengers and vehicles are waiting for the road to be restored on both sides of the KKH,” he said, adding that the chief minister has ordered efforts to be expedited in Shigar, Ghizer, Hunza, Gilgit, Astore, Diamer, and other districts.
Evacuations in Kasur
Meanwhile, in Punjab, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has ordered the immediate evacuation of people living along the banks of the Sutlej River in Kasur district, warning of significant flooding as a powerful monsoon spell approaches.
The flow of the Sutlej is expected to increase next week, coinciding with the seventh and strongest spell of monsoon rains this season, which has already been linked to 164 deaths across Punjab.
“There is a possibility of further increase in the flow of the Sutlej River next week, and citizens are requested to immediately move to safer places,” PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said, during his emergency visit to Kasur.
The PDMA director convened a high-level meeting at the deputy commissioner’s office in Kasur to address the potential flood situation.
Officials are racing to clear storm drains and reinforce embankments, with the upcoming monsoon forecast to bring intense rainfall from August 13-17 in upper Punjab, followed by extended downpours in other areas from August 18-21.
Major urban centres including Lahore, Faisalabad, Gujranwala, and Sialkot face threats of urban flooding, while the PDMA has also warned of landslides in Murree and Galliyat. 



 
The monsoon season has so far killed at least 164 people, 582 rain-related injuries, damaged 216 homes, and resulted in the loss of 121 livestock, according to recent data.
River monitoring stations show low-level flooding on the Indus River at Kalabagh, Tarbela, and Chashma, with Tarbela Dam currently at 96 per cent capacity.
Kasur Deputy Commissioner Imran Ali said comprehensive preparations have been made to handle a potential flood, with de-silting of drains underway, machinery available, and staff deployed. “Adequate arrangements have been completed to deal with the flood situation at all sensitive places,” he said.

All major bazaars and business centres in Khar, Inayat Kalley, Sadiqabad, Raghagan, Pashat, Haji Lawang, Yousafabad, Nawagai, Lowi Sam, Umary and Qazafi reopened in the morning after the district administration notified an end to the 48-hour curfew late on Tuesday.
“The general public is hereby informed that major roads in the district, including Khar- Munda road, Khar-Nawagai road and Khar-Sadiqabad-Inayat Kallay roads will reopen from tomorrow [Wednesday], allowing citizens to resume their daily activities , while bazaars and trade centres along these routes will also function normally from Wednesday,” read the notification shared on the Facebook page of the deputy commissioner.
The notification came an hour after heads of trade bodies, including those from Khar and Inayat Kalley, announced on social media that they would reopen their business centres on Wednesday regardless of curbs, as they could no longer “tolerate the baseless restrictions.”

Residents protest civilian killings in mortar shelling

The lifting of the curfew restored business activities and transport services on both inter- and intra-district routes but also led to the reopening of educational institutions, which had been closed for the last two days.
 
 

However, curfew will remain in place in around 27 selective areas of both Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils until August 14 due to the ongoing ‘targeted’ military offensive Operation Sarbakaf against terrorists, which entered its third consecutive day on Wednesday.
According to residents, security forces backed by gunship helicopters and artillery targeted terrorist hideouts in the areas on Wednesday.
However, loss of life on the terrorists’ side in the ongoing operation was not reported by officials on Wednesday evening. Provincial Inspector General of Police Zulfqar Hameed said it was an intelligence-based operation aimed at “eliminating terrorist threats to peace” in the region.
Meanwhile, scores of people from Lowi Mamund tehsil staged a demonstration on Wednesday against the killing of three members of a family after a mortar shell allegedly hit a house in the Erab area on Tuesday evening.
The demonstration held in the Bad-i-Siah area began after the funeral prayers of the deceased were performed. People from all walks of life, mostly youth, showed up defying the curfew.
Participants expressed grave concern over deaths in the mortar shelling, which, they said, killed a woman and two children and wounded two family members.
Bajaur Aman Jirga chief and JI local chapter emir Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, PTI local MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman, former MNA Gul Zafar Khan, Malik Khalid Khan, Najibullah Khan Mamund and JI youth wing leader Irfan Janbaz addressed the gathering and such incidents were unacceptable.
They said authorities promised to avoid the targeting of civilian population in the ongoing operation.
“We were told by authorities that it would be an operation targeting terrorists who posed a threat to peace in the region and its residents,” said a speaker.
The speakers demanded avoiding civilian casualties in the operation, lifting of the curfew and restoration of mobile phone and internet services in the region without delay.
They said that they would launch a massive protest demonstration if their demands were not met immediately.
The demonstration, which continued for a couple of hours, was also addressed by Ibrahim, the head of the affected family, who shared details of the mortar shelling.
Earlier, members of Bajaur Aman Jirga met at Bajaur Press Club Khar and condemned the killing of three people in the incident.
The participants, who also included political, religious and youth leaders, discussed the prevailing law and order situation in the district amid the ongoing operation against terrorists in several areas of Lower and Upper Mamund tehsils.
The meeting chaired by head of the jirga Sahibzada Haroon Rashid, was addressed by ANP MPA Mohammad Nisar Khan, PTI MPA Dr Hamidur Rehaman, former MNA Gul Zafar Khan, ANP president Gul Afzal Khan, religious scholar Maulana Ihsanul Haq, ANP senior leader Sheikh Janzada, PPP president Haji Sher Bahadur and PML-N president Malik Gul Kareem Khan.
The meeting was later joined by ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain and a delegation of his party, who said the killing of civilians not only violated the authorities’ promise but also sparked unrest among residents.
They said that they were not against the action against terrorists as it was vital to clear the area of anti-peace elements but they were opposed to the killing of civilians.
The participants called for an investigation into the incident and said civilians should not be targeted in the future.
ANP leader Iftikhar Hussain expressed his party’s solidarity with the people of Bajaur and called for immediate halt to military action in the district and other parts of the province.
Accompanied by party provincial general secretary Hussain Shah Yousafzai, joint secretary Hamid Toofan and other leaders, Mian Iftikhar said the ANP was deeply concerned about the prevailing poor law and order situation across the province and that the peace march scheduled in Islamabad on August 23 would determine the party’s plan of action to address issues.
Later, the ANP provincial president, along with other leaders and activists, visited relief camps set up for displaced persons, including those on the Bajaur Sports Complex in Khar, and learned from inhabitants about their issues.
Senior officials of the district administration, PDMA and health department briefed visitors about the facilities being provided to displaced persons in camps.

CAIRO: Over 120 people were killed as Israel’s military pounded Gaza City on Wednesday prior to a planned takeover, while Hamas held further talks with Egyptian mediators.
The death toll was the worst in a week and added to the massive fatalities from the nearly two-year conflict that has shattered the enclave housing more than two million Palestinians.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated an idea — also enthusiastically floated by US President Donald Trump — that Palestinians should simply leave.
“They’re not being pushed out, they’ll be allowed to exit,” he told Israeli television channel i24NEWS. “All those who are concerned for the Palestinians and say they want to help the Palestinians should open their gates and stop lecturing us.”

Netanyahu restates idea that Palestinians should leave enclave

Arabs and many world leaders are aghast at the idea of displacing the Gaza population, which Palestinians say would be like another “Nakba” (catastrophe) when hundreds of thousands fled or were forced out in 1948.
Israel’s planned re-seizure of Gaza City, which it took in October 2023 before withdrawing weeks later, is probably weeks away, officials say. That means a ceasefire is still possible, though talks have been floundering and conflict still rages.
 
 

Israeli planes and tanks bombed eastern areas of Gaza City heavily, with many homes destroyed in the Zeitoun and Shejaia neighbourhoods. Al Ahli hospital said 12 people were killed in an air strike on a home in Zeitoun.
Tanks also destroyed several houses in the east of Khan Yunis in south Gaza too.
Starvation and malnutrition
Eight more people, including three children, died of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza over the past two days, the territory’s health ministry said. That took the total to 235, including 106 children, since the conflict began.
Israel disputes those malnutrition and hunger figures reported by the health ministry in the Hamas-run enclave.
Hamas chief negotiator Khalil Al Hayya’s meetings with Egyptian officials in Cairo on Wednesday were to focus on stopping the bombardment, delivering aid and “ending the suffering of our people in Gaza”, Hamas official Taher al Nono said in a statement.
 
 

Egyptian security sources said the talks would also discuss the possibility of a comprehensive ceasefire that would see Hamas relinquish governance in Gaza and submit its weapons.
A Hamas official said the group was open to all ideas if Israel ends the bombing and pulls out. However, “laying down arms before the occupation is dismissed is impossible”, the official said.
Global outcry
The Israeli prime minister’s plan to expand military control over Gaza, which Israeli sources said could be launched in October, has heightened global outcry over the widespread devastation, displacement and hunger in the enclave.
Twenty-four nations this week decried the “unimaginable levels” of suffering and urged Israel to allow unrestricted aid.
The Israeli military said nearly 320 trucks entered Gaza through the Kerem Shalom and Zikim crossings on Wednesday and that a further 320 trucks were collected and distributed by the UN and international organisations along with three tankers of fuel and 97 pallets of air-dropped aid.
But the UN and Palestinians say aid remains far from sufficient.
Arab states and much of the international community want Gaza to be governed by the Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited governance in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
The authority’s foreign minister, Varsen Aghabekian Shahin, told reporters it was ready to assume full responsibility in Gaza. Hamas would have no role and be required to hand over arms, she added, calling for an international peacekeeping force and withdrawal by Israel.
Israel says it does not trust the PA to rule Gaza.

According to a notification, the committee has been mandated to discuss the water and power issues and submit its report immediately after the meeting for the prime minister’s consideration and decision.
It has been tasked with proposing an immediate solution, implementable within four to five days, for uninterrupted water supply to Gwadar city from both the 7.5MGD water supply scheme and 1.2 MGD seawater desalination plant, as well as a mid-term solution, to be implemented within four to five months, for uninterrupted power and water supply to Gwadar district.
 
 

Both plans must clearly assign responsibilities to ministers and executing agencies with fixed timelines.
The committee comprises Federal Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, the federal ministers for maritime affairs and energy, federal secretaries of planning and development, maritime affairs and energy (power division), Balochistan chief secretary, chairmen of the Gwadar Port Authority and Gwadar Development Authority, Quetta Electric Supply Company chief executive officer, Umar Cheema and former CEO of Sky Electric Amin Sukhera.

“Once we have enough countries agreeing to this, the [UN Environment Programme] secretariat will be forced to put it on the agenda,” said the climate minister.
Going through the treaty’s text with a fine-tooth comb, he found it confounding that there was no mechanism to show how the polluters would pay to countries that were getting polluted, he said, giving the example of small island nations which generate less plastic waste, but get ashore anyway from the rest of the world. He also asked developed nations to stop exporting their plastic waste to “countries like Pakistan” and using them as “junkyards”.
 
 

Interestingly, in his address at the informal ministerial dialogue on investment opportunities for a plastic circular economy, he said, “When I look at the green financing, I find that the same countries that are consuming plastics are the countries that are getting green financing,”, putting the blame squarely on countries with a bigger plastic footprint.

Musadik Malik says he is ‘extremely disappointed’ at UN system, as plastic talks remain stalled

Talking to a packed hall, he warned, “Injustice is unsustainable and if we do injustice to nature; it is not going to care… it will retaliate, and we shall all suffer.”
Giving the example of coal, he added, “We are all interwoven as one global village, or so I believed, up until the geopolitical tectonic plates moved. And when they moved and some countries started to use coal once again, other countries were forbidden from using it. I find that perplexing… how can coal in one country be black and another country be orange with yellow polka dots. So sometimes, naive as I am, I don’t get the geopolitics of the world. The plastics [pollution] is, frankly, no different.”
“I told them to listen to us; we’re not voiceless and don’t ramrod us,” he told Dawn over the phone from Geneva.
‘Race to the bottom’
Billed as the most important environmental deal since the 2015 Paris climate accord, the 10-day summit with delegates from 184 countries has yet to agree on a definition of “plastic pollution” itself.
“They’re just squabbling over where the semi-colon is going to be placed; the number of brackets in the text continues to grow; no wonder nothing gets done,” said Dr Malik.
He was not the only one. European Union environment chief Jessika Roswall found there to be “more square brackets in the text than plastic in the sea”.
Dr Malik said he was extremely disappointed with the way the UN system works. “Is this how you deal with matters that affect the lives and livelihood of people?”
From Geneva, Rachel Radvany, environmental health campaigner at the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL), told Dawn: “What was meant to be a global effort to solve the plastics crisis has stalled.”
She further said, “As in the climate space, it’s the countries least responsible for the problem that are fighting the hardest for an ambitious treaty… while producers are in a race to the bottom, with some even questioning whether the treaty is about plastic.”
“The written jargon-infested statements were benign to say the least; everyone agreeing and endorsing each other that the world needs to do something about the plastic waste, yet offering not a single solution,” said Dr Malik, adding that it had been exhausting.

A special ceremony was held in Islamabad’s Jinnah Sports Stadium with senior civil and military leadership in attendance. Among the senior dignitaries present at the event were President Asif Ali Zardari, Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, Deputy PM and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Senate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq, Inter-Services Public Relations Director-General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, federal and state ministers, and foreign officials.
Addressing the event, PM Shehbaz said: “The time has come for us to move beyond political division, personal interest and empty slogans to adopt collective thinking for Pakistan. On this great day today, I once again, with an open heart, invite all political parties, stakeholders and civil society to become part of Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan.”
He said this was not a plan to revive the ‘Charter of Economy’ but in the greater national interest so the whole world could see that “differences have their own place but we are all one for the sake of our beloved Pakistan”.
The prime minister said the country would not give space to another ‘fitna’ after the many sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, adding that everyone had the right to protest, to criticise and to conduct politics, but not to riot and vandalise, to defame and curse and to rebel against the state.
The premier paid tribute to the nation’s founders and ideologues whose “leadership and efforts changed history and geography” and to the country’s armed forces for their performance in May’s military conflict against India, saying that country was dealt a “historic lesson” that its future generations would remember “for eternity”.
PM Shehbaz also thanked Pakistan’s allies for their support and solidarity on the international arena amid the tensions with India.
“I am also grateful to US President Donald Trump and his team for playing a strong role in the ceasefire. I am hopeful that for regional peace, Trump will play his role in peacefully resolving the Kashmir issue in accordance with UN resolutions.”
The prime minister said that while celebrating independence and Marka-i-Haq, Pakistanis must think about those still struggling for their freedom, whether it was in “Gaza’s blood-soaked streets or in occupied Kashmir, where the blood of innocent Kashmiris runs and turns the rivers red”.
He added, “Pakistan clearly states that it will stand with its oppressed brothers and sisters. What is happening to the Palestinians is a test of our humanity. Pakistan will fight … until our Palestinian and Kashmiri brethren get their rights.”
The prime minister subsequently unveiled a digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.

Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal had said last month that this year’s Independence Day would be celebrated under the banner of “Marka-i-Haq” (Battle of Truth) to demonstrate the nation’s resilience, progress and pride.
The Pakistan Army had named the period of conflict with India since the April 22 Pahalgam attack to the May 10 conclusion of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos as “Marka-i-Haq” in May.
The military confrontation between India and Pakistan came as the former blamed Islamabad for the April 22 Pahalgam attack without evidence. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week. It took a US-brokered ceasefire for both sides to finally agree to cessation of hostilities.</p><small>2025-08-13 20:07</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618708-bhc-admits-petition-challenging-cellular-internet-shutdown-in-balochistan' target='_blank'><strong>BHC admits petition challenging cellular, internet shutdown in Balochistan</strong></a><br><p>

“If the first one goes okay, we’ll have a quick second one,” Trump told reporters. “I would like to do it almost immediately, and we’ll have a quick second meeting between President Putin and President Zelensky and myself, if they’d like to have me there.”
Trump did not provide a timeframe for a second meeting. He is to meet Putin in Anchorage, Alaska on Friday.
Trump also said Russia would face consequences if Putin did not agree to stop the war.
“Yes, they will,” he said.
He did not spell out the consequences, but he has warned of stiff economic sanctions if no breakthrough can be achieved.
Trump spoke after holding talks via telephone with European leaders and Zelenskiy about his meeting with Putin.
“We had a very good call. He was on the call. President Zelensky was on the call. I would rate it a 10, very friendly,” he said.
Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron said that Trump said that Ukraine must be involved in talks about territory in any ceasefire deal with Russia.
The comments were the first indication of what came out of talks between Trump, European leaders and Zelensky, intended to shape Trump’s meeting with Putin in Alaska on Friday.

Trump’s insistence on involving Ukraine, if confirmed, could bring a measure of relief to Kyiv and its allies, who have feared that Trump and Putin could reach a deal that sells out Europe’s and Ukraine’s security interests and proposes to carve up Ukraine’s territory.
Trump and Putin are due to meet in Alaska on Friday for talks on how to end the three-and-a-half-year-old conflict, the biggest in Europe since World War Two. Trump has said both sides will have to swap land to end the fighting that has cost tens of thousands of lives and displaced millions.
On a day of intense diplomacy, Zelensky flew into Berlin for German-hosted virtual meetings with European leaders and then with Trump. The Europeans worry that a land swap could leave Russia with almost a fifth of Ukraine and embolden Putin to expand further west into the future.
Putin is bluffing: Zelensky
Zelensky said that he warned Trump ahead of his talks with Putin that the Russian leader was “bluffing” about his desire to end the war.
“I told the US president and all our European colleagues that Putin is bluffing,” he said at a joint briefing in Berlin with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz. “He is trying to apply pressure before the meeting in Alaska along all parts of the Ukrainian front. Russia is trying to show that it can occupy all of Ukraine.”

Zelensky’s comments, made after a virtual call with Trump and European leaders, come as Russian forces step up pressure on the battlefield in eastern Ukraine, aiming to force Kyiv to give up land.
Zelensky, who said he hoped the main topic of the talks in Alaska would be an immediate ceasefire, added that any discussions regarding territory should be covered during a three-leader meeting.
“Regarding our principles and territorial integrity, in the end, this is all decided at the level of leaders,” he said. “Without Ukraine, it is impossible to decide this. And, by the way, everyone also supports this.”
Zelensky said Trump told him he would debrief him about his talks with Putin.</p><small>2025-08-13 17:06</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13173032fd5626c.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930667/na-passes-ata-amendments-allowing-3-month-preventive-detention-of-terror-suspects' target='_blank'><strong>NA passes ATA amendments allowing 3-month ‘preventive detention’ of terror suspects</strong></a><br><p>The National Assembly on Wednesday passed an amendment to the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997, which reinserted powers granted to law enforcement authorities and the armed forces to detain “suspicious” individuals for up to three months.
Section 11EEEE (preventive detention for inquiry) of the ATA was amended in 2014, providing the government and authorised armed forces and civil armed forces with the authority to conduct preventive detention of individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activities. However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to two years, which expired in 2016.
In November 2024, the government quietly introduced the bill in the NA, seeking to grant military and civil armed forces the authority to keep individuals facing terrorism charges in ‘preventive’ detention for up to three months.
The bill to amend the act was moved in parliament by Minister of State for Interior and Narcotics Control Tallal Chaudhry.
 






In its statement of objectives and reasons, the bill read that Section 11EEEE was amended in 2014, and was designed to empower law enforcement agencies to pre-emptively address security threats by detaining suspects for a period not exceeding three months to conduct thorough inquiries
“However, this amendment was subject to a sunset clause, limiting its validity to a period of two years, which expired in 2016,” the bill read.
“Further, the current security situation requires a robust response that goes beyond the existing legal framework. The erstwhile amendment of Section 11EEEE of the act, ibid, are required to be re-inserted to empower the government, armed forces, and civil armed forces with the necessary authority to detain individuals who pose a significant threat to national security,” it added.
“This provision would allow for the preventive detention of suspects based on credible information or reasonable suspicion, thereby disrupting terrorist plots before they can be executed. This will also provide law enforcement agencies with the legal backing to conduct more effective operations against terrorism,” the bill read. “It would facilitate the use of Joint Interrogation Teams (JITs), composed of members from various law enforcement and intelligence agencies, to conduct comprehensive inquiries and gather actionable intelligence.”
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, the House passed the bill through a clause-by-clause read. Earlier, the House adopted a motion to consider the bill with 125 votes in its favour and 59 against it.
A copy of the bill available with Dawn.com stated that in sub-section (1), the detention of a person arrested under Section 11EEEE, including detention exceeding three months, would be subject to the provisions of Article 10 (safeguards as to arrest and detention) of the Constitution.
The bill outlined an amendment to sub-section (1) of Clause 2 of Section 11EEEE, which reads as follows:
“The Government or, where the provisions of section 4 have been invoked, the armed forces or civil armed forces, as the case may be subject to the specific or general order of the Government in this regard, for a period not exceeding three months and after recording reasons thereof, issue order for the preventive detention of any person who has been concerned in any offence under this act relating to the security or defence of Pakistan or any part thereof, or public order relating to target killing, kidnapping for ransom, and extortion, bhatta, or the maintenance of supplies or services, or against whom a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists of his having been so concerned, for purpose of inquiry.”
Meanwhile, in sub-section 2, the following amendments were proposed:
“In sub-section (2), for the proviso, the following shall be substituted, namely:
provided that where the detention order has been issued by the armed forces or civil armed forces under sub-section (1), the inquiry shall be conducted by the JIT comprising of a police officer not below the rank of superintendent of police, intelligence agencies, civil armed forces, armed forces, and other law enforcing agencies and for sub-section (2A), the following shall be substituted, namely: (2A) The provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) shall remain in force for a period of three years from the commencement of the Anti-Terrorism (Amendment) Act, 2025.”
The bill also incorporated an amendment to sub-section 2 Section 11EEEE (preventive detention for inquiry) of the ATA — which is available with Dawn.com — which would grant the armed forces or civil armed forces the power to arrest a “suspicious person” for three months. The amendment was moved by PPP MNA Naveed Qamar.
“In clause 2, in paragraph (a), in section 11EEEE, in proposed sub-section (1), for the expression ‘a reasonable complaint has been made or credible information has been received, or a reasonable suspicion exists’, the expression ‘sufficient grounds exist’ shall be substituted,” Qamar’s amendment read.
 






Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said in the House that this law would only be used in specific situations.
“A clause is being added to the bill stating that there are solid reasons for arrest,” Tarar stated. “The arrested person will have to be presented before a magistrate within 24 hours [and] a clause has also been included to be enforceable for a specific period.”
Reacting to the passage of the motion to amend the ATA, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan noted that a similar law was brought previously and branded it a violation of “fundamental human rights”.
“The Supreme Court said these laws were contrary to fundamental rights,” Gohar said. “You cannot touch a single person in the world without a solid reason.”
PTI senior leader and former NA speaker Asad Qaiser assailed the bill and rejected it in his address.
“A new legislation has been passed, where you can be kept in prison for months without permission,” he stated. “These laws can be misused and will target political opponents.”
Qaiser stated that he only wanted peace and commerce in the country, warning that the Constitution was being “destroyed”.
Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman lamented that Pakistan’s anti-terrorism legislation against corruption and mismanagement made every citizen “inherently criminals”.
“A person is first arrested and then later proven guilty. There is no room for such legislation in the world,” he said.
“Terrorism has not stopped. I cannot even return to my village now,” he added.
“A guest in our area was told that extremists are in control outside. Legislation has made no difference, as this parliament has no importance. They create laws based on signals.”
Addressing NA Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Fazl told him that “parliament should not be taken hostage” in his presence.
He also called the National Action Plan a piece of “discriminatory legislation”, stating that he rejected it in the past and continued to do so.
The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) also expressed concern over the passage.
“Preventive detention without charge or trial — based on vague criteria — risks undermining due-process guarantees under Articles 10 and 10A of the Constitution and opens the door to abuse. HRCP urges legislators to reconsider this measure and ensure that counterterrorism efforts comply with Pakistan’s constitutional human rights obligations.”
 






Aseefa slams Utility Stores Corporation closure
Separately, First Lady Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari assailed the countrywide closure of the Utility Stores Corporation (USC) despite the government’s assurance last year that it would not be.
Established in 1971, USC was a state-owned enterprise (SOE) tasked with supplying essential commodities at subsidised rates, primarily targeting low-income households. It operated over 4,000 retail outlets nationwide. The closure last month of the SOE not only left thousands of employees in a state of shock, but has also triggered deep concern among low-income consumers who depended on the network for essential goods at subsidised rates.
Aseefa recalled the PPP submitting a calling-to-attention notice on the issue of USC outlets’ closure.
“Despite the assurances from the honourable minister sitting here today, we have unfortunately found out that utility stores are being closed and hundreds of thousands of people are now unemployed,” she said.
“As a result, their families are facing severe hardship. This is a clear injustice and we demand a clear answer from the government. I request the government to give attention to this again.”
Minister for Food Security Rana Tanveer acknowledged that he said on the NA floor that utility stores would not be shut down. “This was done in a phased manner; loss-making stores were closed first, and some people on daily wages were fired,” he outlined.
“But there was a separate formula for those on contract and regular [employment] — a package for their future safety was made in not less than Rs20 billion, which we will give them.
“Although I have no involvement in this process, from my understanding, the permanent employees will be adjusted and for those willing to take the package, monetary compensation will be given to them.”
Recalling this year’s Rs20bn Ramazan Package, Tanveer quoted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as saying that it was better to distribute cash rather than have leakages in the utility stores and have people lining up in the summer.
“Cash payments were transferred directly through a digital wallet, which was of benefit to the recipients as there were no deductions by banks,” he stated.
“I think that this time as well, the recipients of utility stores who used to take items from there will be given cash based on the same formula.
“There is no doubt that utility stores have been closed and people have been protesting,” Tanveer noted, adding that a team comprising Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar, Adviser to the PM on Inter-Provincial Coordination Rana Sanaullah and other officials held talks and resolved the issue.
Responding to the minister, Aseefa said, “I would urge the minister that he had promised his coalition partners in this House that he was not going to close these utility stores.”
She added that the issue had been taken up by the Standing Committee on Finance and Revenue as well, which was told the same.
“I urge the cabinet, I urge the government at this time to please reconsider and please revisit this. And to the downsizing committee: we need to be strengthening our utility stores, not downsizing them and not closing them down.”
NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq then asked Tanveer to arrange a meeting, to which the minister agreed and asked the finance committee to nominate their representative for it.

Karrar Haidri, Vice President of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, said in a statement that the Chinese mountaineer died on Tuesday night after being hit by falling rocks while climbing down from the peak.
“The incident occurred on the Abruzzi Spur route between Camp I and Advanced Base Camp — a section notorious for frequent rockfalls,” the statement read. “Guan had reached the summit on Monday with a group of climbers before beginning her descent.”
According to the statement, recovery efforts for her body are ongoing, while other climbers who also summited K2 that day are now returning safely to base camp. In total, 32 climbers summited the peak on Monday.
Teams with elite Exped, Imagine Nepal, Seven Summit Treks and Alpinist Climber Expedition successfully summited K2 on Monday morning, according to Haidri.
“The strong teams stood on the summit of the world’s second-highest peak and the highest point on Earth, equipped with sensors, marking yet another chapter of human endurance and teamwork,” the statement read.
“The joint team which reached the summit of K2 includes Tao Hu from China, Eduard Kubatov from the Kyrgyz Republic, Gulnur Tumbat from the United States, Zhang Qingliang and Li Na from China and Pasang Tenje Sherpa, Mingma Jangbu Sherpa, Pasang Sherpa, Sona Sherpa and Pasang Nurbu Sherpa from Nepal.”
On behalf of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, Major General Irfan Arshad congratulated all climbers and wished them a safe descent.
Meanwhile, 15 climbers from Imagine Nepal reached the summit of K2, achieving a 100 per cent success rate this season.
“Summiting in August is rare, as the optimal climbing window is generally in July,” Imagine Nepal said in a statement. “The 2025 season faced significant challenges from the jet stream, with high winds limiting opportunities and forcing prolonged waits at base camp.”
According to Imagine Nepal, the expedition was led by Mingma G — who completed his sixth successful summit of K2 — and departed base camp on August 5 and reached the summit on Monday.
The summiters include Mingma G from Nepal; Jangbu Sherpa from the US; Pema Chhiri Sherpa, Aangdu Sherpa, Kami Sherpa, Lakpa Sherpa, Lakpa Tamang Sherpa and Lhakpa Nuru Sherpa from Nepal; Sohail Sakhi from Pakistan; Liu Mihe, Dilixiati Ailikuti, Li Jiang, Guan Jing and Hu Yinghong from China; and Maria Alexandra Danila from Romania.
Imagine Nepal’s statement added that Danila became the first Romanian to summit K2, while Dilixiati Ailikuti from China became the youngest climber to summit the peak. Jangbu Sherpa and Sohail Sakhi completed the ascent without supplemental oxygen.
In a statement, Elite Exped said this year’s K2 expedition tested every ounce of patience, resilience, and teamwork.
“Harsh weather challenged every climber, and many teams turned back. But in the mountains, it’s all about the waiting game — knowing when to hold back, and when to push for the summit,” their statement read.
“Under the leadership of Mingma G, and in collaboration with the teams from Imagine Nepal, Prakash Sherpa’s team from Alpinist climber, SST and Vinayak, our lead IFMGA guide from Elite Exped, the climbers regrouped and committed to rope fixing above Camp 4.”
Elite Exped added that snow was heavy, but through effort, ropes were fixed and a path was opened, leading to a successful summit at 3:32pm PKT on August 11.</p><small>2025-08-13 16:27</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/1319363638db6e2.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930676/at-least-20-dead-in-shipwreck-off-italys-lampedusa' target='_blank'><strong>At least 20 dead in shipwreck off Italy’s Lampedusa</strong></a><br><p>At least 20 migrants died after a boat overturned in the Mediterranean on Wednesday, with many more still missing, the UN’s refugee agency (UNHCR) said.
“Deep anguish for the umpteenth shipwreck off the coast of Lampedusa, where UNHCR is now assisting the survivors. It looks to be 20 bodies found and as many missing,” wrote the agency’s spokesman, Filippo Ungaro, on social media.
 






Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi confirmed the disaster, saying the shipwreck had occurred 14 nautical miles from Lampedusa.
The boat had been carrying 97 people when it turned over, Radio Radicale reported.
Details remained limited but Save the Children Italy said that a baby girl, aged one-and-a-half, appeared to be lost in the shipwreck.
 






RaiRadio1 reported between 12 and 17 migrants missing, and said that 60 survivors had been transported to safety on the island.
The boat, which had already overturned, was spotted from the air by a plane from Italy’s financial police, it said.
Migrants heading to Italy from North Africa often cross in leaky or overcrowded boats via the central Mediterranean route, one of the world’s deadliest, and arrive in Lampedusa.
The UNHCR said on Wednesday that there have been 675 migrant deaths on the central Mediterranean route so far this year.
As of Wednesday, 38,263 migrants have arrived on Italy’s shores this year, according to the interior ministry.
Piantedosi wrote on social media that the episode underscored “the urgency of preventing, from the countries of departure, the dangerous sea journeys and of relentlessly combating the ruthless trafficking business that fuels this phenomenon”.
 






The hard-right government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has cut deals with North African countries from which migrants embark, providing funding and training in exchange for help in stemming departures.</p><small>2025-08-13 14:42</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13173329765bdb1.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930669/bhc-orders-federal-balochistan-govts-to-file-replies-on-provincial-internet-shutdown' target='_blank'><strong>BHC orders federal, Balochistan govts to file replies on provincial internet shutdown</strong></a><br><p>The Balochistan High Court (BHC) on Wednesday ordered Attorney General of Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Awan and Balochistan Advocate General (AG) Adnan Basharat to file their replies on the shutdown of internet services in the province.
Last week, mobile data services in the province were announced to be suspended until August 31 over “security reasons”. At the same time, a shutdown of internet services was also reported as former Balochistan chief minister Dr Abdul Malik on Saturday expressed concern over the law and order situation, adding that internet services had not been available in the province for more than a month.
A notification issued by the Balochistan Home Department on August 6 cited the “peculiar law and order situation” in the province as a cause for the suspension.
A constitutional petition was filed against the internet shutdown by Khair Muhammad Shaheen, chairman of Balochistan’s Consumer Civil Society, against the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). A two-member bench comprising BHC Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barrech and Justice Sardar Ahmad Haleemi conducted a hearing over the matter today.
According to the court order, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the chairman contended that the cell phone was a basic mode of communication for businessmen, students, educational institutions and  others but the government had suspended mobile network and internet services throughout the province “without any plausible justification”, which was negatively impacting children’s education and business activities.
Shaheen said the indefinite suspension constituted a violation of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 9 (security of person), 15 (freedom of movement etc), 18 (freedom of trade, business and profession), 19-A (right to information) and 25 (equality of citizens) of the Constitution.
The petition also added that inter-district and inter-provincial bus services were suspended, due to which the public was “suffering”.
“The contentions so raised require consideration,” the order said. The bench ordered that notices be issued to the respondents, AGP Awan and AG Basharat to file their responses before the next hearing on Friday.
It added that in case of a failure to do so, the secretaries of the interior and information technology ministries were to appear in person on that date.
In November last year, the PTA had announced the government’s decision to suspend internet and mobile services with immediate effect in many districts of Balochistan to ensure public safety, in the wake of terrorist attacks in the province and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.</p><small>2025-08-13 14:38</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618681-chinese-mountaineer-dies-while-descending-k2' target='_blank'><strong>Chinese mountaineer dies while descending K2</strong></a><br><p>

Moody’s Ratings is a credit rating system that evaluates the creditworthiness of borrowers, such as governments, corporations, or financial instruments. According to its website, the agency uses letter grades (Aaa, Aa, A, Baa, etc) to indicate the likelihood of timely repayment, with Aaa being the highest quality and C the lowest. These ratings help investors assess risk before lending or investing.
Within this scale, Caa1, Caa2, and Caa3 all fall into the “Caa” category, signalling very high credit risk and poor standing. Caa1 is the highest within this group (slightly less risky), Caa2 is one notch lower, and Caa3 is the last, meaning the greatest vulnerability to default among the three.
“Moody’s Ratings (Moody’s) has today upgraded the Government of Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa1 from Caa2,” the international rating agency — one of the top three global rating firms — said in its statement today.
It cited Islamabad’s improving external position and changed the outlook to Pakistan’s rating to “stable” from positive.
Moody’s rating outlooks fall into four categories: positive, negative, stable and developing. A stable outlook indicates a low likelihood of a rating change over the medium term, while the other three categories indicate a “higher likelihood” of a rating change.
“We have also upgraded the rating for the senior unsecured [medium-term note] programme to (P)Caa1 from (P)Caa2,” it said.
 

This table shows the rankings from highest to lowest of Moody’s long-term and short-term categories. — Moody’s

“The upgrade to Caa1 reflects Pakistan’s improving external position, supported by its progress in reform implementation under the [International Monetary Fund’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme,” Moody’s highlighted.
“The Caa1 rating also incorporates the country’s weak governance and high political uncertainty,” the agency noted.
“Foreign exchange reserves are likely to continue to improve, although Pakistan will remain dependent on timely financing from official partners,” it forecasted.
Moody’s went on to highlight that the “sovereign’s fiscal position is also strengthening from very weak levels, supported by an expanding tax base”. “Its debt affordability has improved, but remains one of the weakest among rated sovereigns,” it noted.
Expanding upon the “stable” outlook, the agency said it reflected “balanced risks to Pakistan’s credit profile”.
“On the upside, improvements in the debt service burden and external profile could be more rapid than we currently expect. On the downside, there remains risks of delays in reform implementation required to secure timely official financing, which would in turn weaken Pakistan’s external position again,” it noted.
“The upgrade to Caa1 from Caa2 rating also applies to the backed foreign currency senior unsecured ratings for the Pakistan Global Sukuk Programme Co Ltd,” Moody’s said, adding that it also changed the outlook for the Sukuk programme to stable from positive.
“We have also raised Pakistan’s local and foreign currency country ceilings to B2 and Caa1 from B3 and Caa2, respectively,” the agency added.
It noted that the two-notch gap between the local currency ceiling and sovereign rating was “driven by the government’s relatively large footprint in the economy, weak institutions, and high political and external vulnerability risk”.
Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the rating upgrade and appreciated his economic team’s efforts, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.
The premier also welcomed the Moody’s “upgraded rating about improvement in the economic outlook for Pakistan from positive to stable”, the report quoted a press release from the PM Office as saying.
PM Shehbaz reiterated that the government was committed to further improving the rating as it was reflective of the economic policies in the right direction.
Hailing the development, Adviser to Finance Minister Khurram Schehzad noted: “While challenges remain, this recognition reaffirms that Pakistan is on a clear path toward greater macroeconomic stability and resilience.
“With Moody’s upgrade, all the three top global rating agencies have now upgraded Pakistan’s ratings with stable outlook,” he pointed out, referring to Fitch and S&P Global Ratings.
 






External position continues to strengthen, although still fragile
“Pakistan’s external position has continued to strengthen over the past year,” Moody’s said, adding it expected further gradual improvements as progress in reform implementation under the IMF programme supports financing from bilateral and multilateral partners.
“In turn, this contributes to continued increases in the sovereign’s foreign exchange reserves, albeit from still fragile levels,” it noted.
“We expect Pakistan to fully meet its external debt obligations for the next few years, contingent on steady progress on reform implementation and timely completion of IMF reviews.”
 
 

“Nonetheless, Pakistan’s external position remains fragile,” Moody’s cautioned.
“Its foreign exchange reserves remain well below what is required to meet its external debt obligations, underscoring the importance of steady progress with the IMF programme to continually unlock financing,” it explained, estimating that Pakistan’s external financing needs were about $24-25bn in FY2026, and similar amounts again in FY2027.
Detailing its rationale for the rating upgrade, Moody’s noted that Pakistan fully met its external debt obligations and added to its foreign exchange reserves in FY2025.
“Reserves rose to $14.3 billion as of 25 July 2025, equivalent to about ten weeks of imports,” it said, comparing them to $9.4bn at the time of the last rating update in August 2024.
The agency also pointed out Pakistan’s successful completion of the IMF programme’s first review, unlocking a $1bn disbursement in May 2025, and a $1bn commercial loan in June 2025 by the Asian Development Bank (ADB).
Outlining its rationale for the stable outlook rank, Moody’s observed that it reflected “balanced risks to Pakistan’s credit profile”.
On the upside, it said, a building track record of reforms and revenue-raising measures could unlock more financing, which in turn would further boost foreign exchange reserves and the external position.
 
 

“On the downside, there remains risks of slippage in reform implementation or results, leading to delays in or withdrawing of financing support from official partners,” it warned, saying it could lead to renewed material deterioration in the sovereign’s external position.
“The current government formed after the February 2024 elections faces a significant challenge to continually implement revenue-raising measures without triggering social tensions,” the agency underscored.
Fiscal position improving, but debt affordability remains weak
Pakistan’s fiscal position has improved from very weak levels, reflecting progress in implementing revenue-raising measures, Moody’s observed.
Citing narrowing budget deficits and widening primary surpluses, the rating agency said the government debt affordability was “also improving, although it remains one of the weakest among our rated sovereigns”.
Noting strengthened revenue collection, it said: “We expect the government to continue enhancing revenue administration and compliance, alongside the introduction of new tax measures.”
Noting new taxes introduced on solar panels and e-commerce businesses in the recent budget, Moody’s estimated tax revenues to pick up by another 0.5 percentage points of GDP in FY2026. “However, a decline in SBP dividends will lead to an overall narrowing of government revenue to about 15-15.5 per cent of GDP,” it added.
 
 

“We expect government expenditure to remain contained, even as budgeted defence spending has increased,” the agency stated, noting reduced subsidies to the power sector and debt servicing costs.
“Overall, we expect the fiscal deficit to narrow further to 4.5-5pc of GDP in FY2026 (FY2025: 5.4pc),” the statement added.
Environmental, social and governance scores’ impact on rating
Moody’s also provided its assessment of Pakistan’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) credit impact scores (CISs), which communicate the impact of ESG considerations on the rating of an issuer or transaction.
Pakistan has a ‘CIS-5’ credit impact score, which means ESG considerations have a “pronounced impact on the current rating, which is lower than it would have been if ESG risks did not exist”.
Pakistan’s CIS-5 score “reflects its very high exposure to social and environmental risks, as well as its weak governance profile”, Moody’s statement said.

It then stated the country’s issuer profile scores (IPS) for the ESG categories, which are expressed on a scale of 1-5 points.
“Pakistan’s E-5 issuer profile score for environmental risk reflects the country’s vulnerability to climate change and the limited supply of clean, fresh and safe water,” the agency pointed out.
“Pakistan has an S-5 issuer profile score for social risk. Very low incomes as well as limited access to quality healthcare, basic services, housing and education, especially in rural areas, together with safety concerns, are important social issues,” it added.
“Pakistan has a G-4 issuer profile score for governance risk. International surveys of various indicators of governance, while showing some early signs of improvement, continue to point to weak rule of law and control of corruption, as well as limited government effectiveness.”

Previous ratings
Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb already urged Moody’s in July to improve Pakistan’s current Caa2 credit rating during a virtual engagement in July.
Speaking at an event in Islamabad earlier today, Aurangzeb pointed out that Fitch and S&P Global Ratings had already upgraded the country’s credit ratings this year and said he was hopeful of “the third agency” — an apparent reference to Moody’s — doing the same soon.
 
 

Pakistan has been postponing the launch of international bonds since July 2021 due to challenging macroeconomic conditions and resultant poor credit rating, and relying mostly on time deposits from friendly nations to meet external liabilities and stay afloat.
The agency had last upgraded Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings to Caa2 from Caa3 on Aug 28, 2024. It had also changed its outlook to positive from stable for improving macroeconomic conditions.
In late February 2024 — shortly after the general elections — Moody’s had retained Pakistan’s long-term credit rating at Caa3, noting that “political risks are high, following a highly controversial general election”.</p><small>2025-08-13 13:43</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><img src='https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/08/13172047d669c6b.jpg' width='100%'><br><a href='https://www.dawn.com/news/1930670/bilawal-hits-out-at-pm-shehbaz-over-delay-in-k4-project' target='_blank'><strong>Bilawal hits out at PM Shehbaz over delay in K4 project</strong></a><br><p>PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari on Wednesday criticised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif over the inordinate delay in the K-IV water project, saying he had expected the premier to demonstrate the same speed and efficiency in Karachi as he does in Lahore.
Launched in the early 2000s to ease Karachi’s water woes, the K-IV project has faced repeated delays and cost hikes. With just Rs3.2 billion allocated against the Rs40bn needed, officials fear completion could be pushed back another decade.
Addressing an inauguration ceremony of a new canal for Karachi from Hub Dam, Bilawal said: “The K4 project, we had hoped for Shehbaz speed, but Karachi got Shehbaz slow. This cannot happen that Lahore gets Shehbaz speed and Karachi gets Shehbaz slow, so I will especially request the prime minister to complete the promises as quickly as possible regarding the K4 and this city.”
Bilawal was referring to the famed ‘Punjab speed’, a term coined to describe PM Shehbaz’s swift and efficient governance as chief minister of Punjab.
 


Islamabad’s budget allocation had triggered a kind of rift between the PML-N and the PPP — allies in the ruling coalition.
The Sindh government had expressed strong reservations over the “inadequate allocation” in the federal budget, saying it was taking the matter very seriously and in the process of reviewing the entire budget.
“We have serious concerns not only about this project but also the K-4 initiative,” Sindh Information and Transport Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon had said. “The funds allocated are highly inadequate. The Pakistan Peoples Party is taking these issues seriously and will thoroughly review the budget.”
He had stressed the need for fiscal discipline and smarter resource management at the federal level.
“We’ve submitted formal proposals to the prime minister and urged the federal government to cut down on unnecessary expenditures,” he said. “If revenue is not increasing, it becomes essential to control expenditures. All spending must be managed wisely; otherwise, we’re putting our entire fiscal policy at risk.”
Meanwhile, the new Hub Canal, a significant initiative of the provincial government aimed at addressing the water woes of the city, will add 100 million gallons of water per day (MGD) to the supply.
The Hub Canal project, approved in 2022, included the construction of a new canal and the rehabilitation of the old Hub Canal to further increase water supply in the two districts. The project included upgrading the Hub pumping station, rising main, and Hub Filter Plant from 80 MGD to 100 MGD.
Bilawal said the water from the new canal would be supplied to the Central, East and Keamari districts, hoping that it would be supplied to Lyari and the islands in the future as well.
He said restoration of the old canal was also underway and added that the party would try to secure increased water allocation of 200 MGD for Karachi from the chief minister.</p><small>2025-08-13 13:11</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618665-na-passes-anti-terrorism-act-amendment-bill-with-majority-vote' target='_blank'><strong>NA passes ATA amendment, restores 90-day detention powers</strong></a><br><p>

According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Azerbaijan’s Colonel General Karim Valiyev called on COAS Munir at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi today.
“On the occasion, Colonel General Karim Valiyev conferred upon Field Marshal Asim Munir, Azerbaijan’s prestigious Patriotic War Medal for ‘Services in the Field of Military Cooperation’, on behalf of President Illham Aliyev, in recognition of his exceptional contributions in Azerbaijan-Pakistan bilateral military cooperation,” the statement said.
Established on May 17, 2002, the medal is a state award of Azerbaijan, awarded to servicemen of the country and foreign states, and other persons for merits in strengthening military cooperation with the Azerbaijani Armed Forces.
Per the statement, Gen Valiyev commended Pakistan’s unwavering efforts in combating terrorism and reaffirmed Azerbaijan’s determination to enhance collaboration in defence and security.
The Azerbaijani leader was presented with the guard of honour by the army upon his arrival, the statement said.
 






ISPR said that both leaders held a meeting to discuss “matters of mutual interest, with particular focus on the prevailing global and regional security landscape”.
“COAS reaffirmed Pakistan’s deep fraternal bonds with Azerbaijan and reiterated the resolve to further consolidate bilateral relations. The COAS also congratulated the visiting dignitary on the successful conclusion of the peace agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia,” it added.
Azerbaijan’s Valiyev praised the armed forces for their “professionalism and success” in Marka-i-Haq and Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, the statement said, adding that the delegation extended best wishes for the upcoming Independence Day and Victory celebrations.
It continued, “COAS thanked Azerbaijan’s leadership and people for standing together with the people of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq and also for sending the Azeri Contingent for participating in the Independence Day ceremony.”
“Both military leaders expressed a shared commitment to advancing defence cooperation and promoting joint efforts for regional peace and stability,” the statement added.
Islamabad and Baku maintain robust military cooperation. In 2023, COAS Munir visited Azerbaijan, aiming to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and defence collaboration between the two nations.
Last year, Azer­bai­jan signed a massive $1.6 billion deal with Pakistan to acquire JF-17 Block III fighter jets, developed by Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group.</p><small>2025-08-13 10:35</small></div><hr><div style='margin-bottom:20px;'><a href='https://www.geo.tv/latest/618652-azerbaijan-top-commander-confers-prestigious-war-medal-on-field-marshal' target='_blank'><strong>Azerbaijan top commander confers prestigious war medal on Field Marshal</strong></a><br><p>
